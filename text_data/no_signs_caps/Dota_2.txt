the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

dota 2 will drain you of your will to keep playing and yet you will always return dota 2 will make you regret ever playing it and yet you will always think just one more game dota 2 will take away all your free time and yet youll almost feel proud of how many hours you have in dota 2 with the time you spend on this game you could do all sorts study on learning a new set of skills to further your career you could raise money for charity you could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others you could even just play other games you know those ones sitting in your backlog pushed aside by dota 2 but you wont you will always return to this game the maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages mostly these languages will consist of russian and peruvian this game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking half the time you will not even remember having played dota 2 on a certain day it just becomes natural to you if you start playing this game you will become addicted you will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics a quick chest purchase here a few random items on the market there and boom like me youll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it if you start dota 2 not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivationdestroying hobby but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too tldr this game will take away your time money and patience for others you will become an angry person basically 1010 goty all years

the real dota 2 dota is a competitive game of action and strategy played both professionally and casually incompetently by millions of enslaved passionate fans russians worldwide players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes carries forming two teams of five players five feeders radiant heroes then battle their dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape waging campaigns of cunning stealth and outright warfare raging in an unknown language and teamfighting with one rampage victor irresistibly colorful on the surface addictive dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity which requires no infact takes an infinite amount of your life away every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike that allow players to screw with their allies and get their teams killed this is one of the reasons that the dota phenomenon has continued to grow dota will have more rage quitting and all chat abuse than any other game originating as a fanmade warcraft 3 modification dota was an instant underground hit after coming to valve the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience russia so that the rest of the world can experience the same core gameplay but with the level of polish that only valve can provide learn from these ingenious people and become inspired to spread their knowledge with the rest of the world get a taste of the game that has enthralled millions will happily teach you fluent russian all for the sweet price of $0 just choose your server [imgurcom] < link note original description by valve edited by myself

this game ruined my life i recommend everyone to play dota 2 and not lol nor hon  dont get me wrong i am not hating or anything i was from hon for like 23 years before dota 2 was released and tried lol and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to hon dota 2 is a great game an awesome game i really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it i say mechanics are well designed what makes a hero op is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it this is a team game people so team work is a must unless you are solo queuing then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around monster gamers are real dota 2 has taught me a lot of things you can only be good at something if you focus on it learn from mistakes be aware of your surroundings trust your instinct use common sense trusting on your team to always have your back believing in your capabilities always try to be better than you were yesterday and that the comebacks are real this game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds a mere game that brings people together not just friends but complete strangers too dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten all in all i recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain suffering and torment because at the end you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better ps calm down its just a game

alright listen up instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians im going to tell you how dota 2 really is at its core in a nutshell dota 2 is a great game but a terrible experience at the same time you want to keep going back to it but you also hate to go back why one word community dota 2s community is for the most part rude and hateful and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting moba its unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away at the best of times often its much worse and i would prefer not to go into the details sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you havent actually done anything wrong occasionally though you come across friendly players and when that happens the game is a pure joy to play however since the game is 5v5 coming across four nice players at the same time if youre solo queueing is a rarity why then have i played the game for over 2000 hours the sensation of winning your determination to keep playing despite of the discouraging community is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory that sweet moment when you see the enemy ancient blow up and look back on the match remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying but even a victory can come with a grain of salt many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning there is a mute option but that doesnt stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat people can intentionally feed the enemy team ignore their own team teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player its really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time going ranked doesnt really solve the problem either at least not completely ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill it feels much more professional and tryhardish although you meet nice players more often nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell having played some matches in ranked i can say the mode isnt hate free i had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode another problem with ranked is that like i said its more tryhard many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the this is ranked you better be a damn good player mentality but dont get me wrong dota 2 is a great game in itself and thats why i keep going back to it the core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well no technical issues to speak of not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so of which i have had none myself graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them all the various spells and abilites look great the game is very deep and complex with tons of items skill and item builds and strategies to learn it can be a bit terrifying to beginners but once you get the hang of things its engaging all the playable heroes are well balanced although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being op and free to play from the start thats another thing the game does right all the heroes are free and playable from the start unlike dota 2s undeniably very successful competitor league of legends dota 2s microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff which means there are zero pay to win elements in the game it really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game if youre one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you you have a better chance of not finding dota 2 so terrible to put it roughly in perspective playing dota 2 is like playing skyrim but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make calling you a fooping idiot every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective failed to kill alduin uninstall skyrim noob dont know how to make dragonbone armor learn to play tard it would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures would it not sadly thats how dota 2s community is having played the game as long as i have i would say that you are better off not playing dota 2 the game is fun when youre winning because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine which is 50% of the time and sometimes not even when youre winning it isnt the losses that make the game unpleasant its the unfriendly people often your day will just be worse after playing dota 2 instead of it cheering you up as games do people will tell you that dota 2 is great but that greatness comes with a price do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view this review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what its really like not just the great things if you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis then youre good to go the game is at its best when you play with friends and dont have to worry about getting a stick in the mud player on your team great game with bad community

dota 2 is the official sequel to the highly popular mod for blizzards warcraft iii defense of the ancients a mod that has been worked on by many and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong a lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between blizzard and valve last year and it ended to valves favor the dota name and franchise is now legally a part of valve probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of icefrog the year before dota 2 is a realtime strategy game in the subgenre called moba multiplayer online battle arena a genre that has grown rapidly the past few years with different type of alterations in favor of success dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular moba right behind the giant league of legends just like lol dota 2 is gaining success throughout its competetive esport scene and its clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position the latest and biggest tournament was the international 2013 which included a total prize pool of over 28 million us dollars which was the biggest prize pool in esport history gameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master the map consists of 3 lanes that are constantly being pushed by npc creeps you are controlling a hero amongst 4 other in your team and are fighting against 5 in the opposing team the goal is to push your heroes and npc creeps to the enemy base where you have to destroy the ancient it sounds pretty easy but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics plus the over 100 heroes you get to play and face after 300 hours i have only touched what i call the more advanced mechanics and i am not even close to professional level the most experienced players have around 5000 hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past 3 years to dota 2 since the game is extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play these type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players there is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there beware though  the tutorial does not cover any russian dota 2 might be competetive extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap but it is still the game that i have spend the most time playing on steam mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it somehow i keep returning to it so i suppose i am enjoying it you better have people to play with though and you better not be good friends  because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe its  with it until you hate each other only play this if you plan on getting some mental disorder time will fly and you will realize you still suck and people hate you no matter what its free so why do you need a review anyway translations german

this game helps you realize the stuggles that were present during the cold war and reinforces your fear of russians or at least playing with them team up with south americans to battle the russians and receive more negative feedback from your teammates than your ex girlfriend gave you about your small  once you realize that the south americans are also your enemies you can play on their servers to escape them because everyone knows that they only play on the us servers to slowly damage our mental stability to aid them in their everlasting mission to feel like they dont live in a third world country 1010

i originally played dota when it was merely a ums on wc3 so take this review for what its worth dota 2 is an addictive experience however this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society if that statement is an insufficient description of the game continue reading this game is not for the casual gamer this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game if you play this game i can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard i have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play no matter what you do you will encounter someone who will complain about something youre doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you i can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with so here are what i consider the pros and cons of the game pros this is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing free to play with optional cosmetic costs gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection this in effect increases replayability tremendously wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more this in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game cons this game has a steep learning curve believe me there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance unlike hero customization in league of legends not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either it can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection but thus is dota secondary to the steep learning curve games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team this can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of fundamentals of gameplay video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have suffice to say many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team the player loses gold and the other team gains gold this doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay unlike other video game developers steam does not region lock this brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference you can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when theres a russian only speaker spanish only speaker and a portuguese only speaker on the us west server blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in america unfortunately this is by far the worst aspect of the game the game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future more often than not an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions there is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 1020 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier this review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary of course if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy final rating game 910 game community 310

ive always wanted to go to russia to learn the culture eat and drink and see the sights but i cannot do that as it is expensive and im busy doing my uni work but then i found dota 2 this free learning course teaches you all about russians and their culture i can even speak decent russian however these russian people can get quite angry and annoying they often shout the phrase  and bring you to the depths of insanity i got forced to drink my sorrows away during the beginning of the course but it was worth it in the end if you dont have the time and money to travel to russia id suggest you pick up dota 2 a fantastic learning resource 810

there is fine line between bravery and stupidity  juggernaut going into dota 2 is crossing this line youve got to be brave to even consider playing it in the first place if you stay here longer than 2 hours then im sorry but youre stupid so am i because this game as enraging it can be is also really enjoyable experience if you want to be constantly surprised by game developers and other players and there is inner drive of selfimprovement in you its game for you even if at the end of the day you suspect yourself of masochistic tendencies just try it

after wasting my 1500 hours on it i think i can say something about this game first of all this review is not a humorous one im writing it seriously to give information about this game because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters i think this review will be informative for these people gamers who has spent couple of hours like me knows everything i am going to try to tell after this short introduction we can start russians problem is not about being russian due to the games popularity among russian players there are too many bad always swears doesnt play as its a team game doesnt speak english in eu servers etc russian players but there are also too many nice russian players briefly the problem is not about being russian if there are 10 gamers in dota 4 of them will be bad players if there are 1000 400 of them thats the point if you want to play this game to get relaxed dont do it after few matches you will find yourself more depressed angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed the bad players are the reason for it as an illustriation you started a game to get enjoyed looked the picks someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said me mid or me solo etc ok thats right you are still relax you picked a support for your team they somehow fed the enemies ok still you are relaxed they started to argue with each other they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry and then you will lose the game this type of games are not so rare in dota 3 over 10 games are being played according to this nutshell therefore it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota then why people still playing it too much why there is not just bad players in the community now because it is addictive you can not get rid of it if someone trolls your game you want to play again and wish to play with better players if you win the game you want to win again and increase your mmr if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back shortly you will want to play again after every game however if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want this reason is pointless for you meaningless mmr system when i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players however the system is completely meaningless player profile and skills are same at 1k2k and 3k mmr once you get your mmr it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it 25 every lose decrease it 25 and as i said before player profile is same at 1k 2k and 3k when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc it is completely up to your team so how people get too high mmrs they have this mmr at the begining and how they did it there is no clear information about it valve does not announce how it is being calculated for example i played 10 first ranked games with 8 wins i played support and carries buy wards and couriers when i was support i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry but my mmr was 2200 when some people get 4k starting mmr this system also a fact about this games addiction but doesnt help kind players about creating a better environment all in all i dont recommend this game just because of its community the game is a master piece master of mobas it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game it has great graphics etc however it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it on the other hand if you have a great mental power and patience play it i completely recommend it this review was written for normal patience leveled people i dont say dont waste your time go and do some social activities if u want to play video games dont play it go and play more enjoying games lastly i have an advice for valve it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota people who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players as defined at the beginning they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased now it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling i hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends d some suggestions i wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate i lost my will to play dota however then thanks to some sensitive comments i started to play dota only with my friends now i have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as i mentioned in my review months ago as some people say in comments of this review play this game with your friends after writing this review i have rarely played solo games and it feels better participate in some tournaments after lots of bad pub match experiences that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience you can participate in esls or other platforms open tournaments for free finallynever give up you can encounter very kind players as well after a bad pub game performance your teammates maybe say uninstall dota etc but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends just do not give any importance what they say you can see similar things in this reviews comments section there are very kind sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing offensive comments same is true for the player profile in dota just dont give any importance what the haters say final note for the guys who say why dont u recommend the game while playing it too much please read the review again this review is a complete answer to your question good luck & have fun d unfortunately io lost the arcana showdown  edited game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected some suggestions section added thank you all for suggestions comments and rate ups

dota 2 is quickly becoming the most played game on steam and for good reason the blend of wellbalanced multiplayer infinite replayability gorgeous aesthetics and the time and care valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection i simply cannot reccomend dota 2 enough the game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes and each one feels unique and welldesigned in any given match you take control of a singular hero and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team unfortunately the barrier of entry is high quite a lot of research preparation and knowledge is required to be sucessful and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly however tutorials are available to guide new players and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a fiveman black hole or pulling off that perfect blinkpoof combo spectacularly enough the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines dota tv is an ingame spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments including the multimillion dollar international that valve hosts on a yearly basis and all of this for free there are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way they are mostly designed by members of the community and can be purchased or recieved randomly while playing content patches and new heroes are being added all the time dota 2 will continue to grow for years hopefully continuing to find new players interested in a fastpaced online multiplayer experience that is equal parts exhilirating and engaging

dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena moba for short in dota 2 is a pure freetoplay game which means that you dont have to unlock heroes maps or other stuff the only way to be good at dota 2 is to know the game you need to know every single item and hero to become a really good player and thats the reason i like this game so much however this can be a problem for new players you dont know anything about the game when you spawn in your base with 4 teammates so what is this game all about well you play as one of the 105 available heroes and you have to destroy the enemy base sounds easy right well to do that you have to fight your way through towers creeps and of course the other team at the start of the game you just stay in your lane and farm and harass enemies by attacking or even ganking them after this laning stage is completed your team and the enemy team will face eachother in so called teamfights after a while one team will have a large gold and experience advantage and they will push to the other teams base and then of course destroy it verdict  i really enjoyed and still enjoy this game dota 2 isnt a paytowin game which makes this game much more enjoyable dota 2 also has the best esports support you can easily watch a match and select one of the several broadcasters to make watching esport matches more enjoyable the only downside of dota 2 is the fact that youll need a lot of knowledge to be good at this game if you manage to survive all the mean teammates and learn everything about the game youll easily spend 200 hours on dota 2 if not youll quit within 20 hours score 91100

dota 2 ranks among few titles that can be classified as truly freetoplay while many other titles label themselves with this distinction there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions while dota 2 has an extensive cash shop all offerings are completely cosmetic hud options voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase all gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of ingame currency once a player has determined that theyre ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates again learn with friends to reduce this aspect dota 2 is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made every match is different and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse its twenty to fortyfive minutes of gladiatorial bliss the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow dota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement and its a title that rewards users for a deep dive heavy investment heavy reward the barrier to entry isnt quite as bad as it was years ago but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesnt have a colossal learning curve as a freetoplay title readily available on steam it offers players a frictionless doorway  but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning playing and enjoying dota 2 the game is in a strong place right now its rewarding and sociable like few other games and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered the next few months will be crucial its currently the best expression of valves progressive attitude towards players and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one were used to just remember to spend your starting cash and make sure someone buys the courier oh and when riki starts showing up in your games just get some sentry wards down and dont run away also you always want a bottle when in midlane and runes spawn at 000 and again every two minutes practice lasthitting before you go online and if youre jungling memorise where the lowlevel creeps are actually you know what forget all that just have fun 4 out of 5

indepth competitive scientifically proven approved by church of england and american monster truck foundation true mlg review on awardwinning game heroes of league of autists 2 alright guys listen my name is [ig] d[andi] singsing aka wilddigger1998ua and i will throw some of my wild gameplay suggestions in a game that is totally not corrupted by trends pro leagues where people play like lobsters on acid denying your own aegis because you click like a frenzied ape when nothing around is happening and totally not toxic community where every ivan george and pingpongclingclong is a distinguished pro gamer with 200 years of training at icefrogs monastery of enlightement somewhere inbetween tibets asscheeks okay lets go this riding on cat mirana chick with face that looks like she just seen a dolphin putting on a condom her ultimate allows teammates to get invisibility for given time which can for instance save your carry support who is getting dived by frenzied bristleback and enemy mid hero with 2 runes up his butt so just press r  and since they didnt have any dusts  your carry is safe haha no we cant have any of that i need more damage on my arrow that i will miss anyway plus if my allies are dying i can just blame them instead of doing anything if they are russians  just double your blame output okay so we have that hero spector but it doesnt look like this gay guy from bioware game so she has ability to move through obstacles and units has free tons of pure damage cant be reduced by armor on every illusion and map presense with her ultimate that allows her to fight at any given time without leaving her farming spots until necessary and with high enough agility her illusions can just inflict enough damage so your team can fight freely while you patiently taking your farm so what do we do of course we aint gonna do any of that we will get her phase boots because spectral dagger is clearly not enough we will never ever get free damage on carry and we get a bloody skill that blocks and returns damage instead when enemy team has like ugh same damage output as yoursand you have no hp yet anyway get vanguard that just doesnt work because of dota 2s rng programming and then will farm radiance till 50 timemark because expensive aura with items green damage that doesnt work on illusions even though aura does work and can do a lot of good things like blocking enemys blink dagger that will be blocked by your ult in a second anyway is clearly better than statgain or manaburn okay so we have that orange bird guy that can hold solo lane against 2 or 3 people with minimum deaths except some specific combos that just screw up his escape and set of abilities that allows to eviscerate enemy team if your allies have at least anything to hold them in place what are we gonna do with this hero you may ask of course we will put him on a support role and make him buy mekansm so he would never have any mana for his high damage dots that also have ridicilous slow debuff and ult that is easily countered only like by ten heroes out of 150 we have mirana without ultimate to go get all this exp remember alright these situations are obviously too situative so we will talk about global scale meta lets get to most obvious question what hero should we pick the answer is  pudge you need mid  you pick pudge you need support  you pick pudge you need offlane jungler roamer carry social worker girlfriend president of the united states of murrica  just pick pudge why because someone did that on twitchtv you silly noob cheekyscrublord you of course have same skill as pro players so you can just mimic them and game will be magically won you dont need to think about anything just buy recommended items and blame your teammates if something is wrong you got a motherflipping dragonclaw hook afterall if you bought an item that is worth of 3 years of your school lunchboxes  nobody will have enough guts to argue with your divine skill in pressing q button at cursor location to lasthit a creep mute everyone at the start of the game just in case tho next important issue is map presense lane control creep control ability to analyze situation counterwarding and all that important elements of this pseudostrategical map game for all of that just remember these two lines buy wards where the gang it is important that you will never type gank properly this is basically all you need to know about this game remember its not important to win its the whole competetive spirit and sportsmanship that matters everyone has around 50% winrate anyway because of matchmaking and elo system in rankeds is based on wizardscience and tarotfortunetelling its supposed to work only in chess anyway yeah developers may tell you their rating system is not based on elo but can volvo really pull off their own mathematic rating model for the game that after all these years still lags when someone is picking a hero armor rating still doesnt work properly and hero with 320 movespeed can chase down and kill hero with 350 because of model animation oooh i think not anyway i give this game 100 dirty apes out of 100 and encourage you to start playing as fast as possible to join in most viral addiction the world ever saw since taking heroin rectally poping polyethylene packages or throwing water filled condoms out of the window became a thing

ah my dota you are my bliss and you are my sorrow sometimes i wonder how i would feel if i had not met you on that day all those years ago would i be a happier or a sadder man than i am now what is certain is that of all the games i have played i have spent more time with none other than you for those of you who have no idea what im talking about let me introduce you to dota 2 valves faithful sequel to a game that can most easily be described to the uninitiated as a mix between the rts and rpg genres the game consists of two 5man teams with each player choosing a unique hero and fighting to destroy the opposing teams throne it sounds simple enough but once you mix in the seemingly myriad number of heroes to choose from the race to level up faster than your opponents and the vast array of items to buy you have one of the deepest and most competitive games on the planet

great game if you hate having fun the antifun levels of this game are the highest ive ever seen if you like having fun or being happy stay well away this is a game made for people who like having their bum smacked by a girl and being told to enjoy it the voice acting is pretty good as well  edit by special request im going to tell you how to find little nuggets of fun in this game that will improve your gameplay experience if you decide to try this game ignore your grumpy teammates and use your abilities and items when you want to stay away from tryhard meganerd modes like captains and play fun gamemodes like diretide if you see any weird letters like  or that one that looks like a 6 mute everybody on both teams and stay on the lookout for opportunities to have fun never queue for matchmaking without a good friend things that are not fun and you should not do if you like fun buy wards when you have no spare money pick dumb heroes with lots of buttons like chen listen to grumpy teammates i hope this has helped you to get more fun out of valves dota 2 please mark this review as helpful if it has helped

i guess i have to review this game because ive banked so many hours into it ill keep it brief dota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created your team will let you down constantly the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most you will never get the hat drops you want and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are or more likely force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more itll turn you into a monster and destroy your life itll murder your loved ones and feed them to you but youll play it anyway youll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way will have no conceivable effect on anything you will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning basically the same feeling you get when you play dota 2 and dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life so the next day youll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame staving off the moment when youll have to face your demons for as long as you can you will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your mmr was or your sunstrike accuracy so what are you waiting for you worthless peons get out there and dance dance for the puppetmaster gabe go earn your hats you craven mongrels 010 would not recommend to anyone but cant stop playing and wont be able to stop you either

dota 2 so over the years you teamed up with your friends or the people you dunno to fight to destroy enemy crystals over and over again its the very moba game we ever want gameplay910 as any starters in dota its hard for them to find their way into the core of the game theyre cruelly mocked personally screwed mentally devastated yes thats it begins but they can never get rid of it once theyre in hundred of heros for you to choose from and numerous skillstrategyitem combinations make the game always be different and fascinating graphics8910 source engine works perfectly well in this game and you can see more specs that can not be shown in warcraft and you can run it smoothly in any digs at hand story10 well i got no idea how to put a score here since pages of story and hero backgrounds have been totally ingored but you can still take a look at it when youre horribly killedhaha online system8610 theres the problem matching system can be better than what it is now overall9510 dota 2 is a competitive game of action and strategy played by tons of passionated fans of dota and the moba games you cant act alone but be a part of the team to reach victory

at first i thought this game was pretty good but that was until the first time i was called a feeder dota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork except the community only does three things 1 call each other fgs and berate one another for slightly foolish decisions 2 do solo farm and try to win the match by themselves which never works especially if they are playing against a team of 5 players in a party also known as a five stack 3 make fun of and ruin everything for new players if you want to learn how to play dota 2 you either need a really good guide or a good friend who has more than 500 hours into the game the tutorial just teaches you the basics no you cant learn by yourself by playing matchmaking with random people all youll learn from the other players is that you suck because youre new and dont understand any of the tactics and that the best course of action would be to uninstall theres also the fact that some people create new steam accounts so they can be matched up against newbies and annihilate everyone also this game stole all my friends we used to play other games now they play nothing other than dota 2 and one of them has spent $40 in the game on skins cosmetic items that add nothing to the gameplay you can buy some of the best games on steam for less i repeat less than $40 and then he told me he only plays dota because he cant afford any games on steam so there terrible community steals your friends incredibly addictive for some people dont touch this game i spent way too much time hating myself while playing this never again edit 172 people read this review wow also i have to say i think the ingame tutorials are better than the actual game because the actual game has only one map unlike the tutorials i know this is pretty standard for moba games but for me this contributes greatly to actually ruining variety and fun in the gameplay its just all the same tactics over and over on the same map this doesnt only mean less variety but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better on another note this game is like the opposite of everything i like about tf2 unbalanced classes according to google every dota herochampionclasswhatever the hell is overpowered only a single map relies too much on teamwork when its hard to find online whereas tf2 benefits from teamwork but still its not the key to winning a game and its much easier to achieve teamwork because tf2 doesnt rely nearly as hard on your earlygame the earlygame in dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you setting the outcome of the match in stone almost literally during the first ten minutes of the game and also a horrible community not saying tf2s community is good but hell its miles above dota dont really know why i am comparing this game to tf2 maybe because valve made both games but still just wanted to throw out there some actual criticisms about the game itself and not the community now some people have been telling me pfft just block the trash talkers that doesnt change anything theyre still horrible at teamwork which like i said is the entire point of the game and if you block them you cant coordinate with them basically its not only a bad game for new players because you suck its also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks except for koreans whenever you see one in a game bam you already know his team has won overall i think dota nay the whole moba genre has great potential but its just too bad ive yet to see any game in the genre actually achieve to fulfill it edit 2 i just came back to this game and tried it out again the hopes that maybe it has gotten better no theres still absolutely no communication between the players except for casual pings here and there seriously there are tonnes of balancing issues in the game and the one character that stands out the most is sniper he has good abilities and does real good damage at a real fast rate if you play the game right he can easily annihilate two to three heroes by himself later on in the game frankly he is cheap and it is incredibly easy to kill steal with him valve is a company structured in a way that if youre employed there you dont really need to do these things you dont need to patch bugs from a game you dont need to fix balancing issues at valve the employees primary concern is getting recognition if you add something that looks cool youre gonna get recognition if youre going to fix something youre not because youre not showing off your creativity or imagination youre doing an important job to ensure that the product works as intended noone cares for that give me more cosmetics theres also the kill stealing now you get much more experience and gold as well as the kill credit if you actually deliver the killing blow yep just the last hit no questions asked it doesnt matter if youve reduced someone from full to 1% health and someone from your team pops out of nowhere to take the kill credit and leave you with a measly amount of gold and little experience a lot of players hate these kill thieves but you know what thats exactly what this game encourages to screw other players over couldnt say the gold and experience be divided equally between the two players based on the damage they did nope instead the players are forced to hate each other and if you are an actually fair player who doesnt want to rely on these cheap tactics youll be behind in the game what is this defense of the capitalists i mentioned that one friend spent $40 on items in dota 2 i actually played this game with him again and he has spent about well $300 on the game thats enough to buy 4 copies of gta v here in australia he was also recently hacked and had $200 worth of items stolen from him thats what you get when you blatantly overprice some items and drive the games economy into the ground refer to the previous joke on capitalism now the worst part of this game in my opinion is the long matches matches usually take anywhere between 30 to 50 minutes the longest ive seen is 70 minutes youre not going to have time to go to the toilet people with indigestion beware i bet valve is in on a conspiracy to make profit from increased adult diaper sales youre not going to have time to eat youre not going to have time to speak to people while playing the game or do little chores around the house that youre parents need you to do because youre impatient and if youre gonna get addicted to the game like a lot of people are youre not gonna have time to have a life see my russian cousin it also really sucks that when your early game sucks youre going to be stuck in a losing match where you know youve lost and all your team is doing is delaying the inevitable its not enjoying to lose and if you quit at that pointthe consequences will never be the same literally the more you abandon games doesnt matter if the game crashes on you or if you have a slow internet connection and the entire thing stopped working or if you have a really slow connection and it messes up and boots you out of the game or if you have a slow computer like my $300 friend and your entire computer crashes and you cant get back in the game the more you will be punished so on your first few abandons you will get low priority matchmaking games low priority games are pretty much like the normal priority games on steroids so more insults less teamwork more s more kill steals then as you keep abandoning games the punishment gets more severe each time the amount of low prio games you get for abandoning never goes down this game would be much better if it was made by communists

dota 2 is a very highly skilled game dont expect to walk in and expect you being very good you are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but thats just the nature of this game dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies anicent if you destory it you win the ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom middle and top you take control of a unit that is a hero many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as crystal maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game you are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players you need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell there is 107 heros in dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the warcraft iii they are categorised into 3 groups strenght which are usually the tanky guys agility most carries are found in this category and intelligence which most of the supports are usually found all these heroes have different skill levels such as invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells he is able to create spells with 4 of his spells creating the other 10 he is able to create tornados which disable enemies meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it just an all round crazy hero viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells passive spells are spells that work all the time you dont need to activate them and 2 other spells which are targetable you can customise your dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include glados and the narrator from the stanley parable you can change your hud to different themes the game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool most of the time it is 25% in 2014 the international is a annual tournment created by valve for dota 2 in 2014 the prize pool for this tournment became 109m dollars first place got 5m dollars if you are into esports then this game will be up your ally dota 2 is a hard game but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot if you arent sure you want to play this game you can pm me and i can teach you how to play i honestly dont mind

this is yet another new release by the company moba you may know this company from their popular games such as league of legends dead island epidemic and dawngate this is a very slow paced first person shooter set in the age after the 3rd great war in which humanity has been set back in the ages where magic was still okay to use in this game you play as an ex soldier trying to defeat the main communist overlord sniper who threatens america as we know it the single player aspect of this game is probably the best experience youll have in this game as the online is currently dead the developers stopped updating this game after league of legends was confirmed to be more balanced and a hell of a lot better they did however unlock a new game mode called compendium in which you simulate reading a book and collect trading cards ill give this game 3 meepos out of 5 its okay but the fact that youre required to be able to speak russian to get this game really lets it down

im only talking from my experience in pubs it feels gratifying when you win it feels frustrating when you lose in dota 2 you will lose alot whether you want it or not what matters in this game isnt your hero or this pointless counter picking your performance is solely dependant on skill experience and reaction time however no matter how good you are defeat is inevitable with a bad team at the beginning when youre matched with new players such as yourself this can be quite infuriating and almost made me stop playing after approximately 10 hours thats why i strongly advise you to play with friends so you actually have a coordinated team about the game itself its a solid moba [enwikipediaorg] with a big diversity of unique heroes the majority of the community is quite unpleasant at times and isnt very beginnerfriendly which can be really offputting if you ignore these people aka muting and just keep doing your thing you will find yourself genuinely having fun after 50 hours 50 hours sounds kinda extreme but it really isnt this is the kind of game you can spend thousands of hours on and you still wont be able to fully master it if youre ready to go through all this hardship and frustration go for it i highly recommend dota 2 if youre looking for a casual multiplayer game that you can get into quickly stay away from this

this game allows you to exert your knowledge and understanding of layered mechanics and exceptions of those game mechanisms onto randomlyselected regional people without their permission or interest heated debates can lead to forged alliances to achieve that common goal or end into displaced frustration projected onto others to substitute ones own failures and inabilities to execute ones characters heroes qualities on the other hand this game allows one to create hero build guides as a pretense to be productive with hisher vexation as well as to fruitlessly raise the standard of expected knowledge of the game through item and ability walkthroughs in hopes that those one encounters in the future rely on these indirect serviced suggestions

the first time you play you will have a very unpleasant experience and most likely uninstall the game within a few days however youll feel an urge to play it youre going to watch videos of pro people teaching you how to play and youre going to think that now youre really good youre wrong over time however things will get better and youll actually start winning then you start losing again but this time its not your fault its your teams fault always remember that nothing is ever your fault your dumbass antimage was complaining that you were stealing his farm but its your farm dammit then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier when the real reason he lost is because he didnt give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5 and they even have the nerve to question your methods then you notice that your dumbass antimage is in the jungle farming because he couldnt farm in lane you know however that he is just a noob eventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s and the game is obviously over this is the time when you give up and sit in base ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up its better if you just quit now while youre waiting in base make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss make sure you type in allchat team noob followed up by report antimage if they ask why you want them to report him ignore them if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves repeatedly say phrases such as lol ur so bad and ur just mad cuz you cant play you could also take the alternative route and say things like    and     yea the game and communtiy can be a  sometimes but its also a super fun game that requires fast paced decision making as well as strategical analysis plus it unifies gamers and conservatives by creating one common hatred russians all in all this game is 90% getting  and 10% feeling like youre on top of the world but that 10% makes you feel sooooo good that it keeps pulling you back

reposting since under the old review system i would be forced to recommend that people play this this game is like a shower fight between you and another naked man youre both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay when you slip over and land painfully on your  the other guy completely by accident gets his soapstained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though its the other way around youre the noob who cant get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try the other guy in the tub is the  from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter antimage puck ursa or some other broken class and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end the guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who even though youre farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them insists youre killing them the wrong way and are therefore an idiot noob the naked shower fight is also a oneway road once you jump in there is virtually no returning you become enslaved and before long all youll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota you wont even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved by dota or lol the video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality people who play mobas and people who dont neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave starcraft and wow in the dust if you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is people will just yell at you because youre terrible at the game and dont consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute individual step taken throughout the game if you want to get good you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference ingame if at all if you do otherwise you will get yelled at every single time without exception to not get yelled at you have to assimilate into the formless mass this is all a part of the selfenslavement process you wont come back ever and within a month youll find yourself just parrotting the same  people were yelling at you for earlier because youll be one of them by that point and you literally will not return youll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language

dota is less of a game more of a tool of self discovery in fact thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake games are designed to be enjoyable and fun  enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota especially for those in low priority they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either every facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know theyre destined to be although it seems at first to be a team game of 5v5 this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers barracks and ancient these objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat dont worry about the other team theyre fighting amongst themselves and dont matter anyway  remember youre better than your teammates and its inconceivable that theres any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes the interface and minimap should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as   and no courier gg my team are  ff but dont worry if you cant understand its not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that dont need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful if you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding dont fret they are likely jealous of your superior skills and cant understand that they are actually the ones letting you down just remind yourself of that one game you had that went freakishly well and make fun of someones build 1010 worst game ever

finally reviewing this game best moba imo if you think you are a kind or calm person try this game out you will discover one of the dark sides of you 99% guaranteed playing this game you would rage blame be a racist person which is typical you would not be kind to a newcomer  them for ruining the game right also you will be proven that hell is real in this game noob hell that is its a high learning curve game if you are a newbie to this kind of genre or this game in particular think carefully about getting into it not just because its very hard to get the basic right but also it will slowly consume your life look at the average player spending their time in this game look at my record gg no refund on your life spent legal addiction despite all this you should enjoy the game once everythings in place this game hands down gives the best feeling of victory ever as well as the worst feeling ever if you get to play with stupid people in your team this game requires skill and teamwork the more you play the better you are it would be ideal to play with your friends so its easier to work together as a team solo is a bit of a gamble the community is toxic if you cant deal with something like this you should avoid it this is quite normal in competitive games victory matters you know there is a mute option too on the racist part some people are branded as noobs depending on the region russian on eu pinoy on sea you will encounter different kinds of bad words again depending on the region some examples are  tangina pota bobo gago lanjiao sohai etc i know all of them including the meaning see play dota 2 for free language course being russian or pinoy doesnt mean you are a noob you should see this more as a joke there are pro russian and pinoy players some rank really high no need for it to be high bracket some can play well so it doesnt mean that its untrue its just true to some extent the game is freetoplay but you would eventually buy cosmetic items for your heroes anyway similar to csgo for some items the price can be ridiculous gl hf dont forget to blame people unreasonably if your team starts losing especially the mid

the game itself is good had a lot of fun but the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry and then fail at it what results in a waste of time it usually starts already a hero selection people dont communicate only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy too bad because the game itself is good the community is for 80% flamers egotrippers wannabe carry players very rude

dota 2 is the semisequelremakerereleaseevolution of the longrunning warcraft 3 mod defense of the ancients which in itself was based on a custom map for starcraft called aeons of strife after the release of the original dota map in 2003 the warcraft 3 community began producing a long line of dota spinoffs sequels and mods just as eul dotas creator had used aos as inspiration for dota itself which culminated in the release of dota allstars by steve guinsoo feak allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the dota maps and mods in 2005 guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic icefrog who has been supporting updating and shaping dota ever since his changes have been the most significant the most popular the mod grew more during his time than ever before and arguably have benefited and enriched dota as a whole by 2010 dota allstars became simply dota and icefrog was showing no signs of stopping later that year dota 2 was formally announced with its development spearheaded by both icefrog and eul both of its most important authors its past and present alike entered a semiclosed beta in late 2011 and was finally officially released in mid2013 and the rest is history history lessons aside dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable over a hundred heroes each with at least four spellbased abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items from a massive arsenal of over a hundred games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes and possibly far more dotas metagame is constantly shifting and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 680 released earlier this year on top of that it is completely free to play with no features locked out to any players whatsoever not even cosmetic items which form the backbone of the games vast microtransactionbased economy these items are freely distributed by valve to all players through levelbased gift drops and randomchance item drops free game updates alter the game balance significantly while introducing new seasonal game modes and far more and thats not even scratching the surface of the games competitive scene with its many tournaments its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines all leading up to the annual valveorganized grand championship the international it may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first but given time patience simple memory and a keen mind anyone can ultimately come to see dota as perhaps the most enjoyable enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived oh and its sort of fun[b]

dota ii is a fun free to play game i have been playing its precursor since it was released as a mod for warcraft iii years ago i have sunk more than a 1000 hours as it never gets boring its a incredibly deep game which intergrates complex gameplay and mechanics its a very popular game when you notice the international competitive scene however be warned that this game has a steep learning curve and i still consider myself a casual gamer type for this game and as most multiplayer game you will encounter abrasive players in the community which could ruin the experience though that can bes fixed by muting or reporting the players

dota 2 is one of if not the most frustrating and aggravating game ever created your teammates will cater the enemy team not back you up and refuse to call missings or place wards the enemy team will always pick combos or  heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick 4 carrys after you randomed phantom assassin and tell you to buy the wards every other game you will get a russian pudge picker that feeds 3 kills mid in 5 minutes and immediately ruins all the work youve done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane youll rage and call gg early and trash talk your teammates but youll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around as things start to finally look good you get bashed 5 times in a row by a faceless void or the ogre magi will get a 4x multicast on you 2 times in a row while the natures prophet is pushing your top barracks but after all the rage inducing pain you keep playing you suffer through it for the chance of that amazing satisfying comeback even though youre 20000 gold behind the enemy team only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient but you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory even so after the game youll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your 60 minutes of pain and suffering when you finally get that mythical youve always wanted valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless its a drug that once hooked to is almost impossible to break you almost dont even realize youre raging and forget that youre telling your best friend how much of a feeding  he is and how this lost game is because of him when youre the one who has 1 kill and 13 deaths you keep playing in hope that youll get good enough where youll be able to play with dendi or the other pros and you know thatll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day i would not wish this addiction on my worst enemy but i cant stop you nor can i stop playing myself

valve is afraid some fat kid might commit suicide for being called a noob and with this horribly broken matchmaking i see no sane reason to play this game anytime soon and because icefrog and the his devs ignorance about the eu servers turning to shit because of russians who select english on purpose because their own servers on east is unbrearable with the horrible people who mostly feed and rage in their games talking smack all the time now dont misunderstand this is a great game with huge potential but the truth of it is its rotten from the bad matchmaking and somewhat horrid and lack of brain community main reasons not to play this game goes undisputed as follows 1 russians ruining games talking russian when they clearly selected english as the preferred language in case anyone hasnt noticed dota is a team game 2 solo queue has been removedthis means that you can be matched against an enemy 5 stack when you are playing alone 3 no real community q&a support from developers and complete ignorance on the game dev forum mods deleting posts thats not deemed worthy even though there is issues surrounding the topics 4 ranked is viritually a joke in comparison to normal mm the only difference is a number for self gratification purposes it viritually means nothing when most mmrs you are still playing with complete  5 broken soloqueue at times matches you whether you are alone or 2 players playing together you will often or notdepending on your luck you will be matched with an enemy full 5 man team communicating in game while your team is just 221 or just all solo players this creates a huge disadvantage at the start of the match now valve has it ever occured to you in the small strains left of what corporate moral fiber you have that you should fix dota 2s blatant community issues is this really how you get out of your responsibilities by ignoring and deleting users expressing concern in a noninflammatory way its shameful considering how much of a profit youre making on it at least youd have the dignity to give us something back no ive personally almost quit this game two times because i cant handle the community and players i am matched with constantly they dont speak my language share my mindset or my skill level the least except an actual good match on some occations which leaves me with a horrible experience most of the time

i have been a gamer for my whole life but i never really put a ton of time into any one game in the early 2000s when i had a lot of free time quake 3 elite force jedi knight 2 et cetra all took up a ton of my time but as my age progressed i had less time to dedicate to gaming mass effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me but that was probably the most id invested in many years i currently have around 500 hours of dota 2 and dont plan on stopping anytime soon the gameplay is spectacular the community is great i have made more steam friends on this game than any other the meta is interesting the professional scene is a blast to watch and the game is extremely well supported  especially with the recent wraith nightlegion commander content update the thing is that im not great at dota 2 ive put almost 500 hours in and theres still more for me to learn  there are still some heroes i have yet to play it is a lot of investment but once you get it you will have an absolute blast edit just updating this now that ive put around 1600 hours in i still completely stand by everything that i said previously the game is super fun and im really enjoying playing with all of the friends ive made in it ive also experienced some of the negative parts of the community and theyre unfortunate but i must say that they are far and few between the community is largely welcoming and ive made some fantastic friends through it  ones i hang out with in real life now definitely play the game the learning curve is steep but entirely worth it

when you are done eating thanksgiving dinner at the kids table league of legends dota 2 welcomes you to the grownup table dota 2 has a level of depth and polish that the other moba games out there just hasnt seem to have reached yet what is remarkable is dota 2 has reached this level of depth and polish in a remarkably short amount of time what started as a relatively rough beta has blossomed into a competitive game that entertains captivates and truly engrosses people who are into competitive gaming valve has done a bang up job making this game free and having all of the buy stuff totally optional to those who are interested in it i think the method of giving people drops that they can decide to equip or unlock via unlocking chests is genius i hope they get all of the money

its fun till you realize you get reported for no reason and have no way of countering the report or explainning yourself the issue is if you get reported you can not get items in the games till you play a number of matches which takes about 30 to 60 minutes to play this is a problem cause anyone can report you for the three following which is not your fault or a way to avoid them its ridiculous they dont even tell you why and you can end up either playing those matches without any rewards or forced to not to play ever again this is a major problem who the hell thought this was a good idea

dota stands for defense of the ancients or as i like to call it dota the two is not to refer to the game being a sequel which it is but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game the objective is to turn it into dota 1 in dota you need to defend an ancient which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation since im one and twothirds bhuddist i usually end up defending one of them at random much like all the other players dota is a very unique game in that includes both offense and defense there are lots of characters and all of them are mostly good at different things in my opinion the best part of dota is playing it this is because dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies such as attacking the enemy teams ancient or defending your own ancient the goal of dota much like other games is to win if you become proficient at this skill you will win very often leading to more victories scientists show that six out of every three dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over this is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing dota takes a while to learn though and that is because it is an extremely offensive yet defensive game with many complicated nuances like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good one interesting feature of dota is that dying is really bad in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long like when halo 3 would just beep at you instead of spawning you and youd get really angry except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs defense vs offense why did i write a third position in that last sentence excellent question there are neutral enemies in the game and they usually dont do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral if you dont respect their space however you may find that they beging to fight back much like an offensive form of selfdefense early in a match of dota you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls also called town portal scrolls or town portal scrolls for short why did i mention town portal scrolls multiple times good question that is because there are multiple teams once youve bought items you go kill enemy creeps and they arent people so its ethically sound and completely morally fine to do  once youve spilt some blood or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up that is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points and that usually transfers to you after they die think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system once youve levelled up and gotten rich you can buy better items that make you stronger and then get new abilities like skills active abilities passive abilities or passiveaggressive abilities these abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice once youve become the best allaround person you can be or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average resets between games so you never get bored its time to go tear down the other teams towers those like many buildings in the united states canada or certain us territories will fight back and damage you and then eventually go and destroy their ancient which is what the a stands for in dota that makes your team the winner and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts

much of what you have heard of dota 2 is probably true it is an often cruel tricky to approach and that requires huge amounts of time to master it is these characteristics however to make it a game unique depth and the potential rewards that can give a feeling of conquest actually earned a high price and therefore real tangible all this long to find in a relatively short time a team more or less sets of people with whom it is possible to cooperate and communicate effectively since the nature of the deep tactical gameplay makes it almost impossible to be accompanied by casual players and hope to derive mutual benefit and fun especially in the long term now that dota 2 is available for all the challenge of numbers with the main competitor league of legends can begin in the face of a rock starting even steeper valve from its experience exceptionally balanced and truly free from the need to open your wallet not counting infrastructure for the live broadcast of the games can be the envy of every another developer moba if the work on accessibility will continue in the right direction this could make the confrontation one of the most exciting and interesting in recent years

league of legends has the spanish this has the russians these two games have brought out a racist side in me that i never thought existed while having 1000 hours played in lol and developing a strong hatred for the spanish and any other culture that speaks something close to spanish this game has also made me develop a hatred for the russian community as you can see ive only played 50 odd hours of this game at the time this review was made but if i had to add at least one positive note to this review its this ive mananged to learn russian in only a few hours grasping the most important phrase  blyat this phrase runs through my mind every day of every minute i sometimes even say it to myself in my head irl when i see someone doing something moronic this game is a russian weapon developed by putin himself to enslave the world along with the help of whatever leader brazil has right now while most of the friends i play with play lol i quit that in order to seek refuge from the spanish epidemic there is over there but instead have been sucked into this south americarussian racism simulator wasting most of the extra money i have on steam to buy cosmetic items for heroes ive just played i never liked history when in school i hated it with a passion just like the americans with their hatred for the russians this game has taught me everything i need to know on why to hate russia how to hate russia and question the very existance of that country based on the ape like intelligence that ive seen coming from the country in short if youve always been a saint in your life never swore never hated another culture never thought of abusing everyone you know that doesnt speak english that well then id suggest not playing mobas entirely all jokes aside if cancer had to be a game this would be it without a thought what valve has done is develop a way of making world war 3 possible along with the help of putin and his various ape test subjects that ive encountered in the game 1110 would keep playing

dota 2 is my favorite way the program lets me assume the role of another creature helping me experience our oneness with the universe i like to assume the position of the dinosaurriding lightningwielding halflizard halfman i like to join servers with up to nine other disciples be disruptor as he is called and go to the jungle closing my eyes there i concentrate on my breathing the other disciples woefully always curse at me i usually have to mute them i do so to concentrate on being one with the virtual nature i cant afford to go to national parks so this is the best thing sometimes i see lots of colorful exclamations points and these ping ping ping ping ping sounds occur around my character they are beautiful one time someone said the  level 1 disruptor buy courier you ing  and the truth is there are many players like him they arent at peace with themselves perhaps if he came into the forest and hummed koans with me and he had done so as the giant walking tree then he would see his greater consciousness all the negative energy would leave his body and wed share a moment of experiencing our buddha nature in my experience sessions last about 1020 minutes and initially it did not take long to find a server apparently ive been moved to lowpriority matchmaking but thats okay i just assume the lotus position in my chair and wait patiently the only downside to this is that sometimes i forget to click the accept button

dota 2 is a bad game for multiple reasons it has some nice rewarding moments during gameplay but most of the time you will find yourself screaming at your teamates pulling your hair our throwing the computer across the room and cursing russians brazilians and pracitacally any other ethnicty that does not speak english never have i played a game that has made experience such pure rage towards other players and towards myself pros team based mechanics that require cooperation punishment systems for people who grief or abandon good art lore and character design large free roster of playable characters a valve spin off of the orignial dota a warcraft iii mod cosmetics cons crappy boring tutorial and does not prepare new players terrible match making system broken  gameplay no true skillshots with the exception of meat hook hookshot and sacred arrow support heroes are generally unattractive and no one wants to buy wards or courier exessive intentional counter picking which ruins your game from the very beginning filled with people from different nationalities who do not speak english usually russains which means communication lots of griefers and trolls who threaten to feed abandon or simply say mid or feed and claim the middle lane by their divine right usually resulting in them feeding the enemy team and never ganking if they are arrogant pubs are awful and unless you queue with a friend you will most likely suffer by yourself 100% team game meaning it requires synergy and cooperations which most pub teams dont possess the game is super addictive and you wont want to shut down the game and do something else unless you are pretty much forced to you wont even want to get up to eat or  harsh cruel community ingame and out of game even towards the games devs diretide 2013 incident lucky alpine stalker set controversy etc cosmetics yes its a con aswell due to the fact that it ushers in a wave of casual players who dont really care about actually gameplay this game has some good points but the cons clearly outweigh the pros despite the hours i have clocked on this game most of my experiences have been terrible and it has negatively impacted my social life and made me a hateful person at times dont even bother with this game

dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena that adopted most of its mechanics from the original dota mod of warcraft 3 now lets come to some of its features  > once you understand the basics and become good at the game oh wait everyone of us is a noob  you will soon have a huge backlog of other games p > basically hat simulator > can cause rage anxiety and affect your mental state too many  griefers > you make 1000 good moves in a game and you wont be recognized go feed once and get reported > you will start putting aside other priorities ty dota2 > to sum it up it has a  community like most other mobas unless you are insanely good at the game 1010 recommended best game ever played

this game is total garbage with the worst community ive ever seen in any multiplayer game the game will lower your iq if you indulge in it over extended periods of time and will also ruin your mental state caution it causes depression and explicit anger mmr is broken and every server you play on is russian the only good thing is that youll acquire some knowledge about the russian language aswell as some of their mental capabilities if they even exist

hi i only recommend you this game if you love mobas but i didnt like mobas and now i have 1200 hours in it i was a cod player an mw2 player of course you will not be pro in your first matches to be good you need a lot of training if you played lol and you have 30 lvl its sure you know the basics in this game the most important thing is the last hitting at the start because if you have more gold and xp than your enemy you own the game the game may be boring but if you have friends it wont be i think the boring part is the first 13 lvl because you cant play some gamemodes before that if you are new here you need to complete the training if you are totally new here completing the training will get you a sniper set no the setts doesnt give you any bonus just the enemy can see how rich you are these decorative items have degree common uncommon rare mythical immortal old and arcane this items can be normal auspicious heroic cursed and unusual so these were the decorative items lets talk about the ingame items you start with 625 gold each hero have their own item build i recommend you the healing slave tango and clarity items this items will fill your hp or your mana if you are new or never played that hero before i recommend you the guides up left the book icon i recommend you the greysharkruua builds or purgeeng builds thank you for reading this review p3d0hungariandota2fan

dota or defense of the ancients was the first of its kind and originally started off as a warcraft 3 custom map but it quickly grew to become one of the most popular games in the world as well as spawning a whole new genre which we know today as mobas the game is simple 5v5 3 lanes and both teams objective is to destroy the other teams ancient there are over 100 heroes in the game each with their own unique skills and attributes and forming a well rounded team with synergy is key to victory closing notes  the community can be awful you will get yelled at flamed and even reported for making mistakes if you can overcome this the game is amazing

massive learning curve i am at the bottom of it but here is my fresh perspective on this game dont get into this game if youre not willing to learn a lot or sacrifice plenty of your time once you reach a high skill level you understand the game at its core and you also find the right people to play with this game is the most enjoyable game you can possibly play that is if you have the patience to get there the community is great overall the game is flawless valve is doing a great job with this one competitive scene is the healthiest ive seen and ive watched countless competitive matches so damn entertaining just look at this httpwwwyoutubecomwatchv8hbr1egx1i better than lol by a long mile

an accurate representation of pubbing in this game would be to imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life each turd represents an average public game now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar it is the best feeling in the world that chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar

i really cant say anything other then this game is ing amazing look at all the hours ive spent in the game you all are probably like well there are these people who have spent thousands of hours in the game so thats not many but do take into account that my total time owning this game hasnt even exceeded a year yet there is not a day i remember since i got this game that i havent at least opened dota 2 usually to play a public game sometimes to play a bot game and sometimes to brush up on hero knowledge and look at guides this game will ruin your life and obliterate all your free time my only warning to new players is that the community it pretty toxic to new players and not everyone speaks english just mute anyone calling you a noob flaming you etc but never do so to the people that legitimately want to help you overall rating 11610

you want me to say some words about dota 2 here it goes cyk@ and axaxaxaxa are the only phrases youll only ever have to use to communicate  dont be decieved by the server names as every server is a russian server  id recommend never to play this game with friends as your friendship will be destroyed into tiny pieces  phantom assassin is the source of all depression  going into the depths of low priority is like taking a trip to hell with no way back  you better be lucky if you random otherwise youll probably get earth spirit  if youre afraid of rats dont play this game as theres a gigantic one named natures prophet  pray to the lord that youll never be against spirit breaker because his name doesnt lie but somehow i keep coming back to the game gg wp valve 1010

hello everybody first i would like to introduce myself   ok my name is etro who has a hobby of playing a lot of games like skyrim minecraftpokemon and etc ok heres the point when i played dota 1 the first try of the game was hard and i really cant understand it very much the moment i played dota 2  thats how i realize and understands the game so the thing that iam saying dota2 or valve can explain better than dota 1 no offense  ice frog so i would gladly recommend playing dota2 than dota 1 for the first try of the game  others say that dota 2 is not a good game or a bad game well we all have our opinions   for me its the best game of all the time d i respect the lol league of legends players even though they are saying that dota 2 sucks here in my country philippines many filipinos say that they like lol better but i really dont get their point i mean no offense to the lol makers and producers but lol kinda copied dota 1  i dont even know if lol have their permissions or paid icefrog for copying the main idea of dota but valve paid icefrog for dota 2 so it means valve have their license while lol doesnt have i dont really know guys if lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog but i think they didnt ask for permissions or paid  if im mistaken please correct me or you can just tell me to remove this review and im sorry if im mistaken that lol really have their permissions or paid icefrogbut i really think they didnt well the real point in this paragraph is i will play or follow the one who have permmisions or paid and that is dota 2 or valve if your noob or getting annoyed its ok cause we all started like noobs  and just ignore the people who are saying that youre noobstupididiot they will just annoy you and they have no hearts they are monsters anyway for them to easily ignored just press the heroes panel at the upper left of the screen in there you can see a speakers icon then press it and wahhla you muted the player you chossed i hope this really helped you guys  ok thank you guys for reading my review with this game i hope you recommend this  bye

still waiting for volvo to giff diretide fun game better played with friends however becuse the main problem is the community most players you encounter will not speak english so it may benefit you to have a russian portugese and spanish dictionary at your side if you are new to the game do not use the builds you see pros use they build situationally the builds they use are not good for every situation at all also if you do not take criticism well dota2 is not for you the worst player on your team will blame you for everything that goes wrong like seriously if you cant handle an insult play something else these people are  regardless of the community and the lack of diretide overall volvo did a good job on dota graphics are great mechanics are great and it is a fun time overall besides the general rudeness of other there generally are very few bugs with the game and it generally runs very smoothly if you are new i strongly recommend doing training before anything else and playing against bots until you are fairly confident in yourself it takes time for you to fully understand dota and no you can not jump hopefully next update youll be able to wink wink volvo unlike other  mobas cough cough league cough cough you do not have to spend any money on dota the only things there is to buy is cosmetic items which you will be able to get for free as soon as volvo fixes the drop system i strongly recommend dota if you dont have friends a life or any desire to find love as dota will slowly consume your life and always remember  magic  antimage

one of my favorite games in my library my play time reflects how much time i have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game supports who actually support the team carries who can carry the team to victory and players who can execute a base push as timely as the new york sunway by the way i love subway sandwiches i eat a blt without the t almost every week bacon is the most delicious meat lettuce is like the cup to the tea party you cant have tea without water and you cant hold water without cups unless of course you use your hands or your mouth but lettuce cups are pretty delicious so imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes which while they rhyme with potato dont taste anything similar if potatoes tasted like french fries tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables speaking of wet tables if you put water on tables it gets wet not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated what is 6x6 its like 64 or something which is like 10 if you add them all together what does that mean i am not sure math is hard unlike dota2 which is a great game especially as a carry actually i never played carry before it seems like a pretty easy job thoughjust kill things until you win the game that is a pretty simple job description unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle i mean jungle is a location how is it a job it is more like a forest than a jungle i mean jungles have lions and stuff right forests have angry bears i am not sure where manbirds and horsemen are from though horses arent jungle creatures i think they sound more like mountain creatures to be honest i havent seen a troll before or a gnoll but i bet they are forest creatures as well too so jungle should really be called forest mid is a pretty self explanatory position its the middle of the map lane like if you had 3 lanes he would take the second one or she there are female heroes as well are they called heroines well i wouldnt want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug that would be sexist i mean playing lina is pretty addicting though fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire  its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx thats what lina is which reminds me that pokemon recently came out x and y are pretty popular with my friends so i wamt a 3ds those things cost money though but i head i can trade my items for cash that sounds pretty amazing earning money while palying games its like the american dream for people who dont want actual jobs not that i have a job yet all i do is stay home and read manga which is pronounced mane gah like mango but with an a i sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa so offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane so the dangerous lane as they would call it it isnt very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys its like chinese vampires and running water i dont think they can cross running water many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing one flush of the toilet and the go poof or do they i actually know nothing about chinese vampires i only know vampires from the books my friends lent me it was the twilight saga i really preferred the jacob to the other guy though i was pretty upset when bella made the wrong choice i mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted plus the other guy was like 439434 years old yuck so support is the last job you can play not only do you provide moral support because most teams dont ever have asupport but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy like a slave donkey to carry your items for you he can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price why wouldnt i want another donkey instead of one flying one i am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one i mean how would you even catch a flying donkey it could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror but donkeys are pretty cute so keep them on the ground if donkeys were meant to fly god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic so that is dota its a pretty good game but it has some problems too after all even blts have ts here are the digusting parts of the blt games take a while to finish so if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game a game of dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours like i am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of dota i mean look at my avatar that is my face for like the first 5 minutes of dota before my legs fall asleep and i start getting cramps it also has too many different heroes i think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7 it would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldnt choose any hero it is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero you are literally counterpicked because you chose too early it would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option some game modes take forever like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans sometimes i want to make team electric but then a ban comes up and i accidentally ban mr thunder or the masked electric emo then team thunder is ruined i can understand why bans could be good though cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy he uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death sometimes he tickles you for extra damage what is worse is that he eats you he gets fatter and stronger the biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action but not enough story its like worse than dynasty warriors when it comes to story i could use a few cutscenes telling me why i am teaming up with a giant spider a porcupine a baby rock and a angel man at least there was a reason in dynasty warriors 7 about why i am fighting guan yu with my hated enemies the filthy wu were those filthy wu actually even men the way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians so i think i will give the game a 11014 its a pretty good game but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category i understand that every hero has its own lore but the bigger connection is quite lost when i team up with my biggest rival against my best friend a 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game people play like men instead of filthy wu women but ali why the 14 and not a 17 because the game has that huge tomato and i hate tomatoes i love blts without the t bl is the greatest invention of man till someone introduced the uncessary t i would have bl everyday if i could afford it but i have no job and spend all my time reading manga

if you can get past the initial learning curve and burden of knowledge the game puts on you then dota2 can be extremely rewarding as far as most mobas are concerned this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage the gameplay is as a result solid and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy the ui is a little underpopulated however and doesnt explain much learning how to do some of the functional things like leaving a game thats safe to leave or muting people or reporting people are not super intuitive you have to dig furthermore the options available though very powerful and plentiful are not explained super well as a result its important to toy around with your settings a bit which can be a hassle as far as the f2p model goes its pretty fair you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions the only thing they do is customize your aethetics and happily not to an extreme extent because of this the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear this might dissuade people from buying them because some of the items are barely even visible overall i would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge the game is not easy but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things veterans of the genre will find a lot to like

this is a game that will quene you with people that have 40% of your hours played this game will show you the worst scum of the worst and will favor them in a trial this  game will show you that in this cyber world there is a hell and you are in it once you start palying rankeds this game will take away your will to get better at it by throwing hords of russians peruvians s and whatnot who speak only their native language but start playing a ranked in which team coordination and communication are a must this game will take away your hopes of a normal match and it will leave you with a bad taste in your mounth once you lose a game by being the only one that did his job right and is not feeding overall i give this  game a 410 the game itself is worth at least a 9 but when you put russians and  of the entire world together without putting them in their own servers or restricting them by their gameplay this is what you get people that cannot communicate and play together to win i promise you this games community will make you loose all hope in humanity and in everything that is good if youre unlucky you will end up as one of them i for this matter am abandoning this ship after 13k hours played i finally figured this game is being ed by its own community because it fails to set up people who can communicate i might come back and play it once valve makes people stay in their respective regions by creating dedicated servers  like lol  but untill then i will no longer participate in this  thank you and good luck trying to make something out of this game you will need it fyi im pretty sure there are some typos and grammatical errors but i dont really bother checking them right now regards steve a once diehard fan of this game who was hoping valve would do something about the community but was dissapointed over and over again

anything great this game could provide you gets completely driven off by the so real rrp russian retardation phenomena which will put and keep you off from any sort of enjoyment you could ever witness playing it if you happen to be an easily losing temper person or you just cannot bear dealing with down syndromed people most of the most of the time do not play this game

a few things that stand out over my 4500 games ive played are the following 1 regardless of how supportive and accommodating you are you will always be stuck with one cancerous player that will just ruin the game 2 your opponents will always play like a well formed professional team your team on the other hand will fight over the mid position pick 5 cores purchase no wards fail to rotate on ganks and you wont have a courier till the 35 minute mark 3 if you play with your friends they will slowly break all ties from you this is because of the constant aggressive verbal directions and abuse you will hurdle at them over the course 4 dota2 is like a drug addiction you will be always chasing that first high in reality its a flaming piece of  you end up depressed jobless and friendless 5 now that i reflect on the total hours ive spent on this game i could have done something useful in my life  like get a university degree or learn a new skillset

[today in international dota news] more peruvians are setting their preferred language to english without knowing a single word of it despair is on the rise filipinos are committing mass suicide in ranked matches shouting what frightened onlookers describe as a wew russians agree that the only heroes worth playing in the game are pudge invoker and sniper however russians themselves have no idea how to play these heroes and continue to yell incomprehensible profanities in the chats in other news it seems that mexicans are causing worldwide panic as they do nothing of value refuse to supportinitiatecarry steal vital last hitskills and feed on teams everywhere the mexicans strangely enough cannot see that what they are doing is not only wrong but is also making them look worse as a race and finally the number of english players is decreasing substantially as many take their own lives after losing match after match while on 4 stack teams of foreigners this however will hopefully force the now homeless peruvians and mexicans into joining the russian and filipino servers so they may kill eachother off at last bringing about the death of dota 2 and the start of world peace this has been russell stover with your international dota news and may god have mercy on us all

great moba game if your deciding to start on a moba game your probably going to choose between league of legends and dota 2 both are great games and i think dota 2 is a better expireance in my opinion here is why dota 2 all characters are free so you dont have to waste your time trying to unlock them the game takes more skill imo characters have a bigger learning curve the community is not toxic game allows you to use your mic you can turn off mic volume in less than a minute no micro transactions you can trade item sets aka skins you can combine item sets you can buy item sets on the steam market you can parts of item sets for money this list can go on for another 2000 words the game only has one map so the game probably sounds repititive but its not there is many ways to play the game such as carry support tank jungler etc when you check out this game it probably is going to look boring but definitly check this game out one of my favorite games

if you ever wanted to learn russian then this game is totally the best one to learn basic russian and insults at one place forget about school get dota and play with coldblooded russians which doesnt shrink back to insult you because youre not playing good with a hero which is in their opinion the easiest hero in the whole game well the only thing is that you cannot understand them while theyre talking ingame because theyre mainly talking russian get yourself a dictionary and start learning russian there its the best thing you can do 1010 would play it again

just like its previous installment when it all started back in warcraft 3 as a custom map dota 2 is pretty much the whole same thing with several new additions added to which couldnt happen before as someone whos been playing dota since its beginnings the first thing you may recognize and notice is that many of the games features such as map layout heroes and gameplay is almost exactly the same but with a better and more refined look with updated graphics making the entire map feel more lively and a refresh of old of course thats all good but at the heart of dota as many may know is its gameplay and replayability the amount of hours ive pumped back in the first dota was unforgettable clocking more than 2500 hours of time played just like dota 1 dota 2 shares the exact same formula pick a hero last hit creepsfarm up gold and win team fights to gain victory simple and straight forward right wrong if you played back in dota 1 youd come to realize the more you played it the game had a fairly high skill requirement in order to do well especially if youre pushing to be top in a region or tournament the amount of time and practice makes perfect as you will want to eventually learn every hero how they synergize and working together with your teammates it gets rough but extremely fun and satisfying especially if youre on high level play unfortunately though most people tend to ignore these kinds of games since difficulty is fairly high or they just cant stand to put the effort to actually play the game well and properly otherwise various issues can occur such as getting hate from other players and getting reported for not being able to play well its an immediate turn off and can easily have people packing their bags and finding another game unfortunately again this is thanks to the toxic communities that have spawned across all moba genre games you will always have to deal with these kinds of people who will give you  and you have to bare with it as those kinds of players wont be going away anytime soon i strongly believe competitive games have the highest chance to have ragers compared to other types of games out there and its tough to avoid the negativity that comes with it now with some additions theyve added a store where you can purchase from hero skins ui skins to different voices for the default announcer different couriers and sellingbuying through the steam market the thing that seperates skins here compared to others is that skins come in seperate armor pieces you can equip on a hero meaning you can say keep a helmet and sell the other parts like gloves to someone else on the steam market it goes to show how much control the players have and what they have in their hands the best part of all this is that all heroes are free right off the bat to everyone so no need to spend money and unlock the heroes you want to play it allows us as the players to explore and see what heroes we enjoy playing the most and if youre into cosmetics you also have the option to buy a skin the business model for me personally is fair and likeable as ive had no issues with it whatsoever its equal for both the customer and developer now while the gameplay is still the same and fun at its core what else has been added by valve well we now have various events that take from time to time usually worldwide holidays such as christmas or halloween are some examples these events bring in replay value to want and play the game more such as getting limited skins for heroes ui skins couriers or just straight up rare items that can be sold across the entire steam market so you can get some funds put into your wallet for perhaps other itemsskins on the market or even just saving up to buy another game entirely from either the steam store or ingame store theyve also made several changes to the ui compared to back in warcraft 3 the ui is bigger and straight forward and buying items through the shop are easily seen as everything is now categorized properly and accessing them with a simple click its easily noticeable but just in case you may have noticed some heroes have not been put into the game yet and are missing its mainly due to copyright issues with blizzard seeing as how brewmaster was a pandaren from warcraft and now valve has changed him to a koala beast of some sort in fact every champion for the most part have been changed in their appearance because dota started off by using blizzard races and even some famous lore characters such as thrall disruptor or rexxar beastmaster its certainly slowed down some heroes from being brought back the recent being legion commander male to female and terrorblade no longer the demon hunterillidan valve still has a few more heroes to change and get out such as techies so if youre a big techies fan andor mainer youre going to have to wait a while longer until valve finally pushes him out alright and now my few personal grips about this game other than having a toxic community as i mentioned earlier throughout these types of games i just do not appreciate or enjoy the art style that valve has brought into this game not in terms of quality but art style the quality is fine for some but most heroes i feel lost their identity and instead of something different or unique valve just made most of the heroes look ugly and feel uninspired in my honest opinion i mean now earthshaker now looks like a mutated version of beast from xmen with a mix of a koala similar to the new brewmaster hell i still appreciate blizzards art style so much more in warcraft 3 than this new look look at pudge and slardar they had the look voice and feel back in warcraft 3 but now its just not as strong anymore here even the almighty and fearful zeus doesnt look like an intimidating god anymore but a scientist another thing that i do not find a lot of fun a whole lot anymore is the gameplay itself yes the core gameplay its literally been the same thing over and over nothing new or innovative just a rinse and repeat of picking a hero farming up gold for items and winning team fights maybe its just me after playing thousands of hours in this genre or perhaps if you take a look past the gameplay and look at what it really offers theres really nothing going for it last hitting isnt fun anymore as thats all youre doing most of the time early on with team fights mid to late game unless you personally find it fun the worst part is you will fall behind if you say die a few times to an opponent carry it pigeon holds you because now your team has little to no retaliation or chance of hoping to win since that carry will just roll face your entire team and theres a decent chance someone on your team will call you out meaning more anger and frustration can occur i can safely say as a long time dota 1 playerfan dota is still fun but its not fun if you want to play decently at the average level because the amount of mechanics people know in that level will put you in a disadvantage if you just learn a few because most just dont have time to do it so what can i say i mean in the end this is basically dota 20 with better graphics same gameplay like the original a few added features like events and the ingame store associated with the steam market everything looks great except the art style for most heroes personal opinion and of course the ease of access to newcomers while it may seem straight forward it gets more complicated indepth meaning theres a harder learning curve and barrier to pass through to fully enjoy the game at its fullest meaning youll need to spend some time and practice

the games plot isnt really clear but the way i see it is that it is obviously a game about the problem with rapid assimilation of cultures and how conservativism leads to massive xenophobia causing a war between what i think is the texasmexico border on the rio grande though for some reason its russians and peruvians instead overall it really is a great free singleplayer title that experiments with how much you did or did not slack off in foreign language courses in high school while testing how racist you are capable of being

dota 2 has got to be the best thing ive played since i was born not only are the movement and combat more stable than bruce lee glued to a weeble wobble but ive accumilated over 30 hours and have not seen a single hacker if i could sum it up i would say its like chess rock paper scisors and torchlight 2 thrown into a blender to make the perfect moba playing this game lost me hours of my life that ill never get back and i dont want them back gold medals and cigars to valve once again

dota 2 one of the best mobas to date im very fond of this teambuilding strategy and interactive game dota is what started it all league of legends based off original dota this game is what started the moba hype though the game does have its faults the tutorial is a little rocky not being anything like the actual game and learning little to nothing through it the game is a great f2p title there are no microtransactions that will change the game besides your characters appearance though the dota servers are rough in some regions around the world forcing players from those regions to play on other servers based for other regions causing many problems such as language barriers lag and overall less team cooperation if valve improved some of the servers instead of focusing mainly on na servers this would most likely improve game quality for everyine around the world overall i would give a positive rating of 810

ive had this game in my steam library since beta and occasionally id give it a try to see if i could tap into some of the excitement that continued to elude me for some reason 62 hours later on may 12 2014 today after reading the first 10 headlines in the dota 2 steam forums i promptly uninstalled the game im not one of those dudes who mistakes his opinion for fact so ill just say this game isnt for me rude unfriendly community coupled with an overtly pretentious selfimportant theme and arbitrary unnecessarily difficult online play laning ganking lasthitting really are unappealing to me i suppose the kids prefer the game this way because they feel like theyve accomplished something when they win as opposed to the rest of us who simply play video games as an over30yearold gamer with kids of my own perhaps im just too old for this anyway thumbs down next edit my 9yearold just found out dota 2 is a thing thanks loudmouthed fourth graders so 1 for dota 2 because its one pc game my kids and i can play together and not worry about offcolor game content as long as we play with bots and not foulmouthed angry nerds looks like i might be reinstalling sigh as they say in vegas the house always wins well played valve well played

how to describe this game this is the first valve game where i havent had fun at playing it and made me question their work after a year of gameplay i can easily say that if you dont play it with friends you can end up with a brain tumor or end up in a nuthouse you need to play it with friends because its the only way to enjoy the suffering the artstyle and voices are great but the gameplay can be a little tricky and it can go unbalanced very easily the only time where i found the gameplay balanced was in the greeviling because everyone was in the same level but the gameplay its not the biggest issue with this game the community its really toxic and valve itself suffered this recently they are equal or worse than the cod community the only good thing about this game is the business model the big difference between dota 2 with tf2 and csgo its that those games gives you fun and money this game only gives you money no matter if you win or you lose a match you will always end up with the same bitter taste i only recommend this game for those who lost their minds or just want to make a couple of bucks to buy another game if you are sane please make a restriction order to anyone who invite you to play it

game was good got terribly broken i quit thats the long story short want a long story long well read ahead then my dear nolifer says the one that spends time writing game reviews in steam so where should i start of course from the start a friend of mine invited me to play this super badass game with him and after days and weeks of pleads i finally bent to his will entered the game all felt fine he was a pro player and guided me through it i am also a sharp person that never does anything if hes unprepared so i read a few tons of guides from dota legends and watched plenty of tournament videos before my first game i started high above all the newbies and my lerning curve was quite fluent this means i rarely got to deal with raging idiots though rarely is not the same as never even i that played at a higher level than my matches got raged at from time to time imagine how a normal player felt brainless super confident brats keep yelling at everyone they dont like even if he is playing well that he is terrible and should uninstall the game heck the best guide ever writen for the game starts with a description on how to mute players and how to shield your psych so yeah nail number one in dotas coffin the terrible playerbase yeah there are some nice guys that survived but their numbers are rapidly dwindling and honestly even the kids at lol are nicer these days well dota could have still sprung out of its coffin if that was all but it isnt things like the terribly broken matchamking system count as well even if you rock you can hardly progress through the ranks and as gamers say leave the trench since all depends on your partners and you mostly get raging kids and gameabandonig russians no racism simply plain facts and statistics hell im a fan of putin you will never be able to roll up enough wins to play with skilled people yeah valve says its fair and it doesnt rank your winslosses but your overall performance in the game but yeah you guessed it thats pure  the heroes see the game has this goat fella named riky that is wrecking public games because of his easyto playiness and he is overpowered as hell to any unexperienced player yeah good ones can counter the  out of him with plenty of heroes so instead of getting this guy nerfed reduce his stats he is getting boosted with every update same goes for plenty of heroes which ruins the game the balancing of heroes and skills is being lost gradually over time and lately if you see a certain hero in a team on a pub game you know he will win and yeah only jerks pick such but thats almost all the players youll meet other heroes that are so fragile and weak like the poor crystal maiden which gets killed 50 times per game are getting nerfed instead and another nail goes in i can keep this up for quite a bit but i realise readers are dropping off from the review like mosquitoes near raid with every line i add so lets cut it here and shoot the word the game is duying and unless it gets a restart it will keep degrading dont bother you lose a lot of time playing it matches take ages at times no one pauses for you if your mom gets a blackout next to you well either help her or lose the game you see its not a good game to play you wont learn russian apart from swears you wont get smarter quite the opposite you wont make cash unless you sacrifice your whole life to play professionally you pour so much nerves time and effort in this game and you get nothing apart from a few and far between games where you actually match with good guys who pick normal heroes and dont spam the mic with swears well the game isnt a  as someone who is on a rage spree might claim its a decent one but its not worth it i would mark it as a 46510 yeah indeed 465 what a nice number and advice you against playing it thats all really excuse my lenghtiness and if you actually read that well go reward yourself with a treat from the fridge

this is basically dota 1 with an upgraded user interface and graphics its still a work in progress but all in all this is what the original dota style gameplay needs if its going to increase its declining marketshare in the moba genre it itself once pioneered the spectator interface for viewing live games is impressive and though it seems the matchmaking algorithm is not really active at the moment for a beta the parts that work do so rather well the attack and spell animations are all reworked and changed in this version so even for old dota 1 vets there is much to learn that only comes with the experience of engaging in the matches themselves if you can get an invite and you like the moba genre you will find far more to like than not but as usual in these types of games it all comes down to how evenly paired both teams are in skill for a game to truly fire on all cylinders

alright listen up instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians im going to tell you how dota 2 really is at its core in a nutshell dota 2 is a great game but a terrible experience at the same time you want to keep going back to it but you also hate to go back why one word community dota 2s community is for the most part rude and hateful and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting moba its unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away at the best of times often its much worse and i would prefer not to go into the details sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you havent actually done anything wrong occasionally though you come across friendly players and when that happens the game is a pure joy to play however since the game is 5v5 coming across four nice players at the same time if youre solo queueing is a rarity why then have i played the game for over 2000 hours the sensation of winning your determination to keep playing despite of the discouraging community is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning that sweet moment when you see the enemy ancient blow up and look back on the match remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying but even a victory can come with a grain of salt many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning there is a mute option but that doesnt stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat people can intentionally feed the enemy team ignore their own team teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player its really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time going ranked doesnt really solve the problem either at least not completely ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill it feels much more professional and tryhardish although you meet nice players more often nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell having played some matches in ranked i can say the mode isnt hate free i had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode another problem with ranked is that like i said its more tryhard many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such but dont get me wrong dota 2 is a great game in itself the core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well no technical issues to speak of not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so of which i have had none myself graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them all the various spells and abilites look great the game is very deep and complex with tons of items skill and item builds and strategies to learn it can be a bit terrifying to beginners but once you get the hang of things its engaging all the playable heroes are well balanced although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being op and free to play from the start thats another thing the game does right all the heroes are free and playable from the start unlike dota 2s undeniably very successful competitor league of legends dota 2s microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff which means there are zero pay to win elements in the game it really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game to put it roughly in perspective its like playing skyrim but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make calling you a fooping idiot every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective failed to kill alduin uninstall skyrim noob dont know how to make dragonbone armor learn to play tard its like that having played the game as long as i have i would say that you are better off not playing dota 2 the game is fun when youre winning because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine which is 50% of the time sometimes not even when youre winning it isnt the losses that make the game unpleasant its the unfriendly people if youre one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you you have a better chance of not finding dota 2 so terrible but realistically why should you even have to videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you cant have fun half of the time the game isnt worth it people will tell you that dota 2 is great but that greatness comes with a price do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view this review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what its really like not just the great things if you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis then youre golden the game is at its best when you play with friends and dont have to worry about getting a stick in the mud player on your team great game with a bad community

got 99 problems microing is one there are very few games that allow me to hold my weinar while playing  dota is one of em  the innovative playstyle that i have been made new to allows for me to have free hand to generally cup my bawlz or hold my weinar this breathtaking romance between my left hand and genitalia is phenominal towards the performance of my skills in dota  as well as this masterful technique i would reccomend this game but you may ask yourself why isnt your left hand on the keyboard as a connoisseur of stolen pc equipment i do not have the latest in razor technology or advanced moba gaming equipment therefore waisting a second hand on dota

i dont really enjoy competitive games as a rule i like the idea of them but i dont play them i have been playing a lot of dota 2 though because i dont think that dota 2 is really a game i sometimes lose a game so badly that i wake days later in a cold sweat at first all i can think is that i am happy to have woken from the nightmare later in a moment of creeping fear i will realise that the real nightmare is how bad i am at dota and yet i cannot stop myself from playing it dota 2 is an endless nightmare from which i cannot wake to install it is to introduce into your life a hellish netherworld one in which close friends are so disappointed in one another that they cannot even express it one in which improvement means only that you will be matched against better opposition all of this horror floats on the constant threat of the low priority queue a stygian hellscape that this review could never hope to describe summary 1010 would play again until my sightless eyes drop from their sunken sockets and the cold grip of death frees my mortal husk from its trap

my favourite game of all time amazingly deep pvp experience that has me still feeling like every game is something new and different after about 23000 hours given between dota 1 and 2 first off a warning this is game is hard to get into it has an insanely large learning curve and a community who mostly dont deal well with learners or anyone not at the top of their game if you push through this which isnt so bad if you have some friends to show you the ropes and get you into it you will have access to a high action strategy game with so many variables to each game that you can always be suprised no matter how long youve played

dota 2  its a kind of game which can easily become a part of your life once you get really interested in it youll never be able to get it out of your head ive never thought that i would be into a game like this its just amazing cuz of many different characters team roles and skills  it gives you a freedom to choose between lots of strategies this game can teach how to play in a team efficiently how to help each other in order to win how to organise your small group if theres nobody to lead it it isnt always easy to manage with all this stuff but it makes the process even more challenging more catching you know dota 2 is so popular and loved game cuz it makes ppl think realize themselves as a part of a team choose the best strategy to achieve their aim  a lot of characters  oceans of items  various game modes  great events  lots of strategies  improvement of your reaction and cooperative skills  an ability to create your own team  random teammates can be absolutely dumb and wryhanded

of the majority of games that feature animal people i dont think any other game of our generation can shout blatant furry culture forcing more than dota 2 ranging from the down and dirty gondar lines like for the right price anything to the drunk pitiful mangix and you thought disney was bad on top of that they even added a character called troll warlord which is obviously a homestuck reference these guys are really milking the fandom department why cant a game just be about boobs like the old day i mean what ever happened to good old christian family values like monopoly and scrabble now weve gotta fill our games with fanservice and sell out to an audience that is somehow greater than ours i dont think so and theres even a character thats a flamboyant homosexual i had to bring my children to therapy after they heard the words puddin pop from one such storm spirit on the topic of inappropriate directive i cant believe a greek gorgon such as medusa would go so far as to talk about her gays this is simply not alright this game is nothing but a manifestation of what our society is becoming and we can only petition to have valve remove funding for this project to save our youth

a very beginner friendly userfriendly videogame with deep insightful characters that have amazing character development which will lead you to tears in some cases like the poor blind guy who finally achieved greatness because his mom said he could _7 it also has a very friendly community that is very helpful to beginners i recommend this game to any and all casual gamers especially fans of light friendly games and their community like club penguin and 4 ch an also characters in this game are very easy to learn and their abilities are easy to utilize allowing easy collaboration with teammates and friends for example meepo the geomancer is a great character for those new to the game and i recommend all new players choose him theres minor drawbacks in useful content though like certain things are outright useless like couriers and support characters and they should be removed from the game to make it perfect and this is coming from a long term investor of this game who has dedicated many hours 1337 to be exact to this extremely fun indie game all in all if youve never played a videogame in your life or have never spent time on the internet dota 2 is right for you this is a very non informative review

finally found a game i really suck at let this be a warning note for all gamers that have been a prisoner of their own style but then again trying to give dota 2 a shot for a change of scene if you are new to moba or just downright have had suck at it for whatever reasons this game wont be any different by any means so let us begin reviewing the game where comeback comes back and hits you in your face more than the taken franchise i know they should have stopped after the first film  the game itself is pretty darn vast with approximately 112 heroes in the roster and just a bunch of different purchasable items to buy from the gold you receive every second and by kills with its your job to figure out the strength and weaknesses of each of the character you are about to take down lead with and set your perks accordingly  objective arent any different for other mobas you take down enemy structures to make the ancient aka the final tower vulnerable and then take it out  the community is definitely one of the most rage induced people piled together in a game where communication and tactical planning are crucial every team i was assigned to there seemed some guy screaming his throat out at me or some other bad player in out team just like an exboyfriend with emotional issues i dont really blame them it is one of the most competitively played games out there  the graphics are better than most and seem well thought out the animations of characters on the lower box really adds to it its well thought out and isnt much flashy should help most people unlike my adhd sufferer cousin and the system requirements arent as much so you should do fine with most potatoes  sounds are quite varying for all items and also visually the effects are quite different that is definitely a mention for the creative team responsible for it  they have drops yep just like csgo you have a chance to get an item drop that can be tradablemarketable some drops do cost a lot and can buy you a game on steam sale cumulative drops if you are dedicated to it  id also like to mention playing with bots will only get you so far in a game against people the tactics people use are nothing like they programmed those binary butts with there is still a lot to conclude in what seems to be a game based on a chessboard turned side ways but i wont ruin it all by discussing it here so spend some money on a better internet and try it for yourself gaben knows youll need it this game did have its moments for me but it just sadly wasnt a meant to be well the opponent team will surely mourn for me for all those victories i snagged them sadly i cant say the same for my friends i hear one of them ended up with tourette syndrome

a true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming this sequel to a genredefiner that is now just bursting in a global scale is a great point of reference to anyone attempting to make a game of this genre great graphics amazing sound and voice design and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make dota 2 great but its major strong point is the depth in its mechanics while dota 2s gameplay might seem daunting at first its one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting other games such as league of legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula but dota 2 kept it intact and makes sure you learn something new everyday not only the core game is strong but also the esport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing with several tournaments going on including valves own the international at the time of release the game looks like a train with no brakes about to crash against its competitors and run them over raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game

more russian than moscow 1010 dota2 is a russian simulator explore the every day life of a russian glued behind his computer screen wondering why these english capitalist dogs do not speak the almighty language of justice enjoy not being able to understand your teammates and swearing at eachother in a variety of spanishfrench very rarely english and most of all russian you can play on the europe west servers with russians american servers with russians or if youre missing out on that full russian experience play on the russian servers no wonder ukraine is not taken yet theyre all too busy playing this game feel free to enjoy solo queue and end up with a group of 3 russians and a spanish 13 year old repeatedly listening to a repeated soliloquy of backwards letters youve only seen once in a chernobyl documentary attempt duo queue and end up with 3 russians which kind of diminishes the full blown russian experience thus i do not recommend you try this or you can play with bots which are surprisingly better teammates than the russians just for good measure ill throw in an extra russians to get the point across enjoy yourself comrad for those of you that do not enjoy the full russian gaming experience there is always csgo which is the softcore version of dota2 disclaimer long exposure to dota2 might cause capitalist ideals to give way to communism

like almost any other moba out there its free unless you want any of your looks customized i only played a handful of matches and being at least semiliterate in both moba uis and old custom warcraft and starcraft maps i can in no way recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of moba fans the ui is unintuitive the shop is a mess to look at if youre new and you will likely get your face smashed in by even the computercontrolled players time and time again while you punishingly learn every little thing it takes to be good at this game if you have never played a moba if you dont have a friend who already plays this and can walk you through what to do do not try this game if you really love mobas and are looking for a new one yes definitely try this and i hope you enjoy it i did not not even remotely

dota 2 is a 5v5 moba game you have a selection out of 108 unique heroes each with a unique skillset every hero is also available from the minute you start no playing x amount of games before this hero becomes available the object of dota 2 is to destroy the other teams ancient to do this you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes top mid or bottom by destroying the outer towers youll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps as the game progresses youll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members communication is a very important aspect of the game i therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that youll be teamed up with wont always show the same willingness to communicate if youre just starting out playing dota 2 i also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself the skill ceiling is also extremely high so every time you play you might learn something new due to the high number of available heroes skills and items you can be sure that every game is unique something to be wary of is the community there are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action flaming is something that could happen often but if youre playing with a team entirely made up of your friends this shouldnt prove to be an issue if this is not the case dont worry you can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful team oriented game

dota 2 a very frustrating game that forces you to play with and against other players youll rely on your team to preform their selected roles and then watch in horror as they completely ignore the game mechanics and just chase down kills rarely successfully you build in game items during the match to enhance your characters role and then hope and pray your team doesnt feed the opposition too much team fights normally 5v5 tend not to happen as you watch your fellow team members run to meet their fate and be a hero sadly this ends up throwing the game and you lose i would still recommend this game purely for those few matches when the your whole teams synergy is in harmony watch as the gold floods in the towers crumble and the opposition blame each other for their loss

i cant really write a good review for the everchanging landscape that is dota2 but i will say the following generic things dota2 is not a simple team game there are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online you come into dota to have fun with tools every character is a different tool they move different they turn different they attack differently if you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange then this is for you if you come from any fighting game for example you can get into this like really into this what makes dota2 different from other mobas depth dota offers much more variety much more freedom to experiment other mobas shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools you have items that give you more movement options that take away movement options from the opponent even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically in other games you will find these options baked into a character they try to guide you into learning how a character should be played dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment as a reminder its never anyones fault when you fail to build your tool properly this is a game have fun most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle and valve facilitates this but you dont have to everything depends in dota2 should you try dota2 yes but remember to have fun you will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match enjoy smile a lot of people forget this if youre not enjoying dota2 uninstall

has a steep learning curve because the community punishes new players expect loads of trash talk but its worth it if you play with friends who can teach you teamwork is essential in this game keep practicing and eventually you will develop good decisionmaking skills which you might also be able to use in real life much better than league of legends in terms of objective depth which is the reason why i prefer this game over other mobas

when you play for the first time all this game seems like is just a bunch of wierd colored creatures punching each other with sticks it seems really stupid but you suck it up and play through the tutorial then you stupidly decide to play your first game of real dota put short you fed badly after going 030 your first game you kinda hate dota but you stupidly decide to play another and chances are you lost again and this keeps happening until you discover your first newb hero drow seems so op doesnt she afterwards you decide to play this hero again and again and doesnt it feel good to win 50 games deep youll hate noobstomp heroes like riki sniper drow and bloodseeker obvisously these heroes are really op 100 games deep and youll find yourself trying out some new heroes tidehunters ravange is pretty epic you have to agree 200 games deep and youll have played every hero with the exception to earth spirt how the hell do you play that guy i dont get it 300 games deep and those newb stomp heroes dont seem so bad anymore manfight riki stand right next to drow get blademail for sniper and buy a tp for bloodseeker and dont forget to buy dust 400 games in you will know how to ward rune control stack and pull and play a support you will understand the basics of having one person farm while another supports and harrasses holy  youve made it to 500 games remeber your first match if only you could see yourself now by this point you understand the basics of dota remeber to dodge the sunstrike 600 games in and youll realize that for the past months dota is the only game you have played like the only game because once you start playing dota you never come back unless your power dies by 700 games youll start playing against trilanes now as an offlaner you have to do your best to not die and get some farm hide in the trees and sap xp where you can by 800 your tempted to buy that arcana not saying you will but it sure does look tempting by 900 you know what to buy and you get what every hero can do you know where to be and when and you get the feeling when there smoke ganking and roshing gamesense op by 1000 games you hit a milestone the game doesnt seem like colored creatures punching eachother welcome to dota 2 noob advice read guides when your trying out new heroes practice in bots and dont stick to one hero play them all and stick in there your first 10 games will suck purge has some great guides that you really should watch before you even step into your first game and also play with friends otherwise you might have to put up with peruvians who keep screaming noob in chat when you make one mistake people who have to rage at everything thats why theres reports and russians who will play uber aggresive all the time which to be fair on there part works half of the time welcome to dota 2 oh yeah and nerf void

welcome to dota 2 the hotel california of online gaming late last march i was naive enough to dip a toe in its beguiling waters and today 450 hours of gameplay later i return as a semifunctional human to regale you with tales from its realm dota 2 is unlike any other game ive ever played both in its nature and history it started off as a starcraft mod popular enough to be ported to warcraft 3 which then exploded into a kaleidoscope of playermade variants and eventually coalesced again into a single entity titled defense of the ancients allstars there is no single author of dota though all the anonymous contributors whove made it what it is have come from the community that first started playing the mods as such dota is the very definition of grassroots game development the idea of a game made by the people for the people as a certain american president might put it fills me with a particularly warm and fuzzy sensation of course i knew none of this when i first picked up dota a friend recommended it because its free and im cheap i understood that the game had a teambased format where killing the other guys was a good thing like with firstperson shooters but your character also leveled up through the course of a match as in roleplaying games that seemed like a recipe for unbalanced gameplay but as it turns out its precisely dotas balance that makes it so unbelievably addictive you start off as a member of a ragtag group of five heroes intent on destroying the enemys base which is embodied by the titular ancient structure through a series of skirmishes against the other team their defensive towers and waves of autonomous creeps you gain experience and gold the latter of which can be spent on items that make you stronger swifter and deadlier the more you kill the more you make the more you buy the more you kill rinse repeat and make sure to say gg at the end learning a language might be quicker than mastering the full breadth of dota excuse me if im making this sound simple because it really isnt dota 2 has a roster of over 100 heroes to choose from and the combinations of items they can obtain is an order of magnitude greater still each hero has four or more unique abilities and to have any hope of defeating a skilled opponent you have to know what those are what items he or she is carrying and how they affect your chances of survival ignoring all of that nuance i jumped straight into the game with the juggernaut and was promptly beaten into a pulp of samurai sushi a dozen humbling  whoopings later i was online and reading the dota fire hero guides dota 2 choices the key reassurance i can offer is that all of these intricacies are in fact worth learning as daunting as dotas complexity may be without it the game just wouldnt be as rewarding my way of rising to the high bar of basic skill required was to pick the last enemy hero to destroy me thus i went from playing juggernaut to bounty hunter to bloodseeker to ursa to spirit breaker each time i was sure i had the right hero a better player would come along expose my weaknesses and teach me something new im the worst loser i know and yet i played dota 2 for nearly 100 hours before i could get my winning percentage above 50 maybe if i could actually see that i was being dominated by 14yearold kids listening to darudes sandstorm on repeat i might have felt sufficiently embarrassed to retreat in shame i stuck through it though because in the immortal words of agent smith as a species human beings define their reality through suffering and misery and dota delivers both with just enough victory to keep me titillated and once i had a couple of hundred hours of experience under my belt i too started passing on the sacred knowledge of dota through the timehonored tradition of owning noobs im the worst loser i know and im addicted to a game that keeps kicking my  this is not a game for the impatient success in dota 2 requires the strategic forethought of chess the unselfish teamwork of basketball and the steely nerves of poker none of those skills are acquired with ease and theres no magic number of matches or hours played to achieve dota competence its a lot like learning a language i never felt discrete upgrades in my knowledge and skill but eventually i got to the point where i could tell you every typo in the games hero descriptions and every corner of its single asymmetric map just know that the commitment required is on a whole different scale to other games you could complete the epic mass effect trilogy plus all of its expansion packs in less time than it takes the average dota player to familiarize himself with everything from abbadons aphotic shield to zeuss lightning bolt but thats really the point mastering this game in 50 hours wouldnt feel anywhere near as satisfying as taking a good 500

i play both games but i like dota 2 more than lol because  great graphics music  seductive heros  and main reason  i can learn many different languages while playing philip malai thailand jk sometimes i think it would be better if this game gets worse or bankrupt  because i can go outside play with my friends in real life  i really miss u but i cant play with u anymore _________________________send to sona katarina syndra fiora vi ahri

with over 110 heroes to choose from dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of all the games available on steam many players find that even after 100 hours of gameplay they feel incompetent at the game while this is probably dota 2s greatest downfall it is also the aspect that makes the game as great as it is there is just so much to learn in this game that it will provide fans with countless hours of playtime verdict dota 2 is an extremely difficult game and that is what makes it most rewarding yes the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an average player may take well over 100 hours however if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term dota 2 may just be the best game you can currently find  and it is free

 dota 2  dota 2 is a wonderful game for teamplay if you love games like destroying the enemy base and five heroes vs five heroes you would definitely love this game the game works like this that there are two teams first team is called radiant  second team is called dire and each team will have a base that base is called ancient  then to win this game you have to destroy there base so basically the first one to destroy the enemys ancient wins but before that you must go through the enemys towers theres three tower on each lane so you cant destroy their ancient if you dont destroy the three towers and you cant advance to the second tower or third tower you must destroy the first second and third then finally their ancient last thing is  each team will have five players so you and your teammate must cooperate if not you guys will lose instantly the game then each player will have a to pick a their role there are 10 roles after you guys pick a roles there will be three lanes theres mid  top  and bottom  so it can be like this 1 in the mid 2 at the top and 2 at the bottom 10 roles carry  will bring victory if he levels up faster and makes gold faster support  will provide wards and courier also will upgrade the courier lane support  useful even without farm and can go to other lanes to help others initiator  will start the teamfight jungle  can get gold in the jungle so the other teammate can solo topbottom pusher  can push faster through first second and third tower escape  can bait the enemy or bring the enemy to your trap disabler  will stun the enemy or cancel the enemys spell cast durable  will tankshield the teamfight so hes teammates wont die fast nuker  will bring massive damage too the enemy this the common role in game if you have this team you have 5050 chance of winning player 1 carry this role will kill all the enemys and finish the game player 2 support this role will help the carry to farm because the other team will try to kill your carry player 3 durable this role will help in the teamfight he will take all the damage of the enemy so the carry will live player 4 initiator this role will start the teamfight so you guys will have an advantage of the enemy player 5 disabler this role will stun the enemy so the enemy cant cast spell or attack i hope you like it and i really recommend this game so good luck and had fun  pls like my review originally posted by author  steven baes aka stefphen

have an urge to review this game with its latest situation we had a down time during christmas time and lately it seems that the players were more frustating than before closed beta inviteonly period also the leavers and the disconnected players are more rampant now which make this game more and more unenjoyable now noobcalling negative notteamplayers and the blame games involved yes those kind that you have to expect when playing with total strangers youll be wasting 3045 or even 60 minutes of your life thanks to them losing easily so this time around you have to prepare yourself mentally to face those kinds d good thing is that they have implemented the local lobby feature so that you can actually play locally within your lan should be a very good game worthy of having a lan party again i like the balance changes they put into the game the item changes and things that make the early games more fun but im putting this as a no for those who play only with a friend or two you better play this with a full fivepersonteam to fully enjoy this game and the time not wasted or perhaps due to its current state players similar to me might not have the reasons on how to fully enjoy this game hope valve and the team can continue to improve on this game more

i dont usually write reviews but this is a game that i played really much because i enjoy the genre and tried many games in it to compare dota 2 with basically in tems of speed dota 2 along with strife which is basically dota 2 in graphics style of lol with a petitem system which you can level up by playing is average so if you think a moba should be slower you should try league of legends and if you think it should be faster you should try heroes of newerth if you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try heroes of the storm since you dont have to learn as many item effects dota 2 in a nutshell after 2400h of playtime new players if interested in cosmetic items will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious if you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for you cant sell the items since volvo put a trademarket cooldown 2 months i think on every new item that gets released yay so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest rng is strong in this one youre better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market volvo greed simulator the old loot system in which you could acutally gain items after a game for dota 2 profile levels and a leveling chest you had in your inventory which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later was successfully reworked into greedmode the chances to get any items after a game are as low as getting a legendary or higher before sure they drop entire sets now but most of them are common to rare which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both item quantity and value maybe you should try some never change a running system in this particular function mostly developersupport abandoned game the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releasespatches are just really really rare special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% countbasednot reviewed by support employes for example if you express your annoyance towardslets say russiansfor not being able to communicate in english on eu servers you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a eu game 3 probably more are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english these days russianinfested to the max810 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam even though they have their own servers because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language thanks volvo for letting that happen maybe one day the eu servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual eu will have to play on american servers after all d editin addition to the listed issues the game servers are now absolute  1415 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasnt possible conclusion if you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing in terms of cosmetic effects andor profile progression this probably is not the right choice anymore because as stated you dont get level rewards or similar stuff anymore just really rare item drops probably in the 02% range if you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be your gamechoice 1 the community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is not your game for some serious gametime at least not in solo matchmaking i didnt check the other games these days but the community in hon was much more friendly and less russian in my personal opinion dota 2 isnt playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly without being annoyed by trolls or russians gameplaybalance 910 community 2510 rewards system 110

you see as a true christian i was raised to to believe the true saviour gaben but when i heard about this game i said this game has everything i need religion no sinners and a very casual experience i praised the lord for this mighty gift from the highest heights of heaven so like any other true christian would i decided to play and not stray away from the reightous path but when i loaded up the game the loading screens were riddled with satanic images and meanings i was outraged by this atrocity more than when my son told me he had sinned by doing some dispicable acts as matthew mcconau said in chapter 169 thou hou slay thou demonic presence shou nourish in the heighest points of heaven so after i got away from them satanic signs i started to become somewhat suspicious of this game i pressed play and began to sweat as the jesus juices excreted from my body i crossed my heart and prayed to god to forgive me for this act of satanism and waited for the match to started upon the game starting i was stunned by the amount of pagon rituals and signs that were in the game i closed my eyes and picked a random hero only to discover something truly horrifying my beer had run out my bacon stained sweat soaked vest had ripped the russians were here they were everywhere my ears started to bleed as the russian flame began i tried to continue on the righteous path but sin was inevitable i pressed enter i started to flame back my fingers were numb and then i realised i had sinned my heart stopped i could hear god reaching down to me but even he could not stop this i had become the thing i dreaded most more than a gay person a dota 2 player

dont bother spending hundreds on other language learning programs or ones that claim to be the best like rosetta stone dota 2 has the market cornered and you would have to be a fool to pay anything for these superior pieces of software when dota 2 is completely free of charge when you want to learn a new language simply queue for your region and select the language that you already know valves patented system will immediately match you with other language speakers who will get you on the fast track to success you will love your learning experience i can guarantee that you will not grow to hate other cultures due to a language barrier because soon you will be able to speak portugeuse spanish russian and chinese

their sanity ill shatter their dreams of conquest ill destroy of warcrafts custom maps one stood a little taller than the rest defense of the ancients here the heroes of azeroth freed from the tedious management of cities and armies could fight as they were meant to with weapons and experience teamwork and tactics all unadulterated by some abstract general and convoluted mission a vast pool of heroes pulled into one map normalized and equalized through patches armed with improved weaponry combined to cement a gameplay experience that appealed to our encyclopedic minds our fantastical tendencies and our social impulse here was an unthinkable union of knowledge skill mythology role playing individuality and balance here dota matured to perfection but this perfection was uneven the brilliance lay there but burdened by the crust and grime of history the games greatest hero ice frog was a player who saw in dota a wondrous achievement and vowed not to let that masterpiece deteriorate and die seeing the game as a growing process owned by a community ever meant to experiment and improve ice frogs leadership kept dota alive suffocated by a dated engine and forgotten game he and his team worked with the legion of adoring fans to nourish what could be saved and eradicate what could not but even tenacity has limits and in order for dota to break free it needed a new body a new platform in which to siege the world here as ever an angel swooped from above it was valve and they released the building pressure of dota into the atmosphere of mainstream gaming steam that would finally power the community it deserved the rest is history adopting the ftp model utilizing the source engine and steam community dota has its outlet dota 2 players marvel at the games sheer number of balanced heroes how it feels difficult yet strangely compelling sophisticated in its strategy but gleeful in its murder at times silly but still dark oppressive but always promising emancipation if you practice hard and reflect often so reliant on your allies often complete strangers that autonomous action can never rival teamwork like members of a symphony clashing with your enemies in near perfect tugandwar entailing chesslike prediction and fpslike twitching your team fights together wins together and dies together never before except in professional sports has your weakest link dragged you down or raised you up but drag you down they do even in the most porcelain masks do we see blemishes and dota 2 has its fair share teams can and do exploit the weakest member of the opposite team bullying with a savagery only seen in competitive gaming because of this exploitation and the difficult nature of the game as a whole frustration often runs high in the experience losses feel more painful than wins feel enjoyable and the hope for those rare games in which perfect harmony among both teams leads to razorsharp tactics and thrilling plays can be ruined by the cruel hand of fate where a single hero out of position or a single rng move can turn the tide of battle dota 2 is paradoxically rarely satisfying but when it is players never forget that feeling of triumph video games more than any other art rely on us to deliver an experience whether they tell a story or present puzzles to solve games need us to be competent and attentive dota 2 takes this to new heights and presents us with an outlet where the more we pour into it the more it gives back eventually our exhaustion clouds the luster somewhat but we shouldnt judge the game by our own limitations feral profound and terrifically challenging dota 2 is competitive teambased gaming in its prime

this is an excellnt game if you want a really dynamic playstyle and a unique item shop which offers much variation the reason i choose dota over lol is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when theyre telling me i shouldnt be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great id give it a solid 710 just beacuse its such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still cant do it properly i hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because its very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health lol yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games

i recommend this game if you have actual friends to play with and have fun playing together or you are a person who doesnt give a dam about anything and just turn on music and plays game without saying anything like me 3  if you go solo  1 at start you get flamed all the time because you are not really skilled  even when others do x10 times worst  2 when you get good you start to flame newbie players because they arent skilled and its because you get treated like that when you started and its a high possibility that it will be seen in your actual life now or later on 3 you can get pretty fast addicted to this game  you can see in other reviews or just look at there played time which may make you unsocial person  if you werent before  4 tons of russians even if you select other regions you still gonna get them  if you are person like in first sentence or dont care anything what came after if you go solo they you may like this game

if you enjoy dedicating your life to this game while at the same time ignoring your family friends and any sort of social interaction then you will certainly enjoy fighting with your teammates over who will support or who will buy courier by playing this glorious game you will also learn how to speak several languages as for some reason russians and mexicans like to join the us east and west servers when they have servers in their own country im sure you are already sold by this point but just to add on one more thing about this game is that you will also learn how seriously people take this game and realize truly how terrible you are at this game because you are a noob with less than 3000 hours on a game

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

there i was ready for a classic game of late night dota with renowned hustler joshua marc baillie harkening back to our good old days  a well spent youth of boisterous cheer and plays a plenty then our world was sht upon by the powers that be gaben and icefraud both nigh on untouchable behind their shroud of lies and broken promises we queued ready for the action the thrill the skill to survive and thrive in a high skilled scenario wed spent over a thousand hours training for this this was our moment we chose our heroes heroes we have always enjoyed playing heroes that happen to be op this patch our spirits were higher than snoop dogg in a forest fire we hit play i entered the game josh did not my brotherinarms had fallen nay been tripped at the first hurdle gaben would simply not allow him access his dota would restart and hed spam the play button again and again but to no avail this sordid process went on for 5 minutes 5 minutes i will never forget the worst 5 minutes of my life eventually josh gave up uninstalled and played poker night and in that moment i remembered the hundreds of pounds i have poured into valve the armory of virtual hats i have treasured and loathed in the pursuit of cosmetic gratification and a great rage swelled within me a rage that threatened to burst upon volvo customer support in a dire tide of expletives and jokes about hl3 but i contained this anger because i still had a game to win in honour of my betrayed comrade i will not forget the injustices i have seen this day and the hats might find themselves getting rather short of company in the months to come justice4josh pray4josh ti4godssake gameisbroken biginternetwords watchyourselves kappa

a team game were over 90% of people dont want to cooperate play as a team talk plan do strats and so on game looks good at first but at the end of the day its just a horrible online experience if you have a 5 man stack with good game knowledge good coordination yeah matches can be decent but i recommend setting up inhouse matches with another 5 man stack if you dont have a 5 man stack its a pub train all day or just plain badnoobish you win 505 then you lose 457 then you win 4117 then you lose 6028 and so on its all about the lucky roll of the dice named matchmaking most players that play this game have lvl 01 accounts with only dota or other free to play games so dont think if you report them they care they just make another account to troll feed or we also alot of people play this game drunk stoned or just very tired that can be ok i guess in a 1v1 game or a 2v2 with one of their buddies but in a 5v5 team game its not nice they just ruin the experience for alot of other people most people use their own language chatting or writing teamspeak or just skype is not on their menu so most russians will speak russian most turks will speak turkish and so on there is no region lock again for a 1v1 game maybe that could work but for a game like dota having a player from australia or peru joining the euro server with 300400 ping is not cool and alot of people just check more servers for faster queue times and also check more languages so if you check eu west or us east and expect all people to have good pings and speak english think again  at least some of the dota 2 players played wc3 or dota 1 dont even get me started with the other mobas its the only genre that makes me feel ive wasted my time in most cases when i play the game bonus people either flamecurse etc or just dont know what the hell they are doing in most cases both ^_^ so i recommend using your free time  gaming time playing other games and stay away from all free to play team games  mmos they are a magnet for trolls kids or just noobs that dont care and you know why bcuz they can make 1000 accounts so if they get banned or their ranking has gone down its no problem new acc on the way its kinda sad game could have been fun but its not and thigs will never change bcuz of all the reasons ive stated above the game at its core is good but the overall online experience is bad cant recommend this for a new player a true newbie cant recommend this either for an old skool rts player these guys online dont even look at the minimap so most of the time the gamesmatches wont be good and fun even most of the wins are fun just bcuz you had fun  a good talk or we with a real life friend that you had on skype or a gaming friend that you laned with not bcuz of the dota match tbh so just go and drink beer with that mate or just play other games with himthem with this concept of f2p and team gameplay i cant see valve fixing this so i cant see a reason to recommend this sure you can get random good matches but after all my experience playing this i think you are better off without this game  genre completely peace

one of the worst games ive ever played valve doesnt know how to play it so they recommend  items on a lot of heroes which ends up screwing me because i only get people who have terminal autism on my team and have to be plugged into a machine to ing breathe and always build  items like bfury on gondar  game only gets you mad its only fun if youre a  who 5 stacks all your games and pick heroes icefraud decided to make op like ing drow and you win all game but youre still a no life  210 better stiking to tic tac toe with your grandma if you want to have fun because otherwise have fun getting brazillians and russians with the iq of a rock queuing with you and you cant win because its 1v9 and no hero can take that on unless the enemy literally takes there hands off the keyboard and mouse and just go read a book because reading a book is more productive than playing this   game by the way if you suck your friends will make you play the support  every time and that is literally the worst role because all you do is get ed at because your carry cant carry because he has downs so much hes in ing china and all you do is get insta gibbed every fight because enemy is guaranteed to have a svendrowmagnusbounty hunter on the enemy team and are too poor to get any sort of item other than wards which just get countered immediately overall this game just makes you angry and its just like stealing a star from someone in mario party your friends will just whine and youll get angry at them and then remove them over this  game because of skill difference tldr  you this game sucks you should probably get secret of the magic crystals instead

a maelstrom of anger fear disillusionment and sheer ecstasy dota 2 is all these things and more youll learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes an average match takes in that short amount of time grudges will be born heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a g r r martin epic and yet for all its emotional drama both the highs and the lows youll still yearn for more just learning to play is an adventure into masochism everyone begins as a dreaded n00b unable to contribute anything but gold and xp to the opposing team a few weeks later and theyll have learned a few tricks where to place wards how to turn off auto attack in the options and crucially the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting give it a few months and theyll be rolling with the regulars double stacking recrowing and ggwp will become part of their vernacular immunity to the insults will be delivered to them upon chins which have since grown thick with stubble and caloused skin theyll have succesfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the worlds burgeoning esports scene consider the football metaphor pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots strips and footballs rooney messi and neymar use in packed stadiums full of shouting people if all of the above sounds a bit much ask yourself whats the point of playing if you dont feel something in the end dota 2 delivers passion and fury in spades and like all great games its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego just dont look at the item store your partnerparentscommon sense will never understand why you spent $35 on some virtual eye candy for your favourite hero

as of now middle of june 2014 approaches the fourth biggest dota 2 tournament is being warmed up as 16 teams compete for the prize of 10 million us dollars u$1000000000 that is simply abfuckingsurd the tournament name is the international  1st  2011 total prize for the winners was u$ 160000000 1st  1mi 2nd  250k 3rd  150k and up to 8th dividing 200k 2nd  2012 total prize for the winners was u$ 160000000 1st  1mi 2nd  250k 3rd  150k and up to 8th dividing 200k 3rd  2013 total prize for the winners was u$ 287438100 1st  14mi 2nd  632k 3rd 287k and up to 8th dividing 514k 4rd  2014 total prize pool is close to u$ 1000000000 oh about the game revamped the classical moba from warcraft 3 same gameplay minus bugs because of the engine voice acting particles all around cosmetic items so you can be fancy as  acid community but some fun can be achieved though this game is hard in this game there must be a victor and there must be a loser in todays america world no child ever loses there are no losers anymore everyones a winner no matter what the game or sport or competition everybody wins everybody wins everybody gets a trophy no one is a loser no child these days ever gets to hear those allimportant character building words you lost bobby you lost youre a loser bobby they miss out on that you know what they tell a kid who lost these days you were the last winner a lot of these kids never get to hear the truth about themselves until theyre in their twenties when their boss calls them in and says bobby clean the  out of your desk and get the  out of here youre a loser of course bobbys parents cant understand why he cant hold a job in school he was always on the honor roll well what they dont understand of course is that in today schools everyone is on the honor roll everyone is on the honor roll because in order to be on the honor roll all you really need to do is to maintain a body temperature roughly in the 90f 32c so be ready to face some insults hateful gamers with absolutely no empaty for your learning cause you will begin to draw pleasure as you learn the game and all your team relies on you to win the game those are the moments where skill and happiness are at your side while agony and pain are in the other side

dota 2 is a first person mmo rpg survival horror game developed by ea and ea only where you have to fight to survive in the drunken robot zombie apocalypse with nothing but your bare feet as your hands are too preoccupied taking off your panties in excitement for this sick filth the main protagonist is you jakob you are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy jakobs model really matches his personality a hipster emo gothic sexdriven male paired with the voice acting of morgan freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable the storyline is great i love how the developers have a completely separate prologue chapter for the story explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell thats not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game you start out in the middle of  er russia spending time with your beloved family and find out you are really really attracted to your cousin you take her out to show her the world when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you your cousin falls into the crevice you are devastated you try to rush home but then all of a sudden you hear a big  er plop you look behind you and there are robot zombies all drinking vodka you then turn all around and find yourself surrounded and ill stop there otherwise i may end up spoiling the prologue the pvp in this game is spot on its like the developers know that youre the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the getgo its brilliant need i say more fine i shall just like the amazingness that was dungeon keeper mobile you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into eas pockets its fantastic the best part too its free             um what i meant to say was it doesnt even cost a dime overall i would say this game is a 1010 a musthave game ea has really shown how to create such a game im just waiting on the dlc to come out later since surprisingly there was no dayone dlc

a game that isnt for the faint of heart while not matching the level of gore or horror in other game dota 2 and other mobas will get your heart and blood pumping like no other games its highly competetive nature is both its best and worst feature though as people sometimes cant get over the fact they just got owned by another player or are about as graceful as a dancing hippo when they own another player im not entirely bothered either way this is a great game with insanly compelling mechanics at the low low price of nothing this is a must try a more detailed look at dota 2 its history and its significance can be found in my review of it on my blog httpmouseandcontrollerblogspotcom201308dota2html

i dont like mobas this was my very first reaction when a buddy of mine was trying to convince me to play dota2 at that moment i didnt want to but for the sake of friendship i decided to give it a shot at first the game seemed hella confusing the only thing i liked back then was the main menu music and how ironic the menu and heroes looked p we played it through and through and ultimately there came a time when the confusion came to an end and thats when the addiction started as of the game its a strategy based moba game difficult to understand all at once but easy when broken into segments you have to choose a hero from a pool of 100 heroes each and every hero is unique in their own way having different abilitiespowers etc your main goal is to destroy the oppositions home base building ancient in order to secure win it sounds easy but  always hits the fan xd you are given a shop from where you can purchase items to upgrade your heros abilities and attributes my experience with this game sucked at the start but turned opposite as of now the competetion is real hard theres also a leveling system for the casual record along with a ranking system for competetive moderanked match called mmr or match making rating just like counter strike global offensive theres a match making system which helps each and every player of similar skillz to compete with each other so id say to download this game asap because i already regret for not playing it from the start p remember i was one of those who said dota sucks and now its an integral part of my life above all theres something calm about this game unlike csgo xd its always fun to play few kids

well i played dota 2 just 30 minutes  1 match  and heres what i think about that game even when people think or say that people in dota arent friendly theyre probably wrong i wont decline the fact that there are some of them but angry gamers are in every game possible y know even when ive played with a plague of dota 2 and csgo  russians ive heard 56 swears and mostly because they were amused about the game itself gameplay may seem a bit hard for the first time but after you play tutorial  some matches youll get familiar with it its quite fun and teamworkish nothing here is possible without teamwork  and creeps  plus its this kind of a games where you have to be sliced in a half and complete some objectives while farming for some exp and gold the match is getting real somewhere around 17 minute of a game both teams got heroes with special attacks new items more creeps thats where it starts when you bash through a horde of creeps and kill a sniper who was about to use a shrapnel then attack creeps from behind and you push through towers and even more creeps with your teammates sadly but this game was so negatively reviewed for most of the time but everybody has an opinion right try it out by yourself youll like it

pros  1 free 2 most played game on steam guarantees you can play this game 24x7 when the world is asleep dota players are raging at their noob teammates or being a noob themselves 3 low system requirements means your 3rd world friend with a  pclaptop would be able to play the game cons 1 most toxic community of any game you know you are doing well in the game as a noob if you arent asked to uninstall the game 2 selfish players that take heros that make no sense considering the enemy draft 5 carry teams or 5 support teams are not too uncommon 3 you are guaranteed to rage at the same noobs that you were when you start getting good at the game not recommended for heart patients or pregnant woman

its worth maybe somewhere between 1000  1500 hours but once you become fairly decent at the game you realize theres not much to it its neither complicated nor possesses too much variety the most fun portion of this game is irking the other players actually it also becomes fairly monotonous as you find players who dont even know what last hitting is despite attempting to employ advanced tactics however the game ios intrinsically bad not in result of the players like i said once you get somewhere between 1000  1500 hours of playing every character it becomes boring they end up playing too much like one another i never feel a difference between playing lion lina vengeful cm etc as support sure the abilities vary but the use of those abilities dont youre still going to stun when you need to youre going to harass when you need to etc its all the same unfortunately a majority of people ive met who are actually social are the ones whom ive seen play dota frequently

dota2 often claimed to be the hardest moba there is and that is because the game is very complex which is why there is a 10 hour tutorial trying to breakdown the game mechanics into little pieces and if you want to get faster and easier into it you cant avoid watching videos for more tipsntricks which makes this game very time consuming not to mention that an average game is between 30 and 50 minutes long however when you dig yourself through the wall of dota2 and got to the point where you start understanding what you are doing wrong then the game gets very rewarding and fun playing dota2 is a combination of strategy  which hero to pick where to lane what items to buy and satisfying combat one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability which is the heros strongest ability for newbies there are a lot of heros with passives and few abilities something which i dont usually mention in reviews is the voice acting this game although it has 108 different characters has really good voice acting for every single hero although the game is getting to get a bit older now its graphics are definetly up to date and personally i really like the water it looks really good overall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic indepth game go for it it is free and you have excess to all heroes from level 0 on this game gets a g for gooda>g>o

a very confusing game that strives to continue where heroes of legends left off but resorts a bit too often to slavic jumpscares to create an immersive slendermanlike experience current main issues pros  a friendly and positive community  possibility to make friends and discuss delicate topics with new people from various ethnic backgrounds chat comes with emoticons and other essential stuff  strong focus for learning new languages  full of fun minigames if the main game is not compelling like the shopkeepers quiz buying stuff from the valve shop ingame advertisement clicking guessgames for dota 2 network offline times etc cons  i picked the sniper class but had trouble aiming in the first person mode needs to be fixed asap  playing the game with oculus rift resulted in nausea  low replayability after their first game everone i know has practically reached their skill cap  basic things like ingame quicksave and quickload functionality is missing  raid bosses like roshan and troll warlord are hard to understand and severely imbalanced  steam achievements were teased but are still not working i already ate my 500th tree but didnt get the achievement  the crafting system is confusing and unintuitive  want to create a drum well you need a robe and a bracer of course want to create a buckler yep you guessed it you need a chainmail shirt armor and a branch  hitboxes are off and often clipping for example i bought a bigger sword for the sven class but game doesnt register hits that clearly happen against smaller models like the phantom assassin  npcs like the mud golem and the shopkeeper only have few lazy dialogue lines i was more interested in hearing their immersive part of the story while constructing a hut in a nearby forest out of treebranches  rts system for building or repairing base components are limited to only a few heroes and could use a revamp  character wipes happen a bit too often in the servers ive been at without going into too many spoilers finishing the campaign left me with more questions than satisfying answers for example why was the evil dragon knight so eager to hurt the seemingly innocent creeps for monetary gain why did the mysterious drow ranger attack our valiant hero why does axe look like a tomato so many questions yet so few answers overall the game is ok for an early access fpsrpg hybrid but doesnt entertain the more hardcore gamers for very long for a smalltime indie developer team i guess its acceptable but id wait for more available dlc expansions before paying anything for the main game

extremly rage inducing game recommended only for ages 1265 you will be able to learn every aspect of racism and realize what actually e means within dota 2 ie anyone below 3000 mmr is trash tier with a 2 inch  and their opinion is always invalid dota 2 is also a pathway for you to be fluent in many different languages such as chineese korean thai malay russian and many others the secret to climbing mmr is instalocking the most broken hero in every game overall 1010 game highly recommended

dota 2 what is there you didnt want in a game this game yes can be frustrating and unforgiving and yes can be hard to get used to but that is the fun in which this game provides you with you may struggle to survive in the jungle against a five man gank and continuously get slaughtered but as a team and with strategies you and your team can survive to become the victors at the end of the game when i first started playing this game i had a hard time getting used to mobas and never had seen them before which in turn made it so much more difficult for me to understand what was going on but with the support of my mates i learnt and gradually got better i would strongly reccommed new players to play a few hours of bot games first because going online with no experience like i did doesnt benifit your team yes you may win but was it worth all the jeering and crude comments from both your own team for feeding and the opposition for being quite horrible at the game but most importantly you must have fun playing a game without having fun makes there no reason to play it

i never liked rts games  i thought they were for nerds  i played league of legends about 5 years ago as abilitypowerattackspeedattackdamagelifestealshen@middle before it was cool [leagueoflegendswikiacom]  when dota 2 came out i quickly favorited keeper of the light [dota2gamepediacom] & juggernaut [dota2gamepediacom] and play them both middle  my strategy as a support player is to control the entire maps flow of creeps this gives the enemy much more to worry about than just their opponents  they now also have to contend with a large group of little guys aswell    how annoying  this is a tower defense game  there is an ancient inside of each teams base  the objective of the game is to kill the creeps  destroy the towers and work your way into the opposing teams base and destroy their ancient  it is very competitive and addicting  so give it a try its something new and im sure you will find a [ characterhero ] that suits your playstyle
recommended
despite the hours in this account i have played dota for at least 50 hours at my other account 1 year had passed since i played dota this game is a strategy game if im not wrong you have to defend your tower and destroy the enemies one using various characters will different weapons you plan how to defeat the enemy it was really fun since that day and i will try to play this game in this account note 01 hours played on this account well see how this goes

ive played this game since i was in my highschool dota 1 days were surely a jumpstart for me now im a licensed interior designer and i still play this game ingame items make this game a whole lot more interesting than before but since im a new player its sad to know that dynamic presents are now unavailable rendering old players an edge of having good set of items while new ones can never have while they level up so this makes leveling up your dota profile a bit of useless to me leveling up a profile knowing that there is no use or benefit can be disappointing at some point and hopefully soon there will be an autoban for rude players ingame some sort of a profane word detection thru out any language there are a lot of rude and tactless players out there that can most of the time disappoint newbies from playing the game not everyone though but nonetheless this game is still as awesome for me as it was before in dota 1 very nice graphics and enjoyable game keep up the good work

horrible game i hate it yet i still play every night hmmm

its a good game and all but it has so many flaws first off the pros the game is getting massive content every now and so and it feels fresh the map is fantastic and simple to learn same with the heroes too and the community made content is fantastic but the cons where do i begin now i love this game and everything but the community is just what ruins it ive been into games and i have over 800 hours plus and still being called an noob and everything and blames me there is some situations that i couldnt do anything and my friend keeps trying to help and no one else trys to come to the lane and im the one getting blamed also the game seriously need either more servers or region locks because i am sick and tired of being matched with peruvians portugese russians etc and not to mention if youre in a parties more chances youre gonna find some stupid clan team that does nothing but just does stun stacks while we just wanna have fun the worse of all is the people who always spam umadbro and take insults from  but seriously its impossible to not be frustrated in a video game espacilly dota seriously its just sad that these kind of communities just ruin a game and i can no longer have fun to me the game is just not fun anymore some heroes are broken as hell heck valve tried to nerf riki but they just buffed him more instead well gg

i started playing dota 2 around 2 years ago at that time it was still at beta and i would never have expected that this game would greatly affect my life when i started i did not have any experience and much expectation of the game due to the genre  it was all new to me however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because i did not like the fact the game was still at beta and at that time i was detesting its predecessor dota due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out i was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the esports scene within the game community of the genre i was hooked due to i never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar i personally was not a fan for sports in general although after hearing about esports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports esports is a term for organized video game competitions especially between professional it is known as competitive gaming professional gaming and cyber sport the most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are realtime strategy fighting firstperson shooter and multiplayer online battle arena generally dota 2 would fall under the moba genre due to it consists of sessionbased online multiplayer matches in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents fortified strongholds known as ancients each player controls a hero character and over the course of an individual game focuses on improving their heros abilities acquiring items and fighting against the other team welcome to dota you suck is a wellknown proverb within the dota community which is aimed at new player in fact is the truth especially for new to the genre for the first dozen hours or so you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players on the other hand if you persevere dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense teambased multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming its an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay being a freetoplay and the great features developer valve has built up around it that said you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing or even your first week it is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake however theres a method of this insanity in order survive in dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counterintuitive practice of killing your own ai units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities there are 102 dota 2 heroes and counting each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other for example riki is an melee agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible which is an obvious choice for most of new player however there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes this can be done by purchasing either a dust of apperance sentry wards or gem of true sight anyone can purschase these item during a game making the game more balanced in addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time in conclusion dota 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered it has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike league of legends and has an incredible longevity

ive been playing dota 1 since 2003 i switched to dota 2 a couple months ago from all my friends shifting over here is a short list of pros and cons that i have seen in dota 2 as opposed to dota 1 pros  better mechanics many heros function differently in dota 1 due to the restrictions of the warcraft 3 world editor  visually stimulating dota 2 has many ways to customize heros couriers wards animations and more  item drops as opposed to dota 1 even casual players can end up making some money just by playing  spectating  much easier for new players to learn due to the new system to help starting players  builds display on the item panel  has many events in which additional items can be earned  has an in game mic system as well as quick toggle phrases cons  currently doesnt have all the heros or neutral camps that dota 1 has  lacks some of the game modes of dota 1  surprisingly lacks some of the important mechanics of dota 1 the most notable one that i can pull off the top of my head is batriders napalm does not trigger any damage bonus on radiance  veil even when the threshold for doing so is met  servers tend to be down for a brief period of time after nearly every update  doesnt have as well of a language division as dota 1 i que us east and west with the language of english in dota 2 yet 13 games if not more will have another language i wouldnt even mind if it was something like spanish or french but i am getting everything from russian chinese portuguese ukraine korean japanese and many more that i cant even identify  double courier is a lot harder to use in dota 2 even with hotkeys and grouping i find this to take away from bottle crowing as well as make it harder for 2 farmers to get their items quickly for they will likely be on the opposite sides of the map even if they arent the offlane will still likely need it to get items to survive every game will only have 1 courier unless someone accidentally buys another neutral  dota 2 has much better pathing and makes it harder to get stuck on unpathable areas this makes sure you will never stupidly get stuck somewhere but also takes away from some hero abilities that do move other heroes or yourself  there is currently no public lobby system there is everything from private fiends guild etc but there is no way to host them publicly for anyone to join  your computer needs to be decent to run dota 2 at least 4 gb of ram and a decent graphics card is highly advised in conclusion dota 2 is definitely a f2p game that you should look into if you have yet to play any moba it may seem a bit difficult at first but it will grow on you to avoid the initial hate you may come across i advise having someone assist you with learning the basics or look up some tutorials online going into this game with absolutely no knowledge of how this game works is definitely not a good idea once you learn the game it can easily become the most enjoyable strategy game you have ever played

to fully illustrate what makes dota one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself dota has its roots as a warcraft 3 modification warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of hero units  units that actually gained experience points abilities and items as the game progresses this really made it feel like you had an investment in these units and you grew attached to them to a degree these hero units effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units became your avatar ingame it was a brilliant concept and dota took it a step further dota created a multiplayer mode that focused exclusively on playing these hero units  it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard rts format its one of the best examples of less is more than ive ever seen and that description hardly does it justice managing your individual hero and your income position on the map constant decision making and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game ive ever played ive yet to play any other multiplayer game where every member of your 5man team is crucial to your victory everyone must do their part and do it better than the other 5man team there are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5 and teamwork becomes a huge factor in the most intense and close games the level of immersion really cant be matched its hard to think of another game that draws you in more than dota especially when other people are counting on you to do well its a hectic stressful enormously complex and indepth experience  not to mention absurdly fun this is what keeps me coming back and id recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer if youre new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies or just want to watch some gameplay be sure to check out my youtube channel thanks for reading httpwwwyoutubecomuserjjmerrill

dota 2 is a fps developed by bungie in 1998 for the nintendo 64 its a game that presents itself as a point and click adventure similarly to the best game of the year 1010  new york times gone home you play a young lesbian trying to find love however the game presents multiple obstacles to keep you from achieveing your goal the obstacles are mostly stuns and supressions that every playable champ in the game has access to accept for surpressor who has access to a global ult that puts all his opponents into low prio but thats another story the game also has access to cool cosmetic items that give players direct access to their facebook allowing everyone to see how vibrant and colorful their language is when losing an mmorpg dota 2 is also an amazing language software on pare with rosetta stone that allows players to learn multiple languages including but not limited too russian mexican spanish burrito burrito taco ecceterra i would highly suggest this game to you and your friends despite it being so over priced at 8999 msrb it is worth every penny dota 2 is also the only good video game to come out in the last 28 years and will stay that way for years to come and thats how i spent my summer vacation  ferris bueller

league of legends is an oldtime strategy game developed in 1993 by tesco in collaboration with that guy from the indie game thing the game is very easy and beginner friendly clearly inspired by the gameplay mechanics of hey you pikachu in legend league the player adventures through maps known as legend lands in order to find all 7 bags of decomposed lamb the first team to get all 10 of the 33 bags is the winner the winning team is then awarded with a meat medal which can be spent at the ingame store in exchange for various trinkets and goodies such as oprah winfrey memoribilia and more copies of the game itself the graphics are really bad and clearly stolen from fortress craft look at this for example what the  is this  is that meant to be a fedora jesus christ sainsburys at least make an effort the character roster consists entirely of short humanoids wielding weapons that arent actually weapons for example this is just a midget covered in loo roll right nope its apparently meant to be a magical mummy creature ing political correctness the game revolves around the main character meaty m8 blaze it and follows him through his journey to save his wife and family from the evil ruler known as notch an optional hidden storyline can be unlocked after completing the game in which meaty m8 blaze it attempts to conquer europe and eradicate all minorities within it in conclusion its not as good as other fps games on the market but still worth buying i r8 it 88 m8

i play dota since it was a warcraft iii custom map more than 7 years i think the matchmaking in dota 1 was completelity random so you could not improve too much your skills playing pub games now past 2 years dota 2 has been released the matchmaking is much better their system wants you to win 50% and lose the other 50% i play dota more than 7 years but 90% i know about dota its because i improved and learned the past 2 years  pros > dota 2 have a steep daunting learning curve you cant just be a good dota 2 player with 100 games sometimes youll have to get tips with friends search strategies on google and watch competitive games this can be fun and challenging > its very fun when you play pub games with your friends and win the game otherwise heh > although its always the same map and objective theres a lot of combination and strategy plays you can do  more than 100 heroes > if you like mobarts game when you spend a lot of time in dota 2 and learn advanced plays youll not stop playing well i do not know if its a good or bad quality cons > dota 2 is a rts real time strategy 5x5 game so its very frustating when you play with people you do not like > it does not have a good tutorial explaining all the advanced plays youll have to learn by yourself or by a friend you can search on forums in the internet too > its very difficult in the beginning if you do not have patience and time it will be a very difficult game to enjoy

so after 781 hours of this game up until 81614 a lot of yelling by commendable teammates and dozens of items later i still enjoy this game previously with most games they get really repetitive and boring after about 200250 hours but dota 2 is not one of those kind of games i would recommend for others as this is an incredible moba but may be difficult to learn for the uneducated i would not recommend for others to procrastinate from schooluni work trust me i learnt the hard way all in all i give it a 1010 story time me sven 200 health probably should get back milkman ogre full ye probably should 3 enemies come from nowhere thinking im going to die anyway milkman dude get back now me na na na i got this i get triple kill mom and cleave really pays off me thats what i thought milkman speechless my advice the impossible is impossible unless the possibility of the impossibility is possible

dota 2 is a 5v5 game where you play on your own its automatically your teams fault for losing and remember it is never ever your own fault this is also a great game if youre looking for nicknames from your first day youll already get some cool nicknames like  noob and so on this game also lets you learn russian very easily all you have to do is click find match and its for free  but remember you dont have to speak english in here if thats not your main language just speak your own im sure itll be nice for your team a tip for when you play a hero with a big ultimate such as enigma magnus and all of those buy a blink and as soon as you see a good time to use it use it dont tell your team youre going to use your ultimate just do it and then blame your team afterwards for dying when they didnt go in with you also make sure to bring lots of food when you play dota 2 and share it with the enemy team feeders are greatly appreciated in this game if you are a russian or any person that doesnt want to speak english be sure to visit the english servers youll make lots of friends for sure when you play a game thats going back and forth and takes over 50 minutes be sure to say ez game gg noobs if you win if you end up losing just open all chat and say your team sucks and threw the game no matter what your own score is if an enemy or a teammate tries something but fails to kill anyone make sure to laugh in all chat and call them noobs then theyll say something like  1x1 be sure to accept its always fun to make nice friends when youre alone a tip for laning always take mid no matter which hero you are mid is mostly a solo lane so nobody to steal your exp or last hits never gank a side lane if theyre good theyll win the lane no matter which heroes they are up against if they lose their lane just call them noobs and say you can never gank because theyre always dead if you have 2 supports and 2 carries in your lane the best option would be to put the 2 supports on the safelane and carries on the hardlane if people go with you in a lane when you tell them not to just call them cykas and take all their last hits when playing a support hero make sure to take all the last hits on your lane a good support always takes last hits so he can buy support items early such as dagon or a maelstorm also make sure to tell your carries to buy the courier and wards a support cant afford to waste money on things like that he needs lots of farm to kill a hero just right click the enemy hero and let your carry do all the damage then when your carry dies and the enemy is low you can safely use your skills now because you are sure to get the kill 1010 would recommend never played a better game

ive played 70ish hours and heres my impression the game is quite good but the community is pure toxic waste you cant surrender or leave their games because their client punishes you so youre forced to play it out with the little gremlins i might quit if i cant find some regulars to queue with who arent so bad hasnt happened yet though i dont play much any more however ever want to have a teammate call you a lil  after you say hi ever want to farm for 20 minutes in the lategame because theres no stalemate breaking mechanic ever want to get cussed out for calling somebody out for bullying a teammate ever want to play with teams who will not speak to each other to save their lives except for insults ever want to leave a game filled with people like this but not want to deal with whatever punishment valve has come up with for leavers then it might be the game for you i really do wish it werent so since the game itself is otherwise great when its not crashing

best way to become and meet a heartless and cruel individual who enjoys inflicting suffering upon others specially if they are less skilled and experienced in addition murdering innocent bystanders as well as trees seems to be the trend while flaming teammates or opponents is another popular culture in the game but at the end of it all this game is all about channeling your innner hatred and getting all your frustration out on those who dares to press the find match button in around the same time as you all in all excellent gaming experience and obviously the best use of your time

this game is a petri dish an enviroment for which the vilest and most putrid of gamers can thrive and cultivate to their hearts content i walked into this world unsuspecting and walked right back out changed scarred by the soviet fires and new meta revolutions i would favour my eyes being scooped out viscously with one of those mcflurry spoons than spend further time drowning in this cesspool of a f2p game unfortunately i still need my eyes in order to investigate this growing red menace and further stop the vlads stalins and ivans from further infiltrating the steam network and send them right back to the ak47 mines from which they spawned terrible 910 joe mccarthy had the right idea

i dont get this game its like civilization every one picks one of the 108 country but its a 5v5 game the diplomatic exchanges with your team mates are limited because you can trade a limited amount of luxuries and you have to spend a big amount of gold to upgrade your country there is no research feature also the spying are realy limited as you can only place wards wich replace spys in this game on the map but they are usless they are city states but they just stand here and hit whats in range and never come to help you when you are far from them finaly there a only 3 era early mid and late but it dont change much the gameplay and some country are too op in the late era and you cant buy atomic bomb to nuke them 210 this game lacks a lot of content to pretend to be a civlizationlike

day in the life of dota 2 player wake up in the morning and think about playing some dota but instead prepare for school watch some famous players play dota the last few minutes you have before you leave get on the bus and fall asleep only to think about dota get to class and make murmurs here and there about dota and curses about noobs or matches you lost get random smiles throughout the day when you remember a really amazing match but sadly have nobody to share it with because all your friends play league get on the bus to get home and realize you have a lot of homework have to walk far from the bus to get home and play dota run like a mad man from bus stop to get home for dota have an argument with yourself on whether you should play dota or finish your project you have been putting off for dota play dota for only 1 match he says finishes at 10pm he does hate yourself because you didnt finish any work talk to any nondota friends and played 7 hours of dota cry yourself to sleep and wake up in the morning to do it again dota has essentially ruined my life i went onto the steam store to find a f2p game because i was always bored with hours of time i played stuff like warface and what not and i kept seeing this i had also heard about youtubers making jokes about the game so i figured why the heck not played the game once thats when the addiction started soon my hours of freetime reduced to minutes seconds sometimes i would stay up 3 hours later just to play more matches dont even think of making friends on here they only encourage you to play more dota has essentially taken my life away and i must say im ing loving it dota is love dota is life warning game causes following symptoms racism towards russians for reasons you dont even udnerstand insomnia anxiety high blood pressure low blood sugar malnutrition extreme levels of stress hyperventalation high amounts of giddyness and happyness extremem amounts of sadness rage and carpul tunnel worth it 1010

dota 2 is one of those games which cause a myriad of emotions youll love it and hate it all at the same time but that doesnt stop it from being the most competitive and professional esport games on the planet one of the first negative things youre going to encounter in dota 2 is the learning curve it isnt like most games it requires knowledge of many unique aspects and only after encountering every hero at least once will you start to get comfortable if you want to take dota 2 seriously or even casually prepare to invest a lot of time guides can of course cut this time substantially when you do learn to play you will be rewarded with one of the biggest feelings of accomplishment of any game you will feel like a god among men  but remember most people feel this and as such the dota community is one of arrogant and toxic tossers there are nice players but there are plenty of unpleasant ones if you want to play dota 2 properly you need to play with friends  or just learn to mute people overall dota 2 is a team game that is really hard to play casually you will either love it or hate it  but more often than not both at the same time
recommended
the best thing about dota 2 is its player vs player action the worst thing about dota 2 is its player vs player interaction

i ing hate that i like this game so much

dota 2 as we are entering the moba territory where the fan bases exist to the extremes i decided to test out all the moba games that i had access to which was league hon hots smite and demigod so that i tested out all games fairly and equally after playing them all i believe that dota 2 is probably the best moba out there if you like strategy and a more grownup moba game dota 2 does well with a focus on each hero being unique and each having their pros and cons to assist the team in their own special ways so this means that each match will never be the same due to the choices of heroes and peoples playstyles its developers and lead designer icefrog have a focus on balancing every hero on every major update and making sure that no hero is extremely overpowered the game follows valves concept of free to play games where the only thing up for purchase is cosmetics with nothing that will change or alter the gameplay the game also has item drops at the end of the matches but at the time of this review the drop rates were changed and its current nigh impossible to even get a single item the only issue i really see is the issue with some of the servers due to the outsourcing of servers to other companies and their locations so ill write down the list of servers that have issues that i know of sea location singapore eclub  its a gamble there is two servers and one is good and one is awful sometimes up sometimes down good luck japan location tokyo nexon  it doesnt exist yet they are holding it hostage for the past year us servers valve  they are currently using mail pigeon for packets west  seattle east  sterling russia stockholm   the server is perfectly fine the only issue is the distance from russia to stockholm causes increase latency  other than some of the server issues you can have loads of fun and you might even pick up the russian spanish portuguese or filipino languages dota is a quality gaming addiction and language learner 1010

it requires a lot of patience and teamwork other than that its an excellent game

tldr amazing prepare yourself for a dank adventure 1010 by playing this game you basically sell your soul to gabe newell aside being one of the best balanced moba arts games ever other features include > dota 2 offers a system called matchmaking that allows you to learn multiple foreign languages ranging from russian to chinese youll be learning c and  like it was 1 2 3 > for a fee ranging from bzz pugna bracers to dragonclaw hook you can customise any heros look except zeus so valve doesnt get sued by nintendo with virtual hats > owning and frequently playing dota 2 allows you to safely assume every other arts or moba in other languages such as lolspeak is inferior and therefore concluding that dota 2 is the best game of its genre interested in the dota master race go to redditcomrdotamasterrace now > a very balanced ranking system measured in mmr which is according to the majority of me mid players an accurate measurement of a players genitals however fear not as mmr experts from rdota2 claim that mmr is substanceless after the 6000 mark as matchmaking morphs full agility and matches you with players 2000 points below your rating and prepubescent children that bought a 5k account isnt that just great bored with the game no problem you can indulge in the world of dota without playing via a plethora of ways > you can participate in steam discussions where you can assume you know what youre talking about > go on reddit and discuss anything about dota whether its a thread about serious metagame discussion or a thread about arteezy tweeting about a thread about arteezy tweeting > or you could experience the pinnacle of human stupidity by participating in any popular dota streams twitch chat the persons chatting there offer a broad range of insight about the stream or the game in general be it  im lol fan and i have down syndrome     ___fissure_____ or the simple yet very concise 322 or feed disclaimer playing this game seriously may cause severe trauma lack of sleep heavy breathing and brain cancer if you go full tryhard contact your doctor immediately

this game creates an astonishing level of rivalry between two friends i was at the company of my friend whilst we played some jolly dota 2 when we was contacted by a wild russian then another and so forth we fealt threatened so i used all that i had in my power to fight back against the russian scourge with a twisted grin and keg of ale the dapper whale clicked report again and again on each russian within my grasp my grin was growing crooked now stretching across from cheek to cheek i began to laugh and squeal with delight at the power that was bestowed upon me imaging what i could do with this button first i will report the russians then america why stop there i might even attack china i had reported every teamate but one my friend with a wry smile and a cackle i whispered one utterance to my friend through a messenger pigeon called skype with a click and a report i felt that my work here was done and the game had lost all enterainment value for the day so i exited the game and now im in low prio for another ing week because i refused to play with russians because the language filter dosent ing work
not recommended
dota 2 one of the finest mobas to date from a background of starcraft lol and hon  without playing the original dota my expectations for it were slim as i refused to see what valve through dota could bring new to the genre however what i see in dota is a refined version of previous mobas with new strategic and tactical decisions rather than the spamming of all your skills hotkeys and your heroes auto attack what dota does is realise what items benefit you and your team as you try to destroy the enemys ancient also including a concept of denying your own creeps towers and items which adds a whole new dynamic to the game however what dota fails to achieve is consistency just like other mobas it updates and refreshes the game to keep players coming back but when this update is applied the game breaks down instead of growing stronger this includes the shutdown of all servers for hours or days with the odd chance you get into a match but fail to have good game as your ping is at 1000ms however for a daily shutdown every couple of months is the price to pay for a great time which has recently became free to play dotas community is also the most rewarding with players being able to become pro and play their favourite game for money to benefit acclaim fame it also allows designers to create customisables for heroes that can get into the game if it is voted up by the community itself however the community ingame can be irritating at first but you can make friends and have a laugh in conclusion with its small problems dota is my preferred moba and i will continue to play it until the apocalypse 910

what is dota 2  a welcoming community where everyone is so kind that they are even ready to take care of your relatives especially your dear mother  910 players are always ready to play with you  a very multicultural community it literally erases the borders between genders nations ages anything just like in real life you can meet foreigners anywhere  has a lot of minigames within such as king of the hill hot rapier a dota 2 version of hot potato hide and seek base race and many others  experienced players are always ready to teach you how to play always

if new to mobas one of the best mobas out there if not the best to make an unbiased opinion as a faithful dota player ever since the warcraft 3 custom map dota is hard to learn at first and expect other players to flame you if youre new and you join in the matchmaking fray if a friend of yours dragged you into this lifedraining game or if youre a girl most likely your boyfriend because he needs a support worry not there is a coaching system for new players to be guided by their steam friends and a very thorough tutorial at the start which i could not emphasise any more but to complete trust me it may seem like a long tutorial but after awhile youd realise that it really isnt as much and it was worth doing  plus it saves you from other players flaming you oh and always pick sniper sniper is life sniper is love or viper use viper if coming from league of legends its just like the lol 3lane 5v5 matchmaking map with different game modes which you should be familiar with after awhile unlike league of legends in dota 2 all the heroes are balanced ingame and no external bonuses are given to them if you buy cosmetics pay2win such as runes but they do make your heroes champions look good and gives you that good feeling that youre supporting the esports proscene here in dota 2 the metagame is similar jungling supporting wards carries towers turrets etc and youll learn these as you go by just as you did in lol in this game you also get to deny creeps minions heroes and towers to rob enemy heroes of their exp or possible gold and that in my opinion is a big quality which new loltodota2 transferees dont realise now unless youve been living under the rock like patrick youd realise that theres a huge hate factor between lol and dota 2 players just dont listen to them theyre immature a big difference between lol and dota 2s metagame is how lol relies more on skillshots while dota 2 relies on strategy  this youd agree upon if youre not like the immature fanboysfangirls of each side on the other note just give the game a shot seriously this review is an attempt to making an unbiased personal opinion on the game but however much someone tells you how good or bad a game is shouldnt affect your personal likes and dislikes although personally i would recommend this hope to welcome a new player to the dota 2 community soon and if you ever feel like raging  keep calm relax its just a game

there are alot to say about dota defenders of the ancientsits a remake of the old dota mod for warcraft actually i could say that the transition from dota>dota 2 gameplay was amazingthey didnt forgot a single thing and added even more than original dotathe game got amazingly cool graphics and a great soundtrackthe menu organisation are very simply and easy to understand to all new playersvalve really cares about your learning in dota2 so theyve made a learning page where they teach you how to play better by making you a recommendation of the best items dota 2 have in stores always recommended items for you to purchase for each herobecause dota 1 didnt had that optionso you need to now by your experience what to buythey have videos where they show you each skill of each hero and it doesif you also want you can play with tips in your game if you need more help and also ask a more professional player to teach you its called coachhe will spectate your game and make you tips the gameplay is amazingi love it because its very realistic and logic dota 2 got a lot of logicinstead mobas like lol dont havethe art of heroes are sorry but ill repeat itare amazingeverything is amazing in dota almost xd still dota got some problems that need to be corrected 1stthe communitydota 2 community is full of stupid noobish kidswho dont know how to play and dont even learn how to playand when you say them dont feed or other itemtheyll always say to you fucyounoobive fuc your mothertypical answer of russian 12 yo kids 2some updates that dont needed to be done like removing the pudge fountain hookbecause it had a lot of logicand they removed itbut nevermind to this 3i cant tell you if dota2 still got many bugs or notbut i notice that they still have a fewlike shop bug where you cant buy items 4serversi dont know why but its normal to have the servers down in dota2and sometimes in the game will appear searching for dota2 networkdont know why this happens but probably their servers cant hold so much peoplemy opinion so yeah thats pretty what ive wrotei hope you play this game and like it and enjoy as i do good luck & have fun

dota 2 is a fastpaced first person shooter with some rpg elements mixed in in all my years of playing indie games i have never seen a better real time strategy game for a space travel simulator its lacking in rocketships but overall it is one of the greatest zombie survival game on the market if you could possibly desire a better game then you should think about purchasing drake of the 99 dragons both it and dota 2 share many similarites

i love this game  especially when there are events and bonus xp  reccomended to all of my friends some of tham started to play  my favorite heroes are supports who are nuckers and pushers  i highly reccomend this game to people of different types  for tanky natures  for passive and for aggresisive players  for those who love strategy and enjoy teamfights

i used to be a healthy and contributing member of society until i encountered dota 2 the moment i started playing it i thought to myself wow this is it the game that will finally do what no other can i was right ever since i played dota 2 my family has disowned me i lost my job my girlfriend dumped me and i was left by my dog instead of talking civilly to other human beings like i used to i now simply scream expletives at them without even looking i no longer have to remember purposeless numerics such as my social security number my cellphone number my age and even the number of children i have before i played dota 2 i thought i can measure my lifes worth with useless factors such as my income quality of living or contribution to society but now i know the truth and realize how foolish i was dota 2 taught me the true meaning of living that is ones mmr the one thing that separates 7k gods from other 1k scrub trash after dota 2 i have never looked at life the same way again 1010

how to properly play the game step 1 open dota 2 and jump straight into matchmaking in russia it is multifunctional as you can learn dota 2 and russian racial slurs step 2 pick the coolest looking character you can find step 3 after you picked meepo head to the middle lane step 4 die to the enemy it shall boost their morale to make them more reckless step 5 keep dying it probably will pay off step 6 at the 15 minute mark buy the courier that everybody has been swearing about step 7 click on the courier step 8 aha you clicked on the courier now you will forever be a donkey in the midst of your confusion bravely clop to the battlefield step 9 after much wtf blame the support for being a noob to keep your reputation intact step 10 after you lost the match head towards to the store and buy everything you can to improve cooler looking stuff should probably buff your character right step 11 get mistaken for a pro due to your accessories step 12 repeat steps 4 5 9 and 10 until you lose your soul step 13 sue valve to calm your emotional distress

a great game filled with action and strategy takes a very long time to learn longer to master after 700 hours i still cant play each hero and havent mastered quite all of the advanced mechanics you must play this game for 50100 hours before you can even think about deciding if its a game for you it is very competetive and sensitive people will not enjoy it you will be insulted a lot if you get to a high lvl and have played many matches like me you wont be paired up with peruvians or russian quite as much but at the beginning there will be someone who doesnt speak english in a us english server and they will most likely suck and lose the game for you there will be heros that will wreck you every game until you and those idiots you call allies learn how to play against them even after all the hardships im still playing this game those 700 hours i found this game 6 months ago 500 of those hours only on the weekends even with school its a fun game but people suck enjoy

as a newbish moba player i have to say dota 2 is an excellent game i learned most of the basics of mobas through it the tutorials are well made thank you valve the heros are interesting and well made and the way you can customize them through items you can buy from the store or steam marketplace the community is mostly not toxic and ive enjoyed it as most of nonmoba players whine about it being repetitive its not there are a lot of different teams of heros you can have in a match just like in league of legends i guess you thought that i wont talk about league of legends you were wrong both games have their own unique that might have some similarities championsheros both have the same type of map layout which is what i like both are free to play and fun to play dota 2 might have some things that might make it more harder to master but practice makes you better couldnt we all just play our own games and not fight about which one is better both have their good and bad parts i give this game an 810

when i began high school i chose to study russian as my second language however the language is very hard to master with complicated grammar and pronunciations during my first year in school i only could reach a d in grade later on my teatcher gave me tips to improve myself in russian she told me that next years course will be much harder and that i have to come in contact with the language on a daily basis to improve my russian knowing that i like video games she recommended me to play a game she usually plays in russia everyone plays dota 2 she said obviously i could not really belive that the whole russian population plays a single game but if the solution to my grade was video games i would not complain desperate for anything to help my grade i gave dota 2 a chance i loaded up on the russian server but all i found where a german open mic stack where talking to each other it was very courious how could possibly find no russians on their own server the following day i told my teatcher about my problem frankly i was more than surprised by her answer oh dont you know russians allways only play on the eu west server she said laughingly now this this truly seemed like a mystery worth investigating why are russians not playing on their own server the answer i recieved from my teatcher made me only more confused there seems not to exist an acceptable answer i have tried to answer this question later on in life in my masters dissertation but its no use finding an acceptable answer to that question is like finding the meaning of life anyway if you could ignore this issue and proceed with playing on eu west you will improve your russian greatly like i did everyday after schooli played dota 2 on eu west with each game my understanding for this complex game increased aswell as my russian language skills thanks to dota 2 i have gotten a chanse to come across russian in both speech and writing this game is really spectacular if you like me want to become better at russian and have the time to play it as for my grades in russian i recived a b in 2 grade and a in my third when i started to spend a lot of time on dota 2

ive never really take the time to try and learn this game but i hear from everyone its a great game so i guess ill take their word on it and recommend it myself
recommended
ill rate this game 1110 since i am genuinely attracted to this kind of game alone  i was 4 years old since i was playing dota and warcraft the expansion pack too dota in that day was kinda rubbish but it has its unique style of playing aside from the game itself just been copied from another map dota2 is pretty much has introduced the new selection og games style plus the game itself is packed up with good allocations and good formation but sadly other players tend to be salty and act like a boss but i dont care almost all games has all those player i or you could be one of them depending on the matter of discussion graphics are epic and the game style is hyper y decent game indeed

ive played this game since it was a mod for warcraft and i have to say its one of my favorite games however much like tf2 it has its fair share of problems for starters this game has a stupidly high learning curve theres no one true way to play any of the 100 heroes and it can get very frustrating very fast trying to find what you can easily work with for any of them with the gigantic selection of items other than a small pool of heroes that im confident enough with to pick on a regular basis the largest part of the roster is alien to me with my success {or lack thereof which is normally the case} depending largely on the skill level of the enemy team and my teammates which brings us to the next point 90% of the people who play this game are stupid now i dont claim to be good at this im slightly above average at best however its hard to play on anything outside of solo bot servers when youre constantly thrown in with stupid people first timers people who dont speak the server regions language people who are only there to prance around in costumes or dont want to follow simple ordersuse common sense or any combination of the above meanwhile you can rest assured that your opponents will almost always have their act together and be an unstoppable force that you futilely try to at least hinder which is made even harder when your teammates insist on throwing themselves into unwinnable battles further feeding them until the point where theres a 10 level gap between you and the lowest leveled enemy on the other hand you might go up against a team thats super bad as in its a game that lasts less than 20 minutes in which case youve learned nothing and your time is wasted just as thoroughly as it would be against people out of your league or on the occasion that you get teammates that know what theyre doing you can expect them to whine about your choice of hero your starting itemsabilities your lane choice or god forbid your costume at which point 910 of these people will purposefully feed the enemy or go afk and then either rage quit or stop when youve ceased your apparently unforgivable behavior or they might report you to try and get you thrown into low priority which is dotas equivalent of hell and unlike tf2 you cant just drop out whenever you wish without taking a heavy penalty for doing so so have fun being in matches where there will be almost no fun a majority of the time now there is a report system which in theory is supposed to shoo away the vermin that dont need to be playing this in the first place in practice its horribly broken due to being automated doing amazingly good but youre the odd man out in a peruvian 4 stack that youve somehow managed to offend expect to have the low priority message pop up when you exit to the menu after the match or maybe you want to report that 025 treant that refused to do his job and started purposely dying to feed the enemy the entire server could report him but he could still easily slip through without getting lp in all seriousness its down to luck if it does work when you want it to and doesnt when its being abused up next hero balance thankfully this isnt quite as bad as it could be but there is still silliness here and there some heroes have one or two overpowered abilities while others are all around unbalanced and others still are in sore need of buffing at the same time some heroes are nicely balanced but are easily outclassed by other heroes who can perform the same role only much better and easier why pick legion commander and eventually out damage the enemy team using skill when you can pick ursa and out damage them from level 3 onwards and rarely have to press more than one button why pick weaver and alternate between your 2 escapes when you can pick storm spirit and have an escape with no cooldown why pick centaur warrunner to be durable when you can pick axe and not only be durable but be so durable the lane gets locked down for your enemy theres tons of examples like this also youll see some heroes almost every match {pudge sniper zeus who all have skills that can be more or less mindlessly spammedhave low risk high reward play styles} but lots are seen either rarely or rarely outside of comp play {io meepo dark seer who all take some degree of skillhave high risk decent reward play styles} what it sadly boils down to is why play a hero where you have more than 1 button to press and risk being overwhelmed but have a more rewarding experience when you can pick a hero that more or less does the same thing but with less complexity as with tf2 valve is slowly but surely turning this into another hat simulator i played a ton of the original dota and i sure dont remember any customization because that would have been silly this game is hard enough without being distracted by someones super pimped out loadout or worrying if youre going to get a nice drop {if any only 23 people usually get drops at the end of the round} the main problem with character customization though is that much like tf2 it attracts half wits that only want to play the super easy classes and dress them up then look down on everyone else who isnt wearing a 20c wolf hat yeah take your little wolf hat into a ranked match see how they like it also like tf2 valve focuses more on cosmetic items than the game itself which started off small but in recent months has led to them 1 canceling popular game modes in order to {in their own words} focus more on cosmetic sets 2 building entire game modes around expensive sets {although in fairness said sets only enhanced the modestracked stats for them but still} or just flat out making new modes pay to win {the year beast brawl was p2w to the point that disgusting amounts of money and cheap tactics trumped genuine skill almost 100% of the time} 3 doing inane things like changing the perfectly fine models of heroes and then using that as an excuse to make more money {shadow fiends model was just fine but then he got a redesign that looked like an angsty 12 year old made it and a $35 cosmetic that looked like an even more angsty 10 year old designed it} 4 possibly the worst outright ignoring critical server issues to focus on cosmetic item bugs overall the game would be greatly improved if valve would do the following things 1 mandatory region locking for everyone to heavily cut down on the language barrier 2 a proper {and required} tutorial for new players 3 rather than adding new cosmetics every week finally adding the remaining heroes from the mod as well as much needed balancing for all the heroes as fun as this game is i reccomend it to no one other than someone willing to go through absolute misery to occasionally have fun

ill rate this game 1110 since i am genuinely attracted to this kind of game alone  i was 4 years old since i was playing dota and warcraft the expansion pack too dota in that day was kinda rubbish but it has its unique style of playing aside from the game itself just been copied from another map dota2 is pretty much has introduced the new selection og games style plus the game itself is packed up with good allocations and good formation but sadly other players tend to be salty and act like a boss but i dont care almost all games has all those player i or you could be one of them depending on the matter of discussion graphics are epic and the game style is hyper y decent game indeed

simple addictive cruel intensive bizarre an incredibly deep rewarding multiplayer experience while the original was one of the best games ive ever played im happy to report this sequel is better in every single way possible played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide dota 2 is what every other moba is trying to achieve if you play league of legends stop playing that and play this the supreme moba and my favorite game of 2013 full article here httpwwwlivepixeltvchristopherstop10gamesof2013

dota 2 is probably tied with call of duty for the best online multiplayer indie anime game the people who made this game knew what they needed to do to make this into the great game that it is today i have about 3 hours on this game and i can tell you those were the best 3 hours of my life the great thing about this game is the friendly community i remember after a match the person on the opposite team said i was a  i assumed that was the german word for gg all and all i reccomend this game to any one who loves a game with a good campaign and story and remember to say  after every dota 2 match

amazing but russia just russia pray to god that you do not get put with russians who play on the europe west server

is dota 2 better than league of legends not better but something different both games have many similarities but also some differences in the way of playing hardcore fans of the original wacraft 3modifkation defense of the ancients definitely feel at home because dota 2 is practically only a technical remake of its predecessor but even those who have over the years played league of legends tired and looking for a new challenge in the genre will find pleasure in the game genre newbies may take a look of course especially since dota 2 is free2play beginners should expect frustration moments when it comes to first games against human opponents but despite the solid tutorials only if some experienced players come equal to each other unfolds dota 2 its full potential fun for me dota 2 is the best moba and with his multitude of heroes and revised engine significantly better than the outdated league of legends in addition i think that dota in work with steam will become more and more players with the time caution makes you addicted to more 97100
recommended
dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle area moba game with a huge community and fanbase this game takes the players handtoeye coordination decision making reaction time and teamwork and puts it to the test in a 5 vs 5 situation unlike most of the moba games on the market dota 2 is free of charge from the beginning with no money ingame or real money being spent to unlock playable characters meaning players do not have an advantage over others on the choices they have and its easier for beginners to get to know a hero however this game does have a rather steep learning cliff similar to a learning curve but instead of gradually learning it takes some time then the game snaps into focus for you and you become pretty good and then its a normal learning curve from there on there are a few issues with the levels of toxicity of some of the players but overall this is a good game higly addictive though and youll probably end up being glued to the screen for hours on end
recommended
ill give a thumbs up only because the game itself is pretty good but this is not an actual review its more like a short summary about my over 900 hours spent into this game lol n00b cant write  until 2kh noob i started playing it because my friends convinced me and because almost everybody in the forum i post on play this so i started playing it both with my friends and solo today at the end of my very last matchwhich i lost i realized that i have never had fun in this game i mean out of 900 hours i can only remember like 78 really funny moments where i actually laughed oh the irony of fate the very last laugh was in my very last match i was earthshaker top dire in lane with warlock against death prophet and batrider we got first blood like 10 seconds after the 0000 mark i spotted dp warding our jungle i used fissure to block her escape way and warlock used shadow word while we were aa her she started to move left and right like she didnt know what to do it looked like she was dancing and it reminded me of that case of mass hysteria happening around the early xvi century in france where several people started dancing uncontrollably for weeks until they diedyes i know my interests are ed up and that actually made me laugh that to me was a funny moment not the quick first blood not the 2 more kills we did on bat in the next couple of minutes warlock got all of them btw but the fact that dp started dancing while we were beating her up this made me think a little but only for a couple of seconds theres a game to win here guys focus theres very little to say about what happened next the typical things that usually happen in a bad unranked 0 mmr trench  tier match me without blink until 2500 our drow disconnecting and abandoned cause of pc problems lina with aghanim and no meka wards only for half matchim guilty of it too we lost roshan two times over 20 kills of difference for the radiants lina and storm spirit arguing with each other calling names your mama did this your fatha did that your sista lul  dont evel let me start on that one and so on at the very end of the match we hid in the fountain waiting for them to ff gg wp ez qq m8s ecc and in that moment reading the argue between lina and storm i asked myself some questions am i having fun is this game making me laugh how many funny moments i can remember about this game is that normal that to me every single match ive done looks exactly the same as the otherslul of cuz yes u ing <2kh scum n00b the answers to the questions were no no not even 10 i dont know in that instant i realized that this game to me was just a gigantic waste of time how many times have i actually enjoyed what was going on on screen why am i taking this so seriously why do i want to win so desperately why do my teammates want to win so desperately  how many times have i smiled while playing this game  these are not pro player matches we play we are earning nothing from this theres no need to yell at each other this makes me sad ive heard yelling my whole life i play games because they help me forget about how life is hard to relax and laugh at the hundreds and hundreds of funny silly nonsense moments this beautiful piece of software can gift me games really help me they help me a lot please guys stop dont get mad im serious this is a game right games are meant to be fun please stop arguing we lost a videogame its not the end of the world next time you will win we will all win  and even if you dont who cares its just a videogame enjoy the little things you can get out of it remember dp dancing to death wasnt that fun remember pudge denying himself after we wasted literally all we got at him and then the radiants team wiped us yes we lost money and experience but wasnt that kinda fun sorta fun even a little bit yes we lost this match but cmon dont hide in the fountain lets do something silly to them lets annoy them storm use your ulti to get near them and then immediately go back in the fountain lets watch them throwing everything at you in the attempt of catching you isnt that fun d <<storm>> <<storm>> <<storm are you listening to me storm are you still arguing with lina because of her aghanim she made a mistake everybody makes mistakes there is no need to take it personally now she knows that aghanim is a nono shes got it now just chill out man its a game>> d slap << o bbut

a slower version of the hit moba league of legends dota 2 seems to have more consistency between heros as to what works and what doesnt its map is much larger and allows for more juke spots and places to farm safely the game is a welcome sequel to everyones battlenet favorite dota not recomended to newer moba players but for those who have played league and found the game too fast too simple or too hard to come back from when behind this is a great game those who enjoyed s1 and s2 league where boots were one of the earliest items you got and many champions were unforgiving will enjoy that feel once again in dota 2 this game has a very wide pool of itemization for all roles although it still suffers from gold starved supports like most mobas i would say that this game is a moba for those who have already learned the basics in other mobas and are ready to try something a bit slower but more complex bugs balence issues etc are dealt with in a very timley manner which allows for stable gameplay i think this game has sucked away my soul more than my wife and that is saying something i give this game a 9410

rank 910 recommendations play some rts games before play other valve games as well major theme serious gameplay to be found here with valves item system bought at price $0  beta test put it this way i have over a thousand hours in this title for a reason something always brings me back to it it has even elapsed my hours in counterstrike somehow what is it exactly that keeps bringing me back here first off this game is of the moba breed it isnt an rts fps or even mmorpg its roots are from warcraft iii and other rts games someone brought these games out of the shadows and gave them an overhaul you have probably heard about lol being league of legends the most direct competitor with dota 2 not getting into the whole thing simply put dota 2 is more hardcore and punishing than league of legends while still providing a fun and inviting atmosphere this i can say with certainty because i have played both titles in their infency valve is known for their work theres obvious reasons for this they dont scam you out of your money coughcougheacoughcough but rather let you spend money items are cosmetic and you dont really have to participate in trading collecting or even buying anything in dota 2 just like team fortress 2 all items are random drops at the end of a game  which can be from 20 minutes to 90 some odd minutes just like other valve games they are best played with friends reasoning being that you know how they play and they know how you play enjoyment can come from winning but i think it comes more from a collective win where everyone felt like they did something to win this is more obivous in the matchmaking in ranked play unranked seems to be all over the place but with ranked you play with players of like skill plus this is the only game i can think of where pausing a multiplayer game works more than half the time graphics arent a huge thing here they can be scaled down quite well but be expected to run a reasonable setup this isnt half life 1 or 2 in terms of system requirements ive managed to get it running on my laptop which says something overall like ive said before theres solid good reasons to play and continue playing dota 2 since the title is free hop on and try it out

a game where the other team of russians are better than your left over unwanted few russians that any command equals them sprinting to the front lines alone also teaches the fact of how brutal and cold the internet is no remorce for trying to have fun in a game no effort from teammates to make any single move or to communicate other than when you die once your team will all become the most social members all to chip in a report for your feeding but this game still finds its way back on to my computer

okay i recommend and do not recommend at the same time why i recommend  its a valve game come on people  the training missions are good i put 2 hours into them  its freaking free  just get it if youre looking for a random game to play why i do no recommend  it just sucks  i am not the kind of person to play this game  i like campaigns not massively multiplayer stuff

dota 2 is one of the most addictive games i have ever played as you can see by my hours i managed to achieve nothing in life over the course of 1100 hours however with these hours i have learned a lot about the game like for instance if you ever meet people from bali theyre like some of the coolest people you can meet if you meet an american sounding indian you will find one of the funnest s i have met if you meet and angry japanese boy that kid is tigha stay away from him at all possible this game overall is a battle between pinoys and the world well as far as the south east asian server is concerned pinoys are at constant odds with everyone else in the game they seem to live in a world where when they do worse than you you are the noob very intresting philosophy by them the dota community has something that we can all learn if you talk  you will get hit this has been demonstrated many times over the course of my dota career and of course if someone instantly calls mid you have already lost overall this game has brought me to tears both happy and sad even though i sometimes hate this game i always come back for more 75413 lucky charm marshmallows

rank 910 recommendations play some rts games before play other valve games as well major theme serious gameplay to be found here with valves item system bought at price $0  beta test put it this way i have over a thousand hours in this title for a reason something always brings me back to it it has even elapsed my hours in counterstrike somehow what is it exactly that keeps bringing me back here first off this game is of the moba breed it isnt an rts fps or even mmorpg its roots are from warcraft iii and other rts games someone brought these games out of the shadows and gave them an overhaul you have probably heard about lol being league of legends the most direct competitor with dota 2 not getting into the whole thing simply put dota 2 is more hardcore and punishing than league of legends while still providing a fun and inviting atmosphere this i can say with certainty because i have played both titles in their infency valve is known for their work theres obvious reasons for this they dont scam you out of your money coughcougheacoughcough but rather let you spend money items are cosmetic and you dont really have to participate in trading collecting or even buying anything in dota 2 just like team fortress 2 all items are random drops at the end of a game  which can be from 20 minutes to 90 some odd minutes just like other valve games they are best played with friends reasoning being that you know how they play and they know how you play enjoyment can come from winning but i think it comes more from a collective win where everyone felt like they did something to win this is more obivous in the matchmaking in ranked play unranked seems to be all over the place but with ranked you play with players of like skill plus this is the only game i can think of where pausing a multiplayer game works more than half the time graphics arent a huge thing here they can be scaled down quite well but be expected to run a reasonable setup this isnt half life 1 or 2 in terms of system requirements ive managed to get it running on my laptop which says something overall like ive said before theres solid good reasons to play and continue playing dota 2 since the title is free hop on and try it out

i came from the world of fps and i barely know the mechanics of dota when i started this game will consume your stamina but you will keep on playing it ive been reported for a few times due to afk i wasnt really afk i fell asleep on my desk pros  taught me more about team work this is meta gaming you cant win without good team work  taught me different languages doesnt matter if its a bad word a newly learned word is knowledge lol  i became logical in a way yeah  good game to combat depression or any negative feeling no need to take meds this is your medicine lmao cons  i always end up doing impulse buying whenever a set is on sale  sleepless nights @@  goodbye social life advises 1 please do not use vladimirs offering if your hero is sniper 2 if the tower is attacking your hero hit a friendly creep around and the tower will stop attacking you 3 never deny an aegis

just like realtime chess but everyone is a queen some queens shoot lasers some summon huge golems and some sing so hard your eardrums burst dota 2 is definitely one of the best games of this generation and im certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come graphics 8510 very pretty the art direction in dota 2 is one of the best the source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster and have it look great too cosmetics look great and fit perfectly with some exceptionsim looking at you alpine ursa but many stay true to the heros artstyle sound 9510 all heros have a multitude of voice linesand some even respond to one another eg tidehunters hatred for kunnka if you find the default anouncer not too flash theres a huge variety of optional packs from the smoth talking narrator from bastion to the harsh condescending tone of pyrion flax gameplay 1010 the big one theres a reason dota allstars got so popular not just from the incredible passsion from the community or the dedication of icefrog and co but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres from perfectly coordinating a fountain hook to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as storm spirit no other genre rivals dota 2 outstanding strategic gameplay and nearvertical learning curve at the time of writing i have 7469 hours played and ive only just scratched the surface in the combos stratagy and 107 availble heros to use it takes year of hard work dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is dota 2  beardattack @ fren

this game is simply the most thrilling game i have ever played the combantion of the complex mechanics and the team based gamplay make this one of the best games to play with friends however this game has many many side effects such as trash talking anybody on your and the enemy teams lose alot of sleep any money that you have will be spent on usless cosmetics such as skins hudskins and announcers you will not eat any food as dota is more important you will learn to hate every member of your team or the enemy team that is from eastern europe mostly the russians as they suck balls at dota everybody else on your team will apear worse than you and you will want to kill them with a blunt object these are just some of the reason to play the amazing game that is dota 2
recommended
first of all dota is the best game i have ever played before im going into details i just have to say that i recommend the game for everyone it can be fun and challenging and it is mostly very well balanced compare to other game of this genre positive its free to play and not pay to win there are like over 110 heroes to choose and everyone got its own special play style its a very great game to play with friends the game is based on high skill sometimes a bit luck and of course on teamplay the game has a never give up effect once you started to play dota 2 you wont every be able to stop playing it the workshop adds nice new thing into the game like skins made for fans by fans there are many cool gamemodes the competitive scence is very fun to watch and you can learn very much from the pros there are many reallife events based on dota 2 like the ti the game never gets boring its like a passion negative lets be honest the community there are so many arrogant and  people in dota 2 that sometimes its just make me wanna cry and thats of course very brutal for noobs but i have to say just move on and play ignore these stupid players in my perspective dota 2 is very well balanced but there are still heroes who are just too strong and broke which can frustrate hard language problems there are like in every game some russians who think they can freely write russian in the chat although its an english server i think thats unrespectful towards the people who actually write english although they are also from other countries besides russia like me pauses seriously these unpauses s everyone up and nobody is able to wait for like 3 minutes  my rating for dota 2 would be 95 out of 100 thats all from me hope you enjoyed my review and see ya

i highly recommend this over its competitor rosetta stone while rosetta stone promised adaptive learning social sharing and community learning i found dota 2 to be a much better product in terms of cultural exposure and hands on training unlike rosetta stone dota 2 matches you up with real spanishspeakers russianspeakers or dirty pinoys that are fresh off the boat and ready to help you delve into their ethnic practices and language as an english speaker i learned the peruvian dialect of spanish in less than 3 months solely playing dota 2 for an hour a day i highly recommend this game as we say in spanish jajajajajaj gringo noob la  madre concha tu madre idiota hijo de la gran  calla csm que huevon eres pajero de  l jajajajaj xddd

gameplay  910 as you begin to play this gameyoure given a tutorial on how the gameplay works as you finish completing the tutorial you would have options to either play with bots or with online players there is a wide variety of modes to choose from all of the heroes are unlocked from the start so you dont have to unlock them one by one like any other moba game each heroes have their own specific roles so choose wisely and dont anyhow go whatever you feel like there is no ingame money in this game and you earned different rewards as you play many matches there is a lore for you to read for each character if youre interested however these game have a steep leaning curve and those who are new to moba genre will struggle how the gameplay system work it require a lot of tactics & teamwork in order to win a matchthat is if your partner will listen to you cause a lot of player i found will quickly rage at you if you make a minor issue while some other just rage quit because they felt like they cannot make a comeback a lot of heroes are memorable mainly because sometimes you would see those heroes interact with one another depending if they are rival or allied graphics  9510 this is one of the best looking moba games i ever seen the environmentcharacter details and the visual are neatly done some skills are pretty to look at and the particle look awesome despite only having one map available to play onlyyou wont get sick of looking at it just because the details they put into those maps are amazing did i not mention it also featured day & night time as well  these feature sometimes grant a huge benefit to specific heroes audio  9510 icefrog did really well with the sound effects a lot of the heroes skills are jawdropping due to how pleasing and awesome it sound while there is only a few music in the gamei wasnt bothered much because of how great the sound effects are voice acting is pretty well done too and none of them want to make you block your ear because of how horrible it sounds longlasting appeal  9510 i would say that this game have a lot going on even though you keep playing the same map or heroes every match offered some sort of challenge mainly because you have against other players that have better skills than you there is some crazy modes to choose from if you bored playing normal match by leveling upyou unlock certain gears which you can use to customize your heroes appearance and many different more modes there is a compendium where you able to complete numerous challenge which gives you compendium points if you gain more compendium pointsyou level up your compendium from there you able to gain numerous bootsitemscourier and many more final verdict  9410 to those who want a challenging moba games and not too noobfriendlythen this is the right game for you i spent quite a lot of time playing this game and it a really an enjoyable experience bewarethe community like any moba games are the worst i ever seen you would find people trash talking at youraging at you and even people that like to troll the game seem to have a lot of server issue also which can be extremely frustrating when you almost win a match nevertheless the game is really great also play with bots if you hate playing with d0uchebag because you gonna encounter a lot of them grade  a  excellent

dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena moba for short in dota 2 is a pure freetoplay game which means that you dont have to unlock heroes maps or other stuff the only way to be good at dota 2 is to know the game you need to know every single item and hero to become a really good player and thats the reason i like this game so much however this can be a problem for new players you dont know anything about the game when you spawn in your base with 4 teammates

very good game 910 probably the best moba i have ever played 10x better than league of losers all the heroes are free of course no paying involved the only thing you can pay for is skins and accesories which does nothing except give your hero a different look although heroes are cheap as people say this is not completely true every hero in the game is counterable and yes that means sniper the game entirely depends on teamwork to win the match and skill as well one hero cannot win you the game note 2 heros may be able to win the game with previous experiences pros  all heroes are free  skins and accesories are fairly cheap  lots of playable heroes  unique game modes  nice community with lots of friendly players  good report system  most of the heroes require some amount of skill  frequent updates and patches  voice chat very helpful when communicating with teamates cons  players neglect lane calling  players base lanes on what hero you go  extremely buffed heroes ex phantom assasin templar assasin axe  no extreme buffs for heroes that require skill to play  poorly balanced heroes would i suggest this game i would highly suggest this game to anyone who likes f2p mobas 910

this game is enormously screwed it has no hope the community of this game is most awful thing i saw in centuries its impossible to confront a thousands of idiots that u have given by the mmr system by the way popular rating system that doesnt work completely its pure luck if u had a good team or if u even have a good team there is always 1 idiot who try to ruin it on purpose or on accident dont even try to install this game i spent almost 2300 hours playing this  until realised how awfully made it was the low priority ban doesnt work to search and punish all the idiots for their mistakes or pranks the mmr system always finds you teammates not matched your skill and their skill comparatively if u want to waste ur time for nothing go on and take it you will regret this whole time and u may like it in the first time until u will realise all things that i wrote up in that review my english may not be good but i sent my message to you all if you already playing this game please dont spent money on this  other good games need your support not the volvo machine that consumes only money not positive feedbacks about their multiplayer games lately thx volvo for a great game i think you should send this game to alpha cuz its broken hard

this is truly a masterpiece of gaming naughty dogs latest title and their first foray into the firstperson shooter genre is without a doubt a dazzling success drumstick of the albatross 2 codesigned by gabe newell and david phreak turley has everything hundreds of weapons to choose from an enormous array of materials obtainable to build ones own home base and three different unlockable character models at the low price of $599 each booster packs are an amazing addition allowing ones character and mount to be personalized even further but where dota 2 really shines is in its gameplay the tight control scheme designed exclusively for the steam controller allows a seemingly seamless interface between man and machineyou are the character the experience of battling with enemy mechs upclose and personal is unrivalled by any game especially with the advanced mango physics overall i would rate dota 2 a 9810 experience its only flaw is the slight lack of purchasable paytowin content that i usually rely on to make my gaming experiences successful id love to see a dota 3 especially if zynga takes a note out of blizzards book and makes the game dozens of times easier for paying customers to succeed at pvp

this is a short story about a player named karl and his experience with dota 2 there once was a time long ago when karl played games expecting no help from the team he chose snowball heroes his mmr rose there was a certain joy in his victories no matter how badly his team did then after long nights of 1v5 he thought to himself i wonder how it would be if i played with those other four russians for a week he tried to help lead others into the light of smart plays excelent ward placement and proper item choices he led by example keeping the games close through the midgame but when the late game struck and the enemies bkbs were built the team he spent the past thirty minutes of his life guiding and supporting were not there they were not there when the bottom rax fell they were not there when the ward spotted the radiant attempt on roshans life they were not there when the mid rax was taken they were farming chasing illusions and supports when the time came when the last set of rax seemed doomed to fall they came in came my four hard carries like the lost children of a single mother they came to defend my home from the void they had spent so much time farming and leaving the fighting to me that they hadnt a clue how to fight together the four of them died a horrible death only killing a crystal maiden they saw on their way back to the base why do i tell you this tale because there is a moral to the story never play a support to climb the mmr bracket it only leaves you heart broken and 25mmr less 1010 would carry again

one of the most addictive games i have played so far yes i have the greed of drops no lying but this one is just kickass d different heroes their abilities and the items <3 heroes range from funny to creepy d  okay for those who will start new there are a few things just dont ignore the tutorial its boring at first but really important and do ask you friends while in game which item is good for which hero and go for easy heroes at first like rikki or razor dont wish to make lots of kills at first just hang around your friends and towers and defend its generally a helping community start making friends when you understand the game better to make a team for when you have to play ranked matches people do say go after the recommended items and its right for when you start playing first but after that every item has an detailed explanation just go through them and with your gut feeling because it doesnt matter what skills the heroes have what matters is how you use their skills and no one knows it better than you yourself

this game is fun and entertaining if you actule have teammates to play with do not play this game solo you will get crushed by partys from opposing team who know how to make combinations with heros but that is not the worst part of this game the worst part is the fact that you will most likely get teamed up with russain players or spanish who are uncapable of speaking english language at all i have spent two years in this game trying to find one or two good teammates but all i found in this game is non english speaking teammates who keep kill stealing and blameing others for their own mistake this game is no fun for me its real pain filled with anger and haitred

its a wonderful yet brutal experience which leaves you with a strange lovehate feeling for it like any worth while relationship does for veterans from warcraft 3 mod days will fell quite nostalgic and really appreciate the up scaling done to the game newcomers will still have a sense of how detailed the game is both graphically and game mechanics wise at its core its an rpg through and through with leveling systems items and fixed hero abilities the community still needs to grow in terms of mannerism but anyone with thick skin can power through the nasties which arent that many anyway

a fantastic multiplayer experience this game is deeply complex with its metagame and many strategies a team can employ the community is not as toxic as many say it is yes there are the few rude obnoxious and annoying players but that is true for all multiplayer games there are many ways to play such as the carry support nuker initiator and jungler these roles all have their place in this game and there is something for everyone pros  complex but easy to get into  many ways to play  relies on teamwork  great esport community  100% free  nice aesthetic  many heroes to choose from  great ui  very rare glitches  dota tv  metagame cons  a little difficult to get into  players not playing on thier regions server  first few hours are not very fun  occasionally takes a while to join a game
recommended
yeah cause this game is very good to people

i was jungling chaos knight one afternoon racking up the six figure kill spree when i had an epiphany after about 3 matches youve seen it all this is a painfully simple game that offers no challenge whatsoever i have some suggestions to improve the gameplay at least twentyfold 1 introduce a loadout screen and killstreak perks such as uavs and ac130s to reward hardcore junglers such as myself 2 have an in game marketplace where in game gold can be purchased for bitcoins at a ratio of 11 3 increase number of players per team to 16 for epic battles

this game is awesome  the market  the items and image are best  but ranking and report system need to be improved a little bit more  1010 dota 2

this is by far the greatest choice making rpg to datethere are over a hundred characters and each character has stunning storys that can change based on your choices it seems every new game i start has diffrent npc and voice lines that drive the story through the end the ending is generally the same wether the dark lord or light lord wins this single player rpg allows building of the story through dicisions and item purcheses like recently i choose the character phantom assassin and built the powerful mechinism that allowed me to heal my party members the dialoge on this story line was great though the curse filter was removed as i heard lines from the ever changing juggernuat character such as  this noob feed loses the game and she took safe lane for a ing mech though there are still a few bugs such as the one that causes incorrect traslation of the npcs lines as in my pa storyline the puck character was translated in spanish and my ally in arms keeper of the light was incorrectly translated to russian though sad i will miss their dialoge im sure there is much more to come as i havent had the same dialoge yet in my 3000 hours of gameplay [1010 would shoot myself]

dota is certainly a game with a learning curve but after you get past the basics it is obviously very very fun as you can see by the amount of players ofcoarse this is always compared with lol but in my opinion i find dota far more fun i suppose it just depends on what you like if your friends play one or the other and other factors but the best thing about this game and loltheyre both freeeeeeeeeeeeee which is ing incredible

dota is great and really enjoyable game do not worry if you suck at it because even those pros who are being watched by thousands had to start somewhere maybe youll be the one being looked up at

dota 2 is one of the best games out there it is a massive rage factory and you will hear insults come out of your mouth that you didnt even think you knew you can play powerful heroes like a succubus with a pain fetish or a massive red man who loves to splatter people into numbers also the learning curve is best described as a learning cliff but whatever i tell you doesnt matter because you people read the reviews for comedy rather than purchasing information
recommended
might be the best and hardest moba out there the best of it all it is free to play with no payable benefits only item for show start to play this game need a coach > add spidark on steam and i will give you a great first impression

dota 2 is the sequel to the popular warcraft iii mod known as dota it is very well crafted and improves the gameplay from orginal modification in the source engine gameplay mechanics are solid and is very difficult it requires to be attentive at all times positioning is key throughout due to the very long stun times and high damage output by every hero at a certain point in the game dota 2s graphics are much improved from the original warcraft iii modification in the warcraft engine respectivly and shows great colours and lighting on the map and characters unfortunatley due to its difficult nature and very large learning curb and tends to push back a large amount of players my recommendation is to start with a group of friends in bot matchs and play every single hero at least once to figure out their abilities then play the game online where everyone is an idiot or russian glhf
recommended
amazing best game i play so far

probably the best game of its genre theres tons of copies or lookalikes out there but none of them comes close to the original if you want to join the moba genre stop looking and download dota2 however  for those who are interested  theres a point id like to make depending on your previous moba experience if you have never played a game like dota2 before also goes for people who might be thinking about changing from lol you will have to be willing to learn and you will have to learn a ton trust me before youre any good at this game youre going through a hell of climbing up a mountain of things you need to learn with people at the top  all over you while insulting your mother or insulting you in a language you cant even read if youre prepared to face the most toxic community of all game genres out there you will find a game here which could potentially accompany your whole life it wont get boring ever  literally to be fair the learning part goes for every game of this genre and since its a team game your teammates will hate you for everything youre doing wrong  or they think youre doing wrong even if its right the moment you mastered the basics though this game will prove to be one of those you can play for years and still have fun with it
recommended
dota 2 is a lot of fun if you meet the right team  too bad that doesnt happen very often the community is more toxic than botulinum toxin on the other hand ive learned several russian swear words since 70% of the community is russian russian simulator 1010

learn russian and qqing

one of the most addicting games ive played yet just a personal note to new players watch a few totoriuls before playing a official game other players get easely agitetd by noobs sorry for the bad spelling im actually not english x

terrible all you do is right click

would you like to play one of the most competitive high skill capped games on steam here it is you are gazing upon dota2s famous legacy down from my childhood warcraft 3 days where id be mid with some other guy not knowing what to do to now my current self playing on the competitive scene this game is free amazing the community is by far better than most other known mobas points at league it also has great microtransactions incase you wanna make your favorite hero a total and utter badass with items but wait you dont need to buy the items because in time you will get them sure its all randomed and time is consuming but thats the joy of it its all just free great game overall i could spend countless hours on this thing and many more id give this a solid 9210 just because of how great it is
recommended
is a nice game  3
recommended
play against russians play with russians become a russian
recommended
fully my live thanks dota2 
recommended
its fun and addictive game its one of the must try f2p games in steam
recommended
nice this game
recommended
steep learning curve but once you invest the time to not suck then it is a pretty addictive and fun game the teamwork aspect of it is what makes it andor breaks it if you are unlucky to be paired with a feeding player that said if you can find a small core of people that you consistently play with then win or lose it is a pretty awesome game oh and dont use riki or sniper unless you have to just trust me
recommended
look at some of the good reviews im just messing around here
recommended
this game is great the community may be a little mean at times but if you find a good group of friends to play with it is amazing
recommended
ive spent a lot of time playing this game i even participated in a few tournaments last year and you know i will definitely advise this game to everyone first of all the amount of things that you have to know to be a good player is really huge it is very good because the more you learn and try to remember the better your memory becomes secondly the number of possible game situations is probably more than a billion different item builds skill builds moves skill usage etc etc this stuff improves your logic and tactical skillz thirdly you have to make your ingame decisions very fast and it improves your mind skillz as a conclusion id want to say that this game is an excellent thing if you muse about selfperfection and dont give a fk about the raging community if their rage is unfair just mute them if their rage is fair consider your mistakes learn to play with bots and let gaben be with you
recommended
dota 2 this is one of the most amazing games i have played in a very long time its a simple idea a 5 vs 5 arena with the same map everytime both teams trying to kill the others base you fight as over 100 heroes each with different roles thats all it is team communication is vital you cant win without coordinating and fighting as a team overall it is definately a game for certain types of people you need to be able to work and talk with your teamates and be concentrated pretty much 100% of the time also its a lot more fun to play with people you know form up a group with four of your friends and it will be much more fun the games can take anywhere from 3070 minutes but most of the time game i play only take about 4050 minutes lastly dont jump right into matchmaking right away you will probably get flamed and insulted and hurrased by your teamates if you dont do well play some bot matches first learn what heroes you are good with if people do flame and insult you take it with a grain of salt just dont yell back that wont help anybody its a really fun game and you should all try it out bonus its free so you dont lose anything by playing a couple games then learning you hate it chances are though you will love it
recommended
fantastic game best of the bunch if you like hon you can easily slide right in
recommended
absolutely fantastic fun and addictive one of the best games ever made if you get this game though make sure you do the tutorials and some bot matches before you play pvp matches otherwise you will get anhilliated and wont want to play the game again

heard of dota 2 all my life from friends around meand now i see why xd its 1 addictive 2 fun 3 competitive 4 challenging 5 teaches something thats not only important in game but also in the real life which is teamwork 6 this point may sound awkwardweird to people to be a pros instead of a consbut its the learning curve wut how is this pros instead of cons you say let me explain every game you play you either win or lose now not all games are meant to be won  cause its when you lose you learn something and even when you think you havnt learnt a thing from a game of loss you just did you learnt that you did something wrong to have achived that loss and should try to improve in that missing element knowing the fact that no ones perfect this is what makes dota 2 fun and keeps you playing over and over day after day so its hard to get even close to 1% of being bored plus in top of that there are 100 heroes that makes getting bored of this game dead impossible  and that gives us point 1  so i recommend everyone to play this game even if youre a cat cause cats are awesomeso is dota 2  happy gaming arafat  trapwolf
recommended
this is a really good game but it takes so long to be a professional on this game  but im telling to play this game its awesome
recommended
its ok
recommended
its alright 1110  ign
recommended
this is a great game i used to play the warcraft 3 user map settings version it was addicting way back then and it is still addicting now i played league of legends before i played dota 2 and i admit i was a little scared of the transition from league to dota but as i write this review now i do not think i will ever play league of legends again i will stick to playing dota2 from now until forever perhaps its the nostalgia it gives me or perhaps its fact that everyone is a  on league of legends eitherway this is a great game to get into especially if mobas are your type of game

recommended
best game of its type i love dota 2 and im sure many other would too though the tutorial is a little boring the game quickly warms up and is a great thrill the abillity to buy and sell stuff on the steam market is very cool as well
recommended
it takes effort to learn dota period so to all the newcomers out there please dont lose hope when you stumble from losing games it is normal it normally takes about 30100 games to really master each hero plus their item builds good luck
recommended
its hard to move on from dota 1 after i try 23 games on this game im so regret why im not move on to dota 2 from long ago
recommended
i dont like it i promised myself id never play it but now i cant stop playing it very addictive and makes you very competitive even if your not the competitive easily addicted to a game type of person edit 122814 the game and the community is full of trolls and intentional feeders the only hope for a goodgame is now only in the ranked playlist and even there youll get your trolls from time to time if youre going to play bring some friends to have a team or dont even bother at all it used to be fun and you could search an all pick and actually encounter people who want to win and play but now it seems that all the cod casuals have drifted over to dota 2
recommended
wow i like this game

very fun game i suggest it to everyone

wasting of time

welcome to the game of english majors russians peruvians and this gg report riki ez mid this game is like your abusive father you sorta kinda hate it you know its not good for your life but you still come back to it at one point or another because this is some kind of forced relationship that you know that you will get beaten or yelled at if you try to escape it also gaben

ok so its dota 2 the larges and most popular game on steam at the time of writing if you dont have this game and you are an avid gamer you will most likely pick up this game at some point due to the fact that it is free and well why not from a graphics point of view at maxed out on a gtx 660 easily it looks fantastic and that isnt even the best graphics card so the requirements arnt huge but much lower than that on budget pc with the worst graphics card ever and you might get a few people compaining about your wooden pc increasing the time to load up into the game and if worst comes to worse you can turn it to complete minium and i bet you that even if you laptop has one of the worst gpus on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace from a gameplay point of view as you can see i have spent well over 500 hours on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewers have spent from 1000 hours and above the reason well there is 1 map that has a few variables that can change the game such as the runes weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemies with so 1 map you think hummm that must be pretty limited well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact is that becuase of the 100 heros and many hero combinations and counters no game is the same with each game changing the way you play slightly depending the character you play how you play it and who you are against and how they play it so the game does take a while to get old and even then having the same map means that you can really know it like really know it how to do specific techneques and pulling creeps where the enemy heros can see you and how to position yourself so in that term the gameplay remains fun and interesting while still for players like me challenging the community this is the one issue you get with this game some people are not very forgiving for your mistakes and there is a lot of antirussian stuff mainly because when you go to play on an english or us server and you get strange man shouting at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand people get a little to say the least annoyed althrough the higher your battle rank and mmr i will talk about that later means that eventually you will get players who actually make an effort to coordinate with you the ranking system and how valve makes its money so the game is free and so how does valve make its money well first let me explain the ranking system basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle points for you to increase your battle point level each level you will recieve an item i think and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free items these items can also be dropped through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game valve also sells hero costumes in the dota storein game shop these items will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which i find very unique and means that there arnt huge pay to wins in the game which annoys me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win these costume items are very effective with the steam market allowing players to sell their items cheaply to other players but valve still profits of that by taking a transaction fee also due to the popular steam workshop players can submit their item designs to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money made which is a nice thing for new artists to make some money while having something to potentially put on a cv also when you reach a battle point rank of 13 you will unlock ranked matchmaking which will allow you to play games with other people of that level 13 and higher to increase your mmr with the top mmr being 7500 and bottom 0 you really have to be bad to get 0 with 5000 mmr being very high mmr is for more serious players that want to really test their skills with others of that level but on a down side note 20002700 mmr is very hard to get past as there are people from all different abilities so that can be a little dificult to get past but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level this concludes my review for dota with a few 1010 statistics also please consider taking a look at my youtube channel where there is some dota content and some help videos for new players httpswwwyoutubecomusermerlinicvideos graphics 8510 gameplay 910 community 610 as it gets better later on rankingprogression system 910

this is a really good game from valve in which a competitive moba game dota 2 is a moba game involving 10 people and 5 member on each team each team called radiant and dire defending the ancient core of their life members of the team choose one of 100 heroes there are 3 basic stats ability which are strength intellegent and agility both team fight each other have the purpose to protect their ancient and destroy the enemy ancient to sum up this game is really recommended though for new player it is needed to follow the training not all of players are friendly to new player make sure to understand the system of the game and be polite to each other dont forget to commend a player that you assume is well worth commend and report those player who you assume as a ruiner
recommended
dota is mother of all moba games
recommended
this game requires logical thinking its fun when you have a team that knows what theyre doing prefer this over league of legends dota 2  chess lol checkers that pretty much sums it up pros fun well balanced every hero is and has a counterhero meet different people more strategic depth you dont have to buy your heroes or characters this disables ingame advantage to people who use real money wider hero diversity no gap closer slow utility spell on everyone unlike lol every hero is unique cons tutorial isnt done yet pretty hard for people who are new to moba the learning curve is very very very steep lol also has outside factors affecting the game such as runes you can unlock and equip outside of the game to affect every match in some way dota doesnt have any idiocy like that your win or loss is completely unaffected outside of the current match you are in this is coming from someone who hasnt played a lot of videogames i have compared it with lol and that is my opinion this is affected my academics significantly my family doesnt like me anymore because im addicted to this game a lot to be honest also this game needs some changes on its mmr system because of which i had to create this account to start dota all over again to improve my stats i hope something would be done about it in the future and new servers would be opened up in countries where people get terrible ping such as india i would definitely recommend this to people who are capable of logical thinking decisions need to be made much faster and people who would love such games and not easy ones such as lol should definitely give this game a try this ruined my life my social life is pathetic my parents dont like me and im terrible at academics as i mentioned earlier at home people made sure i dont play dota 2 so i secretly game at a gaming parlor almost everyday i spent half or all of my college fund on dota 2 and other games on steam my parents are unaware of this addicted so much and im just in high school good game life reason  dota 2 5 out of 5 definitely would recommend
recommended
one of the best most difficult and truly competitive games ive ever played it is free and doesnt have any paytowin all heroes are free the only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay

this game is free the community might ruin this game for most players

too many russians very competitive noobs gonna have a hard timeing much flaming in the first weeks well kinda always xd you will learn most swears in russian you gonna be a russian racist after literally 13months its pretty much about tacticsroles and strategy free 2 play 10million players 100 heros and 100 different items make this game very complex noobs might need like 13 months to get along with the game hard mechanicstowercreep aggrolasthittingdaynight sight juking skillshots and so on well all in all i have to say its not the best game for beginners id say that might be his younger brother lol though if you have time to get along with it then my friend you gonna have so much fun for literally endless hours of playing as i said awesome game go and dl gl hf d
recommended
keep playing dota 2 and youll eventually learn russian or romanian yes i highly recommend it
recommended
honestly the most intense competetive game ive played since back in the days of codwaw bad example but especially for being free and the huge followingive drowned more time that id like to admit on this game so addictive and fun when you actually get past the learning curve and start to get good always something to learn and mostly every patch adds something cool or refreshing to the game ie a new hero or changes to the map or something of the sort download and enjoy kicking  with your friends
recommended
what i dislike about this game is some noobs who doesnt listen to teammates and dont support in the game that whay i really dislike other then that its a great game if you play as a team its victory all the way and its fun

lol is a different game then dota 2 in many ways but there are several things that are very similar to both game ive played both not on this account and i have to say that both games will make you hate mexicans french people brasilians russians and pretty much anything that is foreign it will make you a  both ingame and irl both games will make more addicted then whitney huston was on coke to be just even though i prefer lol over dota i think dota 2 is a better game then league for the simple reason that it is more interactive and you can play with your friends easier

ok ive nearly played 800hrs of this sht game dont get itbut when you win its its great d if you dont mind the stress and heart problems this game comes bundled with and that it destroys friendships by all means download dota 2 that being said the stratergy and teamwork you need to preform flawless kills and team ganks on the enemy team is not easy but when done correctly and played as a team this game is truly a gem you will never find a game like this that gives you the satisfaction that the choices you make can change the game in a matter of seconds ps the game does have a tutorial to get you going but if your new to the moba scene take the time to learn watch guides becuase this game has quite a steep learning curve and quite a big selection of items to buy it can be overwhelming to the new player i recommend playing a few bot games before jumping into a match against other players

dota is certainly a game with a learning curve but after you get past the basics it is obviously very very fun as you can see by the amount of players ofcoarse this is always compared with lol but in my opinion i find dota far more fun i suppose it just depends on what you like if your friends play one or the other and other factors but the best thing about this game and loltheyre both freeeeeeeeeeeeee which is ing incredible

dota is great and really enjoyable game do not worry if you suck at it because even those pros who are being watched by thousands had to start somewhere maybe youll be the one being looked up at

this games amazing i play it every day since i downloaded it
recommended
ok ive nearly played 800hrs of this sht game dont get itbut when you win its its great d if you dont mind the stress and heart problems this game comes bundled with and that it destroys friendships by all means download dota 2 that being said the stratergy and teamwork you need to preform flawless kills and team ganks on the enemy team is not easy but when done correctly and played as a team this game is truly a gem you will never find a game like this that gives you the satisfaction that the choices you make can change the game in a matter of seconds ps the game does have a tutorial to get you going but if your new to the moba scene take the time to learn watch guides becuase this game has quite a steep learning curve and quite a big selection of items to buy it can be overwhelming to the new player i recommend playing a few bot games before jumping into a match against other players

a solid multiplayeronline battlearena game what is a moba a moba is probably a game where by fundamentals everything is first set in total equilibrium and players actions skills teamwork and effort is what makes the difference for one team to finally win over another with over 100 different heroes to choose from all absolutely free no need to unlock and no need to buy anything on top of the seemingly repetitive one map and mode theres actually different events with a very distinct gameplay and features ranging from team versus team like diretide and even coop like the wraith night the games business model is the way i see it most userfriendly everything you want unlocked is unlocked everything that u can buy is purely eyecandy and visual effects and models but at the same time one courier one announcer one set on your favorite hero is enough to make the game experience just so much more be vary though amongst the player base lurk some really irrittating and annoying children from all across the globe whos primary aim and goal  in game and in life  is to just annoy people and  them off for their own pleasure steer clear of falling into arguments with them that cost you the whole game and some nerve cells theres the report abuse button and let the mods do the rest
recommended
probably the best game ever made always come back to it and always find a reason to yell at  and russians thanks obama
recommended
i recommend that game for every moba fans and others 
recommended
who needs a life when you have dota 2
recommended
its a wonderful yet brutal experience which leaves you with a strange lovehate feeling for it like any worth while relationship does for veterans from warcraft 3 mod days will fell quite nostalgic and really appreciate the up scaling done to the game newcomers will still have a sense of how detailed the game is both graphically and game mechanics wise at its core its an rpg through and through with leveling systems items and fixed hero abilities the community still needs to grow in terms of mannerism but anyone with thick skin can power through the nasties which arent that many anyway
recommended
i was jungling chaos knight one afternoon racking up the six figure kill spree when i had an epiphany after about 3 matches youve seen it all this is a painfully simple game that offers no challenge whatsoever i have some suggestions to improve the gameplay at least twentyfold 1 introduce a loadout screen and killstreak perks such as uavs and ac130s to reward hardcore junglers such as myself 2 have an in game marketplace where in game gold can be purchased for bitcoins at a ratio of 11 3 increase number of players per team to 16 for epic battles

this game is awesome  the market  the items and image are best  but ranking and report system need to be improved a little bit more  1010 dota 2 
recommended
this is by far the greatest choice making rpg to datethere are over a hundred characters and each character has stunning storys that can change based on your choices it seems every new game i start has diffrent npc and voice lines that drive the story through the end the ending is generally the same wether the dark lord or light lord wins this single player rpg allows building of the story through dicisions and item purcheses like recently i choose the character phantom assassin and built the powerful mechinism that allowed me to heal my party members the dialoge on this story line was great though the curse filter was removed as i heard lines from the ever changing juggernuat character such as  this noob feed loses the game and she took safe lane for a ing mech though there are still a few bugs such as the one that causes incorrect traslation of the npcs lines as in my pa storyline the puck character was translated in spanish and my ally in arms keeper of the light was incorrectly translated to russian though sad i will miss their dialoge im sure there is much more to come as i havent had the same dialoge yet in my 3000 hours of gameplay [1010 would shoot myself]

i had good grades until i started playing dota now im failing maths 1110 would buy again

dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena video game and the standalone sequel to the defense of the ancients dota warcraft iii reign of chaos and warcraft iii the frozen throne mod developed by valve corporation dota 2 was released as a freetoplay title for microsoft windows os x and linux in july 2013 concluding a windowsonly public beta testing phase that began in 2011 the game is available exclusively through valves contentdelivery platform steam dota 2 is played in discrete matches involving two teams of five players each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map each stronghold contains a building called the ancient which the opposite team must destroy to win the match each player controls a hero character and focuses on leveling up collecting gold acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory development of dota 2 began in 2009 when the developer of the dota mod icefrog was hired by valve as lead designer dota 2 was praised by critics for its gameplay production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor however the game was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community dota 2 has become the most actively played game on steam with daily peaks of over 800000 concurrent players

i want to introduce you to a game defense of the ancients is its name in this game our chances are all the same so when you are good it will bring you fame but when you are bad it will bring you flame ingame since becoming a good player always be your aim and the game starts for radiant and dire ten heroes are picked from a pool of 107 five heroes for each all different styles from being supportive selfish to even vile unstoppable wicked sick and beyond godlike for a single purpose to defend the ancients with all their might many many more id like to say but it will take too much time of my day so i will stop and step out of your way cause youve known the basic its now your time to play

i had stopped playing dota 2 for a while and i came back i had lost 5 games in a row one of which was due to 1 second lag in the first 5 minutes of the game which corrected itself right after the point where i was too underfarmed to do anything anyway then i played a game and i started winning i worked well with my lane partner i ganked the enemy safelane five times as timbersaw before the 10 minute mark and got my bloodstone at 7 minutes then during an exciting teamfight in which i was the 1 damage dealer and ace on the team the game crashed the entire east coast crashed because i was winning because i was having fun half of americas dota servers blew up because i thought i could have fun  you dota

this this game is the king of free to plays it is the king of mobas and it will ruin your life with its addiction the depth of this game is amazing a huge variety of items and characters to do battle 5 vs 5 in online multiplayer i would like to point out that this game has only one map one ing map that never gets boring the best way i can describe dota 2 is that its like chess and football its a game of momentum as well as timing and skill everyone needs dota 2 in their life put it like this i have 80 games that i may as well uninstall because i only play this game 1010

i used to play alot league of legends like 3 years or so i played dota 2 closed beta and i really didnt liked game because it was so bloody difficult but now few months ago i realized this is what is this game about  i really do like dota now  i am not playing league of legends anymore because it became boring without denying  loosing gold on death  it just feel to simple to me so yeah tldr  dota 2 > lol
recommended
if youre fond of blaming others for everything or uncomfortable with acknowledging the fact that there will always be someone better than you out there this is not the game for you if you like a constant challenge and youre capable of continual improvement than it comes highly recommended the game itself is crazy fun and varied the map is ridiculously intricate and its all freetoplay without being paytowin the matchmaking system on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired ie no region lock soloqueue disadvantage questionable balance methods etc the community really isnt as bad as everyone says and the hero that you think is op is not theres always more to learn and thats what keeps me coming back
recommended
good gamecan create a extra ordinary friendship
recommended
i love the gameits super fun but only after the huge learning curvebut in the end all the time put in is worth it

i dont think i can recommend this game yes i have a hell of alot of hours but thats just becoming sort of good in the beginning of your playing its frustrating everyone gets mad at you and its just not fun also icefrog doesnt care about normal people just money i have fun with it but you probably wont

the warcraft iii mod that took the world by storm is now a stand alone game in f2p model with microtransactions and cosmetic items that allow for customization as well as a bustling digital market for trading currency i can see this going the way of tf2 where it stays a relevant game for years to come i bet blizzard is kicking themselves over cause if they had picked this up before valve did theyd be making a whole lot more money moba games are a trend these days and the original dota was a game i really got into for years i recently only started playing again and immediately i remembered how petty and elitist certain players are sometimes you dont even enjoy playing the game sometimes you just play cause you wanna even up the losses from the last time you lost this game makes you rage in ways you thought you never could ah but the feeling of crushing your enemies is a fair trade off no good graphics gameplay hasnt changed that much events are pretty cool marketable items are nice too if they do promotional tieins with certain games like how tf2 did for rare items other than that genuine master thief set thatd certainly make it more interesting pudge with a super meat boy outfit or maybe sniper with a tf2 sniper set i give it an 8 out of 10 play it if you dont mind getting flak from your teammates when you mess up one tiny bit id play lol but then its too cutesy for my taste to each his own

welcome to dota 2 you suck tldr  amazing game try it i was never really the type of guy to play one game for prolonged periods of time but there are exceptions dota 2 is one of them i discovered this game through a friend downloaded it played it immediately hated it and everything about it but not because it was a horrible game i hated it because it was soulcrushingly cruel coming from fps games i was tossed into the game with no idea on how to play passed last hitting even that i couldnt do right after about six hours of trying heroes different lane combinationsstrategies and subsequently feeding i essentially gave up on it three months later i decided that i didnt give dota the chance it deserved i redownloaded it studied up on guides practiced for hours as one hero until i got it right and i found that this game was much deeper than i had initially thought i was a longtime fps player but i was familiar with league of legends in lol youre expected to push and harass amass gold gank and kill to win simple right so i thought the same should be done for dota 2 just push the lane until i win thats how things are in league i learned one thing after hours and hours of getting owned by medium coop bots dota 2 isnt lol not even close in lol its basically a pushing contest with ganks thrown in in dota 2 i had to learn how to counter pick orbwalk gank control creep waves stack jungle camps stack ancients with helm of the dominator deny junglers exp by placing wards in camps harass without getting aggro what heroes countered my heroes all of them which lanes are best for which heroes learn when its better to defend or trade towers when to buy items like hand of midas its a daunting task for anyone to learn all of that at once would be nothing short of overwhelming but you dont learn it all at once you learn it through hours and hours of humiliation and practice then there are the heroes i prefer dota 2 heroes over lol champions in lol they expect you to work for heroes or buy them rightout with real world money the same for any cosmetic items you may want dota hands you all the heroes in the game for free and any item you see in the shop can be earned at random through playing a match the items are also tradeable the champions in league were always soso to me i never really connected with them either because they looked cartoony to me or because they just simply didnt talk enoughhave enough lines heroes in dota are rather serious and usually have over a hundred lines each which really lets you get a good feel for who they are note i dont dislike lol as ive played it myself i just prefer dota like i said before i was a longtime fps shooter before coming to dota 2 i still am but i digress and a part of why it was fun was because i had friends playing with me yeah i get to talk to people i know while we kill random people online thats fun but it was just us going rogue and seeing who can kill more people than the other while we talk about mundane things dota 2 is different my friends and i found that we had to rely on each other to win we were given the opportunity to organize plans tell each other what we were doing if we needed a gank ect high fives went around the room whenever we won and gaming with friends has never been more fun dota 2 is that rare type of game that doesnt hold your hand through it all you dont just pick it up instantly it demands your time and attention it deserves it dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of any game the steepest ive ever experienced but that doesnt take away from how great the game is even when you fail it only feeds your desire to become better you get to reading more guides finding which heroes you play best with getting rid of the ones you dont learning of the strategies you could use and learn how to talk with your team much more emphasis is placed on learning practicing and communication than most games but that only adds to the greatness dota 2 is needlessly cruel but it may be the most fun youll ever have an amazing game theres no reason why you arent playing it give it a try you wont be sorry when you come out of it

the most challenging strategic multiplayer game that i have ever played that tests your discipline continence cooperation communication and agile responces among the other 4 teammates by finding new strategies to beat the opponents and destroying their base as known the ancient the only requirement is that you should know the roles of the heroes and the items that they use mostly by reading the dota 2 wiki [dota2gamepediacom] or watching videos of experienced players like from youtube or twitch in order to enjoy the full potential of the game you should form a team with family or friends instead random people if thats possible free to play with amazing graphics music sounds voice acting and reqular updates pretty balanced and with a big hero pool to choose from and more heroes to come in future also like other valve games cosmetic items make their presence giving you the ability to customize your heroes by buying them optionally in order to support the community contributors and creators or simply finding them from ingame free drops and trading with other players or you can even create your own 1010 would defend my ancient again and destroy my enemies

as a heads up this game is highly addicting aside from that the gameplay can be complicated and a vast majority of the community is toxic to bad players and foreigners if you are fortunate or skilled you can also find some of the more nicer areas of the community one nice areastream i can promise is twitchtvtravdood i leave it up for you to choose gl hf

i feel like this is the same for everyone who likes it you start off by saying what an addicted community these idiots cant stop playing luckily i at least have a life the thing is you dont exactly let go of your life when you play the game but you dont stop playing in your free time ive only scratched the surface of strategies and statistics and how all the heroes work at my level i dont recognize most abilities in ability draft at very first glance the way the game keeps people so enticed i believe is that they want to know every nook and cranny in it it is the most addicting and amazing game ever in its own wright puns for other games i like how it remains amazing with only 1 map is beyond comprehension theres just so much to that one map even the community is that of xbox live with every game exceptions being there is no 6 year old calling every other player the nword or the fword on dota 2 its been replaced with russians calling you a  not the games fault though

are language tutors like rosetta stone too pricy for you do you enjoy repeating tasks for hours for losses that will tear apart friendships and wins that will be forgotten about immediately do you find pride in knowing that you and your group of friends can work as hard as you can and train for thousands of hours only to be destroyed by a melanin enriched man livining in his chickenfarming parents shack regardless of whether or not hes on your team do you like to receive a couple shiny colourful virtual objects that compel you to spend money on more do you enjoy spectating other people playing games and thinking to yourself gosh theyre so bad if i were them i would be doing so much better do you enjoy semihigh pitched ping noises do you enjoy shouting being emitted from a chain smoking peruvian into a ham radio into a headset from 1993 radiating out of your speakers do you enjoy being blamed for every fault within your team do you enjoy right clicking are you a masochist if you answered yes to any of these questions dota 2 is the game for you

dota 2 is a game ive been playing for about a year or so now and i dont think ive ever been so addicted to a game before its a game with teamwork strategy and beautiful visuals the hero pool has a huge variety of different looks skills and basic stats the game modes for the online mode are also cool but i wish some people who play captains mode will actually listen to their teammates instead of just picking wherever they want to overall this game is really fun to play and its free i would definately recommend this game to people who have a semilong attention span and a quick reaction time

really great game introduced me to mobas very addictive and a friendly and helpful community little confusing at first but fun once you get used to it fascinating graphics and crisp sounds gameplay can feel repetitive but theres always an element of suspense each player hero is unique and powerful and the user interface of the game is easy to understand does not constantly bug you for microtransactions which is great only problem is that finding a match even on my closest servers takes quite some time 34 mins loving the game otherwise 910  the best moba

dota 2 is a work of genius this game will bring together everybody from around the world and as players load into the game one by one theres a good sense of kindness and respect from all players as we greet each other and comment on how the last loading player needs to shovel hisher coal just that little bit faster its really a good feeling youve just loaded into this brilliant game with friendly players on both sides and you get ready to pick this however is where it all breaks down this is where you find out your parents never loved you theyre not actually your parents your not so much mom has slept with almost every player in the server and you miraculously recieve a new age and mental health rating from your team mates free of charge once the picking phase is over you move onto the playing the actual game and this is the part where you truly learn to multitask no other game teaches you to cry rage swear clickping 6000 timessecond attempt suicide question all humanity question your own intelligence as well as others all while controlling your pretty little faerie dragon at the exact same time all in all 910 i would

it takes a while to get in to but once youre in you will never get out a great game once you know the basics and has a huge range of what you can do to get better at in the game it is very deep the back stories of the heros are very interesting and it is very good on the game mechanics side and the story side some heros are however quite fustrating to play against but it seems that vale and the developers are still definitely updatimg the game and trying to make everything balanced also i have never tried dotas competitor leauge of ledgends so i cannot say wether i think it is better

its ok i guess

the most challenging strategic multiplayer game that i have ever played that tests your discipline continence cooperation communication and agile responces among the other 4 teammates by finding new strategies to beat the opponents and destroying their base as known the ancient the only requirement is that you should know the roles of the heroes and the items that they use mostly by reading the dota 2 wiki [dota2gamepediacom] or watching videos of experienced players like from youtube or twitch in order to enjoy the full potential of the game you should form a team with family or friends instead random people if thats possible free to play with amazing graphics music sounds voice acting and reqular updates pretty balanced and with a big hero pool to choose from and more heroes to come in future also like other valve games cosmetic items make their presence giving you the ability to customize your heroes by buying them optionally in order to support the community contributors and creators or simply finding them from ingame free drops and trading with other players or you can even create your own 1010 would defend my ancient again and destroy my enemies

its time for a serious review i ing hate this game i have lost a countless number of braincells arguing in three different language not stop in this ing game i hate noobs wrecking the game toward the point of no return i hate going for a  and coming back to notice that i have now 0 gold left because my teammates are victims of aids and alzheimers that have disabled their basic cognitive behaviour of reading but i love it i love coming back from  &  circumstances and winning with 25 deaths and 2 kills i enjoy a good game with good people who can communicate like a grown human being that has a decent brain capability i love to come from my lesson and just to find out that icefrog ed it even more i love it i love it

first lie in dota2 all heroes are balanced

this game will make you racist

well for starters let me just say that for all the lol fans out there who keep saying dota 2 is a copy of league and it sucks this reviews goal is to get you to actually try it out and say that it isnt like lol or any other moba that youve ever played alright lets start with the gameplay dota 2 has fairly simplecomplex depending on how much youve played system in which were one team has to destroy the other teams ancient in terms of goals its pretty simple but in terms of achieving that goal thats a complete different story alright now to next phase the heroes the heroes in dota 2 are quite original and each one has many different roles when it comes to achieving a team win but the issue with heroes as of now is some are just plain stupid and op like for ex riki actually its just riki alright now for the third part of our review in which we discuss graphics dota 2 compared to dota 1 has much better graphics and the level of detail on certain characters is just amazing the main issue tough well it aint really an issue but its more of a technical problem is if you have a really crappy computer in which you cant run these type of games on high so you wont be able to enjoy them sadfais   last but not least is the conclusion and personal toughts on the game this review actually was my personal tought but heck ill just summarize everything then the game really is good and the faults are all quite minor but the thing that dota 2 that i think executes most wonderfully is just the plain heroes and their backgrounds and such its just to amazing

a few months ago i was playing dota 2 with my friends my frist hero is bh also known as bounty hunter it was fun but still having a frist time player like me it was sucks dota2 is one of my favorite game also the graphics of the game clash of hero and also how you play it right you may know what i am talking about its all about how awsome dota2 is like i said one of my favorite game valve make such a wonderful game like this i cant wait to see the other hero

i remember when i begun my very first journey in playing this game it was around the early part of my first trimester during my junior year in high school a very close friend of mine who i regard as a younger brother presented to me the idea of playing dota 2 in order to strengthen our bonds and to give myself something else to do in my spare time i willingly decided that it would be a good idea to play my first game went like this if hell could be virtually contained then dota 2 surely is the closest thing one can get to gates of hell fortunately there is hope for those who enter not continuing to play my first game was played as nyx assassin a hero that i picked purely out of his latter namesake in my juvenile adoration and understanding of the stealthy playstyle in the days of my adolescent youth what had begun as an attempt to become closer to my friend became a gnashing foaming teethgrinding session of psychological torment that flayed away my ideas of what is good and what is bad in this world my descent into this game only proved my avarice for failure as the level of suck i displayed went well beyond the expectations of a five year old attempting to play any video game with alluring colors and noises creeps mocked me the courier was an ally i seldom knew gold was a luxury to obtain the jungle was a nightmarish land of prison strongmen that held me down when their amusement at my attempt to challenge their authority would finally cease and those that played amongst regarded me as an abomination of wicked biology that combined nearly every terrible epidemic of human history finally fused with a bubbling carcenogentic tumor that only lived to spread its filth across the playerbase further soiling what little health was there to maintain depression quickly ensuedand i fell to the depths of despair forever bad i would declare to myselfforever bad years lateri have become what most dread a vindictive young man whose only desire in solo public matchmaking is to preserve and defend the dregs of my cancer by picking supports and buying wards and couriers only to see a swift decrease in awareness and reckless use of the courier who meets its end by the hand of a fivedeath squad that originally intended to end the life of the useless carry that fell victim to the folly of buying boots first and declared my incompetency for not providing him with shared tangos dota 2 is a curse my friend do not fall victim as many others have pleasereconsideri beseech theereconsider

when i first started dota2 i was a little overwhelmed as my first arts  moba game it was pretty complicated i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying before i knew it i was performing better and better i stopped making silly mistakes and i got vastly better at not feeding the enemy team for the most part everyone ive met was very helpful and nice there have sometimes the jerk however as i continue to play dota2 more and more im sure ill continue to improve i recommend this game for all

we were at the clg house preparing for our match against tsm it was long and exhausting as a gentle sweat rolled down my cheek i sighed link had left his desk and was watching anime in his room dexter and seraph were slowly gazing into each others eyes and i knew that a steady makeout session would occur i gazed slowly at the black hunk of a man sitting near me aphromoo was laughing i always loved his laugh i pictured a naked aphro pleasuring me supporting me until the end i sighed realizing that would never happen hey peter aphro said to me casually i smiled at him and he smiled back he asked if i wanted to duo and i said i was tired and was going to bed secretly i wanted aphro i layed my head down and was out like a light when i awoke it was 800 pm suddenly i heard a knock on the door ummm peter may i come in it was aphro yyeah the door is unlocked i said feeling my heart skip a beat he entered wearing his clg uniform only his clg uniform he covered himself embarrassed ppeter ive liked you for a while now aand i stood up embracing aphro its okay zaqu i feel the same way i slowly pulled his hands away as i gazed upon his needlessly large rod aphro i said confidently wwill you support me now and forever he didnt respond but he answered with his body he pushed me onto the bed mounting me placing his hands next to my head and leaning in for a kiss i met him halfway as our lips touched i thought of all our years together and thought that i would be happy to give him my first time he slid his tongue inside my mouth moving it around as i did the same our kiss lasted what seemed liked a lifetime as our lips parted i gazed into his eyes and i could tell from his raging boner he couldnt hold back anymore he flipped me over onto my back as he unzipped his pants his rod of ages was in full view as i took off my pants revealing my  he pulverized my  with his black cleaver he must be stacking armor pen i thought to myself he was close to releasing his void ooze iits okay aphro you can gank my insides dont be afraid to spray and pray his pleasured moans satisfied me as he shot his dark binding into me i felt useless just laying there on my back aphro had carried me in the past but this time i would carry him i quickly used hyperkinetic position reverser to force myself on top of aphro just then i got excited i stuck my infinity edge into his dorans ring he moaned with delight so to pleasure him fuller i wrapped my hands around his nipples as he screamed you cant milk those as i felt a surging tide being released into aphro i exclaimed its all skill aphro had still not shot his exploding cask so i powerfisted him none will escape my grasp i said sexually to further please him i got out my chains of corruption tying up aphro to the bed i wrapped my quicksilver sash around his eyes and continued my void assault ppeter iim about tto ccu aphro said quivering say no more i said putting my finger over his lips i wrapped my mouth around his deathcap as he shot his ebb and flow into my mouth that tasted purple i thought to myself as we lay there in our caustic spittle together i felt finally happy every day past that fateful day aphro has had my back sometimes literally and we are truly synergized tsm best be afraid for we are rush hour
recommended
its an amazing game  technically outstanding especially in the allimportant multiplayer aspects the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying it took me a long time to warm up to but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting my hands on my laptop to play i also love the cosmetics applied to every hero that is why i love collecting sets and trading with other people this gives me an opportunity to communicate with other races around the globe if you can spare the time  play it
recommended
the only way to enjoy this game is to not care for mmr on the other hand you can learn a lot of new languages like russian turkish spanish and many more give this game a try if you like learning new vocabularies

the game is good but the community is trash give it a try if you like moba and teamplay but find friends to play with use a third party voicechat and never ever look at the ingame chat log otherwise you will get verbally assaulted by a horde of 9 years old keyboard warriors discovering human interaction for the first time

never before have i had such a profound hatred for other human beings you cant leave ive tried and will most likely try again soon mostly what this game has taught me is this i am a racist bigot everyone i know is a racist bigot even the peruvians and russians are racist bigots everyone is stupid teamwork like sleep is a false promise dont queue in groups of people less than 5 never go alone seriously its that important you will not have fun angsty narcissistic 10 year olds exist everywhere everyone is a noob even you dont delude yourself search your feelings you know it to be true run

the community is getting better my reccommendation is to do at least 2 hours of internet research before you start playing

its like the battle of the five armies but with two

heard of dota 2 all my life from friends around meand now i see why xd its 1 addictive 2 fun 3 competitive 4 challenging 5 teaches something thats not only important in game but also in the real life which is teamwork 6 this point may sound awkwardweird to people to be a pros instead of a consbut its the learning curve wut how is this pros instead of cons you say let me explain every game you play you either win or lose now not all games are meant to be won  cause its when you lose you learn something and even when you think you havnt learnt a thing from a game of loss you just did you learnt that you did something wrong to have achived that loss and should try to improve in that missing element knowing the fact that no ones perfect this is what makes dota 2 fun and keeps you playing over and over day after day so its hard to get even close to 1% of being bored plus in top of that there are 100 heroes that makes getting bored of this game dead impossible  and that gives us point 1  so i recommend everyone to play this game even if youre a cat cause cats are awesomeso is dota 2  happy gaming arafat  trapwolf

this is a really good game but it takes so long to be a professional on this game  but im telling to play this game its awesome

the learning curve is large but once you get to the top it is really fun to stomp the lesser players under your iron boot

basically a pay2bling game been playing this game since 648b days and i can say for sure hate it or love it its here to change and valves primary cash cow everythings right with the execution of the game except the mechanics carry over from dota to which i think valve says fk this complicated wc3 orb sts lets make it our own attack modifiers  matchmaking and awaits you both public and ranked matches but as you learn to enjoy this game requires some amount of patience [not from the game but from the players] it gets better dont fall for the pay2bling and go on spending spree it just shows to other how much you need to get a real life enjoy the game not your allies screaming how n00b you are learn russian so you can help that random russian player in every server how to play definitely a recommend pros dota universe meaning dota players will feel at home after 3040 hours of gameplay valves main attention right now forget hl3 let alone hl2ep3 the defining moba game at the moment cons steep learning curve unless you played wc3 dota the tutorials arent much to write home about not a pay2win game frequent updates
recommended
this is game that not all people will enjoy but if you do then prepare to dedicate the game lots of time because of the depth of the learning that needs to be done in order to take out the most from the game during your time playing the game you will find lots of people that treatly you quite badly but luckily there is a button for ignoring them overall i think this game would be for people who love and enjoy playing rts games

one of the best moba aroundanyway league of legends is far better

nothing more nothing less thana good moba

its really good and fun c
recommended
honestly one of the best mobas out there it may be overwhelming and ridiculous at first but i quickly realized once i found out about my favorite hero in this cave sven the rogue knight lyralei the windrunner and lina the slayer to name a few but the game in itself is amazingly well rounded with even supports having fun roles in the game and even having the potential to take over the game the pvp community is a lot better than my first arguement about it and rarely do i find any terrible people in the game who have a terrible attitude the best moba i have seen and played besides maybe smite i would recommend this to anyone with a good group of friends who like to have fun and play video games like it
recommended
its hard to move on from dota 1 after i try 23 games on this game im so regret why im not move on to dota 2 from long ago
recommended
i dont like it i promised myself id never play it but now i cant stop playing it very addictive and makes you very competitive even if your not the competitive easily addicted to a game type of person edit 122814 the game and the community is full of trolls and intentional feeders the only hope for a goodgame is now only in the ranked playlist and even there youll get your trolls from time to time if youre going to play bring some friends to have a team or dont even bother at all it used to be fun and you could search an all pick and actually encounter people who want to win and play but now it seems that all the cod casuals have drifted over to dota 2

ok so its dota 2 the larges and most popular game on steam at the time of writing if you dont have this game and you are an avid gamer you will most likely pick up this game at some point due to the fact that it is free and well why not from a graphics point of view at maxed out on a gtx 660 easily it looks fantastic and that isnt even the best graphics card so the requirements arnt huge but much lower than that on budget pc with the worst graphics card ever and you might get a few people compaining about your wooden pc increasing the time to load up into the game and if worst comes to worse you can turn it to complete minium and i bet you that even if you laptop has one of the worst gpus on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace from a gameplay point of view as you can see i have spent well over 500 hours on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewers have spent from 1000 hours and above the reason well there is 1 map that has a few variables that can change the game such as the runes weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemies with so 1 map you think hummm that must be pretty limited well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact is that becuase of the 100 heros and many hero combinations and counters no game is the same with each game changing the way you play slightly depending the character you play how you play it and who you are against and how they play it so the game does take a while to get old and even then having the same map means that you can really know it like really know it how to do specific techneques and pulling creeps where the enemy heros can see you and how to position yourself so in that term the gameplay remains fun and interesting while still for players like me challenging the community this is the one issue you get with this game some people are not very forgiving for your mistakes and there is a lot of antirussian stuff mainly because when you go to play on an english or us server and you get strange man shouting at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand people get a little to say the least annoyed althrough the higher your battle rank and mmr i will talk about that later means that eventually you will get players who actually make an effort to coordinate with you the ranking system and how valve makes its money so the game is free and so how does valve make its money well first let me explain the ranking system basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle points for you to increase your battle point level each level you will recieve an item i think and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free items these items can also be dropped through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game valve also sells hero costumes in the dota storein game shop these items will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which i find very unique and means that there arnt huge pay to wins in the game which annoys me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win these costume items are very effective with the steam market allowing players to sell their items cheaply to other players but valve still profits of that by taking a transaction fee also due to the popular steam workshop players can submit their item designs to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money made which is a nice thing for new artists to make some money while having something to potentially put on a cv also when you reach a battle point rank of 13 you will unlock ranked matchmaking which will allow you to play games with other people of that level 13 and higher to increase your mmr with the top mmr being 7500 and bottom 0 you really have to be bad to get 0 with 5000 mmr being very high mmr is for more serious players that want to really test their skills with others of that level but on a down side note 20002700 mmr is very hard to get past as there are people from all different abilities so that can be a little dificult to get past but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level this concludes my review for dota with a few 1010 statistics also please consider taking a look at my youtube channel where there is some dota content and some help videos for new players httpswwwyoutubecomusermerlinicvideos graphics 8510 gameplay 910 community 610 as it gets better later on rankingprogression system 910

this is a really good game from valve in which a competitive moba game dota 2 is a moba game involving 10 people and 5 member on each team each team called radiant and dire defending the ancient core of their life members of the team choose one of 100 heroes there are 3 basic stats ability which are strength intellegent and agility both team fight each other have the purpose to protect their ancient and destroy the enemy ancient to sum up this game is really recommended though for new player it is needed to follow the training not all of players are friendly to new player make sure to understand the system of the game and be polite to each other dont forget to commend a player that you assume is well worth commend and report those player who you assume as a ruiner

dota is mother of all moba games

this game requires logical thinking its fun when you have a team that knows what theyre doing prefer this over league of legends dota 2  chess lol checkers that pretty much sums it up pros fun well balanced every hero is and has a counterhero meet different people more strategic depth you dont have to buy your heroes or characters this disables ingame advantage to people who use real money wider hero diversity no gap closer slow utility spell on everyone unlike lol every hero is unique cons tutorial isnt done yet pretty hard for people who are new to moba the learning curve is very very very steep lol also has outside factors affecting the game such as runes you can unlock and equip outside of the game to affect every match in some way dota doesnt have any idiocy like that your win or loss is completely unaffected outside of the current match you are in this is coming from someone who hasnt played a lot of videogames i have compared it with lol and that is my opinion this is affected my academics significantly my family doesnt like me anymore because im addicted to this game a lot to be honest also this game needs some changes on its mmr system because of which i had to create this account to start dota all over again to improve my stats i hope something would be done about it in the future and new servers would be opened up in countries where people get terrible ping such as india i would definitely recommend this to people who are capable of logical thinking decisions need to be made much faster and people who would love such games and not easy ones such as lol should definitely give this game a try this ruined my life my social life is pathetic my parents dont like me and im terrible at academics as i mentioned earlier at home people made sure i dont play dota 2 so i secretly game at a gaming parlor almost everyday i spent half or all of my college fund on dota 2 and other games on steam my parents are unaware of this addicted so much and im just in high school good game life reason  dota 2 5 out of 5 definitely would recommend

one of the best most difficult and truly competitive games ive ever played it is free and doesnt have any paytowin all heroes are free the only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay

too many russians very competitive noobs gonna have a hard timeing much flaming in the first weeks well kinda always xd you will learn most swears in russian you gonna be a russian racist after literally 13months its pretty much about tacticsroles and strategy free 2 play 10million players 100 heros and 100 different items make this game very complex noobs might need like 13 months to get along with the game hard mechanicstowercreep aggrolasthittingdaynight sight juking skillshots and so on well all in all i have to say its not the best game for beginners id say that might be his younger brother lol though if you have time to get along with it then my friend you gonna have so much fun for literally endless hours of playing as i said awesome game go and dl gl hf d

keep playing dota 2 and youll eventually learn russian or romanian yes i highly recommend it
recommended
honestly the most intense competetive game ive played since back in the days of codwaw bad example but especially for being free and the huge followingive drowned more time that id like to admit on this game so addictive and fun when you actually get past the learning curve and start to get good always something to learn and mostly every patch adds something cool or refreshing to the game ie a new hero or changes to the map or something of the sort download and enjoy kicking  with your friends
recommended
what i dislike about this game is some noobs who doesnt listen to teammates and dont support in the game that whay i really dislike other then that its a great game if you play as a team its victory all the way and its fun
recommended
i love the game it really gets addicting which explains my playtime lol you might not like it at first but i bet it will really turn into your closetoeveryday hobby after a while once you have gotten the hang of it it has a huge variety of heroes to choose from enjoy experiment and master though there are still a few missing heroes from the original defense of the ancients like arc warden winter wyvern and abyssal underlord the constant updates on the game which balances heroes and adds more content will still make you have fun and be strategic on the game hero sets and other custom items like huds loading screens etc are present in the game hero sets are a handful of items which customizes the whole hero from head to toe and i guess i dont have to explain the custom huds and stuff right there are a few yearly events to look upon on as well like new bloom chinese new year diretide halloween frostivus christmas some random events like the recent foreseers contract event which gives you and possibly quite a few more that i have missed since i have not played the game for long each of the first three events offers a new map as well as new content as i have mentioned earlier map changes may also vary on future game updates but like all other games there are flaws the 1 flaw would be the really bad community only rarely you see friendly good players who will actually help newbies learn most people in the game are rather stupid in the sense that they insult people who are new to the game blames others for their own mistakes and those who trashtalks for no reason there are players which does not know how to wait for someone too causing them to receive an abandon and gets them into the low prioprity punishment pool gets really really annoying no justice done really there are some people who ruins games too which can be explained in one word  troll they feed the enemy team intentionally worst part is that reporting them never does anything the reports need better management no valve the low priority pool isnt that good of a punishment either some players just report other users with no apparent reason and i think causing them an lp would not do any justice at least examine the reports before taking action another thing is the servers some users has gotten problems where the server would just kick them out for no reason which yet again causes them an abandon there are instances where the servers would actually crash due to an update during a really good game really happened to me once was not happy especially when the game is already over an hour long and you were winning a hardly fought match seriously this is just based on my own experiences and my opinion you might disagree on some stuff i have uttered but overall i like this game it gets even better when you get to know the right people and i think ill give it an 810 i have met a lot of really good friends from this game i hope you try it out and find your own have fun

dota 2 arguably the steepest learning curve strategy game you will ever play yet none more rewarding a highly competitive game that is now played by millions for millions ti4 winners took 5million usd that is hugely satisfying pros  variety in hero builds and teams  high replay ability  realtime mixture of rts and moba elements cons  brutal learning curve and impossible to master  demanding community and poor tolerance thresholds  huge huge huge occupier of your time some games last more than 60 minutes otherwise what are you waiting for at 805 hours total i am beginnerintermediate level and have no plans on stopping now

the latest in rage simulation technology dota 2 is supposed to be a team game but plays like call of duty where your team is full of little kids nonenglish speaking players and people who play like they are using a trackpad what is supposed to be a objective based game turns into a team deathmatch if you get matched with russians valve constantly releases patches to try and balance the handicap that peruvians give you but its not working what seems like a 5v5 match in reality is a 8v2 or 9v1 i do not recommend this game unless you like getting angry at yourself for not being able to win a 9v1
not recommended
though dota 2 is not beginnernoob friendly at all everyone is able to play it there is nothing much to say about why you should try it or not but the sheer number of players and yearthousands of cumulative playing time spent on this game should make you giving this a try be aware that the learning curve however is exponential this means that you will most likely be bashed down by the complex mechanics of this game for like the first 300 hours depending on how eager you try and how naturally skilled you are after you are in it and got some friends to play you will be able to have a thousand or more thousands of hours of gaming time in which there is variety and fun also for the big and free game like this is you have to expect by a 5050 chance to find games with bad communication meaning that either your teammates or the enemies are not friendlyhelping etc you just have to deal with it but on the other hand you will get to learn some russian french spanish korean etc curses you did not knew before also this is f2p but there are only smaller cosmetic items nothing involving the gameplay just for your information if you played lol or hon before you will not have an easy going here as this game takes the genre some steps higher

free russian language and culture lesson

the greatest game ever made at face value its just another topdown video game however once surpassing the initial learning curve the depth of this game is second to none the animation is perfect the voices are pristine however every game has its flaws the community is horrible there are numerous bugs and thats just grazing the surface that being said i never recommend this game to friends as once you pass that learning curve you wont be doing anything else once it latches on
recommended
great game its essientally a language simulator mixed in with a moba honestly within 10 hours of gametime i was a natural speaker in russian a language of which i had never had prior knowledge to before this game is great for racism as you learn to hate the russian people despite how much they love or hate gays its a great team building exercise as you learn to love those that you do not know despite how well theyre playing because after all god taught us to love each other apart from russian  the russians overall

dota 2 defence of the ancients is an online battle arena video game it requires strategy concentration and determination for the whole team to win a game the only problem is it relies way too much on your teamwork to win a game you have to destroy the opponents ancient after you level up and become powerful killing the enemy heroes levels you up faster and gives you more gold than the creeps because of the teamwork thing i would rate it 910 but yes i seriously recommend this game to everyone because it is addictive and really fun
recommended
it like drugs you cant get enough

dota 2 is the best competitive moba yet has a bit of a learning curve due to its complexity but once you get the hang of it  you can do some really unique stuff during any match unlike other mobas out there dota 2 allows you to step out of the metagame so you can make up your own builds drafts and playstyles it is frequently updated and has a very passionate community its also just as fun watching as playing
recommended
y  sure good luck
recommended
endless replayability you will forget about any other games for some people it takes years to learn how to play with all the heroes this game is for decade or more very complex gameplay mindblowing opportunities to meet nice russian guys the best part  its free and made by best company valve

when i first played it i thought i would never understand it but slowly but surely things make more sense and it continues to become more and more exciting i recommend it to everyone i speak to about gaming its such a popular game everyone either playes it already or has heard of it at least great topic of conversation too love it to bits thanks for making it
recommended
i havent played this game that much but from what i have played this game is really good game is a moba arpg game the objective is simple enough destroy the opponents ancient which lies deep within their territory graphically speaking the game is best in all the games out there for sure very nice animations looks of the heroes can be improved though to me they look more like cartoons and i would like a realistic approach for them voice acting is nice as well soundtrack can be improved the best part of this game is that its not pay to win all the items that you can get only alters your look in some way and not your performance in the game so no matter what weapon you are using be it vanilla or $10 weapon for a hero it will do same damage to the opponent in all cases i for one dont care much about hero looks so its a big plus for me all in all a very good and polished game it also updates very frequently which is good and bad depending on your bandwidth must play for sure

at the time of writing this i have logged 1500 hours playing dota 2 in that time i could have pursued paid work i could have exercised and improved my body or i could have learned any number of realworld skills instead i have sat at my computer and faced a tirade of abuse often pertaining to my skills my family or my sexuality the dota 2 community is probably the most toxic i have ever experienced racism homophobia and misogyny run rife i attribute this to the standard internet algorithm normal person  internet anonymity  raving  from the whiny gimp who calls gg after first blood to the gobby simpleton who first picked phantom assassin and decides you are all fkinnoobs11 for not babysitting him you will find that most problems in dota 2 are someone elses fault and they will tell them so a lot regarding the game itself there are endless combinations of heroes items and spells that you can use to your advantage which explains why one needs to accrue over a thousand hours before they can even class themselves as competent the learning curve is steep and to even become skilled with one hero takes a long time so is it worth it the game itself is beautiful each individual hero is a work of art as is the battle arena itself the customisations are a delight to view and the thriving community of modders continue to capitalise on the tools available to them dota 2 is wonderfully balanced despite regular cries of  is op all the heroes have exploitable weaknesses and no hero is markedly stronger than any other save in specific situations this is why dota 2 is played competitively to the highest levels of esports for serious prize pools when dota 2 is at its most fun it is an exceptional experience like when a team artfully chains their stuns to annihilate the enemy carry and turn a game these moments dont come often enough but maybe they are all the more glorious because of that so would i recommend dota 2 of course i have sank a preposterous amount of time into playing it ive even enjoyed some of that time id encourage you to find some friends then play and learn together the first time someone says anything that bothers you mute them straight away it only takes two mouse clicks as you get better remember that you were not always competent and consider that when you interact with others try and treat other members of the community with the respect you would want them to offer you lose some hours and have some fun regards loco ps all those guys you think are russian theyre usually serbian or ukrainian and they dont give a damn what you think about putin

a couple of years ago a friend of mine started me on this game and boy what a ride i wont get into the details of the game but there are always a few tournaments going on that you can watch as well as the free to play documentary on the first edition of the international dota 2 tournament look it up on youtube to get a good feel on the game if youre still interested after that if you have friends to play with if you have patience to learn and if you have time to spare each game lasts 40 minutes on average i wholeheartedly recommend you try it this is what competitive video games are all about it is daunting at first has a steep learning curve but every day im playing im learning something new and that is rewarding by itself it is a teambased game so youll get your fair share of frustrations but as long as you be smart about your decisions salvage every mistake as a learning experience and most importantly have fun doing so this is your game of the forever

i would avoid playing this game for two reasons the community is absolutely horrible probably the most toxic community in any game ive ever played the second reason is valve hasnt helped to make the community any better but actually helped to make it worse by not adding a surrender feature do not waste your time with this game

this game is quite addictive ive spent some times trying out all 100 characters from az >< my favorite is viper d if you have time to try this game out try all the heros and pick which one you like and develop it with many builds offensedefense in multiplayers people can be rude aggressive beginner professional which can be quite frustrating but if you play with your friends its going to be great
recommended
dota 2 can be a game for casual gamers or people looking to get more competive there is a very wide variety of heroes to play over 100 and they all have their own playstyle this game is extremely fun after you get past the pretty steep learning curve i must mention that this is a strategy game so if you only like fpss then you might not like this once you start understanding the game more it is a lot of fun please dont compare this game to lol because both games were created differently and are meant to serve a different experience

dota 2 is an anger management game in which the protagonist is challenged by being forced to withstand increasing levels of psychological torture the torture part has not yet been translated into english so its compelling narrative is still in russian but dont let that fool you  it still delivers the full payload for managing to resist an entire session of torture the protagonist is awarded new hats

this review is long so dont read if youre not interested enough my history in dota the year of 2012 i found this game very popular in steam whyd not give a try the game was hard to understand first time havent played any moba games earlier ive played only 34 heroes and used the same build sometimes it was just boring then ive opened for myself single draft mode  it helped me to study another heroes in dotawhose number is above 100  ive discovered the most interesting cybersportive side of dota later i wish i would see the international 2013 in that time now im praying to see all the ti 2014 matches online my favourite teams are navi empire and eg  their replays and mathes helped me a lot to study a professional dota scene a bit game mechanics game mechanics in dota is about to be ideal despite lots of minor bugs some bugs makes the game even more interestingtrying to abuse something with your friends etc dota has very many useful tricks which you can study from youtube videos or proscene replays the main target is the same in all moba games  to destroy opponents main building the process is very interesting and even addicting dota 2 has lots of tactics heroes builds skillbuilds also you can buy skins in the dota store for heroes couriers etc conclusion is you can customize your gaming process as you want or as your team wants dota 2 doesnt have a donate advantages  its a big plus to compare with league of legends dotas better in this way teammates the pubs in dota are very popular of course in dota you can play with people round the world on many languages the people you meet can be aggresive can be calm can be skillful can be useless every game you expect something new and to win many dota pubs you need to learn how to communicate with your teammates effectively and politely russians in dota 2 guys this part of review is for the people who played dota i think now every european says that russians completely suck at dota and always cant talk with the teammates in english im russian whats next am i a complete noob am i aggresive unpolite im trying to be i cant understand people who see my mistakes and tell oh hes russian mute him hes noob everyone does mistakes by the way its just a game but i wanna say one thing im sorry sorry for my compatriots i know there are many of them trolling the pubs abusing communication etc just sorry free to play free to play is the film about dota cybersport made by valve i advice everyone to see it great film about great game which is played by great people the international 2014 the biggest dota tournament is international it is organised by valve and goes every year i expect from ti4 pretty much conclusion so dota 2 is a good and interesting game 910 it is a mix of teamplay timings strategy communication recommended to try but dont get addicted thanks who survived during reading all this long review i havent told much but it is ok so thanks for reading see you at dota 2 battle fields  and to end this review traditional russian

do you like being matched with nonenglish speakers on english servers and losing to right click to win heroes do you love lack of communication between team members in a team game then youve come to the right place introducing dota 2 the most innovative method of mental selfharm known to man some games are so fun ed youll want to commit seppuku to end the miserable experience the best part about dota is when you make the life of the other team miserable then youre in for a world of fun ps always always always bring along some friends dota may be agonizing otherwise the more friends you play with the better

i like the facts that dota 2 is for everyone and the heroes are balanced the fact that you have to strategically plan your game makes it more interesting than go there and just shoot

if carlsberg did mobas  best game ever ok first off a sortof mixed review i love and hate this game i first started playing dota just after the international 2013 i moved into a house where the housemates were hell bent on this game and had friends over every day to play it it was the 1st moba i had ever played infact i had never even heard of the term moba before and for those who dont know it stands for multiplayer online battle arena first of all i was lucky i had friends who played this and watched and got help from them as they played before even starting the game as when landed into the thick of it it is quite daunting the tutorials are blah until you actually get to the main gameplay tutorials but no mention of custom build selection  this is another reason why some of my friends have just given up from my experience if you are a keen gamer stick with it however if you value your life then give up now because it is very addictive stressful and fun in the same sentence dota is a very tactical game which is extremely fun overwhelmingly addictive too and by knowing the basic fundamentals and working as a team and not being arrogant or being able to take advice you can have a great game you dont have to be an absolute strategist to win although it does help the problem with this game is the community and that is not the communitys problem infact i blame the creators valve for not putting enough restrictions in place and the restrictions they do put in place are ridiculous first of all you have to have a half decent machine to play this on standard settings  i sometimes even have problems on lowest settings on this machine and my machine lives up to their miniumum specs that saying that the game is quite playable for the most time on their minimum specs but it seems bugs do keep popping up that they just wont sort out also take the game as it is free to play and if anything happens just suck your gut in and relax valve support absolutely sucks so if anything goes wrong and you have any problems dont go running to valve for help because i have done this on more than 3 occasions with a 2 day  response of just sorry we cannot help you with this issue and my last email getting the response we will ignore any future emails about this issue from you back to the community dont take ranked too personally dota is a team game however many times you will get landed with players who cannot play as a team dont get the essence of dota in the same way you do are absolutely rude and ignorant and arrogant my advice after lots of headaches sod them you are playing because you like to play if you suck they dont help by screaming at you and if you are dieing too often and not intentionally feeding then it is their fault for not working as a team and protecting you also matchmaking you will find when you get into the game servers english speakers take off everything except us east west and europe west and set language preference as english this wont stop you being annoyingly teamed with people who dont speak english but it sure helps for some reason people dont understand communication is fundamental for a team game and selfishly pick servers where the know they will be teamed up with people who dont speak their languages yes i am speaking to all you russians who select everything other than russia other problems are that with the report system or restrictions now people with low end computer who get annoying bugs ingame which randomly kick them off suffer most however it goes for everyone on the report system i rarely use it anymore because it does jack  unless you are with a group of people you know will report the same person for the same actions you get 3 a week no matter how much you play which is dreadful and you only get a report back if action is taken against someone which seems to me it doesnt matter what they have done if noone else reports it there is no check and they get away scott free unfortunately if you are in a game and the rest of your team is a party and they dont like you for some reason excpect a 6 game ban in low priority also a new bug bear that has come out is this failed to load scenario my games usualy load up with some slow lagging problems at the start but manage to settle itself out when the games didnt load it was a pain in the  and you may have to search another 3  10 mins for a game but that was an annoyance i could live with now on the odd occasion i fail to load i get penalised for half an hour from finding any game except ones with bots remember failing to load does not effect the game as the game hasnt currently started and it is annoying but getting a ban from finding a match for 30 mins i even got an hour at one instance is ridiculous taking in account that a game lasts between 30 and 60 mins on average that means sometimes when you only have a set ammount of time to play you are screwed [bugs ive experienced taken out since they dont appear anymore on new laptop upgrade] other than that this game is the most fun game ive ever played and so rewarding so no matter how crap valve are or no matter how annoying the game can be at times i alway come back for more even if it means playing out my low priority ban matches with complete s

its okay game i guess
recommended
just the best moba you will ever play
recommended
once upon a time a russian in the other team told me peka you good 1010 vodkas would play again
recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend

in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had

and you thought real life was a struggle

i only played a little but it was fun

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

actually dota hd i came into this game a little uneasy my past with dota1 not being the brightest in the world but seeing something named dota2 i excepted new features characters etc etc i couldnt have been more wrong valve honestly didnt add a single thing except one thing well get to later the shop interface is still more unfriendly than a rabid bear in heat mages are still completely useless in late game are are the least used class of character the balance is still horribly out of whack leaving a single fed agility hero to be able to take an entire team by himself cough antimage cough and it just feels lazy even the characters were lifted straight from the warcraft iii modles now back to what valve actually did add hats not even joking this is a shameless cash grab by valve do not spend money on this game if you want the real dota2 play league of legends it was an upgrade from the orignal by the original creators theres a reason lol is 1
not recommended
this game in which you need to thinkthe whole game depends on teamwork
recommended
a very good followup to the original which brings dota out of warcraft mand into its own ive played both dota and league of legends  dota 2 is superior in my book two thumbs up up the butt
recommended
if you want some serious teamwork and intense battles you gotta play dota 2 but if you dont have time to train like a madman just play lol its more casual and less time consuming in my opinion
recommended
best free game i ever played
recommended
pls help i dont wanna die this thing kills you 1010

although the pvp can be challenging at first this game will hook u like no other gotta be one of the best games ive ever played

fairly balanced map design  several game mode  which can fill in your desire varities of large hero poll  which can easily fit in what you might like to play  over all 810 just need a few changes in low priority  power cut  net cut are not in our hand still get lp which is not cool
recommended
very nice game for me
recommended
this game managed to teach me that many cultures can enjoy a single game as well as enjoy a good cooperative experience then it falcon punched that lesson out of me and taught me such ideal fantasies never exist oh and also new languagesmainly curses im not complaining
recommended
want to play a nice simple game one with a friendly community maybe some balance well too bad because this is dota

after over 3000 hours of gameplay i can safely sum dota 2 up in two words the trench aka forced fifty you will win you will lose you will improve your skill but you will never improve your score wait for it no matter what why because of the trench  forcedfifty the better you get at this game the worse your teammates will be this is not a paradigm it is mechanically programmed into the game if you can carry 1 idiot on your team the game will handicap you with 2 skilled enough to carry 2 after a few games you will get 3 hardcore enough for 3 now you get fourever your teammates will  i  you not go out of their way to lose on purpose you picked another carry because it seemed logical well guess what i got a few replays that will show crybabies throwing the game so you cant compete for thier spotlight this is the only game where teammates enjoy losing because it means they can bring you down to their garbage level people literally buy and sell accounts off mmr because of  teammates and you will be a guinea pig in their money making ponzi schemes have fun wasting hours of your time on 4k mmr the alleged decent tier while you witness first hand feeders lose you the game minute by minute i could have been a doctor with those 3000 hours

recommended
rest in peace shaan never forget pls come back
recommended
this game is truly amazing you will have to stick with it for about 10 games before you begin to like it but afterwards it is a hardcore stratergy game where you will have to work with your team if you have any hope for victory i know from personal experience that once you have gotten into the game you just want to play more and with the new updates dota has really progressed and delivered a full fun game for everyone to play
recommended
doto is a game where you sit down with your kappachino mute the cykas and procede to feed until you flame you noob team who are obviously below the reddit average of 9k mmr more seriously  dota is a game where each team consisting of 5 different hero picks battle against each other with the ultimate goal of destroying the others base there are 3 routes to the base each of which is protected by several towers which along with the help of your team and creep waves can be destroyed each hero can buy different items and has various different skills to provide entertaining replayable games to all levels of players would recommend 1010

recommended
dota 2 is the best online multiplayer game ever but beware the community is cancerous
recommended
edited for 2015 dota 2 is a moba and quite possibly my favourite game of all time dota meaning defence of the ancients quite accurately describes the goal and purpose of what this game is you have to defend your ancient and to make it easier destroy your adversaries ancient  being the radiants or dires  to win the game dota is a game of momentum the more momentum you have the easier it becomes to play you kill creeps heroes and towers to gain momentum and collect gold to purchase items of high value which can make it easier to gain momentum by killing creeps towers and heroes and the cycle will continue until you overpower the enemy and destroy their ancient i believe it is superior to other games most notably lol my belief which id rather not go to discuss is based off of mechanics including creep blocking stacking and denying and in some cases the graphical standpoint why is it good because its good if you truely want to find out why its so good soak about 300 hours in and as soon as you know youll know
recommended
idk i just the best game ive ever played

very crappy matchmaking opponents too op bad graphics no first person view long loading screens unpolite and awfuly rude teammates that call you in many bad names even my grandmas toaster has a better frame rate and it also makes you crunchy bread heroes are called just like pornstars for example  queen of pain crystal maiden bounty hunter silencer witch doctor or just sounds a little bit too homosexual  lone druid razor batrider natures prophet beastmaster and tiny last but not least is magnus this hero does not only wield a name that`s destined for a huge  but his horn also looks like one too sadly heroes appearance is also poor meepo looks lika a rabbit that smokes weed before every round io is just a light bulb kunkka is the heihachi mishima from tekken morphiling is just water i think sven and juggernaut are twins storm spirit looks like an avarage asian man only he loves drinking energy drinks and watching tentacle porn too often natures prophet cannot even smell flowers because he has no possesion of a nose ogre magi has the nicest  hethey beat even cuties like mirana and windranger faceless void lets just call him eyeless dckhead all females look lets just say  pretty bangable annddddd magnus name says it all lastly i`d like to say that all maps are identical which makes game boring after a while and games ending is too predictable all items that i buy always disappear starting the next round and i hate when games dont have easter eggs or other skins for characters if you have read this until the end listen to me listen to the voice of reason turn off the computer go outside and discover all the things the world can give to you if you dont well welcome to the dota nation

recommended
dota 2 is a very intensive video game that is just as good as league of legends although it is somewhat lacking in its misogynistic protrayal of women where all the female heroes are highly sexualized and often oppressed by the patriarchal standards of the game there is only one strong female character both metaphorically and literally named legion commander and even she is highly sexualized and often the target of pornographic parodies although they are perfectly equal in the terms of gameplay valve has quite a ways to go before they reach the same plethora of wellcharacterized and nonsexualized female characters as riot games managed to do in league of legends therefore although the game is reasonably fun i cannot honestly recommend it to any mature gamers out there
not recommended
epic  thats all

i shouted at my screen and broke it and now i cant play
recommended
do not play this game it will ruin your life 910
recommended
25 hoursday wasnt enough for me to play this game
recommended
if you wish to learn russian quickly turn to no other programme than dota 2 unintentionally valve have came up with a brilliant tool to comprehend the angry sort of russian language for example  before trying a michael thomas or rossetta stone course consider dota for your soviet language learning experience thanks and have fun gabe newell now to be serious dota is extremely difficult to get your head around to start if you are new to mobas you will be lost and somewhat overwhelmed by the gameplay but as you advance in skill level and playing against rivals similar levels to you you then realise how fun the game is you will get raged at and you will fail but that is whole point of improving dota is brilliant
recommended
if you dont have it you are an idiot
recommended
frankly and honestly  dota 2 is awesome and great to play but one thing i disliked is about the steam wallet  i already add a minimum fund to my steam wallet and purchased a item on market  the thing i disliked is that you can`t withdraw your steam wallet money back to your paypal account or credit card  i think its unfair  what will happen if i got a big steam wallet fund in the future by selling some items i get from a game that i played hard  how can i withdraw my money to my paypal or credit card 
recommended
dota 2 has a huge fan base it is a great game with many customize features to heroes ingame ever since the original dota map from warcraft 3 it has made a huge come back in terms of graphics and gameplay in dota 2 id recommend this game in a heartbeat to those who love moba games
recommended
play 5 games and youll love it forever complex and challenging youll never feel like you have mastered this game the attention to detail is also great the graphics or heroe talk line makes the game so much more immersive on of the best multiplayer games i have ever played
recommended
an educational game that teaches and develops the required skills that was needed during much earlier times based on true historical facts dota 2 has given the player unique heroes throughout history so that the player is able to get an understanding of life in the early 1900s dota 2 also allows player to see the true horrors of war and allows them to get deep into the bloodshed so that they are able to learn about the true terrors when facing war it also helps the player develop their own strategies when in combat so that when the day comes they are battle ready and wont go down without a fight not only is dota 2 a historical game about combat but it also shows an indepth field of dedication this allows the player to not just learn about dedication whilst seeing their characters dedicated to their job so much so that they will kill themselves many times for a kill but also the player may also himself use his new skill of dedication upon the game itself after many years of dedication he may enter tournaments within the game and develop new skills like teamwork compassion bravery and even empathy so not only is dota 2 a historical game but it teaches the player unique skills for living day by day this is trully a master game and it cannot be compared against any other games of its genre dota2 history lifeskills 1010

yeah this game is in wild aye so many nights played whilst coned would recomend to all me mates like so ing good aye keep it real dota

one of my favorite games ever
recommended
dota 2 is literally one of the best games i have ever played i give the game 810 because it can be really hard at the beginning if you dont have anyone telling you how to play it dota 2 has about the same type of game as league of legends but i like dota 2 much better because its more reallife lol league of legends is almost the same just with comic book look alike textures and more champions if you dont agree with me then thumbs down your choice if you want to play a mmorpg game that has awesome and amazing textures you should definately download this game right now be sure to thumbs up if you agree or this made you wanna play it
recommended
yes i definetly recommend this game so much
recommended
much better then league of legends this is coming from someone who played lol since beta up until 6 months ago dota 2 shines above other games in the genre for these reasons 1 hero versatility 2 learning curve is steeper but more rewarding 3 games snowball less but if they do its for the right reasons 4 games are less likely to be decided early therefore there is always plenty of time for a comeback overall the game is much more rewarding for someone who is starting out in this genre highly recommended
recommended
i dont like the russian people and the spanish people but the game is fine

dota 2 is a moba multiplayer online battle arena game from valve in which you control one hero in an online 5vs5 game dota had its beginning in the beloved game warcraft3 as a modificated map dota 2 is hard to understand especially at the beginning u have much to learn but when you play a few matches and you start understanding the heroes and game mechanics you will fall in love with this game its also free to play so just try it 
recommended
this game focuses on the diverse relationships between different cultures and nationalities in a way that no other game can can after playing dota 2 you should understand the following  every other country is a   if you dont speak english youre a   if you speak english youre a   your country is a  after you understand these concepts you should fully realize the complex nature of this game and learn to hate 99% of the worlds population 810 better than lol

dota is strategy game where 10 players pick a hero and fight fight to win and make other 9 players lose ironically there are only two sides of conflict but you will have to mange its all out war there and war dont take prisioners at the end of day after games full of hate rage feed brain scarcity russia supremacy birth defects and your own shortcomings you will notice no one is a winner and text at the end of the game radiantdire victory give you only as much as few points of mmr a hollow rating feeding only your ego for that dota2 would be perfect for any antiwar commercials pointing at the end that in war there is no winner but for nolives like us it doesnt matter all we need is our own ego and mmr so we fight fight those other 9 players and hope hope we will see that side we are with wins hope that our mmr will reach as high as our ego hope that other 9 players will die from cancer or other painfull diseases every match every day ruins life and everything else 1010

not the friendliest community because it is expected that you learn quick or have some experience from doing a prehomework before playing it is not p2w which i like and you have a lot of heroes to choose from to play not needing to unlock them as they all are unlocked already from the start recommended to play with a premade team

as much as i only have 20 hours on this game there isnt much to talk about the game is addicting as  and can ruin your life if you dont control it its the same game over and over again two sides the same map same defences and ancients the sounds graphics and game play is just awsome however i do find the community to suck alot i do not have a problem with the russians but my problem is most of the people who do speak english are the most whiny  people and report if you dont do as they say then theres the unfair system of the penalty pool the fact that one can get reported with no evidence and suffer longer waiting times and ier  in conclusion i recomend people to play this game with a group of friends maybe time to time random servers but be careful that this game wont ruin your life

dota 2 the sequel to the great dota i highly recommend this if you are a big moba fan fantastic music voice acting game balance and much more if you are new to moba im not gonna say it to not play it but you could give it a try bad things russians are everywhere even in europe west east us east west they are everywhere even if they have their own matchmaking server they will call you a  for feeding which is not exactly true because they are not defending you pls report insert hero name here the report system it is so bad they can even report you for nothing for example if you didnt said anything in the game nor said bad words they can report you for nothing they can even report you if you have truth about this and that they will still report you unfairly and valve unfortunatly will never check the replay good things they changed the abandon system instead of hours and days they will give you games to finish it to be removen from the abandon pool customizable heroes you can give em hats wards weapons just like in team fortress 2 game events frostivus greeviling diretide wraithnight you have to try this game it has daily 500k people playing this game

community with toxicity levels rivaling the other horrible competitive games out there avoid it unless your warcraft 3 nostalgia is a large as your tolerance for humanitys pettiest of creatures nice people do play the game but they are overshadowed by the farlarger variety of unmedicated disorders that plague the gamer community as a whole whats worse is valve has three cash cow micropayment fests now and they dont look to be dissuaded from that theyve hidden it so well since theyre pricetagging holier than thou satisfaction percieved social status through cosmetics rather than skillremoving or advantage giving items its holding art assets to ransom instead of code i dont want to have to pay usd$249 to unlock the orange hev suit skin or classic crowbar reskin some day

very good for a free to play moba they semi recently they added a training mode that will cover some of the important basics wish they would add more to it which will give you a great starting point for this game when playing real people while mobas are known to be populated with toxic players ive only met a tiny portion of players that would fit this description give it a go it wont cost you anything but a bit of time

initially i more often play other games i was a bit dubious call my friend to play dota 2 because i have never played before battle arena game strategy but never expected to play dota 2 so fun unity cooperation caring etc with graphics that support and animation that is not inferior to other games make dota 2 is better than the first game  defend of the ancient by blizzard entertaiment 
recommended
best moba ever since valve took dota from blizzard and wc3 and turned it to something brand new it reached new heights and it keeps on climbing

frankly and honestly  dota 2 is awesome and great to play but one thing i disliked is about the steam wallet  i already add a minimum fund to my steam wallet and purchased a item on market  the thing i disliked is that you can`t withdraw your steam wallet money back to your paypal account or credit card  i think its unfair  what will happen if i got a big steam wallet fund in the future by selling some items i get from a game that i played hard  how can i withdraw my money to my paypal or credit card 
recommended
dota 2 has a huge fan base it is a great game with many customize features to heroes ingame ever since the original dota map from warcraft 3 it has made a huge come back in terms of graphics and gameplay in dota 2 id recommend this game in a heartbeat to those who love moba games
recommended
an educational game that teaches and develops the required skills that was needed during much earlier times based on true historical facts dota 2 has given the player unique heroes throughout history so that the player is able to get an understanding of life in the early 1900s dota 2 also allows player to see the true horrors of war and allows them to get deep into the bloodshed so that they are able to learn about the true terrors when facing war it also helps the player develop their own strategies when in combat so that when the day comes they are battle ready and wont go down without a fight not only is dota 2 a historical game about combat but it also shows an indepth field of dedication this allows the player to not just learn about dedication whilst seeing their characters dedicated to their job so much so that they will kill themselves many times for a kill but also the player may also himself use his new skill of dedication upon the game itself after many years of dedication he may enter tournaments within the game and develop new skills like teamwork compassion bravery and even empathy so not only is dota 2 a historical game but it teaches the player unique skills for living day by day this is trully a master game and it cannot be compared against any other games of its genre dota2 history lifeskills 1010

25 hoursday wasnt enough for me to play this game
recommended
much better then league of legends this is coming from someone who played lol since beta up until 6 months ago dota 2 shines above other games in the genre for these reasons 1 hero versatility 2 learning curve is steeper but more rewarding 3 games snowball less but if they do its for the right reasons 4 games are less likely to be decided early therefore there is always plenty of time for a comeback overall the game is much more rewarding for someone who is starting out in this genre highly recommended

dota 2 is literally one of the best games i have ever played i give the game 810 because it can be really hard at the beginning if you dont have anyone telling you how to play it dota 2 has about the same type of game as league of legends but i like dota 2 much better because its more reallife lol league of legends is almost the same just with comic book look alike textures and more champions if you dont agree with me then thumbs down your choice if you want to play a mmorpg game that has awesome and amazing textures you should definately download this game right now be sure to thumbs up if you agree or this made you wanna play it

graphics  detailed heroes  nice animation and effects  living setting  blured textures balance  very good hero balance  video tutorials for beginners  train with ki  very hard for beginners game size  currently 108 heroes  over 120 items  many tactics  only 1 map sound  diverse hero sounds  nice music  nice battle sounds  71 surround language  learn easy different languages russian spain etc  welcome to dota 2 they say before concluding with you suck theyre not wrong for the first dozen hours or so youll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players but if you persevere dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense teambased multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming a fantastic freetoplay model dota 2 has become notorious even among its moba peers for its difficulty  and thats totally justified its a doubleedged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a worldclass game at the highest levels you should not expect to have fun your first day playing or even your first week maybe months dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counterintuitive practice of killing your own ai units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves and understanding the effects of hundreds of abilities like bloodseekers rupture which deals huge damage with every step you take is a big barrier to entry even figuring out which of the 108 heroes fits you best is a timeconsuming challenge your learning has just begun when youve settled on what roles heroes and builds suit you best  you also have to adapt based on what other players choose if the other team plays a riki you need to compensate with an emphasis on detection go up against bloodseeker and his hideously powerful rupture will force you to carry around a town portal scroll to get home shop system only cosmetic enhancements almost all of which are created by the community tournament goodies such as tickets for viewing live events are for sale theres not a single paid on the ingame balance and thats great in short words dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other mix of strategy and rpg skill management and tactical gameplay 108 heroes each with their own style and combat abilities most heroes have 4 skills that can be increased in power by levelling up by killing enemys there are over 120 items to choose from within each game each with their own ways to power up your stats and active abilities creeps that charge down the games three lanes and the player controlled heroes on the opposite team theres a huge time investment before you can enjoy a game it creates a playing field where skill and teamplay is top priority the best dota game many heroes items and a great balance thanks for reading if you like my review give me a thumbs up in steam not the youtube video i make this for the community and your help is greatly appreciated

i used to play this game in order to clear my mind and relax from playing league of legends but now its exactly the opposite very addictive game loads of fun coming from someone with a fair amount of experience in mobas loads of heroes to choose from all free to use with purchasable skins tons of items and possible item builds some nice workshop content and a lot of support from the community community overall is not perfect but you will never find a perfect gaming community i recommend this game to people who enjoy playing battle arena games and remember youre playing for fun not to win

dont play this game ever  blyat davai harush tangina bobo 1110 would abandon again

great game but there is a huge learning curve if you want to play this game i highly suggest you do it with friends but if you want to do it solo make sure to have a thick skin cause the comunity is about as friendly to newcomers as a cactus still if you get past the learning curve and the prickly community be ready to enjoy hundreds of hours of the best multiplayer experience you will ever have

i hate this game like seriously i hate all of this like i have learned to hate things i cannot understand peoples i have never met and emotions ive never know to feel before i playd this game its like learning just to fail it tests the limits of humanity in a philosphical way that degrades the mind and stamps on the soul why did i ever play this why did i particpate and ignore the warnings of others and sink all this time into this madness this game is like your crush continuosly telling you she doesnt like you and slowly pushing you out of his or her life this review says i have around 400 hours of gameplay but you dont understand every one hour of stress is about 5 more hours and self hate loathing and mass sprits of depression man this stinks

a game with an amazing community which never fails to blame everybody else when they make mistakes dota teaches a variety of different languages including the infamous russian which teaches players to despise anybody who does not speak english as their first language as well as being multicultural the dota 2 matchmaking is just phenomenal it always ensures you are put with first class russian feeders which really improves the gameplay as it allows you to be unable to play a game of dota without experiencing the variety of different styles of play that this game offers to the community as a whole this game encourages suicidal thoughts rage and possible brain hemorrhages andor heart attacks 1010 would uninstal then reinstal 11 vodkas  cyka blyat mid or fid

i have played this game for roughly 78 hours so i am definitly no pro but from a new persons perspective noob i can tell you that dota 2 is possibly the most addictive and rewarding games you could possibly play but it can be very rage enducing especially when you are not winning or lose but at the end all of this is what makes it a great game it compells you to get better and want to get better and improve your game and skills to eventually play against human players rather than ai controlled bots

review for  dota 2 review by  weebj dota 2 is the remake of a moba mod that was applied to warcraft 3 frozen throne it is a mindchallenging teamplay game that require skills and teamwork most of my experience from this game is positive i prefer to play carry or initiator as i have played alot of hours on smurf accounts i have a bit of experience on the ranked and experienced side of the game the thing that bothers me with ranked match making is that after your calibrating games you either get into the best mmr possible or the worst you could ever imagine anyways the best thing with dota is that it always evolves which means that updates and patches are frequently released to balance the game and the players experience there are also cosmetic items that are often added with the patch updates gameplay consists of different roles in a 5man team either you start in the radiant or dire team support offlane mid and carry are a few roles that i recommend you having in almost every dota game the game itself is about destroying the enemy teams ancient which is a giant building located abovebelow your spawn the easiest tactic to making you and your team win the match is to make sure your carry gets farm kills and hisher core items this is crucial because if your carry cant farm or has bad farm it will cripple your team without a good carry your team will succumb to the enemies carry which hopefully in their favor has farmed better or has already completed hisher core items the offlane role is all about going alone to get experience in the lane which is located at the top lane on both sides of the team this will gain your offlaner early levels and the hero of choice should always have an escapeinvisibility ability in hisher ability pool having an escape mechanism will keep himher from panicking and boosting their selfconfidence of commiting to their own team and gameplay the midlaner is often a ranged hero but its normal with melee heroes or a high damage nuker that is going alone on the middle lane the midlaner will be facing a hero of the enemys choice that will participate in trying to take control of the midlane from you popular mid heroes are storm spirit ember spirit sniper dragon knight lina pudge death prophet night stalker huskar necrophos and more heroes like necrophos death prophet storm spirit and lina are nukers which have lowcooldown highdamaging spells in their ability pool these heroes are the easiest heroes of taking control in the midlane by using your highdamage lowcooldown spells the enemy will often retreat from the midlane to seek health and mana regen in their fountain the midlaner also plays an important role in the ganking scene pudge storm spirit huskar sniper ember spirit dragon knight and lina are gankers which can sneak away from the midlane to other lanes where they can help the other laners to gain kills which will result in an experience and gold boost to your carryofflaner the midlaner should also get a bottle which they can store important runes in runes are special abilities that spawn in form of orbs in the bottom and top of the river in small areas of light these runes have abilities such as haste max movement speed regeneration fully regenerates your hp and mana invisibility makes you invisibile for some time and bounty runes which gives you experience and gold runes spawn every 2 minutes of the game and theres a 100 percent chance one of them will be a bounty rune the carry will often going to lane on the safe lane which on the radiant side is bot lane and the top lane on the dire side the carry should always have a support with himher which is a hero that is going to support the carry through the lanephase the carry needs last hits on creeps enemy units that spawn every 30th second with those last hits he will gain gold ranging from 3849 gold per last hit the carry is a crucial role and is needed to play with ease and care mistakes usually result in a permanent mark for your team if your carry has succeeded with his farming he is often going to finish his core items in the lategame being a support is also a crucial role in the game as the support is standing for all the wards and the courier in the game a ward is an item that gives vision of an area where it was placed if the ward was placed on a higher ground hilltop or all seeying eyespots it will gain unobstructed vision which is also a great thing for your team as you can see the enemy advance or preparing for a gank the supports ability pool often consists of a stundisable which is casted upon the enemy the enemy will then be disabled and cannot movecast spells during the disable duration this is an easy way to set up ganks and kills for your carry supports are very squishy but masters in the teamfights no crucial items is needed for a support but i recommend force staff blink dagger wards tranquil bootsarcane boots pipe of insight and mekansm dota is a game that once again requires teamplay tactics and good planning always look up a guide on how to play the game correctly or how to play the current hero you are playing it always helps pros  game never gets boring even though you loose a match you always get that great sense of today im gonna win this match  you can play with your friends in parties up to five  combinations of hero picks and playstyle is unending cons  russians  feeders  supports without any wards  carry players that cant carry  the feeling of a lost game when it comes to russians the only thing i hate with them is that they believe that everyone in their game speaks russian if you dont speak russian you are a gamburger which they are referring to you as an american even though you are playing on eu west etc they queue on all of the servers their language preference is all of the languages chinese english russian etc they barely listen to their teammates they believe they are superior to everyone else in the game and if they dont get what they want they will usually feed or get extremely mad at everyone a tip from me always be nice never say a bad word if someone is flaming mute them keep playing to help your team and remember to never flame back it will usually result in loss of a match and people are most likely not to listen to flamers and will just mute you which results you in being isolated from all communication with your team developer  valve publisher  valve genre  action free to play strategy released on steam on 9 jun 2013 i recommend dota 2 because it is an addictive and fun game to fuel your moba needs

dota 2 is your ordinary high school classroom it has affluent kids who have all the latest hats thinking that precal subjects can be passed with these most of the time they only want to showoff and has no real understanding of the subject it has absurdlygifted students those with high match ratings who turn into snobs when forced to work with members inferior to them little did they know that it is they who serve as role models to their less intelligent mates a class clown happens to be in the same subject some of the time these people are so funny that you wish they do not get grouped with you air heads who do things repetitively and who seem not to get on the teams conversations farm  get killed  respawn rinse and repeat then the average reasonable dudes some of them think too highly of themselves while others have the potential of being your friends did i mention ladies they are not myths they exist however they are as rare as women in engineering classes if you survived high school this game is for you ps ironically the average age for people playing this game is less than seven 1010

i got on this game from a professional blind gamer prospective this game has been hyped by me and it took me a while to get it because my computer was ruined in 911 after being  by my doctor my dog drove me to a warehouse where i got get my proper drug supply from the local blacks upon loading the game up for the first time a ping pong ball fired from kelly littlehales steaming  cracked the screen i got covered with gay 6 months and 9 murder victims later i cockinyourass prayed the gay out and was on my way to master dota my first game i laid down the law and killed isis i was called by gabe newell to star in his upcoming porno i of course accepted and with my 18 pound walrus  made a name for myself in the porn industry 9 out of 11 worst part is that i cant jerk off teemos rat

i think its about damn time i wrote a review about my favourite game ever 1600 hours in it and here it is this game is dope as hell never have i spent close to this amount of time in a game before brings back some good memories of warcraft 3 and i feel that i have a special connection to this game im sure anyone else who has tried any of the games in the warcraft series would have the same nostalgic feeling that i too have when i play the game has a really unique hero collection in which none are op and every hero counters and gets countered by another hero making the game much more fair furthermore all the characters are free and the only thing you can buy is sets and items to make your hero look much cooler purchases dont affect the actual heros stats thus the game is very fair as compared to other games that i know{yes im talking about lolthe name says it all the game is a joke p} i definitely recommend this game to anyone who is perseverant and doesnt quit after getting rekt by riki haha dota is all about practice and youll make it there eventually i know the dota community can sometimes be very rude and harsh but instead of looking your teammates comments about you as insults learn to take it as advice that you can follow in the future unless hes just a raging kid in which case you just mute him i hope this review will encourage potential dota players to try the best game ever created and create your own legacy 3

dota 2 one can only describe the unimaginable complexity that is dota 2 as you would describe a painful stitch you sometimes get when exercising for a while just like a stitch dota 2 only gets better if you keep going and never stop you musnt stop you know you cant stop you may try to stop but you know that if you do you will be forever consume by the inevitable pain and fatigue you see dota 2 is not simply a mere game for your enjoyment dota 2 is a endless path once you step foot on will forever lead you to a freight train that delivers false emotion and hope crushing dreams and desire im afraid your already too late no turning back now dota 2 is a part of you now sure enough though it will consume you entirely 1010 would dota again help me

nothing has improved gameplay wise from the original dota while some heroes have changed a lot visual artwork is garbage worst colour palette ive ever seen and hero models are so generic that you cant distinguish them from lane minions community is more toxic and hostile than ever before leaversafkersquiters run rampant i mean seriously how is it possible not to have a decent report system in 2015 that can handle these players my advice if you are a true fan of dota just play the original warcraft 3 custom map either that or move to lolhonsmite this game is a disgracereally shame

i have played a game that has similarities to this one it is called league of legends i can tell you this if you are one of those subhumans that think lol is a decent game i feel for you i pray to valve gods that riot sinks into the sea and you all are saved from the horrors that lie deep within the lol george to the apostles 216 dota is the game to go with if you are a male in your 30s and you love to hit it off with actual humans then play dota but i suggest being part of the pc master race before playing if one plays on a mac you will find it hard to be liked people will ask why you are playing on a toaster or what is this mac you speak of on the third day gaben had cometh and said to all the subhumans in conjuction to himself illumanatii belive that is how you spell itwait i mean the orange box 20 will include hl3 lsd cocaine and cocaine accesories gaben illumanati 2019 pretty much dota 2 is good unless you are a dingo babyeating coco puffsniffing turtle soup  a loyal rito consumer

dota 2 like any game has pros and cons pros > free to play not pay to win > the graphics are great > complex gameplay and mechanics > a lot of characters to to choose from > your heroes are customizeable cosmetical items > dota 2 has a thriving international competitive scene > never gets boring > constant updates cons > constant updates > peole only seem to play the same try hard heroes every game > dota 2 has a bad community not everyone but most of the community is really unsupportive and not beginnerfriendly > bad matchmaking you get matchmade with players who are either too inexperienced for your level or have too much experience > unbalanced characters some of these try hard heroes are just too over powered and others very weak dota 2 is a game of strategy skill and teamwork do not forget teamwork far superior to any free 2 play game i have tried so far i recomend it but try not to choose the same try hard heroes over and over then think you are good at dota

strangely addictive after youve figure out one hero alternatively frustrating and exhilirating interesting events nice when you have a team or bunch of friends but also good to play solo love the hero items and effects agonizing to play when the internet connection is bad or when you have abusive teammates every game even played with the same people is different infinite combinations of heroes items usage and player skills takes some time to get the hang of any hero at first but some help always helps hahaha  enjoy

ok a lot of mlg pros and fanboys were butthurt at my original dota review so heres my edit i guess my main reason for hatred towards dota 2 is aside from it being just another ing moba game is this valve picked creating this game over many many others keep in mind gabe newell and valve overall picked this game over stars of blood they picked this game over half life 3 they picked this game over left 4 dead 3 and this is just kinda spitballing but they picked this game over maybe ing portal and team fortress 3 thats my honest reason on why i hate dota 2 its just a generic moba game when valve had tons of other decisions i expected more out of valve i expected more out of gabe newell when you finally start working your fat  on said games instead ofthisill respect you again but even still i will never forgive your ing decision

its a big deal yknow

when i first started dota2 i was a little overwhelmed as my first artsmoba game it was pretty complicated i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying before i knew it i was performing  and better i stopped making silly  and  got vastly better at not  the enemy  for the  part everyone ive met was very helpful and  there  the   however as   play dota2

i hate competitive games especially mobas and starcraft this one however managed to suck me in with vs bots game mode and cosmetic items store im still not sure how or why it happened but i do enjoy playing dota and sometimes i even play vs people even though it makes me want to cry or yell in rage there are few major issues with dota 2 at the moment 1 absence of communication between developers and players dev forums seem to exist only for players since thousands of bugs especially cosmetic ones and suggestions simply remain ignored 2 infrequent content updates and lack of features they couldve at least allowed us to play game modes from different events to diversify gameplay or added new maps instead they keep focusing on adding new cosmetic items 9 out of 10 updates only include hats game folder keeps growing but nothing changes gameplaywise they even stopped adding new bots to my favourite game mode 3 constant server side issues which they cant fix there are issues with downloading replays reconnecting to games watching matches searching for games and even finishing matches without somebody getting crashes or disconnects 4 a lot of racism swearing and general anger towards other players especially russians report system is completely inadequate and doesnt help at all i would recommend dota 2 because its cute and wellthought game with amazing voiceovers and excellent replayability i do advise however against spending money in their store since once your start you cannot stop this is probably how drug addiction works  they pull you in with free stuff and then you just want to complete a set buy new items because of the modified effects gamble for a chance to get some common item which would later cost hundreds of dollars valve deliberately removes some items to drive up prices find some unusual courier which could easily compensate all of your spendings or plunge yourself into poverty if you get unlucky with chests

ahhh dota 2 this game is severaly unbalanced since no matter how well you play your team will always blame you for the loss it is also insanely luck based because the team that gets most russians usually looses a lot of functions in this game are completely broken as well for example even if you pick english in the language bar everyone still speaks russian sometimes german or french but never english playing this game i had a few mental breakdowns and smashed three windows in total it sometimes feels like my life is fading away and i imagine life in prison with a really musculine inmate would provide the same level of  to sum up this is game is ing terrible 1010 would recommend

dota 2 is a hardcore moba game with the high production value of a valve game great graphics animations and music there are many heroes and items with interesting mechanics and many combinations between the two of them that can make the game enjoyable having a big studio behind it and loads of fans from warcraft 3 times made it very easy for dota 2 to become an competitive game and esport but for me is not enough to hide one of the biggest flaws this game has which is rng dota 2 has loads of items and heroes based on procs and other random elements which leaves many fights in this game to chance a thing that i dislike so much in pvp games dota 2 is a good game but is not the pvp game im looking for

this game is complete  here are a few reasons why 1 there is no creativity when it comes to them naming the champions heroes for those of you who are butthurt 2 the camera does not auto lock so you gotta keep moving the mouse to see where your character is going 3 half the map is all sunny but the other half is really dark and edgy that i get cuts while traversing through it and 4 the items are  the casting is terrible no summoner spells and no b to recall tldr if youre not a wow  stay away from this game

first all heroes are totally free so dota 2 is not a paytowin game second each round is really dynamic and active so the player can make their chance to win when theyre in a bad situation

stop playing lol and wow play a game that requires real skill just remember you suck at dota2 til you have about 500 games won takes about 3045 minutes per game and youre not winning a majority of your games editwrote that review when i had played less than 30 hours of the game having played almost 1000 hours on dota2 now i stick by my previous assessment that dota ing sucks i will  you in it though d
recommended
i find it amusing because id actually say that dota2 is a bit easier to deny just rightclick league you actually have to plan ahead and play significantly more cleverly to deny predict your enemys backingroam more and be able to clear waves to use the tower instead the mind games play a much larger role as well as efficient use of skills rather than just buying hardcounter items to match a given situation the trouble is it looks simpler at first glance while actually offering far more depth strategy and complexity so those who play at a low level never actually see anything more than simplified gameplay and quickly go back to d2 or hon and nothing of value was lost

recommended
awesome gameplay amazing graphics smooth animation definitely better than dota itself valve had made one of the greatest decision in the world to remade dota with awesome features and better graphic but behind its awesomeness theres something that dota 2 lacks and thats its community selfish player lots of flames and verbal abuse ingame definitely make the game worse well despite that therere also a lot of good player inside and playing with friends should be the best solution avoiding verbal abusing people so grab your friends and play little by little youll be better

funny game competitive every match is different and best support and innovation ive seen in a long time in a game and all this for free yeah i could say we are in front of the best moba game in the market but i can say some things that are not that great though about dota 2 at the end of this review its true that this game is bringing the best innovation ive seen in a long time in a videogame this industry is a bit stuck in making money giving just enough for the clients and players and then adding more to pay via dlcs some times they even launch a game that is a beta at 50 bucks price or higher when i talk about innovation i mean for example about the best support for watching games replays and tournaments but the bad side of this is that if you want to watch tournament games all of them requires a ticket to be bought except the only free yearly tournament that is the international being the only exception also the visual customization of the heroes is insane you can customize by separated parts helm shoulders arms body legs weapon just like in a mmo and even some animations or skills and you can trade all of your items in the market or with friends the great thing about this game compared to others like league of legends is that paying money does not affect to gameplay just visuals in league of legends paying money gave you the advantage of having more and better runes and more rune pages for example giving you a little advantage in a competitive scenario also you need to buy some heroescharacters or you cant play all of them when you feel the need to even when you can buy those things without money its almost impossible to get everything without paying even if you play a lot big limitations to competitive gameplay in dota 2 there is no restriction you play every hero you play with every skill also there is a lot of other great things like user skill and item builds and guides that you can select and use ingame and rate up or down you can customize your own for each hero and even the announcer if you have one among other things then what is the bad side of dota 2 first of it you always need a team in order to play or get some fun solo matchmaking is not just bad its horrible no matter how good you are and how long youve been playing this game you will end up with drunk players idiots trolls bored players who are not focused on the game and this is on both sides of the game in your team or in the other report system doesnt work at all maybe just a bit for excessive cases and even if you play with friends in a full team you wont find balanced games the common issue here is either you roflstomp the other team or they roflstomp yours even if you played great of course playing with a full party of friends can decrease the chances this happens but even with that playing a good balanced funny and competitive game will be hard this said they need to implement some kind of public ranking system in order to maybe avoid that a little and then maybe the things could become really better but overall this is a great game with a very good support from their developers constantly adding content and not just focusing on getting your money something rare to find nowadays in the industry
recommended
the game where all s gather if you thought annoying cod kids were too much then you havent experienced dota2 yet its full of obnoxious rude people who have absolutely no idea what a coop  team game is about and constantly whine about stolen kills like if this was some fps the following list contains the type of people you will meet in dota 1 12 year olds thinking they know everything and play dota for life while skipping school 2 people who cant speak english at all despite playing with the english language filter 3 reporters who do nothing but  about everyone else and report them for everything 4 multiple account pros who constantly swear about how their team sucks 5 idiots who tell you to attack 1v5  close range against long  ask you to help and then run away 6 quitters 7 mr afk who gives up at the start of the game and just hangs around spawn 8 new players who get talked down for not completely understanding the game after 2 seconds 9 extremely rare but nice and helpful people worst community ever

do you hate having sex with women and would rather spend your time in an angry haze of racism and nerdy rage bonars well i have the game for you pal for only free dollars you can harrass strangers online and forget to click accept game one time and be unable to play for 30 minutes as a punishment free disciprin for playing a game sign me up am i right deepest mechanics of any multiplayer game without only relying on twitch reflex skills but thoughtful planning and careful execution if youve ever been on the giving end of a perfect gank youll want to put a couple hundred hours in or so before you decide whether you can deal with the 10 year olds and south americans
recommended
1st hour of this game  man this game is ing boring rest  this game is so addictive o_o <3
recommended
i am addicted to this game now lol
recommended
definitely a mustplay game for all rts gamers a long history runs through dota ever since its formation back in the early 2000s i have loved the game for years now and the first time i played dota 2 was back in 2012 while i was using my 1st steam account that account is no longer working dota 2 is a game that rellies heavily on teamwork and such overall just play the game you wont regret it
recommended
how can i get the redemtion code here 
recommended
dota 2 is awesome game id like to play in my laptop but i have low specs hehe thats why i rent in a computer shop

best moba out there good gameplay decent graphics and tons of fun this game will ruin your social lifeif you have one

this game seems to be a copycat of league of legends very unoriginal valve is dead to me
recommended
omg gais fix dis pls roshan meks ma gem lag he keeps hiatting me and my gaem lags so i caynt move d 110  its okay
recommended
dota 2 is a moba in which you dont need big bucks to be better than anyone else a new player is just like an old player with the only differenece being the experience the game is balanced to a very high degree and has a lot of tournements with stupidly large prize pools the heroes are fun and unique and the mechanics are great in my opinion it is the best game in this genre so far
recommended
amzin game to loss time lol its really coool try it
recommended
this game rocks you can choose between a variety of players and with 5v5 you can experience insanely awesome combat please take note that the animation might be different
recommended
i have learned countless pinoy curse words throughout the game 1010 would learn curse words again
recommended
this game what can i say about it it has a great selection of heroes with an absolute perfect balance with each one a excellent combat system that is as paramount as the original defense of the ancient a store that does not sell you items that will  off the opponent a map design that doesent have those ing bushes where people can hide and jsut ing ambush you when you walk by like in lol and a ingame item system that can actually effect the outcome of the game but what i hate about this game i quite a big list first there is no surrender button therefore if you know you are going to lose you would need to sit there for twenty minutes getting killed over and over again till your ancient falls also the community surronding the game is somewhat of a  first there are the racist comments then there are the spanish and the russians that cant even speak a word of english but overall this game i find is quite good why dont you come down to the sea servers where everyone shuts up and plays the game

owning
recommended
want to develop a lifelong hate for all eastern europeans throw away your schooling so you can impress your friends and people you will never meet receive high levels of abuse learn russian and portuguese then this is the game for you dota 2 provides all of the above in a tight free to play package that will end up costing you hundreds as you try to keep up with the large quantities of cosmetics that come out daily
recommended
this game is one of the worst games ever made

recommended
this game is like the easier version of lol it also doesnt do sexy art for the females and has no lolis
recommended
ive only played this game a little but so far its pretty cool
recommended
dota 2 is dota on a new engine if i was to compare it only to its predecessor it is the whole package you get the game that you loved with the beauty of the source engine if you come from playing other newer moba style games this is the granddaddy of those games reborn and hey free to check out if it is for you or not so there is that too

like this game very much when im ing high and playing for the fun not to win its only a game  ruski bljad allahu akbar
recommended
a thoroughly intricate game with massive emphasis put on both skills and knowledge it is not recommended for casual gamers or for those seeking for some easy enjoyment with over a hundred heroes with their own unique abilities and ways to specifically build and play said heroes as well as their weaknesses and strengths when paired with other heroes it is arguably comparative to dynamic chess if not more complicated coupled with the iconic map as well as over a hundred items there is no possible hope of having a sense of deja vu in this game of course it entails an extremely steep learning curve but those who are willing to plough through the enourmous amounts of literature on the game and develop the necessary skills to make them competent will be greatly rewarded albeit at the cost of their social lives which has sadly happened to me of course there is no end to learning in dota it is said that only 50% of the time is spent in the game the rest is spent on reading up skills builds and other playstyles as well as watching videos of professionals duking it out with each other whether one derives enjoyment in self improvement through reading and watching is another matter on the other hand the infamous dota community is a force to be reckoned with as they are not so forgiving as communities of other games such as starcraft a piece of advice for newcomersdont let negative comments put you off the game everybody has to start somewhere
recommended
amazing gameplay yet with a huge learning curve definitely the best moba until this day f2p a fair game id say there are 100 heroes and theyre all balanced  you can pay for hatscosmetics but they dont affect the game itself but the game experience as they only change the interface or your heros outfitanimationeffect the workshop is strong with this one yoda this game has a lot of attention it is updated fixed balanced as fast as noticed necessary there are also some cool events throughout the year englobes many different strategies and play styles that will widen your vision clutch skills teamwork and help you improve your prestidigitation requires training if you want to play this game you should be openminded willing to learn you may play this for years and still be able to learn new stuff all in all its totally worth it and yeah we now have techies d gg 1010 heres a good and detailed guide httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid237442680

recommended
much better than dota
recommended
how 2 review this thing you will make friends from around the world you will be blown away by peoples ignorance and by your own budding racism you will discover subtleties and nuances that make you want to improve you will throw your mouse across the room youll blow money on unnecessary cosmetic items but each character and item is so highly distinctive each set of voice responses so vast and amusing nonexploitative character designs an extremely attentive and crowdsourced development philosophy in spite of having just one playing field dota2 manages to feel like something thats constantly happening as you play it
recommended
i finally understood why we went to war with peru in 1932 good job valve d
recommended
i got shouted at 1010 goty
recommended
dotka is a good game i feel like it ripped of the more superior league of legends though but its a good game nonetheless doesnt require any skill and is a good game
recommended
this game is very good fun maybe a bit difficult to pick up at first but stick with it and im sure that youll get the hang of it it has a great range of unique characters that are all very fun to use its a bit of a shame that you are only given a small selection of them each round as it means that even if you have a favourite you wont always be able to play as them still i recommend this game for anybody who enjoys strategy and winning  this game might be a bit laggy if you have a lot of other stean games thats the one reason why i dont still have it or warframe
recommended
it s awesome game
recommended
rosetta stone was a rip off compared to this i learned russian in a couple minutes after my first game >well played 1010

recommended
having fun playing this game
recommended
this game really amazing
recommended
when i first tried to play dota 2  around the same time it came out  i made the mistake of jumping right on in thinking i knew exactly what i was doing obviously failing i gave up and left about tenminutes later and throughout the course of a few months i did this about fivetimes because i wanted to understand what the big deal was about it and why people found and still find this game so addictive up until recently i hated it with a passion  not only for being killed overandover  but also for the sheer complexity of it overall but now i know i wasnt taking the time to actually appreciate that complexity and realise that the learning curve was so full of depth that if you set your mind to it you can seriously enjoy it considering its all based around one map with the same gamemode every time its evident youd think itd get boring quickly  but youd be wrong even though this is the case theres so many different heroes with different abilities and different playstyles it just makes it more enticing its also extremely strategic and teammates count for everything which means youll be working together and maybe even making some more friends in conclusion this game is worth every hour youre willing to invest into it and if you enjoy learning teamwork and have an addictive personality like me then those hours are going to be endless

this game is extremely fun to play very teambased but it still involves a lot of player skill dont be discouraged if you play your first match and die 20 times this game has a very large learning curve and you will become a good player with practice i recommend playing a game with bots before you play against players this gives you an idea of the mechanics of the game as well as some of the heros abilities overall a very great gameand free

a great game everyone should try if they like league of legends dota 2 is very similar to lol in many ways with the gameplay shops and graphics although in lol you have to buy items and there is no way to trade or earn anything plus in lol you get skins in dota you get sets with individual pieces you can mix and match to your hearts content and get discounted items from the steam community market a must play game 5 out of 5 stars <3

awesome game though you need to get into it its so complex in what you can do in order to win newer edit the game is pretty it runs well its kinda balanced some stuff is unbalanced and it is fun  if you play with the right people these can be random guys which is not very frequent but possible its overcrowded with  well lets say  but if you dont feed their trollmouths you will be okay have not played ranked in weeks i am going to start very soon again old edit just letting this in for reasons dont ever ing play ranked though im at the point of writing having 600 hrs of dota on record and played a ranked match i got matched with 4 greeks nothing bad so far they had a gametime range of 10002000hrs my enemies had ranges from 20002500 where is the fairness i thought that if id play ranked alone i would not get matched with people that are premade this was ing unfair and i do not like that

dota 2 is the kind of game that attracts hardcore gamers with the combination of buying the right items that affects the if you win or loose to the simple clicks you make to move your hero this game is one of the best free to play games with all the content the developers bring you dota 2 is meant for people who are good at multitasking and strategy in this game you have to make decisions to kill a hero only to be killed by another hero or destroying that building that will help win the game however you will die and the enemy team will get more money dota 2 is an exceptional 9510 game

i remember the first time i played a moba back in starcraft playing aos which was later remade in warcraft aeon of strife aos thats how we came to know games of its like afterwards tides of blood popularized the custom map variant and the original dota and its ilk about 100 different or so versions of it spammed the custom map channels until all stars came in and swept the competitions now we see dota 2 here nearly a decade later and i have to say its even better than it was back then the balance now is impeccable not withstanding popular competitive picks the community is friendlier than lol or hons to say the least and although more complex than its competitors the game gives you everything from the start its a difficult game to be sure but as a rtsrpg hybrid it contains depths of strategy tactical complexity and splitsecond reflex gameplay that is sure to delight and impress any gamer dota 2 is a highly polished esport designed to draw in and awe is it perfect no is it good you bet for those of you who dont know what dota 2 is dota is a mobile online battle arena otherwise known as moba you control a singular hero and play in a team of five heroes whos task is to protect their ancient home base all while laying siege to the enemy ancient the team who destroys the opposing ancient wins the game in conclusion i highly recommend anyone to check this game out you wont be disappointed
recommended
great game not comparable to lol at all the entire play feels different good strategic game nice heros some op some not  learn to counter russians are a problem but you get over it eventually and yeah lets hope you have some strong friends because after this youll be screaming their head off but who am i kidding if youre playing this you dont have friends
recommended
if you rage quicklyi recomend getting a steel mouse and keyboard
recommended
its an amazing game  technically outstanding showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail especially in the allimportant multiplayer aspects the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying it took me a long time to warm up to but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends if you can spare the time  play it
recommended
1110 like skyrim with a money vacuum
recommended
pretty good hoping for a sequel
recommended
well like every other new and popular game that your friends force you into joining dota2 is worth staying in very heavy focus on team play stunning graphics massive heroheroine selection and the only thing you actually need to pay for is cosmetics honestly i dont care much for the flamewar between dota and lol seriously shut up already  its obvious dota 2 is better
recommended
no scheduled maintenance every week a game that is always available 24 hours a day 7 days a week

a blast from the past and a major landmark for competitive gaming dota was originally a warcraft iii mod which immediately became a crowd favorite the deep learning curve provides a true strategic experience and will keep you on your feet with the enormous pool of different heroes to pick from along with the collection of items that you can build you can create multiple ways of approaching a situationfight this game is not easy to pick up however the basic mechanics can be quickly picked uptaught with the revision backed by valve dota 2 is sparking up the esports scene once again it is providing another source of life to a game that was part of the few that started the whole competitive scene overall although the game might seem overcompetitive it is definitely a great game to have fun with a group of friends and can provide numerous amounts of fun and laughter games of the same genrebasic mechanics mobas are  league of legends lol and heroes of newerth hon

when i first saw dota as a map on warcraft iii  i didnt like it and i almost hated it it was so hard to play and it was hard to process the buying system and a tons of other things buy when dota 2 came out  it had better graphics  better gameplay  humor  faster shopping system and it was easier to play i mean real easier  so i recommend this game a lot and this game is free  for a person like me that lives in a country that doesnt have acsess to an american credit card this thing that the game is free was like the gates of heaven opening to me i love this game so much and its awesome

recommended
dota has become one of the most popular games ever being one of the top 10 most played games on steam heres why the learning curve some might say this is the worst part of the game but almost no one can deny that its what gets you addicted and stuck in this world of heroes might and magic like any traditional moba each hero has its own distinctive role from support to carry and many other positions dota focuses mainly on building your character up in the beginning of a match and then through teamwork and strategy going head to head with the other team and pushing destroying the enemy teams towers creeps etc all the way to their ancient leading to its destruction and victory it might sound strange to someone who may be unfamiliar with moba style games but its an art and science within itself with millions of diehard fans constantly urging themselves to become better and more efficient with their playing styles with the inclusion of the 100 available characters there are at least five different ways to play each character meaning there is an insane amount of replayability already staked onto the stellar online multiplayer experience of both casual experienced and professional dota 2 players the games learning curve will take at least 40 hours of ingame time and potentially hours of research outside of the game youtube wikis etc which can seem like a major turn off for a game such as this however there is an offline practice mode available for new players to hone their skills and find out what characters they enjoy playing the most ive read the other reviews for dota 2 and found that many people are upset with russians and chinese going on us servers causing a language barrier and potentially losing games because of that i will admit this is a problem that will hopefully be fixed in the near future as it is rather problematic and detrimental to emerging victorious in a dota 2 match in conclusion dota 2 is a great game and has become one of my personal favourite games of all time the amazing diversity of every match the fantastic community and the overall amount of content being added every month is astonishing plus its a free to play not a pay to win its legitamately a f2p game what do you got to lose give dota 2 and try and find out what everyone is talking about you wont regret it

dota allstars was the one that started the moba gaming genre pretenders to the throne such as hon or lol were no match of what the mighty valve have done rebooting the mod into an award winning game to me each hero has a unique feels to them which gives them there own stregths and weakness some heros do feel overpowerd in some aspects but if you have a good team with different heros with different roles your team is bound to win the things i find annoying in game are the ammount of people that always leave a game because of rage quit these people need to learn a lesson or to about good sportsmanship another is languages make sure you read up on your russian spanish indonesian language books for the best experiacne so you dont have to stop and type to your team english overall this game is a great a game with balanced mechanics in all aspects of the game im glad i waste 45 minutes per match to play a great game 9210

 disclaimer  this review is for the standard edition of batman arkham city as of 08082014 the review feature for said game has been disabled  this game is a bomb ive never been deeply into the batman franchise never read any comics back in the day when it was on tv batman  the animated series gained my attention and never lost it batmanarkham city is arguably the best longest and most refined entry in this current series of games it was thankfully developed by the rocksteady studio under the guidance of paul dini the main writer for the animated series that whole thing plays like a batman movie produced by christopher nolan talking about immersion you will think you are batman and that the events happening really occur to you as the witnessing player stunning graphics excellent sound design and a well rounded combat system give this game the edge it needs to turn you into a non lethal crime fighting combat machine comes with leaderboardschallenge maps and a multiplayer mode nothing short of a single player campaign 30 hours rich set up in an open air prison this game shows how deep the rabbit whole of human cruelty really goes this is lore wise easyly one of the best games ive ever played in my whole life and i hope rocksteady will soon deliver an arkham city 2 after the letdown that was arkham origins that what you get when you change a winning team eidos if you like super heros or punching based action games or just good movies in general pls do yourself a favour and buy this game itll be a sad story if you miss out on it
recommended
real time strategy micro one character but strategize with bots teammates items board features and more replayability is like a physical sport the game is different every time one of the founders of the moba multiplayer online battle arena genre one of my favorites obviously
recommended
well played 
recommended
very nice
recommended
dis be my life
recommended
ill admit it i havent played any of its competitors lol hon enough to justify saying that its the best of them all but from what ive gathered it is at least graphically its undeniably superior sure its hard at first but theres nothing more satisfying than seeing yourself climb up that learning curve i recommend this game because ive had a buttload of fun with it
recommended
great game
recommended
once you get past the not knowing anything stage this game is really enjoyable just endure the first few games you play and be prepared to learn quickly
recommended
really ing good
recommended

recommended
the best game that helps you to wheter decide if you have to kill yourself or not it all depends if the other guy on your team that you dont even know in real life tell you that you should end your life if he says so just remember never play it without a 5 player party

dota 2 is one of the best free 2 play first person shooters of the animated cartoon genre i have ever seen i have played this game for over 1000 hours and have learned many new languages such as russian and peruvian i have learned that no matter how long you play the game there will always be someone there to tell you you are a noob and i have only thought about murdering my friends over this game twice if there was a sequel to dota 2 called dota 2 the remake of the remake of the original dota i would play thousands of hours of it aswell 1010 ruined my life
recommended
ruined my life five stars to this game

recommended
the best ever game
recommended
this is the best video game ive ever played hands down i have so much to say where do i start ok so dont be turned away by the huge learning curve when you start you will be terrible but thats ok and likely you may never be great but you will make amazing friends and have so much fun actually i wish i could go back to being a blissfully ignorant noob because learning heros abilities what certain items do lane compesitions ect i can go on forever about how much there is to learn even after 25k hours probably 15k  2k hours actually playing im still learning the game hits an odd paradox it can be the most satisfying and exciting game ive ever played but also the most enraging and frustrating its a ing emotional roller coaster sometimes there will be highs there will be lows from amazing comebacks to terrible throws great teamwork and brazilian  feeders ive even tried giving up after long agonizing losing streaks but nothing no other game can quite fill hole not playing this game for a few hours a day leaves its perfect for me i love being social competitive passionate and excited all maybe too much at times but thats just the kind of person i am some of my best friends ive made playing dota with and even though ive never meet most of them i love them all and noting can quite compare to queueing for a ranked captains mode game with a 5 stack valve is an amazing company and im glad they took the game and ran with it were constantly getting new seasonal events heros game modes and more cosmetic items i can throw my money at oh and one of the best parts all the heros are free and unlocked from the start no progression system where you can buy characters with in game currency or level up some  passives in a skill tree or something like a certain game you dont need to spend a dime but i strongly suggest you should considering your funding not only the people who make the game but the cosmetics are created by the community who they pay also all the items are tradeable ive spent countless hours browsing trading sites looking to swap my items that i got for free as random drops for my favorite heros new hat or whatever ive spent way too much time watching pro games as well which valve fully embraces they even host one of the biggest esport tournaments ever every year called the international i put a good bit of time into writing this review so thanks for reading it all if this even gets one person to give it a try then its not time wasted i hope you enjoy the game half as much as i do

dota 2 consists the most unblanaced heros for any game on the market as of right now there so many over powered abilities on too many heros in fact the heros are considered over powered are played every single of every single match dota 2 is the worst game i have ever played due to the lack communitywhich is toxic hero abilities which are over powered and all around broken game if you like your sanity do not play this game if you do not want to become racist do not play this if you dont rich pumping  tons of money into professional gaming just so the game can make a buck or two do not play game if you do not like russia do not play this game if you do not like any hispanic do no play this game basically what saying to you if you want to play a moba go play league of legends

recommended
best game on steam ever s2 d
recommended
if you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play this is an amazing multiplayer online battle arena the realtime strategy is the best part if you ever want to win a game you must out think you opponent communication with you team is key although you might end up hating them shortly after they start dying the only down fall is abrasive players if you tend to die lot and feed the other team some of your teammates will release their rage upon you other than the sore losers that you will meet from time to time this game has an amazing community the dota 2 community is a bit crazy but in a good way for valve at least because they spend over 20 million dollars in just over 2 weeks currently about 8 million of those dollars are going towards the prize pool of the international the ultimate tornament for the best dota 2 players in the world the team that gets 1st place will get around 4 million dollars and 2nd through 8th place will split the rest keep in mind that this game is free to play it is not pay to win you never have to pay anything to enjoy dota 2 at its full potential everything that is sole in game is cosmetic and does not affect you performance ingame again i say if you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play
recommended
i will surely recommend this game not only to boys but to girls like me as well

this game is not for everyone can bother one card but thats the point every time you run around the map 1 map and the tactics are different actions building but with characters another story a bunch of different weapons clothes and so on that you just do not get bored i think this yoke ideal both boys and girls but children to 14 years i would not be allowed a great game to blow off steam to relax while playing you will not succeed in this worth playing all a nice game
recommended
this is one of the best games i have played in a while it takes forever to learn i played 210 hours and barely know 2 heros though you meet very nice people on this gameactually all the people on my friends list are from this game its very very team dependent you could have all the kills in the world and still lose the game once got 35 kills and still lost and to be honest at frist i didnt like this game i was used to fps and i hated this game at frist but know it ruined my social life thought im addicted and cant get enough
recommended
warning this game is soo good you will forget about the everything else not recommended for people having families others just all and download
recommended
best game on the market if you want to learn russian have your selfesteem crushed by foreigners or contemplate why you even bother breathing anymore
recommended
if u played this game u will need a rehab to quit it best game ever
recommended
to start with if youre thinking of playing dota2 its going to be rough when you start and its probably best to start with some friends but when you get past that barrier youll never find another game to fill that void of dota2s moba experience would totally recommend this to anyone thinking of playing just beast through the beginners block and ignore the flamers 
recommended
if youre looking to play dota 2 chances are you already know something of the genra your stepping into you may have come from hon lol smite or other moba games the objective of dota 2 is to level up your hero gain gold xp and take down stuctures untill you can successfully kill the enemy anciant most mobas have this in common so what sets dota 2 apart from the rest simply put dota 2 is deeper in mechanics the skill cap is higher the esports matches are more dynamic and interesting and it has some berrier to entry if youre the type to pickup a new game and jump right in what really seperates dota 2 from others in the genre is the tone of each match you are punsihed for your mistakes but its your fault not the games rewarded for good play spells are much stronger earlier and roles for specific heros tend to be well establishedbut these roles can change as the meta game changes and new patches or heros emerge if you want to play dota 2 please play the tutorial offered and some bot matches practice different heros learn different roles and see what style of play best suits you also using the ingame guides get to know the heros in the learn tab as well as the items you can purchase videos can also be a godsend in learning the game as can playing with friends going into the actual mechanics of the game would make this review stretch way to long so its really up to you to find out youtube is a great place to find content to help you learn the ins and outs of each class character or mechanic if you are looking for a challanging and rewarding game dota 2 is definitely a great pick stick with it a bit learn the heros and have some fun with friends if you dont want a game that asks you to effort in to get something rewarding out then look elsewhere
recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all

if you have played moba style games before then youll like this game it differs greatly from other moba style games because it delivers a wide variety of game modes and customizations furthermore every champion in the game is unique itemisation is diverse fun and you can have many different builds for just 1 champion a very nice feature to this moba game is the option to change the announcer tired of that old generic hag you can get the bastion voice over for example as many others moreover you can customize your hero skins and weapons you can buy different courier skins and many other things that other moba games dont support its a fun moba game overall and its worth trying out
recommended
best game on steam no doubt but i must admit that it is hard to understand but once you do and i repeat that once you get the game you will just love it
recommended
very fun game if you get into it but its very hard and public games are horrible but still a very fun game

recommended
i still have no idea of what im doing 1200056
recommended
if you want to have a life dont play this game this thing is more addicting than crack and will turn you into a racist
recommended
this game improved so much since it was released on the beta there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1 i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers i know some people who play lol might bash in this game but both games are compleatly different its like comparing cod and battlefield they are so different that connot be compared no preference on either game i think bot of them are good give this game a try the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development try it out its free and badassa great pvp game that offers some of the most intriguing and nuanced team combat around the best game ever
recommended
one of the best games you could ever playall for the price of free make sure to give this one a go
recommended
one of the game which makes you want to play again and again crafting new skills from different heros with each class and skills  building new items build changing the play style of each heros and the game
recommended
an awesome game high learning curb but once you get the basics you just cant stop playing its a challenging but very rewarding game

good game for moba beter than lol i guess nice graphic customable heroesbig trade community and stuff
recommended
i began playing dota 2 at a time when i thought moba games were the weakest of the game genres i always thought it was weird to play a game like this and whenever i saw gameplay videos of dota 2  i had no idea what the heck was going on it never occured to me though that this game would have baited me in for more hours of playtime when i first started dota there was some training missions i had to go through these explained the basics pretty well to me and eventually i thought i knew what i was doing also i also thought there wouldve been some sort of story mode due to the way the training was presented unfortunately there was none but i could see some potential for a storylike mode although during my first public matchup i did feel like quiting because i really did have no idea what i was doing and my teammates were complaining about how bad i was to the other team thats right the other teamour enemies then they all began calling me a noob the amount of insults i received were terrible but eventually i had a few other friends play the game along with me and thats when things began to change thats when dota 2 became something i actually loved to play because of friends and because my friends and i got better it came to a point when we started to insult the enemy team whenever we trashed them everytime we do that it would just end up with us having fun regardless of us winning or not thats what dota 2 is for me having a good time with friends and having fun i then tried lol and i came to the conclusion dota 2 > lol so since this game is free to play i highly recommend it its free so i say why not its best played with people you know after all it is a team based game there are more things to talk about in dota but if you want to know what they are play the game experience it
recommended
just nice game but i want arcana for faceless void

im pretty sure all of my friends play it caused this is where i met all of them lol but this game is amazing strategy is perfectly orchestrated into the captivating gameplay and perfect graphics storyline is not key but there are hints and traces of it shot out at you through weapon flavor text and fanmade comics all in all this game is great and although it may seem that this game is kind of lame because you dont keep items after matches at first that doesnt matterf after the first hour or so of gameplay
recommended
this is awesome

you should try this one

ah yes dota 2one of the best f2p games of the past several years i love this game to death as do a few of my friends but this ame isnt really suited for everyone so i thouht id use this space to point out some of the pros and cons that people should look for when checking out this game pros first off everything is free you dont need to pay to play a hero and cosmetic items are dropped periodically so you dont necessarily have to buy them yourself even if you do decide you want an item you can often get if for just a few cents on the steam market next up the hero diversity every hero feels fresh and unique despite the limited number of roles to play a support jakiro plays very differently from say a support shadow demon all of the carries supports initiators junglers nukers and gankers of the game have unique spells that allow you to simply switch heroes and feel like youre playing a completely different game now for the game itself dota 2 has a pretty decent variety of game modes and has special events from time to time as well diretide frostivus new bloom if you get bored of doing allpick games try out captains draft or the new random ability draft mode if you dont like playing against people there are also coop bot games of various difficulties and some of the harder bots are well actually a bit of a challenge cons this game is hard im not joking about that at all a lot of new players get discouraged because they come in expecting to be able to pick things up fairly quicklymost usually dont many of the games mechanics seem counterintuitive denying creepstowerslowhealth teammates and thus the learning curve is quite steep additionally a lot of new players fall into the trap of learning only one hero often pubstompers like rikki drow sniper and ursa and then have no idea what to do whe their favorite hero gets picked by someone else diversifydont just pick the same hero every game its ok to have a favorite to play but you need to be flexible to play this game now for the biggest issue in this game the community like every online game dota has its problems but people can just be jerks in this one one fineexample is the drow i played with recently she fed relentlessly standing under towers and never payed attention to pings or her minimap and then blamed us for dying constantly all she wanted to do was autoattack creeps ad hope to get a few lasthits in nevermind surviving long enough to spend the gold in this game very few people will admit their own mistakes it always has to be someone elses fault that you lost add to that the league players that you find every once in a while that only come on to shout obscenities into the mic while feeding im not saying all league players do this i enjoy both games from time to time and you have a recipe for very very frustrating games long story short great game thats hard to learn and hard to stick with unless you can deal with an  or two or four

addictive

the best competitive game in the world

well created and fun to play

recommended
having not played the first dota i wasnt sure what to expect i am happy to report that this is a pretty solid game i was very sceptical of only one game map and always starting from scratch but that seems to be a great equalizeri really enjoy the multitude of characters as well as the overall feeling of the interface must play for any fan of pvprts gold for my master
recommended
good graphics
recommended
this is kewl d
recommended
yes but is a nice game
recommended
mindless clickingpeople with nothing better to do screaming at youand completely not funthis game is the pinnacle of human achievement there will never be anything greater
recommended
very good community basically the only reason i play this
recommended
this game is so bad why would i even think of playing this game 1010 would get matched with russians and brazilians again
recommended
there is nothing else i would rather play in my spare time
recommended
a pulchritudinous looking game it is definitely my personal favorite moba game yet it has a huge hero roster is completely free the only possible transactions result in aesthetic changes requires coordinated teamwork and has a huge fan base and community that said you should be wary of many of the players as many are extremely negative and will work to frustrate and annoy you in whatever way possible in many cases you will feel that an opponent is overpowered or a particular hero is cheap but i can assure that in 95% of these cases that is not true i would also highly recommend that you learn the basics first and complete the tutorial because your first few games are gonna be rough you will probably get crushed into the finest paste youve ever been in your life
recommended
nice game and better than league of legends
recommended
its really nice to play here

i find it a fun game it takes a while for you to get okgood at it however i do not recomend doing matches against players until you have at least 100hours or have played another artsmoba whichever acronym you perfer though i cannot say if it is better then lol or hon because i have not played either and even if i had it would be purely my opinon anyway i find it fun and unless you dont like artsmoba style games recommend it

dota 2 is a free strategy  rpg type game made by the worlds most biggest and succesful game company  valve dota 2 gives you the oppurtunity to learn skills and tactics you have never been able to learn before and also has a money making potential to it dota lets you master different players in the game getting stronger and unlocking new items for them to make them more buff there are three lanes in dota top bottom and middle all in which occupy a tower to defend the teams ancient to win the game you will need to destroy the towers to get to the ancient and then destroy the ancient with it 1010 i love this game

awsome free to play moba over 300 hours logged and i havent scratched the surface every game is different technical like a game of chess learning curve is steep so practice with bots before going live overall good community disconnectors should face stiffer punishments as it really can ruin a match a lot of nonenglish speaking players playing on us servers which can make communicating strategies challenging 9510

dont give up after the first few losses get a thick skin to be able to ignore the unhelpful comments from ppl keep improving and then its quite fun

complete waste of time playing this piece of crap all youll find is a pile of negativity and  cancers with broken fingers
not recommended
possitives have you played any other moba before playing dota2 well allow me to introduce you to the first son of the moba genres father father the one that started it all aeon of strife dota 2 is a well balanced and evenly paced moba which offers a lot of variety when it comes to heroes to play and items to make your hero stronger the game has quite a steep learning curve but once you feel like youve gone over that curve then the game becomes so enjoyable especially with friends the game has now been released and is f2p so what do you have to lose negatives the community is quite hostile to anyone who doesnt play very well sadly a lot of russian players dont even want to play with other russians and instead choose the english language preference and end up screwing over the people who actually do speak english and causes communication issues the toxic behavior some people in this game can be unreal and they will sometimes do whatever it takes to make your game horrible yeah you can mute them and try to ignore them but surely they would be inclind to just help the enemy team by feeding themselves to them just because you done one thing wrong that they didnt like but thats why you should try to play with as many friends as possible in order to minimise this issue

just like snowy said \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ horrible game hundreds of hours spent on playing on the same map even with lots of heroes after first 2030 hours ull start to be too agressive after first 100 hours ull split up with ur girl friend and u will play dota even more times per week after 500 hours ull  every mom u will meet after 1000 hours youre nobody you got no friends no girldfriend no knowledge everything u have is dota do not play this game
recommended
this is pretty much my favourite game of all time the learning curve for the game is pretty brutal and it is quite difficult to become good at it but once you do become a competent player the game is infinitely rewarding the game is always changing with regular balance patches and holiday events and the cosmetic item system is pretty awesome you can customize the appearance of all the heroes and it does not affect the balance of the game and i find collecting cosmetic items to be quite fun if you are into trading you can make a ton of money steam wallet funds playing this game pretty much all my steam games come from profits from cosmetic dota 2 item trading i have been playing dota for 10 years including wc3 dota and never get bored of this game i have played other dota style games before and hon and lol cant hold a candle to this game seriously those other games do not even come close to being as good as dota 2 in terms of game and community there is also a large esports scene around dota 2 if you are into that
recommended
can eat trees destroy trees with an item that chops down trees can be a walrus can be a puck no idea wtf puck even is this is a hard game you will die this isint league of legends this is dota this aint no game 1010 one of the best mobas ive ever played pros  great game play really good game to play with friends simple to learn but hard to master mechanics can be a walrus very enjoyable once youve learnt the basics cons  this game is not newb friendly what so ever smurfs leavers 10 year olds pudges  steep learning curve you will sometimes be the only person on your team that speaks english even if you are queing for servers where you live worth trying if you want a challenging moba with a not so friendly community d
recommended
addicted to play

>well played
recommended
this game taught me russian 10 would recommend
recommended
the only arts worth actually playing in my opinion all the other ones around are made for people who cantdont want to learn how to play dota which usually means they end up with at least somewhat dumbed down mechanics not that this necessarily makes them bad games it just makes them a bit dull in my opinion this game will no doubt take a fair bit of time and reading to get into however it is possibly the most rewarding game ive ever played id say the time spent is well worth it because of the fairly large learning curve you cant judge dota by your first impression of it theres someone in particular im looking at here you know who you are solo queue is pretty bloody awful though unless you have a fetish for angry russians or something so id suggest never playing without at least one friend queuing with you my only other complaint about the game is that its ingame tutorial is quite frankly  while it does a good enough job covering basic mechanics that is also the only thing it covers and it will most likely teach you some bad habits along the way i recommend the guide at httpwwwpurgegamerscomwelcometodotayousuck  it covers practically everything you might want to know if you read through and remember the whole thing youre probably already better at dota than the average pubber but even reading less than half of the guide will give you enough knowledge to get you started as in not getting a kda of 0213 every game i definitely recommend this game to anyone with some leftover time on their hands and at least one friend who is a somewhat decent player one last thing to note games usually take about 45 minutes but its not uncommon to have games that last about an hour so make sure you have at least an hour before youll need to go do something when you start a match dont leave games unless it is absolutely 100% necessary it is a  thing to do and ruins the match for the 9 remaining people
recommended
teamwork fast reaction attention to details this game has it all
recommended
a player declined the match 910
recommended
while fun once you give it time it is definitely not for people who cannot wade through a steep learning curve or new comers crossing over from other popular moba games
recommended
i rate this game as one of the best moba even more than league of legends or smite itself great quality and good gameplay
recommended
game is hard
recommended
1 download the game 2  tutorials just search for a game 3 pick pudge 4 feed
recommended
a beautiful game with rage friends feed and russians lose all your free time and friends it is ok you have dotes and you can make new friends have fun and dont feed
recommended
this game will destroy your nonexistent life
recommended
have you ever tried crack me neither but dota 2 is probably going to be the closest thing to it imagine spending every waking moment thinking about something is it drugs love no no its dota and may the gods help you once you take the first step but trust me its worth it just trust me
recommended
100% would rage again

best and worst game all at the same time

wonderful game very entertaining and the atmosphere is a little more relaxed then the other popular mobas the beauty of this game is that it tends to emphasize individual initiative more than your ability to emulate the latest guides as cool as that is nothing really compares to the strong sense of nostalgia players of dota 1 will feel while playing since the game barrows as heavily from the original as is legally possible that said you absolutely have to play with at least two friends otherwise youre playing experience will go to hell very quickly 1  no regionalization of servers  ae theres going to be a lot of psychotic chittering mic spam and people who think they speak english are just going to shriek at you with preposterous accents unless reliving youre favorite moments of full metal jacket strikes you as being the epitome of strategic entertainment youll want to queue with some friends 2  self imposed dictators  ae everyone knows the self important team leader type some stranger you have never met seen or heard of who feels that its perfectly acceptable for him to tell you what skills youre going to pick during ability draft ext unless you enjoy angry nasally congested petty and vindictive mic spam youll want to grab some friends 3  steam is still technically pg7  ae only the characters in your games are allowed to curse stating to another player wow you sure suck at dota is a punishable offence this issue is compounded by the fact that the ban system is automated a player will automatically be banned based on the number of reports they accrue cross scaled by time they accrued them in fortunately i have managed to avoid any of the chat bans but some of my friends havent been so lucky consider the math one in four people on the internet may be defective four reports within a 2 hour period may get you banned you play three 40 minute games how is that going to shake out for you in the long run it may not happen to you and it hasnt happened to me but sooner or later you are going to get flagged and auto punished by the assbrains and this could compromise youre whole steam account you dont have to be a victim of an injustice to speak against it and i believe flatly that automated oversight is as dangerous as no oversight at all dangerous and foolish business so like i said bring at least two friends with you or prepare for a pretty hellacious experience otherwise its very fun
recommended
what a awesome game d but learn russian before you try it because its full of  russians really recommended
recommended
if you are new to pc gaming or rtsmoba games dota 2 will appear as impenetrable as a wall the learning curve for this game is by far the worst element of mobas however those of you with some experience with rts games or are willing to learn will find the teamplay experience of dota 2 an enjoyable would recommend to anyone with a competent pc and drive to play competitively
recommended
nice game for competitive and rest 
recommended
best russian simulator ever
recommended
a great game its like league of legends but with a better community that will not ask you to kill yourself if you get a kill as support
recommended
good game can play online d
recommended
dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game let alone feel competent at it but once you start to learn its secrets theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched even by its peers its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes and success is a rush the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all freetoplay games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount may the best team win ps dont play with russians
recommended
a game for which you have to use brain and brawns to win it a well worth esport if i must say
recommended
for sure one of the most amazing games

this is very wonderful game a lot of emotions new friends and the opportunity to play in a team

a great game to think that it only started as a mod ^^ played it at the time still playing one of my favourite games ever  teaches teamwork  recuires multitasking map awarnes calling misses etc  great to play with friends makes losing actually still quite fun as long as you are not curp stomped  fun way to meet new people d  takes a lot of your time why addictive as hell  like all moba games even this the great ancestor community can be quite punishing  steep learning mountain to climb
recommended
this game make titans cry and babies grow facial hair before you can properly assess this game you must first climb the highest mountain while your consciousness is implanted into a robot at the bottom of the sea the moment you realize the gold that this game achieves is the very same moment that you become one with the greater knowledge so please wrap yourself in this higher power by becoming one with the dota 2
recommended
if ur thinkign about playing this game ing dont seriouly
recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend
recommended
in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had
recommended
and you thought real life was a struggle

i only played a little but it was fun

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

not recommended
most games reward the player to some degree when they have sunk hundreds of hours into them dota 2 is the only time sink i have experienced where you get absolutely nowhere for your troubles thanks to a heavily broken matchmaking system that can take forever to queue up a game as i am writing this a 5 stack for a ranked match can take up to 20 minutes dota 2 is less about how skilled you are and more about who you know if you dont have at least a dozen experienced friends who are consistently competent prepare to queue with some of the worst players you have ever played a multiplayer game with as an added bonus you will often get players who do not speak your language  even in ranked games i have often wished that i never started playing this game

dota 2 dota 2 is a f2p moba game made by valve and was in beta for a long time until it became free to the public in 2013 dota 2 requires alot of skill and it isnt a game where ou jump right in to the game like tf2 valve intended that players should find their favourite hero and learn tacticts with that hero however most players dont get that and hate on it for childish or just ride the hate wagon lets get to the game now you start in the same map each time and i would appreciate some more maps each side looks similar and there are 3 main roads to each teams spawn but they are protected by minions towers and players the objective is to destroy the towers and get to the enemy base and destroy this core thingamajic you start leveling up your character and your abilitieshero gets stronger and its key to the game you will really need to play as a team rather than a lone wolf and will require you to speak with your teammates and not expect them to know your stun and attack plan i will give this game a 475 i think its a good game but it might need some new maps

this game is garbage

i like trying my best but  i dunno sometimes my boobs get in the way of a kill and im more concerned about the kitchen than this incoming gank i wouldnt play with me
recommended
quite tough for new players but you once you start digging deep youll find an infinite amount of depth in this gem originally a warcraft 3 mod this faithful remake brings the original into an all new graphics style which is very pleasant to look at the game itself is a bottomless pit of mastering every hero every item and digging deep into the mechanics for the win this game rewards time investment with a world that in some ways rivals ten games in complexity and depth plus its completely free save for cosmetic items that dont affect gameplay at all this means that all the characters will be unlocked right from the getgo and of course new heroes are still being added from the mod i really look forward to the ongoing future for this game  winning a match beats everything else in its euphoria effect and riding the high is half the game of dota 2 play it  even if youre scared of the community
recommended
low priority sucks and 6 games is to long but maybe it worth it for the game itself

this is the best game i play in my life

i highly recomend this game for people who want to take their game to the next level i think that there is no excuse to not play this game because with a price tag of $000 there is no risk in getting it this game has blown me away and i am always looking to play more also this game is huge i have played around 320 hours of this game and just got started with this game it is very deep and requires a lot of thinnking ahead and attention so a brief recap of my review i say 1010 and cant wait to see how valve could make it any better
recommended
this game is not for everyone can bother one card but thats the point every time you run around the map 1 map and the tactics are different actions building but with characters another story a bunch of different weapons clothes and so on that you just do not get bored i think this yoke ideal both boys and girls but children to 14 years i would not be allowed a great game to blow off steam to relax while playing you will not succeed in this worth playing all a nice game

current meta sucks next meta will probably suck just as well this game is better off you recognizing every aspect of the game and getting used to the learning curve play 6002000 hours get mad at it and fanboy over professional teams fanboying and following professional teams and tournaments is the best way to go also the lore isnt half bad tldr this game is better than league of ies
recommended
this game sucksyou cant even jump
recommended
one of the most addictive games ever
recommended
very best game in the world
recommended
i think that this is my favorite game the game itself has very good graphics and has good controls and the actual strategy and all the different rolls you can play make this so good it does take a lot of time to learn though looking back at my first games i cant beleive that we all faild so hard but now with over 500 hours played i think that i can say that i know what every hero does and what every item gives you it is very fun now 
recommended
dota 2 is a perfect example of how a free to play game should be it starts you off with all the characters playable you can pay for items but they also drop ingame
recommended

only play this if you have thick skin and the patience to learn the game if you have both then you are in for a good game if not then lol

best online game i ever played
recommended
i last reviewed this game over a year ago at the time i had played it for about a hundred hours in that review i spoke about its strategic depth adrenaline pumping action and emotional highs over a year later and ive played it for nearly 900 i was only scratching the surface dota is the thrill of scoring first blood in a bad matchup as well as despair of seeing the enemy spirit breaker gank yet another one of your teammates its flashy teamfights and precise positioning its chaotic 30minute slugfests and careful 70minute economic tugofwars its the uneasy suspense of snatching roshan right from under the enemy teams nose and its the mindnumbing frustration of having an enemy natures prophet knock yet another one of your towers down and get away clean it a hardfought victory snatched from the jaws of defeat and its watching your team get torn apart emotionally crumble and begin to blame each other dota is my favorite game of all time and i dont think ill ever experience anything like it ever again
recommended
this game has shown me that video games are not just a hobby in which we can just pass our time it can also be our career and also become our life when you are the best at somethingdont give it up that easily because you dont get it much in life
recommended
at first i was like dude this game is too difficult for me i died so often that i mainly waited for the death timer to count down my teammates insulted me all the time i couldnt even understand their insults they told me that my mother would be so fat lifestealer doesnt need to build damage but then i  how to  and                   910

as a drop while playing dota 2 because dota 2 is a freetoplay game players do not receive free cards like most other games instead a card drop becomes available for roughly every $9 usd spent on cosmetic items in the dota 2 store if you have card drops available they will appear automatically in your steam inventory as long as your dota 2 client is open cards drop approximately once every 1560 minutes from the steam community market by trading with another player from a booster pack booster packs are packets of several cards that drop randomly after you have forged one dota 2 badge booster packs can also be bought on the market booster packs drop more frequently for players with higher steam levels

i got this game more for nostalgia than anything else never really enjoyed defence of the ancient type games and at first it didnt seem like i would enjoy this either the community may be fierce at times especially when you are new but once you log a few hours and get the base mechanics under the knee the game and its community actually become pretty enjoyable serves to provide many laughs and wtf moments and is best enjoyed in a party with people who will be willing to help you get through the first few games

hard to learn and even harder to master i can not find a reason to learn this game without friend otherwise you should mute immediately all person with cyrillic script except you like it when someone insults you about an hour just saying but in the end even with this really unfriendly community there are some silver linings hidden
recommended
very interesting game and make us forget about everything

very fun strategic game where cooperating with your team is key to winning many matches its veru fun to play with your friends some may find it hard to use certain heroes but its all about practice remember practice makes perfect

just dont play this the game has the worst community i have ever seen with nearly all the players being abusive constantly for being a noob the game becomes repetitive and boring and has taken me over 200 hundered hours to find this out and dont get me started on the amount of russians playing this even outside of their own servers at first the game is fun but dont get dragged in its not worth it
not recommended
a very fun but hard to master game with lots of varied characters at least you dont have to unlock them all cough lol cough
recommended
its pretty fun even when you suck
recommended
the greatest video game in the history of time and space is what dota 2 turns into after youve done 50 hours of boot camp and 50 hours of homework before that youll be shocked and confused and humiliated more times than you can count in the end the investment is well worth it just be warned youll need enough time and thick enough skin to survive the trial by fire

boy gee williker if you like games about doing game things then is this game the game for your gaming sessions this is called defence of the ancients and the ancients are big guys who walk around and you get to play as an ancient and use your powers to defend yourself from the enemy team who are also ancients who are defending themselves from for against you as you can see the ancient defending is an ancient mechanic that people defend but have you ever considered if you wanted to defend your ancient then why cant you make a peace treaty to protect the ancient youre playing as once i decided to defend my ancient by not taking my ancient out of spawn and everyone was mad at me but i tried to explain to them that my ancient would be safe this way and if they wanted to defend their ancient they should not leave spawn too but they got mad and then it said the game was safe to leave which means my ancient is safe so i win but everyone acted like i didnt win plot hole gabe wendell aside from the lack of ancient defending despite calling it defence of the ancients you can play as an ancient and use your spells to stun the enemy team who are unable to defend themselves while you defend yourself good times i played a game as a character called lion who is clearly not a lion this game clearly does not have very good writing and i am glad its not a singleplayer game because compared to mass effect i dont even know which character is saving the galaxy so they cant writing for sucks if bioware wrote this game lion would be a lion and not a man who is not a lion and he could definitely save the galaxy with the help of his tolerance squad and gay romance wouldnt be opress like in defence of the republican george w hitler bush also i went to buy items but they cost gold why cant i buy item for free if it doesnt want to give me item valve also there is an item called a mekansm which isnt even an english word valve cant even spellcheck and but they expect to go and beat league of legends without even any legends or correctly spelled word what morons why dont gabe just buy a thousand knife and stop worrying about game especially since they stole a lot of character from league of legends they turned nidalee into a lion and then into a man who was not a lion and then called him lion and changed his abilities so hes not as hard as nidalee appeal casual audience i trusted gabe newell after valves great games like ricochet but when i played as lion who was nidalee but did not was nidalee i realised that gabe had made a big mistake and dota 2 will never have nidalee if they only have lion who is not a lion wtf overall i would say that it is a bad game that nobody should ever play that looks bad and sounds bad and is bad and doesnt have nidalee and instead has a lion but its a man there is no lion and hes not even commander sheperd and tali isnt even in here and nobody could save the galaxy aside from sniper who could be an infiltrator but he doesnt have good sniper for killing reaper so why even include dramatic singelplayer nobody should ever play this game gabe did a big poo and was a big smelly poop without commeander shepord or nidallee  9510

this game is interesting because while it is very enjoyable and there is lots of variety the people you will play with rarely know how to work as a team and when they do its becasue the enemy is really bad at the game also the community is very unwelcoming to noobs so if you just joined and are learning how to play nobody likes you all in all it is one of my favorites but i will warn you it isnt the easist to just pick up and play also there is a low prioority pool so if you cant get out of that you will always be with noobs even if you are a good player

the websters dictiondary definition of ancient is ancient adjective \antshnt akshnt\  very old  having lived or existed for a very long ti and boy this game is old and existed a long time steam made the old game dona and now made it into the new game dota2 it stands for defence of ancients it used to be a old game for nerds but now its a real life recration of the medevil life style you can go down to the street to buy wares from the fat man down the street like olive branch the slippers and a eye ball on a stick just like medeval times its a real life simulater so its got night and day also you can do all the chores you want like chipping down a tree with a leaf and driving the donckey horse down to the river to drink your team mates will get mad if you do this wrong so get a lot of practice if you like to be wizzard and cast magic this is the video game for you its technically a massiveley multiplayer on line battle house or mobo this means that 1 1 theres a lot of people thats playing it i counted at least 8 people in one house 2 theres a lot of magicyou can cash a spell and it makes the little guy glow with magic glowing rings i think theres a nother spell but i did not try it yet 3 theres a lot of medeval guys and the ladies to pick from marana is the best one though because she shoots a really big arrow and rides a lion cat so shes the fastest watch out though that its pro grammed to be a realistic arrow so its slow you can also play as a donckey horse and this is easier except some times it does not like to listen but thats what stubborn donckeys do 4 and if you like secrets then boy there is a lot of secrets in this game to choose from if you chip down the right tree in the forest you get hit by a lightning bolt its a hidden secret and i could not find out how to make it happen again it also happened when i didnt chip down a tree so its weird also did you know theres a secret fat man in the woods that sells wares but i could only find him once if you find him again please make a web site saying where he is 5 theres a lot of peope that shout a insult and curse word at you this is the bad part of the game i dont know why steam put this part into the game but the voice acting is not very good if its too loud you can leave the game house though also i have a gameplay tips for you stay onto the side of the house that you started on if you go to the other side you get killed by a building i dont know why steam did this theres a dragon in the forest just like medevil times if you slay the dragon you win i think i killed the dragon after drying two times i finally killed it then the game ended i wont spoil it but its a big hole in the ground with little guys jumping and it says die wins some times people say things to you but its a secret code i figured it out though if they say b it means bad or g means good some times they say top or mid and bottom it just means you have to tell the donckey horse to drink in the river and mid means go to the middle of the river

ok for a game built for russians played by americans and won by absaloute swearing at team members so that sniper can go top this game has taught me more about the great passion that people have about winning games such as dota your feeling do not count for  on the playing field no niether does your spirit but just your hero and its abilities and how fast your able to use themto play this game requires not a patient personality but your skills at how fast your able to press 1234 and where you use them you will be sworn at ed over and hated at firstwhich is fine because your not gonna get better at a game like this oohh no firstly to even count yourself as even a little bit past begginers level you have to asess yourself 1 am i russian  if yes continue 2    if yes continue 3            if yes continue if you have answered no or yes to any of these questions you are still and undoubtedfully not a skilled dota player please take it lightly that you wont do well in life you cant play dota you cant play life now to start my review  i recomend this game to russia

dota 2 for me has set the standard for mobas the level of detail gone into this is brilliant the characters are well thought out with hilarious quotes and rivalry with the combat being fluid and fast paced the only downside to this that i would say is the matchmaking there is a steep learning curve when it comes to playing proficiently and already seasoned players do not take lightly to new players beware of this and if this kind of stuff doesnt phase you then matchmake away
recommended
just one any set item
recommended
i leik this game and it it awsome while mitchelle is  at it 
recommended
this game is awesome youll be addicted once you learn the way to play it properly
recommended
its cool and i am cool so we are both cool
recommended
great game i highly recommend it
recommended
here gentlemen the best moba around what to say about it hm well first of all theres absolutely no advantage for those who play the game longer other than experience why do people keep playing it well because its fun duh there is no rune system mastery skills talents or whatever you get from levels making the one who just started half an hour ago be on the same tier of the guy whos 1500 hours in which obviously wont get matched against each other because of the experience gap second everythings unlocked you dont have to grind or pay to play the heroes you want you want faceless void there you go lina sure why not visage yeah this is the part that gets to the new players as there is just so much in the game that god it just comes falling on top of your head and you easily get overwhelmed and third the cosmetics are avaliable for free considering youre lucky enough sure you can purchase them from the shop but you can also get them from drops after games might take a while but eventually youll get items these three things together make this games f2p model the best ever seen and will probably continue to be the best considering how freemium games are right now and last but not least the balance is flawless this is a topic where most people go but ursa is so op how is that balanced well son ursa may have his brute damage alright you touch him youre most likely dead but then again you must touch him to die and considering how slow he is thats pretty hard but he can get blink dagger and you can get ghost scepter which nullifies pretty much everything that he can do but thats in game strategy that newcomers usually dont know thats where the problem is dota is hard im not saying just your usual level of hard i mean hard you need to sink in 100 hours to start to get good at the game thats just crazy but somehow people love it dota different from other games such as those fps team deathmatches those capture the flags you can actually see the impact youre doing on the game youre not just killing people randomly youre contributing to your teams victory because with the kill also comes the tower and as you defend you know youre getting space and denying the enemy team control over your side as well as gold gold yes thats another cool point about dota after you play a match the hero you play the items you get the gold you painstakingly farmed are all gone gone you cant go back you cant enjoy that won match anymore where you will have to start over again with a new hero or the same one if you fancy him and talking about heroes there are a ton of them and thats the main point of the game youre almost guaranteed that you will never play with the same team line up versus each other and even if you do the match wont be the same it has nearly infinite replayability well folks and all that for the small price of one nothing now that you look at it it does seem like a great deal no and even if it isnt what do you have to lose dota get to it
recommended
i love this game it has a steep learning curve but once you learn to play its sooo addictive that your day doesnt end without playing it this is one of the best war games online you can become friends with people all over the world it has got the best developer and the best of players in the world and its free to play too d

dota 2 prefectly inherited the play style and cs feeling of dota the game flows pretty well with the new visual upgrade and getting rid of the old warcraft3 system its entirely a nice try however it is an embarrassing situation dota 2 and its valve behind it are facing first the same old problem of dotaits just too hard for new players to play even a seasoned player of warcraft3 find it pretty hard and need months of practicing to become an ordinary player not to mention those young players who never touched warcraft3 before second for old dota players the old and familiar sound of each hero vanquishes instead are newly created heroes that lack the lore backup them from warcraft i dont know how other old gamers feel about it to me its a completely different game lost the contest by his young and more energetic grandsonleague of legends sorry to say but the golden age of dota has faded dota 2 is merely a replacement of the greater past when we play it what haunts in our head are the night beckonsus here to obeyim here as always nonot really you are not always here farewell

half of the time you get stuck with people who rage at you afk speak russian or some other language you probably dont speak or claim to be professional dota 2 players overall dota is a better game then dota 2

i only recommend this game based on the fact that this is the most generous free2play title youre ever going to find the amount of content and support here is insane theres a reason why seemingly millions of people play this game for years on end chances are youll like it if youre looking for a free game but if youre looking for a free game chances are youre young unemployed with tons of time to kill which is what most of the fanbase here is it also happens to be the only kind of person who can learn this game properly youll need months and hundreds of hours before youre any good i want to say that besides all that its a great game but i cant ive dabbled in dota when it was just starting to get attention it was the only reason i installed warcraft 3 a second time my overall distaste for rts games is actually not a factor here as dota has very little in common with the game it was built on top of no my problem with the game is almost every core mechanic it expects you to learn is not fun at all to implement into your sessions i disagree completely with the tasks at hand that are in every moba out there i dont like the pointless constant neverending flow of creeps i dont like how everything is a race to earn exp at the fastest rate instead of using actual tactics and if you die or leave the proximity of a fight for 60 seconds youll never catch up to the enemy leveling so you better just give up the item shops are super convoluted and have nonsensical upgrade paths i dont like the essential systems of last hits and denying as they make no god damned sense killing your own infantry so that the enemy doesnt get the exp is ludicrous its the dumbest videogame logic i have ever witnessed and i cant get behind it if all this stupid crap were removed i feel like we would be left with a fun game but perhaps that game has already been done elsewhere like the pvp arena battles in guild wars i just feel like if this were simplified down to heroes battling each other directly with their core abilities id have a good time its so beautiful so well crafted so much innovation in the networking features presentation is tops epic as all hell everything you could want its a shame that all this is pasted onto a core game that is incredibly busted and dumb

do not play this game unless you have already been playing it for 2 years or more as a new player you will get matched against players with 2000 games or more experience and you will get matched with players who have 100 games or less even after years of playing and no matter how good or bad you are you will still lose about 50% of the time unless you have 4 more friends who play with you every game this game is just as bad as lol and hon in every aspect people will rage quit go afk feed on purpose give up after first blood the game is so well balanced most games will have 1 team with less than 50% of the other teams score not just in kills but in experience and gold earned also if you are thinking of switching to dota 2 from lol or hon do not waste your time it is the same game with the same issues and you will be 2 years behind the learning curve if you have never played a moba before do not waste your time more experienced dota 2 players will just treat you like garbage for your first 300500 games and make you want to not play

im not a huge fan of mobas but i do enjoy league of legends very much and ive played smite when it first came out like most mobas the community can be cruel and insane at times torching you for the simplest mistakes neat and interesting abilities that can be even complicated the first time you use them this game has a lot of replay giving you the choice to play many many heroes unless you like competition and a fierce community stay away from dota and try lol or another moba but you should still give it a try play a bot game or two and feel the game no pay 2 win as its a official steam game and a very successful one you can earn and buy costumes and cosmetics through playing the game and buying them with real money if you feel up to it you can also trade unwanted cosmetics for ones you want through the steam trading system personal rating 355

basically best moba game released yet
recommended
the real moba in the genre based off of the original warcraft iii mod defense of the ancients this game provides all the goodness from great rpg rts and tower defense games and puts them in a 5 versus 5 layout you fight as a hero with 4 team mates to defend your base the ancient there are towers with different classes that defend your base but with enough pushing power the enemy can break through group up with your team to defend your base and face off or play as 108 different heroes all with different skills appearances voices and animations unlock and trade thousands of items as you play to personalize your heroes no runepages  la lol and no play or pay to win tactics to leach money off of the players try this game and you wont regret it its really addictive and fun with a bunch of friends

dota 2 the most played game in the world >
recommended
wow such language sim very strat super fun
recommended
an interesting proposition unlike most games this is the gift that keeps on giving over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made and many continue to come along dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod and on a weekly and monthly basis valve continues to update and add features to the game aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go if you arent the kind of person who likes to play versus other players the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots and to further add to the lifespan of the game the developers release festive events every 35 months to add something extra for players to do as the game is free to play this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing
recommended
i think that russian`s should not play dota 2

lets play some dota so after participating in the open beta for 7 months and continuing to play the game until now there are endless reasons to keep coming back for more if you want an absolute black hole of a game and community that has persisted for over 10 years if you want to be frustrated and rewarded if you want to lose friends certainly this is not the kind of game that everyone should play but those who played the original dota or the original warcraft series will feel right at home here as a newcomer to the genre but a warcraft player from a young age its been nothing less than i would expect from the most popular wc3 mod of all time the steep learning curve has gotten better valve has taken many steps to ensure that new players will learn what they need to learn there are still so many little things and ways to respond to situations that dont come intuitively to people who are new but if you enjoy the mechanics and stick to the game eventually you will know what to do the game is very mechanically interesting although it takes some time to understand how it works whether you want to sit in fog and wait out the perfect 5 man ultimate farm until you are 6 slotted split push find pickoffs harass and deny there are so many unique ways to play the game different roles are so different and no two games are the same with that said the game generally stays the same an experienced player is an experienced player regardless of the balance changes valve and icefrogs team are constantly patching the game every year after ti they actually redesign the game in different ways it keeps things fresh and ensures that no hero is too strong for too long servers are not region locked so expect people who speak little or no english on both sides of the map unfortunately this happens more than youd think now this does create a language barrier in a game where communication is crucial but on the other hand it really doesnt matter too much unless the player is bad you will run into people who think they know exactly what they are doing but in reality they are playing at a much lower level than they can imagine you will start off as a decent person and you will keep your calm around bad teammates and in bad games but you will turn into the problem very shortly if you let yourself the problem with this game is if you want to mute someone you easily can but you never know if they are going to say something useful to be completely honest with the type of people you get in this game its usually worth having them muted regardless the hat system is better than lols rune system straight up to those who wish they could switch but feel they wont have anything to grind the gameplay itself is what you grind here if you wish to support the community and valve you can buy hats to make your heroes look cooler but beyond that theres nothing you can do or buy to change the game everyone has the same game one hero will always have the same stats and abilities as another player using the same hero the only thing that changes are cosmetics and as you can expect valve has an endless amount of them by now whether its the newest hero release and their beautiful arcana that you just have to have a fantastic announcer from a familiar game weather effects or the million different couriers that you can acquire when you spend your money on this games cosmetics it goes to the people who make the hats and valve gets a percentage thats it sometimes it will go towards a tournament prize pool or a player in closing play this game if you want a mix of warcraftdiablo that will test your sanity and willpower with high highs and low lows a skill ceiling that goes on forever and teammates that make you want to punch yourself in the face you will find yourself coming back for more every day if you have the time

ill admit it i havent played any of its competitors lol hon enough to justify saying that its the best of them all but from what ive gathered it is at least graphically its undeniably superior sure its hard at first but theres nothing more satisfying than seeing yourself climb up that learning curve i recommend this game because ive had a buttload of fun with it

great game

once you get past the not knowing anything stage this game is really enjoyable just endure the first few games you play and be prepared to learn quickly

when i first started dota 2 my brain had downs i had no idea what i was doing at all but i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying and the learning the heroes all heroes are free before i knew it i was performing better and better i focused and kept learning little by little and bingo i got pretty good you will encounter a lot foreigners good or bad but most of them can understand english theres a lot of great people in the game and some are trolls and jerks but its fun  i recommend this game for everybody if you play lol stop unistall and play dota 2 that game is canerous especially its community has grown to filth i played since 2009 it was a great moba for many years until this game came out and perfected the orignal onewarcraft iii mod its really hard at first i know that but give it a try and learn

hard to learn and even harder to master i can not find a reason to learn this game without friend otherwise you should mute immediately all person with cyrillic script except you like it when someone insults you about an hour just saying but in the end even with this really unfriendly community there are some silver linings hidden

awesome game some of the community members need to work on their attitude a little bit p

if you want to hearsee in this case a review from someone whos played other mobas than dota 2 go elsewhere if not this is what i have to say about a game that ive sunk 600700 hours into until dota 2 i would have never considered myself truly addicted to a game although i wish i had spent those hundreds of hours doing something useful im going to explain why it was time well wasted first impressions the first thing that really struck me about dota is what many consider a negative thing its massive learning curve but as a person who appreciates a challenge i didnt find this to be such a major obstacle as many others havethe fact that this game is free totally makes up for it but if you appreciate games that hold your hand the whole way through this game probably isnt for you the shallow tutorial it does have explains the very basic mechanics of the game which is useful and all but this isnt a game thats easily explained the way to learn is really trial and error that why it really helps to have friends to play with you who firstly know what theyre doing and secondly have alot of patience this is a game of strategy diversity and tactics that will be far too complex to inherently know at the start its really really hard the community the community of dota is hands down the worst community ive ever had the displeasure of meeting ive played multiple mmos and other various multiplayer games but none of them came even closeexcept for cod except for cod as with any group of people there are also extremely nice and helpful people you can meet but thats heavily counterbalanced by sheer amount of trolls or whatever you want to call them the gameplay another point of contension about this game is its horrible match making system you wont notice it right away but as you increase in experience and skill you notice you are often grouped with people that either are completely new to the game or dont even speak your own language and in a game that relies heavily on teamwork and communication it becomes a very real disadvantage aside from that dota 2s gameplay is what makes the game what it is at first your head will spin with all the many many abilities that are constantly being thrown at you from the hundreds of characters that make up dota 2 but as you get more streetsmart and youve played most of the heroes youll find it easier and easier to be aware of your foes strengths and also use your enemies weaknesses to your advantage for the beginner the first thing you have to do as a complete greenhorn is to read this guide andor watch this video that are both very indepth guides to dota 2 i will link you to this at the bottom of my review after watchingreading the guide the links of which i have copied and oasted below i would strongly reccomend you first practice with bots a mode in which you are in a team with bots against bots dont dive in headfirst with your friends or with strangers as its really a drag to have someone constantly dying and feeding the enemy team gold and experience ultimately resulting in a loss and your friends coming up with excuses to leave your party once you have practiced i suggest you keep practicing for at least the first day you take the game up go ahead and play a coop bot game in this gamemode you will be grouped up with random strangers fighting against bots there are five difficulties the easiest of which is passive but personally i would suggest easy which is slightly harder than passive but a better way to learn in my opinion cons and pros pros 1 an amazing variety of heroes to choose from 2 the exhilaratingly palpable gameplay 3 the lore each hero has their own backstory which are all fantastic 4 the art style compared to other mobas that ive seen dota 2 has by far the best art style you can buy ingame item sets that change the aesthetic of your characters and many other accessories almost all of which are designed by artists and submitted to the dota 2 workshop 5 the multiplayer aspect this game is amazing to play with friends 6 this game is pefect for people who are looking for complexity and depth it has plenty of it 7 its an esport this game is surprisingly fun to watch and it happens to have a massive worldwide pro scene the dota 2 international is considered of of the largest gaming events ever with the price pool being racked up to 16 mil in total it should make for a very exciting event 8 its freeeeeeeeeeeeeee cons 1 the learning curve although i didnt have a problem with it is a major setback for most people 2 the matchmaking system a heavily flawed matchmaking system that often teams you up with people that dont speak your language andor are not at your skill level at all 3 the overpowered heroes although this becomes less of a problem as you get better at the game its a nightmare at the start of the game heroes such as viper sniper riki and many others wreak havoc among the noobs 4 the community the most vurile trolly community ever i hate this aspect of the game 5 its extremely addictive whether this counts as a pro or con is really up to you but i would say its more of a con in my opinion to recap dota 2 is not a casual game it takes time to learn and master every character in the game alot of time which is unattractive to alot of people because of the amount of depth dota 2 provides it takes a very long time for it to get old even myself who has played this game for about a year now am still learning things every time i play although the matchmaking is really bad playing with friends is an absolute blast although certainly flawed theres a reason why i and many others have spent hundreds hours on this game just try it youll have alot of fun links  httpwwwpurgegamerscomwelcometodotayousuck[url if the

dota created the moba genre and dota 2 its taking it to the next level this is the moba for people who like the challenge of going through steep learning curves to find a true gameplay experience if you want a moba that dumbs things down you can pick any other clone excellent game very polished amazing voice acting and awesome graphics

dota 2where to begin dota 2 is a game of ups and down heart break and happiness and most of all utter ing sadness this game will literally kick you when youre down  on you and then continue to make you give your own father fellatio dota is not a game for the faint at heart and one should only attempt to play it if ready to lose but losing the match isnt all youll lose when playing with friends you will find yourself constantly hating each other as you or your friends  up you will latch onto that hate and it will consume you if you can survive the hate and keep coming back though you will soon emerge into a world of new found misery and sometimes joy as you begin to learn the basics you will start to win while you remain to lose at the same time dota 2 is a game where the player never truly wins the player is never truly good theyre only slightly better each and every time and every time will be different no matter how many hours you pour into the masochistic game that is  dota 2

is dota2 a fun game is usually the first question people ask about this game great games in recent times seem to often have set themselves apart from other games by being an experience game as an example proteus is 100% experience and very little game braid was great because it was an innovative platformer but some of the greatest lasting attraction i felt to the game was because of the endearing story and symbolism that was symbiotic to the music and art of the game dota 2 is not a game that tries to make it as easy as possible to experience the game and then be done with it unlike the set of games that have defined themselves a new genre in run of the mill first person shooters which make it as easy as possible for new players to complete sections of it and reach great heights in an attempt to lower the dominance new players have through tricks like fast healing killstreaks and fast respawns it doesnt fit with half life 2 like games in being a great singleplayer experience which you run through like a rollercoaster ride either each game starts out the same but can diverge in an incalculable number of ways due to the enormous number of variables innate in the vast number of heroes and builds dota 2 is a game a game with rules and learning and practising a game where you cant see the top of the skill ladder from the middle a game that is challenging and intriguing at every turn what is it that makes a game fun i dont think anyone knows the true formula but we know that fun activates the reward centres of the brain dota 2 will give you the rulebook and some practise scenarios but you cannot expect to have it play itself you must teach yourself the game and through your endeavours you will get noticeably better each time and you can and will feel proud of it dota 2 challenges both the intellect and the reflexes with battles between an enormous range of heroes each with interesting astoundingly well thought out and developed movesets and characters because of the sheer challenge and complexity of what dota 2 provides it is a very fulfilling game with much room for growth it is a game that will be enjoyable i expect for a very long time because of this dota 2 is not a game that is inherently fun in as much as you cant pick up a pack of cards for the first time and expect to play poker but we have touched only on the mechanics of the game dota 2 takes place on a very beautiful map complete with birds and squirrels fish and butterflies spiders and cobwebs day and night and forests and ravines in honesty all it would require for me to feel its atmosphere was perfectly polished would be weather effects it would be wonderful to see rain splashing in the river or even little streams the game has over 100 heroes each memorable with welldeveloped movesets storylines and copious amount of charactertocharacter dialogue which allow the games endearing heroes to cater to a huge variety of playstyles overall dota 2 is a game that is not made to take game of the year one year then fade into obscurity as people complete it its a game that sits in that category of games that you go to to have fun with some friends its a game that wants you to keep coming back to it and you know in years time you can still pick up the cards and have fun again if you want to pick up dota 2 which i should again emphasise requires some selfinvestment i suggest you ask a friend to introduce you oneonone to the games concepts with passive bots then practise with bots trying characters until you find one you like and are good at progressing to be able to beat the hard bots with little difficulty is very good preparation for multiplayer then all get on mic and play an online game youll win or at least have fun if you cooperate  zemnmez 2k13

recommended
this game
recommended
if you aint playing this you aint playing a moba
recommended
this is a very competitive game with some incredibly complicated mechanics the graphics are nice everything runs well and ive rarely seen issues which are fixed on a regular basis what makes it entertaining to me is the combination of hundreds of available characters each with their own relatively unique skill set along with hundreds of items to be bought during the course of each match in a 5 man team there are endless combinations of roles which can make for a solid strategy there is a matchmaking system that does a fair job of creating balanced teams hopefully dear player after you have practiced playing with bots and know all of the heroes and an endless learning curve the only problem i have with the game is how much abuse is prevalent in the community new players are able to join matches before they have the experience to make reliable teammates and rather than give them advice or instruction many would simply vote to kick a player from the team and 4v5 is hardly ever winnable i wish there were more people able to demand some respect and cooperation that i had more reports for those who use the word noob regularly and then claim the game is over before it began because of anything else if you like competition teamwork hilarious math reflexes and leadership then this is one of the best games youll find but it will be frustrating at times
recommended
ive played a lot of games with a wide and varied ammount of different communities but never have i played a game that could compete with the same level of   bicth noob that is russian dotos ive travelled wide and far to experience the european servers but no matter how hard i try i can never seem to find the promised lands ive been around to experience the following ti3  navi fountain hooking whilst gabe newel was clearly there diretide 2013    _  give diretide volvo chinese new year  broken shitblades  my life i quit this  game ti4  techies confirmed valve shut up and take my money 1210 rated much fun very russian too many reddit leaks would recommend have recommended they continue to play call of duty & gta v maybe i should recommend to pc gamers league of lung cancer still beats defense of the ancientrussians 2
recommended
awesome game huge community

this my game

one of the best games in the world
recommended

dota 2 is the sequel of defense of the ancients commonly known as dota wherein two teams of players compete with a single character of their choice through an rtsstyle interface which emphasizes on intelligence cooperation and teamwork
recommended
best game on steam
recommended
dota 2  a game worth gettingplaying generally let me start of by saying i usually play alot of playstation but dota 2 got me hooked and im still hooked on it ranged from using abilities working as a team to the just pure enjoyment of having a last kill player friendly can spend hours enjoying it with matesfriends and well if you decide to go alone take some time to practice and learn the capabilities of each hero i think this game is fun and yeah what makes it amazing is each character takes some time to play with its not like easy from the start which makes it fair for the noobsnewbies to the game positives about the game loads of characters loads of items to choose from epic duals to awesome kill streaks and well u think there are negatives but its hard to find one except for the fact that the creators have created a awesome game but my only negative would be the maps stuck on the same map makes u wonder when the update will come or if will ever but yeah its only a small lag in the game which u can bypass negative different maps anyhows said enough if u guys find it helpful pls like it and yeah catch u on dota 2 
recommended

this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend
recommended
in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had

and you thought real life was a struggle

i only played a little but it was fun

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

recommended
so good this game 
recommended
feel dota 2 power comes through you
recommended
you wont like dota2 you may be one of the millions of people that think you like it already playing it and making it the single most popular game on steam by a ridiculous margin but thats only because you dont understand it dota2 is pure abstraction complexity for the sake of complexity and rule sets within rule sets that are broken at random this game is so far removed from the theme of heroes with swords and spells clashing in combat that you might as well be playing a game of chinese whispers in a mental institution for the mathematically insane many of the subsystems only function the way they do now because of the limitations of the warcraft 3 engine while many others have been quietly modified for this sequel this game is a triumph of accidental design that rewards memorization social adroitness deductive reasoning and the ability to predict what other humans will do in a complex system that they do not understand ask yourself why you play games at all compare the aforementioned truths attributed to this game to your definition of fun you see ive just saved you a lot of time this game wasnt made for you it was made for me
recommended

recommended
this is my review for one of my favorite games dota 2 dota 2 is much like league of legends in the sense that it is a moba game and the best moba out there i have tried other mobas like lol and infinite crisis yet dota 2 seems to prove its the best of them all with over 100 heros dota 2 is very diverse from other games where each hero has a great skill set and personality each hero serves a role ingame and items are bought to your choosing or what best fits the hero but the game is very balanced because each skill and items can be countered by another skill or items this makes each and every game unique and very stratigic based after over 500 hours ingame i have come to love this game you couldnt ask more from a free game and it is very fun although it is free the game does have a store where you can purchase items that change the appearance of your hero or hud to having the ingame voice somebody else to making your own workshop content that could be put into game training for the game at first is very difficult and alot to take in at first but if you are persistant and play against bots to practice and better your skills dota 2 becomes one of the best games out there although the game is hard to understand at the start and the community is harsh on noobs with time this game is one of the best free games out there and i highly recommend it
recommended
its like league of legends but you snowball harder never heard of league then its like heroes of newerth but with mroe foreigners never heard of hon its like dota 1 but with a 2 and better graphics never heard of dota 1 its like smite but top down instead of first person never heard of smite its like monday night combat but top down fun and with developers who do  never heard of monday night combat its like cod ghosts but a different genre oh and its free that too
recommended
bad game no one actually enjoys it but everyone cant stop playing it
recommended
play this game if 1 you want to learn spanish or russian for free 2 lose all hope in humanity 3 alienate friends 4 fill the gaping void left in your life after leaving wow swtor everquest or any other mmorpg you will not be disappointed

heres fireicesnowfrostpoisonpussteelaxebladesanddirtsmokelightbeer in your eye something in your eye [hydramediacursecdncom] edit after playing more of this game i developed ptsd far worse than any soldiers who fought in world war 2 or the vietnam war the experience was worse than anyone who survived the holocaust and the genocide that hitler caused would be considered childs play compared to this game i had my fair share of being anally rped in prison from having a broomstick to a baseball bat inserted into me even when i didnt drop the soap but the gameplay of this was far worse than that it was worse than removing the splinters from my butt when i was penetrated with those wooden objects i was also forced to have sex with a corpse because of this game i was recently diagnosed with aids and my t cell count is currently far below 200 my skin started to horribly discolor i started to develop tumors i lost a gross amount of weight my joints were giving out im suffering from fatigue but i can barely sleep because of night sweats and chills and i eventually became blind in one eye people dont ask me do you have aids instead they ask me have you been playing dota instead not even the suicide hotline can help me i cry myself to sleep due to this horrible addiction i finally understand how heroin addicts feel on the bright side you can pretend to be a suicide bomber when youre playing as techies
recommended
worse than drug addiction 1010

this game has everything a competitive gamer would ever want youll never feel as though youre done with the game or have mastered the heroes mostly because there are so many that it would take months to play them all and years to master them you can even team up with 14 other friends for endless strategies and even many fun game modes one of my personal alltime favorite time consuming competitive and absolute pure fun games
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
dont play it unless you are unemployed and no girlfriend it will change your bedtime lifestyle dreams and pretty much your needs of social time will be reduced brings bad influence to your attitude

a blast from the past and a major landmark for competitive gaming dota was originally a warcraft iii mod which immediately became a crowd favorite the deep learning curve provides a true strategic experience and will keep you on your feet with the enormous pool of different heroes to pick from along with the collection of items that you can build you can create multiple ways of approaching a situationfight this game is not easy to pick up however the basic mechanics can be quickly picked uptaught with the revision backed by valve dota 2 is sparking up the esports scene once again it is providing another source of life to a game that was part of the few that started the whole competitive scene overall although the game might seem overcompetitive it is definitely a great game to have fun with a group of friends and can provide numerous amounts of fun and laughter games of the same genrebasic mechanics mobas are  league of legends lol and heroes of newerth hon
recommended
good game well played

excellent game free to play great graphics fun gameplay there is no reason to not play it if you are a gamer and like moba platform games then i recommended this game for you

recommended
free russian learning tool
recommended
the most difficult game to master ever pros always a challenge lots of customization for heroes large playerbase that isnt as loaded with kids as lol blows lol out of the water in terms of complexity loot dropmarket system to buy and sell items community interaction via the workshop cons mexican infestation frustrating when people throw the game or feed as matches can last 1 hour  be prepared to get yelled at by people who dont speak english and cannot understand the simple concept of a team based game be prepared to spend thousands of hours trying to master the game youll still never master it be prepared to dump money on treasure chests in the pursuit of that elusive arcana or mythical items youll only win rares and uncommons very rewarding to play competitive matches and emerge the victor its like chess but not for old black men with pidgeons for friends sitting alone in the park 1110 would blyat again
recommended
dota 2 is a fun and energetic game there is a diverse roster of heroes to choose from that each have there own unique abilities so youll never get bored you can buy character sets announcers hud skins couriers and loading screens to customize the way you want your game to look it is difficult when you are new to it but youll eventually get the hang of it i recommend this game to almost anyone in the steam community and the good thing isits free
recommended
this is the best moba you will despise every second you will praise the the moments you are in the arena you will have a terrible rage inducing battle you will have the most epic conquest of your online career you will get crushed you will annihilate the enemy

i have never learned so many languages in one game i learned portugeese russian mandarin and spanish it also represents how frail a friendship is and how others treat the game with more respect than the people playing lost 7 friends 17 aquaintences took an arrow to the knee and fed the op riki 30 kills the game causes anxiety problems low selfesteem mood swings racism and raging erections i definetly would recomend this to anyone who has the mental capacity and time to go through 400 hours of learning and being yelled at to just play the game correctly
recommended
this game is addictive and kinda stressing if you playing this prepare because your social life is at risk
recommended
game is good but can be frustrating at times and the learning curve is extremely steep i do reccomend this game but not to those easily frustrated or not willing to lose game after game when you start
recommended
pretty decent game with new heroes added in as well as some cool effects but nothing beats the original dota
recommended
a wonderful romp through intraspection every game offers new insights into ones sexuality and right to life

this game is awesome  fun to play with some friends  epic gameplay  and the best game out there

i used to play dota 1 on my old pentium 4 pc back in 2009 and it was a great experience and when i learned that valve acquired the rights to make a sequel for 1st mod game i was shocked like how can they do that are they going to collaborate with blizzard to develop a new one but then i found out that the project will be a standalone sequel without warcraft or blizzard and when i tried the final product i was surprised cause its very similar to its predecessor and for those who enjoyed the first one im pretty sure that you will surely enjoy this valve version as well not to mention ice frog one of the main modders of dota1 was the lead designer of this game so expect that the features that youve loved on the first still remains in this version kudos to valve and ice frog so far im enjoying the game more than any other titles on steam i will definitely recommend this to moba addicts out there especially the dota 1 patrons
recommended

lovehate relationship with dota
recommended
i first played dota and hated itlater on i began to love it and now i am addicted to it got goods people and some not so good people but overall made tons of friends and played the game more than over 400 hours definetly a good game and a good time to play while not having nothing else to do

dota 2 is a fun and strategic game i really enjoyed it there was a variety of characters to choose from and each character had its unique abilities and personality the game had a detailed map which allowed the players to freely roam through this mmorpg in my opinion is better than league of legends or any other ranging from its resolution gameplay design or soundtracks overall all dota 2 is one of the best mmorpgs out there and i definately recommend it
recommended
this game is not easy and you sometimes may hate it couse it really makes nervous but if you are smart you should understand it`s only a game gain skill be paitent and calm and you will enjoy this stuff

i like all the new and good features of this game i hope there are more improvements to this game i just dislike that when it has new features of the game the size also go up

do you like brutally killing random dudes on the internet do you like ruining your friendships then dota 2 is the game for you  this is one of those games at whitch you have to be good in order to enjoy i cant exactly say its fun even when you are good at it but it is very satisfying nonetheless its very competitve as it is expected from a moba the only turn off that is clearly noticeable is the steep learning curve during the first 100 or so hours youll constatly get yelled at for being bad at the game after the forst 100 hours youll feel right at home while playing dota with your friends oh yeah one last thing when you plan on starting your dota 2 journey invite some of your firends to start along side you because i had a problematic situation when a friend of mine wanted to start playing dota 2 the only problem was every time i wanted to play with him he would be forced to play against players of a much higher tier than him of course this can be solved with smurf accounts fakeish low level accounts but that basically means you will be switching between accounts every time some low level friend of yours wanted to play so either start all over again or wait for your friends until they get good enough to play along side you have fun 
recommended
actually f2p no bull crap that tries to make you pay for anything that makes you better in the game the stuff that is paid for is all visual and really stunning they even have some community made art that makes it to in game this game is intensely competetive and is really well done

dota 2 is one of the best mmo ive played actually i played only one mmo which is this one but i like it too much because of its always demanding awareness about the situation the playeris in and its free tooo and not so hardware intensive which adds it to my favourite list

i started my journey the day a friend showed it to me and told me i could play as the very zeus i thought well i could try a game or two

a must have if you always wanted to learn russian have a reason to hate peruvians and dont have an outside life
recommended
good play
recommended
do you like mobas enjoy league of legends or smite well this game is of coruse another moba however it is also the original moba one of the things you may love or hate about dota is that there isnt really any sort on unfairness to new players beyond skill if a person with 10000 hours faces a player who has only 12 they have no different items no different heroes no different abilities the veteran may have new aesthetic things but the only thing seperating them will be skill if youre new to mobas i encourage you to try this one they are very fun and are fortunately not pay to win

 disclaimer  this review is for the standard edition of batman arkham city as of 08082014 the review feature for said game has been disabled  this game is a bomb ive never been deeply into the batman franchise never read any comics back in the day when it was on tv batman  the animated series gained my attention and never lost it batmanarkham city is arguably the best longest and most refined entry in this current series of games it was thankfully developed by the rocksteady studio under the guidance of paul dini the main writer for the animated series that whole thing plays like a batman movie produced by christopher nolan talking about immersion you will think you are batman and that the events happening really occur to you as the witnessing player stunning graphics excellent sound design and a well rounded combat system give this game the edge it needs to turn you into a non lethal crime fighting combat machine comes with leaderboardschallenge maps and a multiplayer mode nothing short of a single player campaign 30 hours rich set up in an open air prison this game shows how deep the rabbit whole of human cruelty really goes this is lore wise easyly one of the best games ive ever played in my whole life and i hope rocksteady will soon deliver an arkham city 2 after the letdown that was arkham origins that what you get when you change a winning team eidos if you like super heros or punching based action games or just good movies in general pls do yourself a favour and buy this game itll be a sad story if you miss out on it
recommended
real time strategy micro one character but strategize with bots teammates items board features and more replayability is like a physical sport the game is different every time one of the founders of the moba multiplayer online battle arena genre one of my favorites obviously
recommended
this game like most moba games is like an abusive partner it will hurt you and make you feel awful so you tell yourself you will stop yourself and that you will put an end to the relationship but when you confront it it pulls you close and whispers in your ear while gently carressing your back that it is sorry for hurting you so you forgive it and the cycle continues great game
recommended
dota 2 is quite an interesting game being a little complicated at first one can be skillful and better at the game after several weeks or months for some i really do recommend this game
recommended
this game has a lot of mechanics to it be it controlling your character managing other units at the same time game is hard to pick up but worth learning the steep curve if youve ever heard of league of legends this game is the hardcore mode of it i would also confidently say that this game has a better community than league of legends players are slightly more mature and less hateful i highly recommend this game to anybody that is looking for a game that has unlimited replay value every game would be different be it good games or bad games sometimes you meet people who are rude even though they did very badly in this game sometimes you meet people that are actually doing what the team needs them to be doing
recommended
its alright
recommended
dota 2 sure fullfiled the expectations i had must play especially considering the fact that itll be free2play
recommended
an f exciting game and the f best game ever existed poor them whom doesnt lend their f time trying to learn dota but somehow its a f right choice too for them 
recommended
this is awesome
recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend
recommended
in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had
recommended
and you thought real life was a struggle
recommended
i only played a little but it was fun

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

oh wow look at me writing a review for 1 of my 3 favorite games on steam at 1000 pm time for spell check spam well anyways as i said it is one of my 3 favorite games on steam so lets start at the begginning it all started in world of warcraft i bought the game in 2008 and knew little about later i found out it was warcraft 4 so i went and looked at wacraft 3 one of the mods for warcraft 3 is called dota defense of the anchients sound familiar well it is a super worked on mod that eventually turned into a game dota2 this has got to sound familiar to you now so basically last time i counted there were 100 something classes in the game so obviously i wanted to try them all yah i got to about 13 and i got tired of failing with new classes so i chose my favorite class phantom lancer anyways in dota2 you can go around and kill people in a 5v5 match doesnt get much better than that oh wait it does when ever you think you have the best class there is one better than you so youll always get owned by someone unless your riki cmon that guys a god basically the goal of dota2 is to use teamwork and your brain to destroy atleast 5 towers 2 barracks and the well anchient hence the name defense of the anchient so i want to make this really long so i am going to go on when i got my first name tag kill counter and description tagged and jumped in joy i was able to make the best item ever it is a common xd so in short do you like moba games roleplaying games strategy games teamwork games games where you break your keyboard dota2 is the game for you to continue on with my jibberjabber i would like to introduce no one the puppet no one the puppet hi bros and brodettes get this game its free fun fascinating furious fabulous frightening fantastic funny fuming another f verb and so much more so get it post more f words below anyways i give this game a 9510 only thing i dont like about it is that matches take 3060 minutes long and you dont want to leave your screen during that times so get this game but i feel like this review is to short i am going to talk about riki so riki is a dranei flying space goat assassin heh that obliberates he has a shadowstep that can teleport him to a target where he can 3 shoot the enemy with 3 backstabs throw down some powder making it so his enemies cant do crap kill the other 4 enemies vanish and go buy a divine rapier yah that is pretty op if you want to suceed against riki make sure he never hits level 6 when he gets his stealth ability which is his elite skill he can basically be forever stealthed when he is out of combat for 3 seconds more on elite skills every class has one which is his or hers greated ability but in my opinion phantom lancer is better once he is high level is invincible he can do lots of damage with his normal attack and when you run away at 15% health he shoots a lance at your finishing you off and summon an illusion when you attack you can summon an illusion and when that illusion attacks he can someone another illusion so on and so forth so basically what i am saying is that phantom lancer is also op there is another class called sniper which you use in tutorial mode basically you can have riki stand invisible by a tower so you have a view of the tower but the tower isnt attacking riki then have a sniper outside of the towers range shoot the tower down and destroy it in glory this would also work for any other stealth classes well i do not know much else to say so i am going to end this here but i have 1 more thing to say get this game it is awesome
recommended
unfairness stress sorrow regret
recommended
ruins friendships 1010
recommended
there is no game that can get you depressed and madder than adolf hitler in 1945 and still have you keep playing it good game especially with friends

do you like right clicking do you enjoy the first 4 letters on your keyboard do you love feeling utterly hopeless and lost for hours upon hours as you try to learn what the hell is going on do you love russians if you answered yes to any of the above questions then this game was essentially made for you now i could spend hours verbally blowing this game and telling you all the reasons you should play it and love it or you can just download it yourself you lazy sod and learn why its the most played game on steam

one of the best esport games in history a lot of people have problems with its steep learning curve itll be hard for really long time to compete with veterans but its an esport game so thats what you should expect from games of this type also prepare for flaming from russians they think everyone know their language so they select all servers to communicate with wider range of people

a very good game simmilar to lol but a little different and harder in my opinion also you do not have to buy the champions wich makes it a truly free game
recommended
dota 2 is a well crafted well thoughtout game that has unlimited replayability and a ton of action from the very beginning of every match having played other mobas i highly recommend dota 2 over all of them for offering all the heroes for free and for requiring a higher skillset and competitive attitude yet still being a fun game that you can play with your friends
recommended
the best game ever
recommended
free to play need a teamwork to win the game know your role and win it
recommended
a really cool game you should play 
recommended
this game is for people who can use their brains properly lol
recommended
dota 2 was the most cool game to play with friends because we can experiment combining items and hero skills created many war strategy i love dota 2
recommended
this game
recommended
if you aint playing this you aint playing a moba
recommended
this is a very competitive game with some incredibly complicated mechanics the graphics are nice everything runs well and ive rarely seen issues which are fixed on a regular basis what makes it entertaining to me is the combination of hundreds of available characters each with their own relatively unique skill set along with hundreds of items to be bought during the course of each match in a 5 man team there are endless combinations of roles which can make for a solid strategy there is a matchmaking system that does a fair job of creating balanced teams hopefully dear player after you have practiced playing with bots and know all of the heroes and an endless learning curve the only problem i have with the game is how much abuse is prevalent in the community new players are able to join matches before they have the experience to make reliable teammates and rather than give them advice or instruction many would simply vote to kick a player from the team and 4v5 is hardly ever winnable i wish there were more people able to demand some respect and cooperation that i had more reports for those who use the word noob regularly and then claim the game is over before it began because of anything else if you like competition teamwork hilarious math reflexes and leadership then this is one of the best games youll find but it will be frustrating at times
recommended
ive played a lot of games with a wide and varied ammount of different communities but never have i played a game that could compete with the same level of   bicth noob that is russian dotos ive travelled wide and far to experience the european servers but no matter how hard i try i can never seem to find the promised lands ive been around to experience the following ti3  navi fountain hooking whilst gabe newel was clearly there diretide 2013    _  give diretide volvo chinese new year  broken shitblades  my life i quit this  game ti4  techies confirmed valve shut up and take my money 1210 rated much fun very russian too many reddit leaks would recommend have recommended they continue to play call of duty & gta v maybe i should recommend to pc gamers league of lung cancer still beats defense of the ancientrussians 2

dota 2 is quite similar to the famous league of legends but has also some minor and major differences in the following two sections ill discuss in short the positive and negative sides of this game even though there is more text i think in the negative section i still think that this game is great and fun to play positive  the earned xp doesnt alter the gameplay but only unlocks specific modes and items  you dont have to buy heroes like in league of legends the only thing that stops you from picking a specific hero is the game mode you are playing  the game is indeed a superb model for freetoplay  the stuff you buy or dont buy dont stop you from enjoying it completely it also does not give any perks that can ruin the overall impression of the game  like all sourceengine games dota 2 can run smoothly even on a trashy pc configuration i have two computers  a notebook that is approx 2 years old and a workstation from the 2007 the gpu is meant for cad and is not good for gaming on both with the right configuration machines dota 2 runs great if you have a 56 years old and more pc you might still be able to enjoy the game since im more of a its all good when the gameplay is great guy eyecandy visuals are not important for me lowering this and that setting is not the worst that can happen make sure however that it runs smoothly since this might ruin not only your enjoyment of the game but also of those who play with you  community  profanity is not uncommon but compared to the one behind league of legends the dota2community is more mature since its still young this might change in time lets hope not  ranked mode unlocks after the player has reached a certain number of games  even though the player might have 100 losses out of 100 games i can hardly imagine someone with such a groundbreaking record it is still a pleasant thing to know that once you start playing ranked most of the players will actually have some experience with the game  ability to train against ai andor with a coach  to ensure that the players are given the opportunity to learn if they want to valve gives us all the chance to test new heroes and strategies against ai andor with a coach another player that wants to help you learn the game  many game modes  there is a decent number of game modes that you can enjoy all of them have their strengths and weaknesses but still quite enjoyable to play  mute option is a blessing  the above mentioned maturity of the dota 2 community has its exceptions of course you might end up with a crazy person who screamsinsults or just belches on hisher microphone distracting you lucky enough for all of us who actually use the voice chat for its intended purposes there is a mute button next to each player in the list of players menu negative  reporting system is not mature enough im saying this as someone with over 100 games behind his back and not a single ban or put on the low priority queue some people simply abuse it just because they cannot deal with some personal issues or whatever and decide that whoever is not following their lead should be reported in a worst case scenario a great deal of the game goes by while threats for reporting someone are made instead of simply enjoying it the given options to report a player are also quite limited for example there is no way to report a player who is idle doesnt do anything at all he is not feeding he is not abusing his abilities and is not feeding since his hero is just camping at the base what do you do in such situations the verbal abuse over voice chat is also not possible to report as far as i know  frequent updates  of which i get sometimes 34 per day which of course leads to the prompt your client is out of date way too often after an update it is not uncommon that the game simply crashes silently im playing on linux so i cant say anything about the windows client of the game  lots of bugs  mentioning linux reminded me of the couple of bugs that seem to reappear from time to time such as the weird key binding menu bug where the player is unable to assign a specific key comination in most cases connected with the chatall command which hasnt been working on my client since day one one other bug that has still not been fixed is the famous invulerable dc disconnected player the player abandons the game and is replaced by a bot who might turn invinsible this leads to some weird situations where players in the game are killed by this bug the usual solution in this case is to push on those lanes where the invinsible bot is not present as fast as possible the bot is not shot at by your own creeps and towers so it just goes along a lane and kills everything on its path i even experienced a situation where such bug appeared on both teams  abandoning the game  im totally for punishing people who just dc and dont come back abandoning intentionally their teammates but its really unfair if you get points in this overall bad statistic for games that crashed sometimes the client crashes and again and again so the time you are given to come back to the game might not be enough sometimes the connection might be so bad that the amount of lag might turn you into an unintentional feeder  stay in the game and feed or leave it i have a decent internet connection but sometimes the problem might come from the servers that valve places at your dispossal i have experienced some games that are sluggish and not just for me but for all other players what to do in such situations when things dont improve i have 2 abandons because of the reasons ive mentioned above  ai  if you play solo against bots that you must do at least at the beginning during training you will find out that maybe in 99% of all games the bots on your team act dumber to say the least comapred to those on the opponents team they not only feed way too much but they also have some basic issues like a decent path finding ive seen plenty of bots getting stuck somewhere and it takes quite a while for them to realize that they cant go in that specific direction since ive mentioned feeding i care to note also that the bots that replace dcs can be a major pain for your team especially if the players that were playing those heroes were high level the ai of the bots in multi is pathetic and they respawn go straight forward to a specific lane even though there is a certain chance of death ahead and get killed giving xp to the opposite team this routine repeats over and over again  matching  the nonranked game mode has a really weird matching system if you are level x in a game you might get players with level x10 x20 etc needless to say it is great to have someone more experienced than you to teach you but i believe thats what the coaching is for the first time i realized this weird matching system was more or less at the beginning of the game when i was level 4 and actually played with someone on my team with level 21  ability draft game mode  i give a special attention to this mode because there is something that reallly bothers me namely the absence of heroinformation on the board where you select your abilities if you havent played all the heroes when this mode gets unlocked you might end up getting a bad surprise not knowing basic things about your hero such as is it melee or ranged is it a carry or a nuker etc the meleeranged is actually not given anywhere in any of the modes at least i havent seen a hint about it but at least in other modes you are given the chance to chat to the other players you are going to play with and ask them those things in ability draft you can only use voice chat to ask questions which might not be an option if other players dont speak your language andor youthey dont have or dont want to use a microphone

love this game so much
recommended
game is very much thrilling and can be enjoyed with friends what i disliked no no no no nothing
recommended
when youre in lane youll most likely pick your main you farm and you farm hoping you stay away from harm a russian will be there soon after your squeels of pain will give them laughter no more safe lane for you your last hits will then turn to poo but what is this i see on the the horizon its the carry your teams score is suddenly rising he pushes hard till youre all in base he rolls and he rolls all over their face so next time you think your time is through remember your carry is not always poo

i used to play dota 1 on my old pentium 4 pc back in 2009 and it was a great experience and when i learned that valve acquired the rights to make a sequel for 1st mod game i was shocked like how can they do that are they going to collaborate with blizzard to develop a new one but then i found out that the project will be a standalone sequel without warcraft or blizzard and when i tried the final product i was surprised cause its very similar to its predecessor and for those who enjoyed the first one im pretty sure that you will surely enjoy this valve version as well not to mention ice frog one of the main modders of dota1 was the lead designer of this game so expect that the features that youve loved on the first still remains in this version kudos to valve and ice frog so far im enjoying the game more than any other titles on steam i will definitely recommend this to moba addicts out there especially the dota 1 patrons

recommended
for the most part yes i do recommend this game and for the record yes this game is addicting despite its extremely annoying penalty rounds due to abandoning games and a community that sometimes consists mostly of multicultural and and multilingual players or trolls dota is a moba that succeeds in keeping players playing  not because of its given motivation to acheive high priority when one is in the lower level but because of its unique atmosphere and game world and characters that never cease to allure dotagoers in their many plethoras of styles and abilities the large and very diverse pool of heroes as players and professionals alike call it never fails to encourage players to change up their tactics and strategies for the matches they participate in all in all this game like the underground hit it was and is is a keeper obviously without a doubt
recommended
this game is more contagious than ebola
recommended
this is such a good game its tough to learn and get into but i love playing this

many people argue about wether dota 2 is better or league of legends i play both dota more and i wouldnt say dota is better there are many differences between the games and the main one is strategy in league of legends vision is required and map awareness is essential however in dota position matters a lot more than lol since the 4th minute on in dota everybody is ganking around the place and tp supports are coming in to survive ganks in lol it is a lot simpler farm kill push mid in dota you have to think constantly watch the map counter draft counter build position yourself and rotate correspondingly in lol there are many lacking features such as vision obstruction hills and trees missing diverse range of active items and ability types if you want a simple just play game go for lol but you are a a strategic player and look for osmething that truly tests your skill id recommend dota 2
recommended
most awsome game for me i`am realy enjoing to play this game recommand this game
recommended
welp its certainly more detailled than lol there are less heros but they are very different there is almost no match up between eachother to be able to interact with trees and other entities makes feel like im inside the games very good go dota2 team hf and gl

dota 2 this name needs no explanation and yet so much explanation to say that this game has not changed my life would be a lie dota 2 has proven that it can both create and destroy life in term qualify itself as god to speak lowly of dota 2 is heresy but i am a heretic by default a devils advocate who speaks out against dota 2 dota its predecessor was an amazing map that i used to play with friends dota 2 is just a target jokes nowadays boasting a lovely all russian matchmaking with offbranches such as turkey matchmaking and brazilian huehuehue matchmaking if you wish to play dota 2 all i can say is go ahead its an amazing game that deserves so much more a one mans story its you and them your teams just a meat shield dont let others coerce you into wasting your precious hardfarmed gold on those pesky wards or god forbid support someone remember chicks dig carries so always pick them plz add vrzo pokemonftw 420swagyolo4ever

a worthy sequel dota 2 have been developed for the past 2 years since its closed beta on 2011 where invites are poured out to players on steam i may not be of those lucky few that have gotten the invite but nevertheless after i experienced in from a friends account i must say valve has successfully elevated the progenitor of the moba genre to the next level with improvements that can only be possible with more advanced game engines i myself has been a dota player in the past and seeing the sequel made but still having its core game play maintained brings a warm joy to my heart since the core mechanics of dota like denying creep stacking or even juking has been successfully brought back to this game dota 2 still manages to bring the competitive atmosphere into players both new or veterans alike since the core mechanics are not changed and then i would like to mention the huge improvement the game has bought is the shop system in game where we can just click on an item if we have the enough amount of money since its pretty tad confusing if you are new to dota 2 and you dont know what are the item builds for each particular hero since dota 2 can be really challenging by mastering different item builds for different situations or the hero mechanics itself a long and tedious journey awaits you but once you have mastered the mechanics then your satisfaction will be very high another major improvement is the tutorial system that valve has implemented such as introducing close combat with dragon knight and long range combat with sniper and also laning tutorials which can help new players to overcome their fear in laning against enemy heroes probably the newest addition is the last hit training which shows players how to last hit a creep to gain more gold and experience this is useful for new comers and veterans alike to hone their skills the steam workshop system also works very well with the game where players can contribute their unique items made for heroes in gamethese items can also be implemented in game through the communitys help by up voting the particular item which is also a fair way for players to get their favorite cosmetic items from the workshop to be implemented in game me myself kept regularly browsing the workshop to see the ideas of the players around the world and its amazing on how you can see a lot of fresh content from players around the world however the community of dota 2 maybe very harsh on new players since i have seen players that tends to be harsh to newcomers since they havent mastered the core mechanics and flame them regularly but dont take it to heart since there are also some good left in this community you will come across gamers with patience and are willing to teach you to get better and even enemies that can cheer you up and joke around with you even though they are losing or winning the game overall i give the game a 910 for its reinvention of the titular dota title and with new improvements such as customization options while still retaining the core mechanics makes this gamea worthy sequel

a game where you meet russians and rage at themand they rage at you becuase you picked rikithis is a must have game but sooner or later you will get sucked in this game and start buying stuff for your heroesand it will protect your virginity  810

dota 2 is the best freetoplay game ive tried this year even with its significant learning curve this game had me completely addicted within the first three matches plan to dedicate hours to practicing against bots before approaching online matches or you will be seriously owned it will hurt you will feed and everyone will yell at you yet somehow you will still enjoy it just play this game you will not regret it

 very balanced gameplay  first time i discovered the new generation likes to flamecurse a lot in chatvoice gamers used to be happy to even meet other gamers   pay  slow but doable xp to get items

the people i meet in this game i would kill in real life
recommended
a combination of great game mechanics and compelling hero backstories make dota 2 a cut above other multiplayer online battle arenas mobas such as league of legend and dota 1 of particular interest to new and old players alike is the hero mirana and her trademark wbutton ability sacred arrow which when successfully deployed is often considered one of the most fatal notulti moves in the game when not utilising this 360damage 5second stun players may take solace in miranas other special abilities such as leap a devastatingly evasive jump starstorm a powerful aoe magical damage dealer and her notorious ultimate moonlight shadow which will render all heroes on miranas team invisible at the click of a button whilst dota 2 does not necessarily revolve around the everpopular hero mirana at this time many hope to one day see her in an online actionadventure of her very own

a game where strategical teamwork is essential to win so if youre under 12 years old and your favourite game is call of duty or team fortress 2 stay away from this game

dota 2 is a game that is gripping and a refreshing change to games out there at the moment i used to be a fps person but now im open to alot more games dota is a team game which actually requires a stong bond between the team rather than many fpses where one good person can win the game while the rest of the team does bugger all all though it is infuriating at times where no missing is called or someone doesnt use their ult it is a great game from valve and the workshop items for the game are diverse and unlike anything youve ever seen before dota is free to play and incredibly addictive and fun so i suggest that you install it and give it a go fox out
recommended
best moba game out there 1

recommended
i dont know about you guys but i learn how to deal with hotheaded people by playing this game alone and oh yeah most russians sucks sorry but its from experience tis a game that really drains your time truly not recommended for college students especially in a week or month before their finals from just a custom map in one of the best blizzards game to a standalone eye catching game with a worldwide recognized tournament for every player and friends that reach the skillpeak of this game note for parents this game can be a big career for your kids so either let your kids play this game and encourage them to be a professional or blockcontrol them for ever knowing this game
recommended
graphics are good all heroes are balance all heroes can be overpowered if get fat therefore it is well balance
recommended
dota2 do not install this game just dont i played 800 hours in this game and i cant say something good 80% of this game depends on your team but your team will be weak because the matchmaking is not good and the other team will be casual fed op heros that will wipe you and make you rage every single ing game do not install lol or hon they are even worse play singleplayer games they are much much funnier than this 
not recommended
the most addicted game ever no game other than dota

with almost 2k hours in the game ive found that this game has great replayability value with changes coming out on a constant enough basis to keep it interesting i have learnt lots   in my time    but           please send

dota 2 do you like feeling inadequate worthless do you like feeling angry or getting mad at people you dont even know do you love to invest hours upon hours of your life into something that will only bring you pain with brief moments of joy do you like playing team games with that require team communication with people that dont speak your language queue from other countries and dc constantly if so dota2 is your game i wish i never started playing dota2 there is a deep understanding a person with 2k  hours of dota begins to see its like the deeper side of chess it is evil majestic molesting and somewhat horrifying if you truly start playing dota2 truly start to unlock its deeper secrets do be craful this game is a pos that will rob your soul the mmr is garbage the mm is hell on earth dota2 might be the best game i have ever played in all my life

75% of characters look like undead piles of crap and all the human females look like s 1010 in seriousnes most of the charcters look pretty cool even the undead ones no hold backs on the female humans looking like s though im not really a big fan of the game or any moba game as a matter of a fact but when trying this game out i actually got pretty addicted to it for a while i recommend trying this with friends though makes the expirence better and gives less worries of meeting a stranger whom is gonna curse you out for eating his tree that one time i recommend trying out the hero named sniper if youre gonna play the game for the first time
recommended
dota has become one of the most popular games ever being one of the top 10 most played games on steam heres why the learning curve some might say this is the worst part of the game but almost no one can deny that its what gets you addicted and stuck in this world of heroes might and magic like any traditional moba each hero has its own distinctive role from support to carry and many other positions dota focuses mainly on building your character up in the beginning of a match and then through teamwork and strategy going head to head with the other team and pushing destroying the enemy teams towers creeps etc all the way to their ancient leading to its destruction and victory it might sound strange to someone who may be unfamiliar with moba style games but its an art and science within itself with millions of diehard fans constantly urging themselves to become better and more efficient with their playing styles with the inclusion of the 100 available characters there are at least five different ways to play each character meaning there is an insane amount of replayability already staked onto the stellar online multiplayer experience of both casual experienced and professional dota 2 players the games learning curve will take at least 40 hours of ingame time and potentially hours of research outside of the game youtube wikis etc which can seem like a major turn off for a game such as this however there is an offline practice mode available for new players to hone their skills and find out what characters they enjoy playing the most ive read the other reviews for dota 2 and found that many people are upset with russians and chinese going on us servers causing a language barrier and potentially losing games because of that i will admit this is a problem that will hopefully be fixed in the near future as it is rather problematic and detrimental to emerging victorious in a dota 2 match in conclusion dota 2 is a great game and has become one of my personal favourite games of all time the amazing diversity of every match the fantastic community and the overall amount of content being added every month is astonishing plus its a free to play not a pay to win its legitamately a f2p game what do you got to lose give dota 2 and try and find out what everyone is talking about you wont regret it

a very good game that is well known for its gameplay and its  community

recommended
chill and play
recommended
dota is the best
recommended
im sure im part of the minority but i just cannot get into dota 2 the original warcraft mod was fun to play as a change to normal gameplay but a game focused entirely on that is unappealing to me personally most of my friends actually play this game a lot and love it i however get bored or very frustrated when i play it and unlike other games for some reason i do not have the drive to make myself better at it also the community is extremely harsh ill admit i suckreally bad but the learning curve is so high very few people are really good what makes the game frustrating is that instead of being supportive when i joined games and tried i got a lot of flame from the other players because i sucked i admit that it is annoying in a small team game to have one guy who sucks but at least dont go nuts when they say sorry im a noob

if you are an old dota 1 player download and enjoy if you are a new player dont even try realy none is going to help you on your first games tutorial is  for online playing everybody will curse you unfortunately theres no space for new players i tried gave up
not recommended
after nearly 2000 hours in this game i think its time to write a review do you enjoy not being able to communicate with your teammates because even if you do happen to speak english anything other than ingame chat binds is going to get you a voice ban expect everyone to be absolutely crap the only way i win games anymore is if i boost some noob op carry thats another thing about this game every new hero they come out with is even worse than the last and has some ridiculous 50 dollar price tag for any item sets free 2 play ruined dota its all peruvians with 5 accounts lagging all over pausing the game all the time because their internet sucks smurfing has gone out of control still the best moba but the worst absolute worst community

well ruined my school my life because dota is life anyone who says its just a game   
recommended
chillar game
recommended
one if not the most complex games that are definately worth a try with the greatest community of s and  who will always be next to you if you need another dose of low selfesteem this game embeds more than learning how to play alone but more on how people learn to cooperate the process of scrambling random players into a team proves to be easy but the talking and teamwork sometimes prove to be hard if not impossible this game is a masterpiece of bipolarity prejudice and humiliation if you reader want to experience how tough and obnoxious people may become during a match which doesnt even take up an hour most of the time this is the game you definately should choose to try out oh i forgot to mention dont confuse the dota english language with the actual english language because this ones got elements of russian greek german and any other language you can think of enjoy
recommended
same as dota but with more 2 1010 would 2 again
recommended
if youre a fan of moba games youll probably enjoy this surely you might find it to be harder to begin playing with it if youre coming from league of legends or some other moba game the community is quite trash mostly and if youre playing pub matches youll be overrun by low level players that use pubstomp heroes and youll most likely lose unless theyre so bad theyre even bad at those heroes it will take you a while to get onto some decent levels and decent pubs but its worth it graphics are nice and somewhat toony like tf2 and gameplay varies a lot depending on the teams heroes and item builds you pick its free so why not try it all its features are free the only thing you might want to buy are aesthetics edit depression simulator 2015  this game taught me that everyone deserves the same amount of hate oh and if its russians that are playing id prefer russian roulette thanks at least you get to learn every single language except english nobody talks english in dota 2 are you crazy
recommended
i dont know whats going on in this ing game i press buttons and people die on occassion 1010
recommended
most cool strategy game
recommended
the most challenging and engaging moba warning to lol players there is a steep learning curve and you need to unlearn a lot of habits all attack animations are not designed to last hit making it actually take skill meanwhile the game is all about skill activatable items and always being able to comeback if youre diligent and knowledgable its about crushing defeat that sinks to your core and triumphant victory that makes you yell to the skies
recommended
do you want to learn how to  talk on russian youve picked a right place also its kinda addicting

blatant ripoff of the adventure time moba

fun as long as your not playing with idiots

dota 2 promises to take the unique blend of online rts and rpg action that has made dota popular with tens of millions of gamers and expand upon it in every way this is a competitive moba game of action and strategy played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes forming two teams of five characters radiant heroes then battle their dire counterparts to control a fantasy landscape waging campaigns of cunning stealth and outright warfare put a few hundred hours into a game and youll normally have its mechanics down pat you may not be the greatest player ever but you can usually expect to be at least competent and able to make a valuable contribution to your teams efforts sure some teenager all hopped up on mountain dew and pubertal rage is still going to have faster reactions than you but youll get by until you pick up dota 2 in dota 2 you can play for a hundred hours and still be the most useless n00b to ever play the game a let down to your team an embarrassment to friends and family its a brutal game but if you get into itand not everyone willit can make a fullon heroin addiction look like nothing more severe than a mild hankering

dota is either fun or infuriating once you figure out what to do dota destroys relationships with friends makes you racist to nearly everyone that doesnt speak your language makes you a terrible intolerant person who insults people when barely provoked if youre going to play dota dont play it with good friends play with friends you dont mind losing thatll either make you super close or hate eachother over 900010 get it now

the developers are really updating this game allot and the recent changed they made show that they actually listen to the people playing this game because of the constant updating and tweaks in heroes you can get suprised in every game with a reaction like does that hero do new  now anyway the game is really fun to play especially with friends the game has a good tactical depth to it and people finding new good combos everyday if you like mobas this is the way to go
recommended
has a steep learning curve the road is rough but if you commit effort it can be a lot of fun  especially when you are playing with friends
recommended
this is a great game and i love it plus its free

i orginally played dota 2 when it first came out having my friend play and tell me about it i tried the tutorial which was an awful idea because the games tutorial is for the most part useless i recommend going straight into a bot match with some friends who have already played the game that will be so much easier here are the pros and cons of this game pros great but hard gameplay super addictive great music voice acting graphics and animations unique characters strategy based teamwork occasional good teammates gives you a list of items to get for you charcter such as starting items early game core items and situational items hella charcters team creation and rosters a giant playerbase and i mean giant cons occasional bad teammates russians play on your own server occasional feedersone who gets killed on purpose racism annoyance and anger when loosing can if you let it ruin your day even your life no joke although hasnt happened to me unlike lolleague of legends has all characters unlocked which can make it harder to chose and get used to characters one map which is fine but can turn some gamers off i know this seems like a lot more cons than pros but this is really a good game definently if you have friends to play with one more thing this game is not for casual gamers at all and you most likely will die a lot at first even if you dont think youll like this game you should still try it if you need help with it at first get a friend to help you play if not contact me and i can help

as you can tell from my game play hours i have had quite an epic time playing this video gameb ased of off leage of legends defend the ancients please is an action adventure game starring jack black and jason statham as they and three less famous friends defend their ancients from evil jack black evil jason statham and three less evil less famous friends this video game was clearly made in russia but i dont know so theres a lot of rusians playing it but i can kinda see why because its quite a fun video ame id rate defend the ancients please a 711 which is my favourite japanese store which links to the reason that this game isnt a 1111 which is that it wasnt made in japan how else am i going to get my bonner hard if there arent any hot anime babes well i guess that these american women would suffice but in all honesty anime girls and a few japanese musicians are the only attractive people on this westernised planet long live nippon

the best moba hands down the lore of the heroes the diversity and unique design of each hero every aspect is well thought out while some heroes are a bit overpowered you can still counter them and you can still win the setting and soundtrack adds to the aspect of gameplay as well this game crushes lol smite and hon in my opinion
recommended
this is a game that surprised me most of the game is just clicking with the mouse right click to do this left click to do that it did require a bit of effort getting used to it but it can be picked up easily still getting to grips with the camera and the lengthy matches means that you play for hours without realising it this game probably will take up a lot of time in your life so make sure you have many reasons to leave your computer screen
recommended
4 noobs only
recommended
dota is the best moba game ive ever played so far even if youre new to moba games like i were you should still try dota its free its fun the only thing you lose on it is your social life
recommended
have a nice game
recommended
this game will take over your life do not ever expect to do anything productive you will lose contact will all outside life you will break countless keyboards every word in you vocabulary will be replaced with f overall i strongly recommend it
recommended
dota2 is the highly successful sequel to the warcraft 3 custom map defense of the ancients the original dota was the parent of the moba genre that we enjoy today and dota2 has done an amazing job carrying on the legacy if you were a fan of the original or enjoy the current moba games on the market such as league of legends heroes of newerth or smite  give dota2 a chance there are literally dozens of heroes to choose from with multiple item builds for each hero this can make the learning curve a little steep but there is a decent tutorial system in place for helping new players learn there is also an improved bot mode now where you can practice against ai and hone your skills until you feel comfortable playing with other players ranked play adds a more competitive arena for players looking to improve and advance and there is now a solo mid 1v1 mode to practice laning if you so choose dota2 is an ever evolving game and growing into a prominent esports arena it isnt for everyone and players that get frustrated easily might want to avoid it the community can be a bit hostile towards newer players but with some patience you can find great players and make friends that will help you through the process

great game for strategy type players items do not directly affect game result for this game are to strategy and teamwork
recommended
since at the era of dota 1 im already a fan of this game what i do like on this game is its not like just the other normal games here you have to squeeze up your mind to win it is all about strategy skills techniques and many other more
recommended
one of the most tactical thoughtrequiring game out there amazing gameplay and graphics providing the player with visual stimulation as well as gameplay satisfaction a must for the moba peeps it was my first moba game and i cant get enough of it rating 9910 ps volvo why you no get better servers <
recommended
i have a pet peeve of basically always liking valve games now call me a fanboy but this one like all of them has a reason for being one of my favourites though it is slow paced and complicated it is a great game when you get into it i myself was never really interested in mobas or rpg games like wow or diablo but i really liked this if you play alot of games that are competitive and involve alot of thought teamwork and strategy this shouldnt be too far away from what you already know find a character youre comfortable with some of my favourites are dragon knight clockwerk and venomancer play some offline matches with bots and you should do great i warn you though this is one timeconsuming and addicting game
recommended
easiest way to develop anger issues 1010

best freaking teamgame ever

this game is a test of everything in your life everything it will turn you into a stronger person but the road is filled with toxic chemicals everywhere you will most likely fall victim to the dangers that doto 2 holds or you can be legend

recommended
great game in the world
recommended
speaking from a past lol players perspective this is the one game i play to death and im really good at as of now this game will make you feel an array of emotions from rage to happiness and back again leaving for quite a ride bottom line if youre gonna play this game and i cant stress this enough go in knowing what youre doing if you dont you will fail hard so many people forget that got that good the gameplay itself is typical of a moba but lol players beware the courier system gold loss on death and other mechanics is going to warrant some getting used to the community is relatively fine so long as you know what youre doing the lol trashers are few and relatively uneventful for me and you are perfectly nice the few s will come but as the bronies say love and tolerate the graphics are good what else is there to say im not gonna do a whole paragraph on it theyre fine the gameplay is smooth and provides a decent amount of challenge and fun overall this is a great game 1010 this is my first review
recommended
i faild school and didnt graduate 1010

lets look at this in a civilized fashion if dota was a person it would be bill gates complete and perfect however dota does not have its own island league of legends is like the ymca its full of children who never had a taste of bill gates lifestyle the people who have had a taste of it will never set foot in the ymca ever again ever unless of course they find that everyone is too good and they leave to join the ymca nothing against the ymca but bill gates life is probably better

this is dotaaaaaaaaaaa
recommended
dota 2 is my fav game and it is good because i have learned russian from it 1010
recommended
yes this game is hard to learn yes people can be rather aggressive yes it is possibly the best multiplayer experience ive ever had and yes once you play at least 10 games youll be hooked i try to play at least one game a day and have been doing so for months and dont plan on stopping give the game a chance more like 5 and i guarantee that youll see why its the most played game on steam be prepared to be dumbfounded as to why you were playing anything else also a side note the games free steam is free the only thing u have to lose from giving it a try is alil self respect in the beginning but dont worry after one game where u actually do really good youll feel like a million bucks

overall id say its not that bad little different from league but still fun enough however my steam friend mwacky is too stuck in his ways to try it and the moment he started doing poorly in a bot game just quit he is a big 
recommended
dota is either fun or infuriating once you figure out what to do dota destroys relationships with friends makes you racist to nearly everyone that doesnt speak your language makes you a terrible intolerant person who insults people when barely provoked if youre going to play dota dont play it with good friends play with friends you dont mind losing thatll either make you super close or hate eachother over 900010 get it now
recommended
dota 2 is highly addictive in the respects that its fast paced strategic and overall fun to play to be honest at first i couldnt get into the game though after i kept pushing myself to learn the heroes items mechanics strats etc this as become one of my favorite game to play with friends every time i play a match its different its always different when other heroes are chosen it changes the game entirely the rules of the game change everytime you pick your hero and your enemies and team mates pick theirs every hero is over powered when leveled and given the right items pros wide and ever growing pool of heroes wide ranges of team and lane combinations training grounds are very friendly to new players to the moba style of gaming or just to the game over all wide range of abilities active and passive casual and competitive game play from nonranked to ranked keeps track of your mmr matches you with people around the same skill level as you or the head of your party some heroes have companion lines cons dated textures on some heroes hard to get out of low priority once in low priority other regions get intertwined easily prefered language doesnt always mean youll get with people who speak in a tongue you understand english portuguise russian german etc people tend to rage easily reports might be common to new players unfamiliar with multiplayer matches
recommended
a place where you can meet jerks get scolded ragequit etc one of the best game of all time

if you love your family and friends you should never play this game with them highly recommended
recommended
blyat after 1000 hours of this game i can say it is one of the best games i have played but i wouldnt advise you to play it as it will drain the fing soul out of you and you will not have any life from then on however if you do decide to play this game report the russians and flame your team
recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend

in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had

and you thought real life was a struggle

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you
recommended
one day a wise man intoduce me into this game it shall protect your virginity my lad he said
recommended
this is one the best games you could ever come across but everything has its pros and cons ill write its here gameplay  it is a typical moba genre game you select a hero from 112 heroes each hero has unique abilites which cost mana to cast that are used to assist the hero along with its physical attacks which deal variable damage to kill the enemy heroes a typical dota 2 game is about 30  50 minutes you kill uncontrolled units called creeps in the starting phase of the game to gain gold and xp and later fight the enemy heroes along with your team to destroy their base and their ancient pros   helps improve  strategical thinking  teamwork  quick decision making  reflexes  observation power  ability to predict  fun to play  relaxing  antiboredom  keeps you away from porn because its so addictive cons   time wastage  affects eyesight  affects vertebral column  very addictive  bad grades  inability to concentrate  makes you racist  makes you antisocial  makes you violent  makes you aggresive  makes you frustrated too often  makes you abusive  makes you cold hearted  affects relationships  many more should you play  whether you should play or not depends on what you want if youre looking for a good strategical game involving teamwork and quick reflexes and decision making this is what youre looking for however if youre looking for a casual game just to kill some time and youre pretty busy through the rest of the day or if youre a student this game is just not for you however id recommended that keeping in view the risks of this game that ive mentioned in the cons you should if you can afford the risks give this game a try atleast note  most of the cons only appear once you play it online since theres close to no cons in the game itself besides being addictive and the other physical effects of excessive computer use the main reason for the cons is the extremely toxic community everyone rages everyone flames everyone abuses everyone blames here welcome to dota
recommended
i hate this game so ing much
recommended
all dota 2 players be patient to your teammateswe are not perfect all the time d d
recommended
extremely good graphics good interfaceand easy to adapt shifting from dota 1 to dota 2  gameplay experience is always good if you ever feel bored just switch your heroesget used to new heroes and you will feel a brand new experience again a very good game gives free to play feature and you dont have to pay to win you give money merely for eye candy only only real skills are allowed here

recommended
here is your typical sarcastic review of dota2 the game is so good i picked a carry then asked for safe lane at the start of the picking phase team then picks faceless void antimage spectre  report submitted damn this is fun 1010 would play again situations where you become frustrated about losing because of lack of proper communication with your team arise very often in this game so the key to enjoying is by simplying letting go not so easy when desperate to win aside from this con everything else is pretty much solid and it is still a very enjoyable game 85100

so i was fingering my bloody  with a carrot and realized wtf am i doing with my life so i decided to try dota 2 for the first time needless to say i got back to fingering my  in about 5 minutes this game is absolute garbage and would rather play minesweeper while attending a 5 hour orgy fest at a mcdonalds i give this game a 2 because at least lemon party had me interested for about 2 seconds
recommended
it is an excellent game lots of choice of characters alot of abilities to learn and different itemsset ups to try not suggested for those who only have 10 minutes to play a game p needs achievements though they could so easily impliment them but are too lazy as of yet

lets look at this in a civilized fashion if dota was a person it would be bill gates complete and perfect however dota does not have its own island league of legends is like the ymca its full of children who never had a taste of bill gates lifestyle the people who have had a taste of it will never set foot in the ymca ever again ever unless of course they find that everyone is too good and they leave to join the ymca nothing against the ymca but bill gates life is probably better

this is dotaaaaaaaaaaa

dota 2 is my fav game and it is good because i have learned russian from it 1010
recommended
yes this game is hard to learn yes people can be rather aggressive yes it is possibly the best multiplayer experience ive ever had and yes once you play at least 10 games youll be hooked i try to play at least one game a day and have been doing so for months and dont plan on stopping give the game a chance more like 5 and i guarantee that youll see why its the most played game on steam be prepared to be dumbfounded as to why you were playing anything else also a side note the games free steam is free the only thing u have to lose from giving it a try is alil self respect in the beginning but dont worry after one game where u actually do really good youll feel like a million bucks

what else to say

guess its good

good game in real time in the moba genre with rpg elements from the creators of warcraft iii the developer and publisher of computer games blizzard entertainment wwwyoutubecomwatchvnrefmi6usjc&index13&listplc6dfae8272f70bd8

welcome to dota a game where you will sacrifice everything for your teammates only be flamed by afk pudges and neversatisied medusas until the end of the match you will hear such insults and remarks as no items why u buy item instead of wards why arent you stacking y u no have tp instead of wardsdust y u no die with me u should read ur abilities noob because i get concerned when someone in unranked gameplay doesnt remember exactly how their ult was reworked last month omg ive never seen such a bad kda before ugh your all horrible just like my teammates the last 56 games just uninstall thats the only thing thatll make you play better all this while desperately attempting to save your hard carrys life and die time and time again to the enemies burst damage it may be that a friendly soul will attempt to reason with them but it will be to no avail to those teammates you were nothing but a verbal punching bag in a long line of verbal punching bags once they locked on they became deadset on flaming you as mentioned previously until the very end of the match then as you go to dotabuff spirits low you see the scrubs havent even registered and then you will see that dota 2 has sent you a notification informing you that action has been taken against those flamers all thanks to your reports it is then you will realize that once more all is right with the world 1110 would recommend

dota2 is a pc game played from the prespective of 3rd person there are around 4050 classes to choose from with unique abilites and items the map is always the same but there are so many different ways to play the map the game may seem slow complicated and frustrating at first but dont let that fool you after i played this game for around 4 hours i got the hang of things and began getting a couple kills per match and leading the team to victory i would give the game a 8510 and would recommend it to others plus its free good luck playing dota2 and if you need any help feel free to add me but comment on my profile first

this game is fun in many ways if you like mobas there are over a 100 of heros that can fit your game style there are also many items that you can use and strategize with in the begining it might be challenging but you can overcome that by playing the training that dota 2 has given you play a few games and youll get a handle of things dota 2 is in my opinion the best moba game out there now all the lol players are gonna yell at me lastly the game has a very kind community besides that one guy that you might play with every 2050ish games all in all dota 2 is a great game and should be played by all gamers who love mobas

dota is the game that drains your soul and slowly your steam wallet by influencing items that slightly alter your characters look in game not like you dont look at the bald spot on their head 247 anyway but still you do it slowly it caused me to denounce every other game in my library i cant help myself but play more of this cocaine lined work of art with a cashmere fitting my muscle to fat ratio is shifting to the latter and i am currently drinking prune juice nonstop just to pass a pair of nail clippers i mistook as a cheeto whose family was being pilled into my mouth for consumption between courier runs someone please help me other than that 1010

do you have too much spare time do you enjoy spending money only to make minor differences to character models well then do i have a game for you designed to eat money and time alike dota2 gives an experience you wouldnt soon forget while new the game offers a community that will constantly remind you of this fact with constant taunts of noob  rubbish noob delete game now so bad etc practice bot matches turn feral when joined by mlg leet pro amazeballs players whose god like playing is only matched by thier inability to stay alive against easy bots and to blame new players for this overall i would give dota a score based on a percentage of either x10 or x100 that x is due to vary depending on the day so i have decided not to include it
recommended
i came from hon to dota 2 and i find the switch so gratifying dota 2 is a much better game and far better community no two games is ever the same and i like that

love this game i played league of legends before this heard about dota 2 and thought dota 2 was going to suck but i play this more now

an exellent example of a game that requires teamwork made lots of good friends here be patient and learn the mechanics u will end up enjoying the game a hell of alot more be patient though especially with no stereotyping pinoys and russians the picks they make lol and for the love of good stop playing riki 9510 my game of the year for 2013 game in review as of 26th march 2015 not much changes from my first review except for some terrible events from valve such as the oracle pa fest as well as the year best 2015 which constantly crashed servers in its ludicrous pay to win concept really hope this does not become the norm for dota other than that current meta is pretty stale with sf sniper and jug in every game hope ti5 changes things up for the community side note managed to learn fluent russian and tagalog in this 2 years who knew dota was a language simulator

dota 2 is the best ever game not only uses skills but also mind always ready and alert every time its challenge me so much to play more
recommended
dont play itit will take your life 1010 recommended
recommended
great game you wouldnt expect for valve to have been the creators of dota 2 and team fortress 2 the games are vastly different
recommended
dota 2 is fun and addicting action realtime strategyarts game that you can sink countless hours into however this isnt the case from the beginning the tutorial teaches players basic mechanics of the game but it will not teach you how to survive in a real match if you jump right in to a game with other players lacking personal experience you will die constantly and likely find yourself demoralized its not fun while this is true if you really take your time with the game slowly learning about heroes items and strategies the game begins to open up it becomes the addicting game i first mentioned and you will love it there are countless possibilities and every match is different and interesting in its own way you need to sink some time into it to get to this point but luckily valve helps ease you in with the aforementioned tutorial as well as bot games and the ability to play against bots with other humans as of the time of this writing there are 110 playable heroes in dota 2 although the map is always the same you will encounter different characters combinations and tactics every time you play this is what i mean by countless possibilities there are characters for all kinds of playstyles supports carriesthe powerful ones dealing out the damage teamfighters and more it truly never gets old give dota 2 a try and some of your time and i assure you that you will not be dissapointed
recommended
only the best game ever if you want to play an aggravating game with a ridiculously steep learning curve that will probably ruin your life and a community that speaks through cussing this is for you other than that its a great game newbies should always play meepo their first game

worst game in my life dont recommend to anyone that has a life 1010
recommended
dota 2 adds a great deal of complexity to the moba genre its balance tenet is everything goes there is no character that is underpowered in fact theyre all overpowered in their own way the game places a great burden of knowledge over whoever tries it out be sure to stick to coop games for starters the tutorial may prepare you slightly but the game as a whole is a lot more complex than other mobas on the market oh and the saying it aint over till its over applies here you cant be sure youre winning until the radiantdire goes down lots of rooms for comebacks in here but the game is far more snowbally than other mobas
recommended
this is a good game and very fun to play with my friends
recommended
i would definitely reccomend this game to others it depends on teamwork and its a strategy game thats why i love it
recommended
dota 2 is good game for me because im a gamer 
recommended
best game ever you dont know where time flows
recommended
1010 recommended its a game where you meet infamous thai girl noozkii a female womanizer and a male catfisher with names like miyako oh you will also encounter people who sound like a great leader and stream their game in twitch lastly what you will always see in this game is harvest moon legend who farms potatoes for the entire game

singlehandedly the best game ever made while simultaneously being the most awful horrible frustrating sorry excuse for a timewaster that i have ever been exposed to in my entire life did i mention this game helps you to find your inner racist theres a reason why i havent stopped playing this genre for 10 years its worth it
recommended
fun addictive game recommended
recommended
if riding around on a big hairy creature bashing people with a hammer is your thing dota 2 has you covered sort of dota 2 offers a huge array of characters that enable players to take roles that are in their wheelhouse whether you like sneaking and ganking smashing through the frontlines or sitting back and supporting your team from a distance there are characters that do all that and more what immediately strikes me about dota to coin a hideously overused clich is that its easy to learn but difficult to master while the game is generally forgiving the players are much less so as with all multiplayer games the experience of playing with others can be a bit of a mixed bag the most important thing to remember about dota 2 is this its not about winning its about losing stylishly to progressively more backbreaking marrowsucking odds

this game will consume countless hours of your life that you will never get back if you are a beginner you will experience phases of depression and lowered self esteem due to the fact that you are unable to be good at the game play long enough and those phases will turn into fits of rage directed at those new players who were just like you when you first started often times after a bad game you will question why you even bother to spend time playing this game however every once in a while you will get one of those games those games where everything seems to work in your favor and you completely outplay your opponent or those games where it was so close that victory fringed on one crucial teamfight one kill or a few bars of hp its those games that get your blood pumping and its those games that give you an experience no other game can give you the hope to find the next one of those games is what drives you to continue playing no matter what in end dota is a game that you play in order to find those fleeting moments where you can truly appreciate the game for what it is

hmmm dota is extremely addictive however this is because its a good game the community can be very harsh and rude towards beginners  so just ignore them  overall i give the game a 910 rating for gameplay  would be 1010 but the community is a bit too harsh on newbies 
recommended
dota 2 is undoubtedly the best mobo game ive ever playedits far better than dota 1 where the graphics is creepy
recommended
this game will devour your soul 1010
recommended
i swear on me mum m8 gtfo before you turn into one of us literally the most addicting game ever created
recommended
far more than you expect this game seems to have a life and culture all its own challenging and fair dota2 delivers in spades
recommended
this game is extremely difficult to play i am terrible at it i spent more time watching than playing i amassed a large amount of in game items i did not know what to do with these items since they were digital and did not exist in the reality i was born in therefore i decided to sell them all and make a profit off of people weird enough to collect things that do not exist in reality i made a good amount and bought a few games during a sale i got free games for being bad at a game
recommended
fun and entertaining
recommended
horrible unbalanced more annoying than fun sometimes but at the end of the day and after so many hours it feels like family when you play with friends so 1010 would download again
recommended
this game has taken over my life
recommended
escape the clutches of dota 2 while you can it will snare your soul and drain it until all you can think about it god damnit that feckn noob riki i can beat a nob hero like that anyday turst me while all your friends slowly slip away from existence until the only friends you have are the friends who play dota and you just use them to reduce the amount of skrubs you get matched with escape with your social life clutched in your arms as fast as you can of course i highly recommend it

amazing game heavily focused on cooperation and communication pros not p2w this game heavily benefits experience over money as spending money on the game will only give cosmetics and no advantage in matches what so ever great community mostly the dota 2 community is hell upon earth as language barriers are all over the place even tho this is a problem the community in and of itself is amazing having alot of contributions daily and providing help for problems of all kinds if you have the right frame of mind the community will always give you a hand outstanding gameplay in general after many hours of gameplay ive come to realize that dota 2 has one of the best character pools in mobas and overall multiplayer games from heros with strengths as the game goes on to heros wich destroy in the earlygame character variaty is there 100% free ive already made a statement on p2w being nonexistant but i have to restate that dota 2 is true to its f2p standards every single hero character is free from the getgo if you dont want to spend 1 cent on the game you can cons servers even tho the server variaty is great there is problems with the servers itself as server breakdowns make the game somewhat unfair as better ping with the right set of skills will mean a big difference between a win and a lose more with heros wich require apropiate timing or an apropiate combostrom spirit for example language barriers as the game many times missjudges the ping of a player it might send players wich speak a specific language into a server wich has mostly players that speak another me being from southamerica and speaking english go mostly to us servers as theres better ping but as i do many other southamerican players go there too and language barriers start appering as an example the typical peruvian wich plays misserably and ruins matches for us players overall amazing i recommend to anyone whos willing to spend large ammounts of time on a game and to all the moba lovers even tho its the hardest by far id give a 9010 great job valve

i love dota 1 but when dota 2 came it was a blow the iteming method is over simplefied and a game can be ended in just 2030 minutes its awesome
recommended
pretty much a boring version of league of legends why league of legends is better than this game 1 league fo legends is f2p dota 2 costs $30 2 league of legends has a broader selection of playable characters 3 league of legends has a nicer ui 4 league of legends has a slightly smaller map for more intense and skilled battles 5 league of legends is more popular on twitchtv and has more mlg pro gaming tournaments and such 6 no russians in league of legends 7 dota features a pay2win system in which you can buy exclusive items for each character such as armor and weapons 8 dota only has one map while league of legends has several maps and game modes which you can play to your liking 9 biggest problem with dota no ranking system you cant see improvement through ladders and such horrendous stats page absolutely no ranking system other than levels which is also pay2win with xp boosts avaliable on the market 10 very gimmicky crates dropped at the end of each game trying to sucker you into spending more money on keys 11 extremely boring map its all dark and depressing makes me want to fall asleep 12 very low player population highest played game on steam but not even 13rd of league of legends population due to the fact that this game isnt free to play and supports a pay2win model 13 this game suffers from a lack of updates it seems to be just a cash cow for valve 14 matchmaking takes ridiculously long its actually suprising that the 1 game on steam suffers from matchmaking this awful really shows how rarely this game is updated 15 players can draw on the map disrupting each others experience and mic usage is also allowed which always brings griefers who like to spam the mic and ruin the game for everyone 16 you can teamkill your own creeps in this game ruining the game for your team and your enemy 17 there is no meta anyone does anything this causes a very chaotic enviorment which is very daunting a new player just trying to learn the ropes 18 this game is not free to play 19 this game uses a pay2win system with gimmicks involved like keys trying to get you to spend money 20 the community is actually terrible with plenty of hackers and griefers ruining the game for everyone involved play this game at your own risk
recommended
this game is so cooooooooool
recommended
fantastic tower defense game however you need to be quite experienced to play  many heros and strategies to use and if you dont know how to use them your team will lose horribly  if your looking for a new game to get into i recommend dota 2 defense of the ancients 2
recommended
i only played a bit but i like it
recommended
ive wasted my life on this game and i suggest you do it too
recommended
i have spent much timeeffort and even money on this game what do i have to show for it still terrible at a large number of heroes and have a less than positive outlook on some of the people in the community 1010 game would play again
recommended
its an average game
recommended
a great timekiller longplay 5v5 which requires good teamwork to be effective it can bring people together highly addictive and fun to play though the only cons i see are these gametime may affect your schedule drastically so think twice before starting a match also though addictive never obsess over mmr dont let the game control you either
recommended
this game is very addictive and so fun to play

dota 2 is a moba and is the standalone sequel to defense of the ancients mod for warcraft iii this game is pretty funny to play with friends and its a f2p not p2w which is awesome the game comes with a really well done competitive system with a nice elo system the prizes on the tournaments are quite high and since its a f2p not p2w you can improve to the level where you go to tournaments the community is not the best but its totally not the worst russians yes russians thats a main thing in this game even if you play in the europe serveramerican server apperently even with their own server they tend to come to other servers and most of them are kinda as[s]holes sometimes it can be a frustating game and a real pain in the as[s] rating 7510 tldr version  f2p  not p2w  funny to play with your friends  nice competitive feeling  good elo system  high prizes in tournaments  russians everywhere they tend to be as[s]holes and not speaking in english  frustating game when youre in a lose streak  not that funny to play alone imo sorry for bad englandino plez dont copi ravioli pastarino
recommended
meh  i dont like this kind of games  but its fun 
recommended
the game is intense interesting and diverse requires a lot of thinking fast reactions and knowledge of mechanics just to begin with tough to learn for a lot of people but there are a lot of guides implemented in the game and on other places online graphics are really good the sound and visual effects are superb and the legacy this game carries from dota 1 or even prrevious names of this map is still there

im very love this gamebut sukanahuivrotebal

best game i have played

once upon a time in a distant land people were happy they lived content lives chatting sharing and feasting together this time would be know to you everyone of you who have played this game as the past now chatting is seen as dysfunctional and disruptive chatting causes you to lose and that must be purged now sharing is considered the must do for even the most supportive person but that person will be exploited and as in modern politics one mans pocket shall become barren and the other flooded with wealth now feasting is not considered a sinful pass time but an even more sinfull chain of events doing these will result in banishment from the perfect land of dota and into a negative land known only as low priority while many see this as the seventh level of hell a positive person will see it as 5 40 minute breaks from the brutal assualt of hate from the common dota peasent this land of dota long known to those who have played the game of ancients is overrun with the xenophobic the angry and hateful i can honestly say that this was well worth my time and you should spend what is left of your rotten soul for this game for it is glory and glory comes with a price
recommended
this is awesome game to play with friends
recommended
after playing over 1000 hours of this game i would love to say that valve have done an amazing job working with icefrog to create a game that although objectively the same each time is engaging and extremely dynamic every time screams of joy and frustration will be heard when you play this game maybe you will develop an unrelented hatred for the russian people or simply call mid or feed all i can say is i am glad i took the time to get past dotas steep learning curve for it has been a rewarding experience that i am looking forward to continue for many months to come

dota 2 is one of the most enjoyable games at the moment its definitely a mustplay
recommended
i love the game of dota 2 is using proven strategies and a good team cohesiveness and there pitted 2 teams each containing 5 players which both have major headquarters called the ancient and the first team to successfully destroy the ancient opponent is the winner there are 3 roads or paths called lanes which connects both the ancient and forces creeps that spawn or appear regularly in these pathways fight with creeps round opponent in the battle towards the opponents headquarters and id like again there are a lot of options at the beginning of the game due to the chosen heroes each hero has 4 skills and a few more active or passive so it is not too complicated to play i love dota <3

dota 2 what can i say well first of all i can say that it is an unbalanced grind through a small level where big pink men fight the antichrist or something like that i can also say that it is  and shouldnt even be considered for a download remember kids you cant spell dota 2 without c a n c e r 110 would rather stick  in a blender whilst wearing the oculus rift whilst playing planet horse

if you have played moba style games before then youll like this game it differs greatly from other moba style games because it delivers a wide variety of game modes and customizations furthermore every champion in the game is unique itemisation is diverse fun and you can have many different builds for just 1 champion a very nice feature to this moba game is the option to change the announcer tired of that old generic hag you can get the bastion voice over for example as many others moreover you can customize your hero skins and weapons you can buy different courier skins and many other things that other moba games dont support its a fun moba game overall and its worth trying out

so far i have played dota 2 for 1 day and id like to share my feelings about it unfortunately its lacking one of the most important aspects of a game which is being easy to pick up but tough to master this game doesnt cater to beginners if you have never played a moba then even the tutorial will be hard but i watched some guides on youtube and followed the instructions it helps to use the easier characters first like viper and lich its still fun but frustrating deep in the battle when you die and it takes about 2 minutes just to get back to where you were unless you spend gold but with all that aside i would recommend it to anyone who likes mobas and those who just wish to expand their horizens i look forward to improving and with a little practice i think it could be one of my favorite video games

best game ever made 20 over years and people still support this game dota
recommended
awesome game but requires skill p

the game is fun there is no doubt about that it is fun and frustrating at the same time you have to work as a team you and you alone arent going to decide the outcome of a match unfortunately it seems to have most of the same trappings as valves other f2p game team fortress 2 the items introduced into the game have little to no quality control thankfully we have yet to see items that affect the stats of the characters themselves dota 2 is one of the best mobas in the genre but far from the most popular dota 2 allows you to play all of the heroes that the game offers without spending antyhing but similar games only allow you to play a small rotation free hero pool you must then purchase the each hero individuall with ingame currency or real money dota 2 is far better in this sense dota 2 also seems to be a bit more highlevel than other games in the same genre this can be both good and bad as it allows for you to reach a higher skill ceiling but it can be discouraging to new players the community can be vile and the punishments for leaving a game are strict if you have connection problems or have other commitments that wont allow you to spend updwards of an hour at the computer i dont think that this is something you could enjoy since it is free id recommend you pick it up and give it a try i will update this review to be more indepth at a later time

took over my life 1010

while many action rts games tried to take its place the original dota mod was still played for a long time until this semiremake semiport it retains everything that made the original great with an improved engine and metasystem builtin matchmaking makes things balanced between players great workshop support for cosmetics and the best f2p system around make it an overall more enjoyable experience to the original however due to the port trying to be 11 with the original some features that couldve been changed remain the same there are a few concepts that while making sense over time are baffling to new players and its that complexity that is dotas greatest strength as well as its major weakness its very hard for new players to hop in and enjoy especially compared to other action rts games that find a better balance between depth and accessability to new players despite this after putting in time dota is one of the most rewarding and unique experiences in gaming one that has yet to be matched

awesome in a sense however there are quite a bit of trolls and rude people that think that you must build the heor the way they want besides that it is highly addictive and very fun
recommended
this game is truly amazing best suits for any age d
recommended
too addicting o_o
recommended
you will never get the hang of this or fully understand all the ins and outs of this esport it can be one of the most frustrating annoying soul crushing games but when it starts coming together and you have a good group that knows how to play together its amazing unless you have 400 hours to spend on this game i wouldnt bother because even with around 400 hours you will still be a fairly rank amateur
recommended
this is a very good game i have been playing it for 9 months now and still throughly enjoy it this is a very good game to build up teamworkif your partners are not idiots

recommended
ruined my life gg
recommended
best moba there is  also the oldest one
recommended
i love it nuff said its just difficult starting out and if you ignore the trolls and tryhards its really great ofcourse the game will never be balanced heroes are harder to play than others and some heroes are just plain op each game takes atleast 3045 min of your life sooo play at your own cost this game is extremely exciting and addicting once you finish the basics and want to step your game up the market items and stuff dont mean anything either its just tracking renaming and customizing your favorite heroes for minimum prices overall id play this game over many others i have in my library its definitely in my top three id recommend my fellow friends to play if they have the time i could probably write a book on this recommendation but the game is free so why not give it a shot you get free drops in game spend time with friends sell your dropped items on the market buy anything else you want etc its very entertaining to say the least and hopefully youll try it out for yourself and give it a chance

gg most game
recommended
the game is good tightens something it was too much like in every new game you have to download the knitted character and achieve new successes in pvp but it does not worsen the feeling of contentment game 
recommended
remove these damn challenges you can no longer have a normal game of dota anymore because people are concentrating so much on the challenges that it is ruining the game constant 5 man dota where skill elevl means nothing anymore it is just like the pa arcana event that ruined the game
recommended
one of the deepest most complex skillbased games to ever be produced in human history no other game will challenge your mental abilities quite like dota 2 every match is different every character is different every role is different the game is a neverending learning experience a mental challenge that is not for players that are either weakhearted or stubborn dota 2 will teach you lifelessons it will force you to learn through defeat and dissapointment to truly review your performance and see what you did wrong the game requires an unbelievable amount of cooperation between the teams and it truly is a beautiful thing to witness a plan come through as characters work in synchronization to pull off unbelievable gamechanging plays dota is unbelievably a 100% free game with free updates that feature new characters and gamechanging items all for free first timers might play it and view it as difficult and not a very friendly game and they are right in certain respects however the game quickly becomes addicting once a person catches the rythym and begins to succeed few things in life are as satisfying as destroying an entire team by yourself to crush the collective will of five people as easily as breathing dota 2 is a fantastic game and an emotional rollercoaster you will get frustrated you will flame and be flamed you will laugh you will rage but most of all you will feel awesome as you learn to dominate and terrorize the souls of the enemy team dota is a mustplay game that really needs people to give it a couple of shots before they figure out whether they love it or not
recommended
this game many times ive told myself to stop playing to resist the constant urge to pwn scrubs in public matchmakingbut as singsong would say nein dota is life and well ggwp thanks dota 6 month anniversary still flaming  1010 also ruins social lives soooo i recently hit 2000 hours in game  must say im kinda proud and dissapointed with myself at the same time reasoning for adissapointed in myslef for letting myself get preoccupied with this game instead of doing more important things  and b i am proud because of the fact i actually stuck with the terrible community that dota 2 is essentially full of raging 12 year old kids and extremely ignorant 6k mmr players but thus i am indeed still here and somehow continuing to add more hours on to this game day to day i have one more comment about dota 2 and that is that people seem to rate down this game and say ive wasted so much time  but although it may have been wasted time  was it still fun why would you regret something you enjoy i dont know i love this game man id definitely reccomend
recommended
1010 ruined my life

recommended
so my friends dragged me into this game just over a year ago and i can now say its one of the the best things that has ever graced my computer screen the game is challenging has a beautiful environment allows one to choose from a multitude of unique and diverse heroes and most importantly fun the sense of teamwork that you receive is fantastic and the knowledge that your cooperation with your teammates is winning the game is very rewarding of course it isnt perfect but nothing is and to be completely honest the most amount of grief you will encounter is the ness of a certain few players but that does not detract from the huge amounts of fun and challenges that dota 2 offers i highly recommend this game to anyone
recommended
dota 2 is really awesome its very stratergic and i made alot of friends throught it some of us even skype  the thing i love about dota 2 is playing online with your friends  which is really fun and awesome

introduction dota 2 is a game where it contradicts life and death dota was based on world of warcraft as dota 2 is now based on itselfwith new looks compared to dota and a brand new map with much more and now even better a free to play game positive 1its graphics are amazing compared to dota and lol 2it has a wonderfull variety of heroes which could be built in unlimited possibilities 3you can either rage or laugh at the noobs who try to play dota 2 while feeding 4plenty of core items for heroes and lots of active items like radiance and abyssal blade negative 1the tutorial needs improvement because when i played the tutorialit felt just like playing world of warcraft 2need lots of experience with these games because lots of high ranked players raged at you for feeding the enemy team 3league of legends lol copied this game and many other players from lol say that dota 2 copied them when its actually lol who copied dota 2 conclusion this game is really addictive where funny and wtf moments meets your waysoverall dota2 deserves around of applause as lol should  off because they suck biography my life of dota 2 started as a young boy at the age of 11 who was looking through piles of games when i found something interestingi downloaded the game and started playiing ityears past as i played hours and hours as days past bywhen i was 23i got myfirst car and a girlfriendwhen my girlfriend was wondering why i never asked her on a date i just asked that i was busybut 1 day i got careless and didnt hear the door open as my girlfriend came in and asked what are you doingi thought she would break up with me but she only said what game is iti replied with that this game was called dota 2when she got home she immediatly downloaded dota 2 and started playing with mewe had so much fun until at the age of 34where we got married and had 2 children1 boy and 1 girl and still playing dota2well now you see how much fun dota 2 isi wont force you to play it but i will say thistry dota2 rather then other games because this game will give you eternal happiness the end

this game will consume countless hours of your life that you will never get back if you are a beginner you will experience phases of depression and lowered self esteem due to the fact that you are unable to be good at the game play long enough and those phases will turn into fits of rage directed at those new players who were just like you when you first started often times after a bad game you will question why you even bother to spend time playing this game however every once in a while you will get one of those games those games where everything seems to work in your favor and you completely outplay your opponent or those games where it was so close that victory fringed on one crucial teamfight one kill or a few bars of hp its those games that get your blood pumping and its those games that give you an experience no other game can give you the hope to find the next one of those games is what drives you to continue playing no matter what in end dota is a game that you play in order to find those fleeting moments where you can truly appreciate the game for what it is
recommended
nice game ever 
recommended
prefect game
recommended
play this good game
recommended
this is a terrible game that you will continue to play until you are nothing but a mere husk of man incapable of loving or feeling anything you will wake in the night sweating thinking of missed last hits you will cower in the corner broken by no wards or courier and you will break down crying at the four other carries on your team who will endlessly berate you in a mix of different languages until finally you give in and call gg i would absolutley reccomend this game
recommended
a great game with tons to do and you never get bored of it and unlike lol you dont have to grind for heros that you want to play or wait untill it becomes avaliable there are many events throughout the year such as diretide and the international to add even more stuff to an already great game i would recommend this to anyone who has the time to learn the basics because otherwise it will be very difficult to play without hurting your teams preformance which could result in the reports and low prio but other than that it is a great game
recommended
10 would blyat again

after playing dota 2 almost 800 hours i decided to give this game a bit of a review ok basically dota 2 is just defeating the enemy team your team consists of 5 mates and the enemy team consists of 5 mates of course you can abandon the game anytime you want to but 5 mates is the basic the map is divided into three different roads called lanes and your team spreads up and fills those lanes usually its 2 guys top lane one mid and two down you can also pick a character from a group called as junglers in dota 2 you pick a character there are over a 100 possible choices more to come during updates etc picking the right chatacter is the key to everything if you happen to get a dream team you are sure to win in case its a dream team it requires the players also to know how to play the game for example many people pick riki one of the most frustrating chars of the whole game and they dont know how to play him right during you develop your hero you gain money and experience points with money you buy different items it depends of your chars item build with experience points you gain levels by the time you reach lvl 11 early game with your op hero youve already won the game by the time you reach the max lvl 25 with a bad hero it basically aint helping your team much you make progress by destroying enemy towers there are 3 towers on each lane  2 extra towers protecting the main building ancient behind the third towers there are the barracks if you take out one lanes barracks down it makes your creeps do better on that lane if you take down every barrack in the enemy base it makes your creeps do 4x the original damage and it boosts their hp as well okay thats the main view of the game and now well get to read about being in a match with other people mostly in dota 2 theres a war going on all the time eu against russians russians against americans and americans against russians in almost every game youll get a chance to speak with a real russian mostly that person just writes any word wrong and makes you laugh at hisher grammar and it makes that person to become more angry in almost every game you also get the chance to be called as a  and you get to read the most known words in dota 2  report feed noob report w8 your mom those are one of the most known words in dota 2 after a couple of weeks playing dota 2 youll see what i meant pros awesome gaming the fun it has variety no match repeats itself very detailed and well made game cons everyone hates everyone extremely hard to learn it makes you frustrated it has an extremely high addiction risk thats basically dota 2 play its worth it edit after 1500 hours of playing dota 2 has changed somewhat much new elements have been put into game making people angry and happy some do enjoy these updates while some dont some heroes who were crappy back then have become overpowered and some heroes who earlier were op are now crappy and that makes people fizzy as ive kept on playing this game ive seen that its become somewhat dull and unlogical while you pick these heroes who are your favorites you keep on doing those same builds youve done for ages not making almost any variety at all though its still not a repetitive game it can sometimes make you feel like you arent that amazing and when youve honed this one very special and oplike build which works against every hero in one match then suddenly it just stops working even though your enemies pick the same heroes it earlier worked against the community has also changed a bit people dont do so much swearing anymore but that doesnt mean theyd shut up no not all nowadays its very popular to talk about your mistakes etc but even though this community is a bit flopped one its still nice during these hours after my original review ive noticed the beauty in it huge variety of people and different natures you can meet many new people there some are nice some arent but thats how its in real life as well you like some people whilst disliking others by now i should be thrusting this game on you but im not gonna do it i recommend you to try this game but it wouldnt be the end of the world even if you didnt try dota 2 if you decide to start playing this game remember not to die a scarless man riki isnt that popular anymore

paul delanda gives this game a 1010 rating
recommended
this game is free not even  you no runes no grind no  yes game is hard but dota 2 was built for both the casual and the hardcore player also you can watch other peoples games which has 10 times the quality of twitch but still sucks because it lacks the power of twitch chat kappa there are only three rules 1 do not die 2 song name is always darude sandstorm 3 there is no third rule download it

this game is too boring for me wont play it much

awesome game though matchmaking sucks sometimes

well  the months of summer are almost upon us  and so are the various summerish problems  heat  dust  ice creams melting too fast  you know the like  but the greatest of them all  are  what to do in the vacations   well  when i started playing dota 2  in the summer of 2012  it was precisely because  i didnt know what to do   if there are such gamers out there  who while away hours on the steam store  unable to decide which game should they buy  bored and distraught of having to go through the same old list of  games in their library  dota 2 might just be it also  its free what exactly  is dota 2  sounds funny right  i thought so too  well its a sequel to the award winning world of warcarft iii mod defence of the ancients  dota and since its a sequel  hence the 2 well  im not really the dota 2 type  i would spend most of my time fanboying over call of duty  battlefield bad company 2  i never really took myself as an online mmorpg type player  i always had this prejudice   wha mmorpg  what you kidding me   but that was only till dota 2 came along getting started in dota 2  is really difficult i shall not mince my words here the learning curve  is very steep however if you are able to get past the learning stage  i guarantee you  all the abuses you endure and the noob  calling will be every bit worth of it dota 2  is essentially a free game  and its completely free  meaning purchasing power does not influence your ability to win the game  hence its purely based on skill  its not possible to spend money on xxtra super human upgrade packs or anything like that  to stomp everyone in your way  unlike league of legends tsk tsk  hence  the game is fare in everyway possible  there are ingame cosmetic upgrade purchases  which you can buy if you like  or if you are patient enough  you will get ingame drops mode of game play  its an online battle arena mmo  so you have two teams  five  a side  there are various game modes you can play  the most common being allpick where you are allowed to pick from the entire pool of heroes  the characters which you control in the game each hero  not being remotely similar to the other each one is completely different and some hereos get along well with others in terms of abilities and stuff  so  its for you  to find out these hidden combinations  which makes dota so intricate  there is strategy  involved at every step the game is indeed complex  and i dont know a single person willing to forego the evil satisfaction of having mastered something complex the game  is definitely a must  for everyone to have played atleast once in their lifetime in a nutshell  pros   good graphics  great sound  smooth gameplay mechanism  fair system  addicting  exciting  thrilling  awesome and so on cons  the community is a bit immature right now  but well dota 2 is young  steep learning curve  but the first place where learning is totally fun  cravings to buy ingame cosmetic items  cravings to download it again  everytime you delete it due to addiction  well  thats all folks

some words about dota 2 it`s a game which can take a lot of your free time and usually you won`t be worried that you played 13 hours in 2 day you have to try this you`ll sure be entertained whoever you are even if you`re troll c dota 2 is new begining of moba games you can play it for free and if you`ll go to professional scene you`ll even earn some money just in case worldwides tournament the international has more than 1000000$ as prize fund each year can`t say if it is going to be 4th international but i hope so
recommended
great game 1010 recommend to all
recommended
while ive only played about 20 hours of this game i can say that this game is quite enjoyable even if the community is subpar if you enjoy rts games then you will most likely highly enjoy dota 2 hell even if you just play mmorpgs like wow youll probably still like it
recommended
this is a great game with hours of fun if you like the first person shooter genre but unfortunantly there is no multiplayer and that can make the game boring after a while but its fun every time i pop it into my psvita
recommended
dont play because youll feed
recommended
great game you can play with your own on solo ranked matchmaking or have friends and have fun great way to kill time and lose your future but if you put your heart into it you might win 5 million $ great way to lose your girlfriend but im not losing mine game is 10010 this game lets you learn how to speak russian peruvian and more if you are interested in learning new languages try this game

alright listen up instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians im going to tell you how dota 2 really is at its core in a nutshell dota 2 is a great game but a terrible experience at the same time you want to keep going back to it but you also hate to go back why one word community dota 2s community is for the most part rude and hateful and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting moba its unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away at the best of times often its much worse and i would prefer not to go into the details sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you havent actually done anything wrong occasionally though you come across friendly players and when that happens the game is a pure joy to play however since the game is 5v5 coming across four nice players at the same time if youre solo queueing is a rarity why then have i played the game for over 1300 hours the sensation of winning your determination to keep playing despite of the discouraging community is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning that sweet moment when you see the enemy ancient blow up and look back on the match remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying but even a victory can come with a grain of salt many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning there is a mute option but that doesnt stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat people can intentionally feed the enemy team ignore their own team teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player its really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time going ranked doesnt really solve the problem either at least not completely ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill it feels much more professional and tryhardish although you meet nice players more often nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell having played some matches in ranked i can say the mode isnt hate free i had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode another problem with ranked is that like i said its more tryhard many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such but dont get me wrong dota 2 is a great game in itself the core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well no technical issues to speak of not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so of which i have had none myself graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them all the various spells and abilites look great the game is very deep and complex with tons of items skill and item builds and strategies to learn it can be a bit terrifying to beginners but once you get the hang of things its engaging all the playable heroes are well balanced although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being op and free to play from the start thats another thing the game does right all the heroes are free and playable from the start unlike dota 2s undeniably very successful competitor league of legends dota 2s microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff which means there are zero pay to win elements in the game it really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game to put it roughly in perspective its like playing skyrim but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make calling you a fooping idiot every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective failed to kill alduin uninstall skyrim noob dont know how to make dragonbone armor learn to play tard its like that having played the game as long as i have i would say that you are better off not playing dota 2 the game is fun when youre winning because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine which is 50% of the time sometimes not even when youre winning it isnt the losses that make the game unpleasant its the unfriendly people if youre one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you you have a better chance of not finding dota 2 so terrible but realistically why should you even have to videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you cant have fun half of the time the game isnt worth it people will tell you that dota 2 is great but that greatness comes with a price do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view this review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what its really like not just the great things if you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis then youre golden the game is at its best when you play with friends and dont have to worry about getting a stick in the mud player on your team great game with a bad community

great game i have bnow logged over 100 hours on advice for anyone ontemplating downlaod get out of limited heroes asap ul be better for it just listen to ur team and look up hoteys online and youl be fine also stay away from zeus
recommended
for the most part yes i do recommend this game and for the record yes this game is addicting despite its extremely annoying penalty rounds due to abandoning games and a community that sometimes consists mostly of multicultural and and multilingual players or trolls dota is a moba that succeeds in keeping players playing  not because of its given motivation to acheive high priority when one is in the lower level but because of its unique atmosphere and game world and characters that never cease to allure dotagoers in their many plethoras of styles and abilities the large and very diverse pool of heroes as players and professionals alike call it never fails to encourage players to change up their tactics and strategies for the matches they participate in all in all this game like the underground hit it was and is is a keeper obviously without a doubt
recommended
definitely worth the time to learn the game they dont say good things come easy bigger reward means bigger pay off

omfg this game guys this game is one of the most addicting games ever over 100 heros to play with above 70 items to buy and play with friend this isnt like those boring slow pace strat games it much better then that it feels like a more combat game while having the elements of ambush patience and knowing when to strike the enemy but its a bit hard for cons to know what to buy what to do and what not to do 910 great game
recommended
dota 2 <3 in my opinion the best moba game needs a bit more practice and more micromanagement items and sometimes npcs then in league of legends but it comes with more fun and more rewards d 1010  mobagame

if you havent played dota 2 you havent lived a good life

have been playing this game since quite a while now found myself coming back to it each day even if i did have better things to do i preferred playing a match of dota 2 this game has everything that you can expect from a good moba game every game is a completely different experience you are snowballing and pub stomping in one game and other game you lose throne in 20 mins matches are highly unpredictible specially with the new updates that have made comeback real winning a losing match is the ultimate satisfaction also many people dont understand this but there is actually no right or wrong way to play a hero some ways make the hero stronger and some dont it all comes down to personal preference and the scenario or kinds of enemies youre facing having said that yes the game has a very steep learning curve takes a couple of hours to play a single hero properly and there are 110 heroes at the time of writing this review each with their own unique set of skills and item builds there are 129 unique items in the game about 70 of these are built by combining the rest of the items it does take a while to understand and learn what each item do and if its worth building it on a particular hero or not say the hero antimage has a innate ability to blink on the battlefield so crafting a blink dagger on him is a bit useless and waste of gold some items can further strengthen the strengthsabilities of heroes while some others can overcome their weaknesses it will take a while to understand what items will be good on a hero and what will be bad now the worst part of dota 2 > the major player basecommunity almost every single person playing this game thinks of himselfherself as the biggest and the ultimate champion of dota 2 its like as if they were born with the innate ability to pwn on the dota 2 battlefield and learned everything about this game in their mothers womb if you are new get ready to be yelled at being called noob a lot being called different names being abused a lot in languages you didnt know existed before dota 2 and last but not the least hearing nasty things about your mom and no this is not an exhaggeration actually it can get worse depending upon how badly you do in a game if you are stomping however you will be getting a ton of friend requests and party requests sure some people are just dumb and had all the flame coming as they just dont learn even after putting in thousands of hours in game but new players should be taught how to do it properly instead of being told to uninstall the game the overall player base is much better on higher mmr matchmaking rate range but reaching there is a climb through a spikyrocky cliff and takes quite a bit of effort and patience finishing off with some tips for newpotential dota 2 players if they are reading this review 1 dont go in with zero knowledge of game go watch some youtube videos first to understand the basics most videos by purge are pretty helpful 2 take the game seriously if you are not serious about winning please dont play dota 2 is a serious competitive game and you shouldnt spoil it for others 3 know your limits and dont try complex micro andor heavy farm dependent heroes like chen meepo in normal matchmaking at least not untill you have practiced enough with your farmingmicro skills and are confident about it 4 try supporting heroes and buy courierwards this will make the team appreciate you if however you cant ward properly get ready to be flamed 5 last but not the least try to have some fun and try communicating with your team if they understandspeak your language overall a pretty solid moba game though i dont like a few mechanics i dont even care i have so much fun that i overlook all the bad things and thats the sign of a great game the game is contantly evolving and changing though with new heroes getting released now and then and gameplay patches that completely change the way some heroes play and thanks to valves ultimate money guzzler mind the events and constant flow in of cosmetics can keep you hooked in this game can never get boring just gather some friends and start playing now if you havent done yet thats all folks game on

recommended
great moba there are a few learning curves to dota 2 make sure to practice with bots and watch tutorials and the differnt playable characters also its free
recommended
dota 2 in a very strategic challenging game i know a lot of people start playing dota and get discouraged because of how brutal it is when you get started dont give up dont be afraid to ask players for help and watch videos watch tons of videos read guides and builds and experiment with every hero in bot matches go to the library ingame and read up on every hero and item dont skip the tutorials they may seem boring or dry at first but they really really useful this game can be extremely fun and so fulfilling when you play it there will be games that your team gets stomped with a 7416 gamedont worry about it there will be other games where the entire game is tied and both team have the same amount of towers down and neither team can get ahead and it reaches over an hour when it does finally end whether you won or lost it wont matter because both teams realize it could have went either way and that is was a truly amazing game it is moments like that when you are congratulating the other team on a good game not just because it is expected of you but because it really was a great game this is why you need to stick it out in the beginning and keep on trying more than likely you will start out with a 2174 score but thats ok because in no time you will have that game the game where your team worked together amazing and your hero was a perfect counter to their entire team and youll get that 44612 game as far as the gameplay is valve is very good about fixing the bugs most bugs are only on for a few days before a fix has come out the game is very stable the only problems i could have with dota 2 are with the servers there have been server issues and sometimes it causes you to have an abandon which wasnt fair but non reversible also there are issues if setting your language preference to english and you get paired with players who dont know any english this can get frustrating all in all dota 2 is well worth the hours put into it and the best part is it is completely free to play you dont have to pay a dime for any content whatsoever the only thing that costs money is to customize your experience while playing including cosmetics huds loading screens etc

some of my friends come up to me and say whats dota sarcastically  i respond with what dota is to me  dota is the gameof my life it helps me get through the struggles of the real world lately my uncle passed awayand therewas a bigger holein my life but this wunderfull game brought me back up i just whant tosay to the makers thank you so much for bringing this game into the steam world and letting it bring me up in the real one

this game really brings out your own imagination on how you think and react and what you want to do limitless possibilities is one of the few things games have these days especially online gaming i never was a big dota fan but after i got to play around a bit after being pushed in to it with friends i found out that it truly is something that attracts the mind it is like a dopamine is released into the brain and you want to come back for more the game and detail along with it being a freetoplay game really takes my fancy i would recommend this game to any person who likes a challenge someone who likes to explore his imagination and to be competitive to rise and see how good you can get at something valve really outdone themselves on this one good job guys

this is a terrible game that you will continue to play until you are nothing but a mere husk of man incapable of loving or feeling anything you will wake in the night sweating thinking of missed last hits you will cower in the corner broken by no wards or courier and you will break down crying at the four other carries on your team who will endlessly berate you in a mix of different languages until finally you give in and call gg i would absolutley reccomend this game
recommended
10 would blyat again
recommended
a great game with tons to do and you never get bored of it and unlike lol you dont have to grind for heros that you want to play or wait untill it becomes avaliable there are many events throughout the year such as diretide and the international to add even more stuff to an already great game i would recommend this to anyone who has the time to learn the basics because otherwise it will be very difficult to play without hurting your teams preformance which could result in the reports and low prio but other than that it is a great game
recommended
technically not free to play since it costs you your soul

recommended
i love this game

everyone of us wanted to be a warrior a gladiator or a samurai from when we were little sadly we were born in the wrong age but there is a way to live up to our childhood dreams a way that we can live the intensity on the battlefield a way with which can bring glory to our clans and doom upon our enemies a way in which we can hear millions cheering for us maximus maximus maximus brothers and sisters let show you that path the path that dredges through blood and tears and finally leads us to the valkyria defense of the ancients 2

when i played dota wc3 mod for the first time i died as windrunner and moved on to hero line wars now that value has made dota 2 i tried it again the f2p model is very fair almost too fair which lets in undesirables the graphics are clean and crisp the gameplay is what you expect from an rts lots of clicking and moving your unit around or for you plebs out there lack there of there is a rating system that and that really is the worst i have close to dial up internet and lag all game my rating sucks because of this and the reason i am writing this is because i am waiting for a 100mb download aka 2 hours all that said icefairy has made heroine in video game form and its free dancezzzz doesnt work

even though it might be hard to learn at the beginning it will be great after you learned the basics this game changes over time the meta changes and there is no way to master everything if you like mobas it is a great game for you

some words about dota 2 it`s a game which can take a lot of your free time and usually you won`t be worried that you played 13 hours in 2 day you have to try this you`ll sure be entertained whoever you are even if you`re troll c dota 2 is new begining of moba games you can play it for free and if you`ll go to professional scene you`ll even earn some money just in case worldwides tournament the international has more than 1000000$ as prize fund each year can`t say if it is going to be 4th international but i hope so

no words of explanation needed just play it and youll know rating 9810
recommended
fantastic moba my favourite and perfect f2p model you have full access to the game the cash shop is only for cosmetic items it has frequent meaningful updates and its the most balanced moba ive played not to mention the graphics are good and its engine is very tweakable meaning youre going to be able to play the game on older systems it runs on linux too
recommended
defense of the ancients 2 is a fascinating game building upon the success of the moba genre dota 2 brings hardcore pvp strategy and tactical team based execution of ideas to fruition the game itself is amazingly beautiful and simple in initial appearance  most hero units have 46 key skills however it is a combination of the vast number of heros with their unique abilities and counters in combination with a huge array of items which produce additional effects that makes the tactical possibilities in dota 2 simply mind numbing from soloing a creep lane for gold and xp to ganking other players with an orchestrated team effort this game delievers the goods the only negative i can think of is the player community itself which can be quite harsh to those still learning the finer points of the game that point aside it can be a thrilling and rewarding experience especially when shared playing with friends and overcoming skilled opponents 910
recommended
in the starting when i saw this game for the first time i thought it will be boring and at that time it was not that popular like lol but when i saw some of my friend had this game like 500 game hour recorded then i thought there should be something special in this game so without wasting my time i installed this game on steam and when i played the first match then i dont know what happened to me i got so addictive in this game that now i nearly have 210 game hour recorded about 120 matches played i liked this heroesthe abilities i like to watch the international tournament each year live all those teams fighting to become worlds best dota 2 team i seriously recommend this game to all the guys who are reading this review there are alot of events each year people enjoy more playing it more hero sets more heroes added in the major updates that makes dota 2 a game for all time

hmmm dota 2 after more than 400 hours i can say that thit is a really good game it is logical that i have pro and contra it is a 5star game as a freetoplay but there are some futures that make this game aintrestingabilityes of heroes are changing radically for example bloodseeker i played totally of 9596 games whit bloodseeker of my 384 matchesso i think that i know what he knowsbut whit the new futuresit is a bad hero   and i diont say this because i dont like to play whit harder heroes another good experience is that there are some new heroes and this is very good another thing is that we can upgrade our heroes ig game how we want so i played 400 hours but its still a pleasure to play and i think that i dont played enough so in conclusion its a really nice game but i want to ask you to dont make the game worse whit futures in the end thank you dota 2 and thank you steam

it was hard at the start but then i turned to be good at playing enigma the i learned how to trap everyone into my   and then i learned to    the i started     rubick and  then i

dota 2 is a fun strategy game that some may find hard or boring out of other mobas dota delivers but only after youve learned the game for new players the tutorial doesnt teach much and may actually confuse you if you have friends that also play it will make game more fun as there a many different game styles

i remember when i first played this game and i thought wow i really dont like this game and then i went back to league legends and was like wow i really dont like this game and then i went back to boba the 5th and was like wow i really like this game and so now i play this and league legoon is obsolete to this wonderful mastapiece of sweg

well  the months of summer are almost upon us  and so are the various summerish problems  heat  dust  ice creams melting too fast  you know the like  but the greatest of them all  are  what to do in the vacations   well  when i started playing dota 2  in the summer of 2012  it was precisely because  i didnt know what to do   if there are such gamers out there  who while away hours on the steam store  unable to decide which game should they buy  bored and distraught of having to go through the same old list of  games in their library  dota 2 might just be it also  its free what exactly  is dota 2  sounds funny right  i thought so too  well its a sequel to the award winning world of warcarft iii mod defence of the ancients  dota and since its a sequel  hence the 2 well  im not really the dota 2 type  i would spend most of my time fanboying over call of duty  battlefield bad company 2  i never really took myself as an online mmorpg type player  i always had this prejudice   wha mmorpg  what you kidding me   but that was only till dota 2 came along getting started in dota 2  is really difficult i shall not mince my words here the learning curve  is very steep however if you are able to get past the learning stage  i guarantee you  all the abuses you endure and the noob  calling will be every bit worth of it dota 2  is essentially a free game  and its completely free  meaning purchasing power does not influence your ability to win the game  hence its purely based on skill  its not possible to spend money on xxtra super human upgrade packs or anything like that  to stomp everyone in your way  unlike league of legends tsk tsk  hence  the game is fare in everyway possible  there are ingame cosmetic upgrade purchases  which you can buy if you like  or if you are patient enough  you will get ingame drops mode of game play  its an online battle arena mmo  so you have two teams  five  a side  there are various game modes you can play  the most common being allpick where you are allowed to pick from the entire pool of heroes  the characters which you control in the game each hero  not being remotely similar to the other each one is completely different and some hereos get along well with others in terms of abilities and stuff  so  its for you  to find out these hidden combinations  which makes dota so intricate  there is strategy  involved at every step the game is indeed complex  and i dont know a single person willing to forego the evil satisfaction of having mastered something complex the game  is definitely a must  for everyone to have played atleast once in their lifetime in a nutshell  pros   good graphics  great sound  smooth gameplay mechanism  fair system  addicting  exciting  thrilling  awesome and so on cons  the community is a bit immature right now  but well dota 2 is young  steep learning curve  but the first place where learning is totally fun  cravings to buy ingame cosmetic items  cravings to download it again  everytime you delete it due to addiction  well  thats all folks

after playing dota 2 almost 800 hours i decided to give this game a bit of a review ok basically dota 2 is just defeating the enemy team your team consists of 5 mates and the enemy team consists of 5 mates of course you can abandon the game anytime you want to but 5 mates is the basic the map is divided into three different roads called lanes and your team spreads up and fills those lanes usually its 2 guys top lane one mid and two down you can also pick a character from a group called as junglers in dota 2 you pick a character there are over a 100 possible choices more to come during updates etc picking the right chatacter is the key to everything if you happen to get a dream team you are sure to win in case its a dream team it requires the players also to know how to play the game for example many people pick riki one of the most frustrating chars of the whole game and they dont know how to play him right during you develop your hero you gain money and experience points with money you buy different items it depends of your chars item build with experience points you gain levels by the time you reach lvl 11 early game with your op hero youve already won the game by the time you reach the max lvl 25 with a bad hero it basically aint helping your team much you make progress by destroying enemy towers there are 3 towers on each lane  2 extra towers protecting the main building ancient behind the third towers there are the barracks if you take out one lanes barracks down it makes your creeps do better on that lane if you take down every barrack in the enemy base it makes your creeps do 4x the original damage and it boosts their hp as well okay thats the main view of the game and now well get to read about being in a match with other people mostly in dota 2 theres a war going on all the time eu against russians russians against americans and americans against russians in almost every game youll get a chance to speak with a real russian mostly that person just writes any word wrong and makes you laugh at hisher grammar and it makes that person to become more angry in almost every game you also get the chance to be called as a  and you get to read the most known words in dota 2  report feed noob report w8 your mom those are one of the most known words in dota 2 after a couple of weeks playing dota 2 youll see what i meant pros awesome gaming the fun it has variety no match repeats itself very detailed and well made game cons everyone hates everyone extremely hard to learn it makes you frustrated it has an extremely high addiction risk thats basically dota 2 play its worth it edit after 1500 hours of playing dota 2 has changed somewhat much new elements have been put into game making people angry and happy some do enjoy these updates while some dont some heroes who were crappy back then have become overpowered and some heroes who earlier were op are now crappy and that makes people fizzy as ive kept on playing this game ive seen that its become somewhat dull and unlogical while you pick these heroes who are your favorites you keep on doing those same builds youve done for ages not making almost any variety at all though its still not a repetitive game it can sometimes make you feel like you arent that amazing and when youve honed this one very special and oplike build which works against every hero in one match then suddenly it just stops working even though your enemies pick the same heroes it earlier worked against the community has also changed a bit people dont do so much swearing anymore but that doesnt mean theyd shut up no not all nowadays its very popular to talk about your mistakes etc but even though this community is a bit flopped one its still nice during these hours after my original review ive noticed the beauty in it huge variety of people and different natures you can meet many new people there some are nice some arent but thats how its in real life as well you like some people whilst disliking others by now i should be thrusting this game on you but im not gonna do it i recommend you to try this game but it wouldnt be the end of the world even if you didnt try dota 2 if you decide to start playing this game remember not to die a scarless man riki isnt that popular anymore
recommended
this game is free not even  you no runes no grind no  yes game is hard but dota 2 was built for both the casual and the hardcore player also you can watch other peoples games which has 10 times the quality of twitch but still sucks because it lacks the power of twitch chat kappa there are only three rules 1 do not die 2 song name is always darude sandstorm 3 there is no third rule download it

dota2 is a really good game that doesnt require experience since every player starts playing form level 1 the good thing in dota2 is that all the heroes are available to all players players can communicate with chat or mic and there are different game modes which make the game more challenging the bad thing about this game is well russian players they will not leave you in peace they will feed so much that africa wouldnt starve for decades and they will take over every single server i the world     and also i would like to          and play a little bit

i dont realy like supernatural games but when i played dota 2 i fell in love with this game instantly such great and detailed map and heroes so unreal yet still each one of them make sense and anyone can easily grasp what the game is about and can learn the game in just a couple of hours but one can hardly say that he knows everything about dota 2 because there are so many little details in the map or heroes that one needs to experience everybit of it ingame in order to understand them ive been playing the game for over 2 years now and im still learing its a game in developing process but still is known all around the world for being one of the best and most famous games ever and most importantly it is free i definitely recommend this game for every one just give it one shot and youll see what im talking about

dota 2 is one of those games that you end up having a love hate relationship with after 1000 hours of play i still thoroughly enjoy playing it on a daily basis however sometimes i find myself quitting after endless hours wasted playing terrible games there are many things that i can say about this game but i think its all been said a thousand times so instead im going to give any new players a tip play with friends this game can be complete  and ragequit worthy if you constantly play with randoms highly recommend this to anyone with s of spare time on their hands

review from a league of legends player playing since s1 if you play league of legends you might have difficult on buying items making combos  counter pick  etc but the gameplay is more different that league of legends starting with 1 creeps  towers neutural making more damage than league of legends 2adding more combos to the game with items than league of legends have and making it more fun d 3way different the items and stats you can upgrade your stats healthdmgarmormr etc 4all heroes are free so what are you waiting for join the battle
recommended
mood swings period symtoms screaming breakdown of relationships hatred raging  racism would definitely recommend
recommended
this game is a free to play moba which in my personal biased opinion is the best as it sets the standards for most modern mobas based off of dota a mod for warcraft3 a blizzard title which was the first moba dota 2 continues with its greatness and beautiful character design the map never changes but it does cycle through day and night continuing the game along you can choose 1 of many heros in the classic mode and play against others to defeat their towers and eventually the ancient this game will induce rage as you may be paired up with people who feed or play with some angry russians just remember its just a game shane simpson alphadragon

when you launch this game the first time youll be overwhelmed you have to play at least 100 hours to be able to tell if you even really like the game or not and the whole time youll be ragged on and put down by a harsh unforgiving community but if you pull through youll find yourself immersed in a rich complex contest of strategy and skill 1010 will consume your life

this game really brings out your own imagination on how you think and react and what you want to do limitless possibilities is one of the few things games have these days especially online gaming i never was a big dota fan but after i got to play around a bit after being pushed in to it with friends i found out that it truly is something that attracts the mind it is like a dopamine is released into the brain and you want to come back for more the game and detail along with it being a freetoplay game really takes my fancy i would recommend this game to any person who likes a challenge someone who likes to explore his imagination and to be competitive to rise and see how good you can get at something valve really outdone themselves on this one good job guys
recommended
i look to this game and i think how a game with only one map and one scenario can be s complex only dota can do this for you i will be an eternal noob on this and thats why i recommend this game

the best moba game ever i play
recommended
the best

dota 2 <3 in my opinion the best moba game needs a bit more practice and more micromanagement items and sometimes npcs then in league of legends but it comes with more fun and more rewards d 1010  mobagame

omfg this game guys this game is one of the most addicting games ever over 100 heros to play with above 70 items to buy and play with friend this isnt like those boring slow pace strat games it much better then that it feels like a more combat game while having the elements of ambush patience and knowing when to strike the enemy but its a bit hard for cons to know what to buy what to do and what not to do 910 great game

this game will slowly suck the joy and life out of you corroding your body and spirit so absolutely that all that remains is a husk with a vocabulary limited to the words noob and feeder 1010
recommended
if you can stomach the horrible toxic idiotic hateful team mates that you will get in 98% of your games then it can be fun try to play with people you know i just want to add that trying not to be offensive ive come across only one or two good russians they play on any servers they want clog chat with random characters are generally terrible at the game and cannot understand why people dont like them despite screaming  when ever the opportunity arises before playing this game i had no problems with russian people but most of the ones who play dota are not good people volvo pls region lock dota

the ulitmate sequal to the famous dota dota 2 offers awesome graphics with great game and teamplay if you have a lan going on or just 4 other friends which you want to play with this is perfect skill and timing helps alot not to hard to start learning but your 1st few matches will wont be easy if you dont do the tutorial great tutorial dota 2 is very teamplay depented so grab yourself a group or friends and start playing only negative part is that it has 1 map and 1 gametype except on special occasions like holloween but ofcourse it would be dota if it had more than 1 of each a must play 9510

a real great game but ruined by russians and mexicans playing on the us servers and not working as a team because they dont know a word you are saying and just end up feeding and ruining your matches
recommended
so much morphine 
recommended
one of the best game ive ever played its very difficult to understand the mechanics despite others mobas  but this is why you should try to do your best
recommended
this is the hardest game i have ever played
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played that simple
recommended
its a great competition game great characters cool graphics special details awesome effects and many more but the problem about this game is some of the communties are trolls and toxic players but dont let that stop you dota 2 may give a stricter gameplay but its best to keep it that way to avoid trolls with low prio to avoid low prio you need a good internet connection make sure you have lots of spare time and play properly there may be a war with lol dota 2 and smite with the fanbase but dont forget each mmobas has their own perspective of gaming
recommended
i love this game then i played a ranked game with 2 of the worst dota players ive ever seen who thought everyone else on our team was wrong and they were right and need to type this slowly because my hands are physically shaking from how angry and depressed i am 1010

rage inducing fun you can play the game and learn russian at the same time holy  this game is for me 55 meepos

dota 2 is a truly outstanding game in fact its so good as well as having fun yo can learn fluent russian and hate humans at the same time how wicked is that
recommended
i havent played much but i wonder when ill 100% it
recommended
nicely done by valve although there might be too many issues like lag poor video performance etc still a fun game to play except with the community there are tons of players out there who are very much not easy to be with and is always blaming on othes but there are players who are kind and knows what the game is really about better played with a friend rather than random players though still love it
recommended
2 rude for usual players everyone hates your mom calls you a nob and spamming you with hate and its only becuase youre playing as pudge i like customization for your heroes but most badass items cost insane amount of monehs still sick but we usual moba wich deserve a try
recommended
so dota 2 is such a self destructive game for players to play i mean first you think the cosmetic beefed up player might be pro then he proceeds to speak russian or swahilitalibaniackbari well i cannot say that it helps the team if only he speaks it and noone understands it or if team never wants to cooperate my solo mmr have been down to 2900 and from there i work my way upwards but damn team mmr is closer to over 3100 but when a support is killed before proper assists occurs i will not get enough xp or gold they only want to care for themselves its a free for all matchmaking train of thought even when one can boast with victories
recommended
dota 2 is a complex game with depth it requires a lot of quick thinking and knowledge to play correctly a skill that takes time to develop one of the best parts about dota is that it teaches you languages for free unlike programs like rosetta stone this game will force you to be paired with people who dont live near you whatsoever you will learn how to swear in multiple languges within the first month guaranteed oh and dont forget the crippling lag that only occurs during teamfights
recommended
rage inducing fun you can play the game and learn russian at the same time holy  this game is for me 55 meepos

dota is a competitive game of action and strategy played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes forming two teams of five players

i liked this game because it provides awareness and strategic instincts which will improve our rational thinking just like a typical sport this game requires a good teamwork and also a good individual skills
recommended
maybe someday even i become a mother ill miss to play dota
recommended
food give us dota 2 
recommended
divide and conquer dota began its way as simple mode and appeared as game the game is suitable for as for beginners as well for professionals inspite that gameplay is simple but everyone will be interested the main guarantee of victory is teamwork but sometimes you will play with too polite people so prepare yourself for any occasion in the conclusion i recommend this game for all kind of gamers

recommended
very nice game  enjoy

whatever

i started playing dota about a year and a half ago and i still love it to pieces one of the most addictive fun games i have ever played even although there is only one map there are so many heroes to playchoose from that you never get bored there are heroes for everybody my favourite is called lion and he is a support hero you jump in and at first you will have no idea what is going on but once you get used to it it becomes quite easy to pick up a hero you have never played with before and try himher out because you know what your doing there are easy heroes to play and hard ones meepo antimage etc i can see why this is one of the most popular games on steam help keep it that way get it you will never regret it 1010  jaffabaffa the man telling you to get it right now seriouslyget it

if you want to experince dota 2 you must throw a small chunk of gold into a cement mixxer full of toxic waste while listening to every insult possible in russian and in spanish
recommended
awesome but bad and laggy servers also its a community of flamers and ragers still i like the game 
recommended
dota 2 has to be one of the most annoying unlogical and stupid games of all time but i still love it and play it almost every day bear in mind that i have only about 1000hrs on this game so my opinions and views are based only on the short time i have spent playing it yes 1000hrs is not much game time at all and i have only two bits of advice for some who is starting dota 1 stick at it never give up never give in comebacks are possible from almost any situation and although you will probably suck at first only trying out the easiest of heroes  drowrikiviper ect soon you will become better soon you will graduate from noob school and become novice level like me this happens at about 750hrs 2 dont rush for the same hero every time even if you really like the hero dont do it picking every hero will teach you their abilities so you will know what each of them are capable of when you play with them or against them so try randoming for the extra gold too do this until you have won a game as every hero or have played a hero atleast twice good luck and may dendi be with you

very addictive game

recommended
really good game to play with friends 
recommended
this game has been an awesome part of my life but in the last 6 months a lot more russian players started playing on europe east and west server forgetting about their own server its been a pain in the as to deal with those guys because they chose the preference of language to be english and then they speak only russian its impossible to communicate with these guys they just keep on flaming and spamming and instead of helping in team fights they go on solo to make the team weaker and then die i dont know what they are doing with their life but still they play dota so from dota player to dota player we should get the hang of it in addition to that people should seriously take ranked matches seriously you dont pick captain to screw your team mates over and have a low mmr playing with low mmr people its not good for you or them but in the end you should play with what you have and concentrate on the game and nothing else you should communicate for a better game but i dont know about people all i know is that i try to be as cooperative with my team as possible i rate this game as 810 because of the raging people who only want what is good for themselves destroying their team bit by bit
recommended
a really good game but too much over price items at some point its quite hard for some heroes practice makes perfect but nobodys perfect so dont waste your time
recommended

please do not start with this game it will consume your soul and wallet sincerly me
recommended
dota 2 is an amazing game you get to learn how to deal with people in dankranked and scrubpubs it is a learning experience for all and when you like to go in on them they say you cant but you have to believe in yourself or you will fail so if you dont want to fail you must do what is right in the fight for your team and your big man joe supports that is a term for the best o the best and the worst of the best because when you are running down the hallway thehall monitor yells at you so dont run and dont have un because when you do you will fall down the well into the water below which is wet and the river is wet play slardar to win every other game and then try to beat the game the boss fight is super duper hard so you want to bring your best weapons like your sword and chicken and farming is the best because you can get more chicken and win the game which is what you really should be wanting to do another thing to consider in here is the batta batta swing mekansm because when you get a pipe you die of lung cancer a lot of times in teamfight you get dirty so dont forget to bring tide i would deb8 more but i am ready for the big man joe

the best game ever1

all you gotta do is right click
recommended
nice game d
recommended
what a game this game full of drama why  this game include teamwork egoism role game timing like a drama play this game so u can be a good director lol you have to play this game before you die
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played that simple
recommended
this game has an insanely high learning curve and is unforgiving to new players but if you have the patience to get through it itll all be worth it the game is the classic tri lane moba with a large roster of heroes and the list continues to grow this game also is completely f2p in the purest form no pay to win scamsperiod the entire game is free all the heroes even the cosmetics which other f2p games would charge for you can earn by just playing the game through end of match drops now granted you wont be getting anything good for your first 100 or so matches but once you get past like level 7 youre eligible for any level rarity drops including couriers now on to the gameplay one way this game sets itself apart from its competition is that it has a turning mechanism in other mobas when you click the other direction your hero immediately turns and moves there in dota 2 your hero will perform a full body turn which could take some time which in turn means you could die the game as i said earlier is unforgiving to new players what i mean by that is when you die you lose gold dying in mobas is bad enough giving enemy laner chance to free farm and gain xp but an extra barrier for yourself isnt a good thing for the one who died especially early laning another big thing no recall to base other mobas you can simply recall to base no matter where on the map not here you can carry tp scrolls allowing you to tp to any ally tower but those cost money and go on cooldown after use dont move while tp trust me and the last major thing that sets itself apart is the balance this game has every hero become op meaning if any hero was placed in lol or some other moba that hero would most likely become op in that game with every hero becoming op in dota 2 there is balance so your stuns last for like 5 seconds your nukes can kill in one hit a snowballer could mean level 25 while everyone else is still lvl 10 these things sound game breaking but somehow works very well all in all the game is great nothing to complain about other then unforgiving to mistakes but if you be patient and work your way through it youll find yourself not playing any other game much
recommended
this is the hardest game i have ever played
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
its like pounding your head against a brick wall but you just cant get enough
recommended
great fun if you find yourself playing this game make sure to take part in its economy
recommended
this is an extremely addicting game its had me hooked for about two years now download the game grab a few friends and find a match if i were to rate this game i would probably have to go 9610 although almost everything about this game is positive the community needs to change a little if youre new to steam i recommend this game to you and hope you enjoy it shadow
recommended
enter pub get stomped report team repeat jk best game of my life i truly wasted 3k hours on this  1010
recommended
best moba game of all time
recommended
dota 2 is a great game a bit hard for new moba players however its amazing when you get into it dont give up and keed defending
recommended
once entered never come out of it 1110 needs more of it
recommended
tough learning curve but a great game if you love learning new languages such as portugese and russian this is the game for you in all seriousness this isnt a casual game to pick up on little spare time this game is for somebody who is willing to be flamed and called many obscenities in russian portugese and tagalog for hundreds of hours before they become average at the game heck at the time im editing this i have about 17k hours and im only okay at the game this goes for many other players as well dota 2 is one of the most popular games on steam and is being constantly updated the replayability is insane there are 100 heroes characters you can play as and each average game is 5 vs 5 in a 40 minute match this gives a whole plethora of different possible outcomes dont even get me started on the custom game modes being introduced dota is not a game for the weak if youre willing to become an emotionless husk of a person this is the game for you
recommended
this is awesome
recommended
this game is highly addicting 
recommended
when i downloaded dota 2 about two months ago there were many games that i planned to play now there is only one i still buy new games because of my inherent rampant consumerism but i instantly regret the purchases when a week later i realize i only have 1 hours logged that is the power of dota
recommended
dota 2 is love dota 2 is life solid game
recommended
ok i think i am officially addicted to this game i love the great variety of gameplay options its also cool to learn to work together as a team with my friends this game has somewhat of a steep learning curve but its great fun to play and the metagame has a fair amount of depth it doesnt hurt at all that this game is free to play i wish all my friends played dota 2
recommended
game not worth buying
recommended
this game is amazing d
recommended
the best part of this game is if you cant talk russian youre not going to understand anyone 1110 would be called  again
recommended
i used to hate moba`s i played dota 2 for 2 hours i now love moba`s the only complaint i have is that there is no such thing as a quick game of dota i decided to play some dota at 2 in the afternoon when i finished it was 3 in the morning in the year 2097 now all of my family is dead and im trapped in the future help me score 610  a good game
recommended
this game is a lot of fun if youre new to this game i suggest starting off with passive bots then easy then medium and after you can win a couple hard bot games then i feel you can try out public matches against other human players bots and human players play completely differently however the reason to play bots at first is just to get comfortable with basic builds and to get confident with your heros ability set jumping into public games without any previous moba experience will likely result in angry team mates and losing games i would say this game requires a lot of practice before you really begin to understand any of the heroes this is why using the random function is quite useful in the humans vs bots modes until you are comfortable with many of the heroes the biggest downside i can think of to this game is even if you select english as your preferred language and choose us east and us west servers youll still encounter many team mates that can speak no english whatsoever when youre ready for public matches i suggest starting off with the limited heroes game mode so you dont get overwhelmed by all the heroes
recommended
worst game ever 4 ing idiots in your team every ing time 1010

great game nuh said

totally recommend it fun game if u play dota 1 frozen throne u will be like this is so much better and totally be addicted to this game d
recommended
if you feel like a team player and if you are competitive you like challenges then you are in the right place but beware of flamers and ragequitters they can be annoyingand of course the trolls i recommend this game only for players who like challenging moba gamesfor newbies i recommend league of legends edit the community is getting worseleaversfeederstrollsflamers everywhere

horrible game

this game is certainly one of the best ive ever play just make sure youre in high tier because the low trench tier is nightmare

what ive learned on dota  europe is united thanks to the same feels against russians  europe is united thanks to a miracle all curse each other  russia is not so far from eu west  russia is everywhere  americans north & south cant explain their high ping on eu servers but they continue to play into anyway  my family is made up of my slty cheap mother my missing father who have no name but infinite crimes my undead relatives who die hundred times per day  i will never play as carry or ill play 5carries team  i will always play as supporter or my team will curse me  all the matches are in the bag for skywrath mage  its a masterpiece of mobas but the community sucks what ive wanted to see in dota  a team made up of 2 supporters 12 carryies 12 initiatorsdisablers  another one supporter in my team  a match without pudge  a match with russians who can type english sentences  boots of speed the cheapest boots of the game in my inventory before the midtolategame phase  slippers of agility like an item for a recipe not like fake boots for a devoted supporter  enemy wards when im going to deward and to hope for extra gold  more than 60 gold units per minute  dust of appearance bought by the gankers of my team instead by me  my terrorblade arcana item given by my best friend on a match vs humans  a better community

since i began playing this game i have become a far less social individual ive lost friends and a sad excuse for a life i didnt even notice the passing of my pet i barely recognize my parents and viceversa the last president i remember is bush the senior all in all great game 1010

i played it once and i was bad and so i went back to playing competitive minecraft
recommended
such a fantastic moba you will love every minute of the complex well made mechanics that you can tell took people a long time to create and put love into definatly not pay to win the reason why i said you shouldnt play this game is because of the community everyone is a jerk lower ranking games consist of horrible people who have no idea what they are doing so they blame everyone els on the team this is almost every game these people make it incredibly hard to move up or learn from your mistakes because the one guy who has a lot of kills but doesnt help the team in any way is yelling at you its just amazing how horrible people are at this game but are quick to judge my suggestion is to skip this game because what ever time place or day you decide to get on to play this beautiful game there will be someone who will put you in a bad mood the only valid way to play this game is to have a group of friends to play with you if you are missing even one person you will get someone who doesnt want to help you or the team again a fantastic moba it is just littered with its community

this game is just perfect and balances out everything with valve working so hard on it
recommended
try hard to play
recommended
this is a delightful game where russians come to america and ruin everything also peruvians decide to join it is a game where you use one of 100 heroes to defend your base and destroy the enemys this is complicated by many things such as knowitalls who think that they have perfect strategies and when they inevitably fail dismally they blame their team then there are the afk people who never even spawn into the game and then there are the russians they believe that they are perfect players they are regularly seen in three forms which you will learn to hate if you come to play dota 2 the faceless void players the pudge players and axe players they will constantly spout curses in russian and blame their team for everything they will also call gg as soon as first blood happens sometimes they will disconnect because they have lost all hope because one inconsequential death on your team which will ultimately have no effect on the actual game except for a bit of demoralization on the team with the death but when they disconnect and abandon the game their team shall receive one extra gold per second which frankly is more helpful than the russian team mate
recommended
its best moba ever without russians p
recommended
this game has a very good concept i like how when i am playing it looks like i have my monitor turned off the brightness in game is great just ask ray charles he has the same perception of the game as we do and last i think the map design is better than league since they put trees that u can cut down by using leaves yes i said leaves alright 1010 would uninstall again

best league of legends copy out there it really feels like another game it is amazing how they have managed to create their own unique heroes even though they have blatantly copied some parts of league i feel like the people who think leauge of legends is too hard will have a great time in dota 2 as it is one of the best league of legends copies i feel its good that other companies realize the potential of games like league of legends and create their own versions of it

this game is officially broken sucks  eu servers lag like  and have russians in it every other server is 200 ping heroes rarely actually do what you really wanted to everyone picks zeus sniper troll riki and pa no one knows how to counter and if you want to raise your mmr to 2k for nonmoba players this means play with people who actually know how to play the game have fun because most of the community here is  russians trolls  and throwers  this game dota allstars was better

1010 moba games best ever dota 2 has infinite possibilities of more than 100 heroes who have 4 or more skills as well and hundreds of items each hero has its advantages and disadvantages of each icefrog is working properly by conducting periodic updates to balance this game
recommended
this game has a multitude of unique heroes and abilities offering people many diffrent ways to play and create their own methods although the game takes many hours of playing with bots and getting yelled at by angry players if you put your time in this game it is very much worth it i highly reccomend dota 2 for casual competetive and players with much time on their hands
recommended
this game is all about the victory if you play for fun this is probably not the game for you but i gotta tell ya winning is fun and if youre the kind of person who likes to win through outsmarting the enemy by counterpicking or playing a special play style then dota 2 is the game for you there are 68 different heroes in dota 2 and not a single one of them has to be played any specific way for all you want you can go carry earthshaker let that antimage be your ward there is only one map but with all these different ways to play its a new experience everytime

this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all

side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk

okay 1sti recomend this game because its amazingness of moba  its better than any other moba out there and because i have friend that also play it i usually play dota2 with my real life friend that also play d2 we play for fun and for win if we lose we just talk to each other about hero combos and never get mad even if a player in our team which is not our friend talking putang ina mo tang ina bobo in se asia or anjing babi but i never recomend this game for a beginner player that has no friend that also play it will become 50% stress 50% fun even if you win ppl who are rude will still talk about your tiniest mistake eg forget to use items or skills cause some peoples only play this game for winning and blame every ppl sry for my bad english

such a fantastic moba you will love every minute of the complex well made mechanics that you can tell took people a long time to create and put love into definatly not pay to win the reason why i said you shouldnt play this game is because of the community everyone is a jerk lower ranking games consist of horrible people who have no idea what they are doing so they blame everyone els on the team this is almost every game these people make it incredibly hard to move up or learn from your mistakes because the one guy who has a lot of kills but doesnt help the team in any way is yelling at you its just amazing how horrible people are at this game but are quick to judge my suggestion is to skip this game because what ever time place or day you decide to get on to play this beautiful game there will be someone who will put you in a bad mood the only valid way to play this game is to have a group of friends to play with you if you are missing even one person you will get someone who doesnt want to help you or the team again a fantastic moba it is just littered with its community

dota2 is very much a mixed bag the game is wonderful when you get into a good game with opponents and team mates equal of your skill however the game is a horrible experience when you dont and thats the main problem of dota2 this game has almost 0 infrastructure to support it to get you into those good games the most important part the matchmaking is utterly horrible and doesnt deliver also its is so nontransparent that its impossible to know anything about your game before hand valve doesnt seem to care about this which is very problematic because without a good drafting the moba genre is a horrible experience which degenerates quickly into a flame fest stomp which just sucks so my conclusion is great gameplay when it works but the disastrous matchmaking and drafting severely maims this game 410

my personal favorite game of all time you have great chances of becoming addicted to it its a moba which stands for multiplayer online battle arena meaning 5 randomly selected people of about the same skill will play against 5 other randomly selected people in a game that lasts on average 35 minutes in a big battlefield you can queue for a game with any number of friends from 1 to 4 no matter what if theyre good or not one of the best things about this game is the fact that absolutely everything regarding gameplay is 100% free which means you can play any of the 109 heroes as soon as you start playing without paying anything the only things that change between games is your skill level which goes up as you play that means you could match an account with 2000 games against an account with no games played in a 1v1 game and the level 1 account would have no disadvantage except being probably way worse at the game than the longtime player of course every game has its drawbacks for dota 2 i would say it is the complexity of the game which is at the same time a good thing for the experienced players as it makes every game unique dota is hard to learn because there are hundreds of different skills and unique interactions between them which can seem overwhelming for the beginners at first but dont worry everyone gets good somewhat at this game after you invested some time into it another con is the length of a game because it means you can play if you dont have a lot of time ahead of you i would suggest having at least 1 hour completely free before you if you want to make sure you wont have to abandon the game because the length of a game changes every time and there is the occasional person that disconnects to the game and you have to wait for him a few minutes overall i recommend you to at least try this game because there is a good chance that you will like it even if youre like me and you get bored of every game you play after a few hours i dont think you can ever get bored of playing dota 2

i hate dota 2 i hate it with a passion > it is not that the game itself is bad  really it is rather fun albeit somewhat repetitive given the lack of change in the battlemap  same map every time same hidespots same store locations etc  though during events sometimes some minor artistic features will be changed in any case a simple game as far as setting variety or lack thereof goes but a neat idea lots of variation with the heroes though some are considerably more powerful than others  not the best job balancing them in my opinion the problem with dota 2 is really the community which is lolstyle atrocious in all the times i played dota 2 i met a grand total of 2 friendly people both in bot matches i met a massive number of people who were just downright nasty pushy demanding immature not in the fun way unnecessarily combative just unpleasant to work with  not that there ever seemed to be much teamwork in this team game i suspect the atrocious community is why steam added the reporting system but really that just made things worse the system is frequently abused leading to players constantly reporting each other for made up things just because or out of bitterness at losing or because you dont switch upon their demand to speaking spanishrussian in the englishlanguagefiltered server etc this overreporting wouldnt be an issue if steam actually followed up to see if the reports had any merit and maybe removed the reporting option from players who constantly sling false accusations  but from what ive seen there appears to be no such oversight hardly surprising  there really is no incentive for valve to follow up getting reported kicks you into low priority matches which basically means that you have to go up against humans other players in this awful community who have also been reported and kicked into low priority there is a certain number of matches you must play in low priority before you are free to once more play the matches you want also locks you out of bot matches there doesnt seem to be any appeals process for this oh you can also get shuttled into low priority for spending too long without getting experience so if you are playing techies one of the heroes and want to go out and spend a few minutes planting mines the game may just decide that you have abandoned and kick you into low priority anyway i think ive wasted about enough of my time warning you off its a free game last i checked so i imagine youll download and play it anyway be my guest maybe these things wont bother you

what immediately strikes me about dota  to coin a hideously overused clich  is that its easy to learn but difficult to master its a phrase oft bandied about but in this case it perfectly describes dotas very simple concept and goals  which take mere seconds to understand  and its phenomenal gameplay variability and strategic depth  which offer enormous scope for skills development it delivers by doing what every truly great pvp game should do  and thats provide its players with an even playfield to work on a robust set of rules and a suite of characters available to all that enable deep and rich tactical play its an archetypal sporting construct that ensures fair competition where winning is all about skill expertise and experience  and maybe just a little luck every now and then many pvp games dont quite do that and instead enable player advantage through investment of time andor money im fine with that  in world of warcraft my hardearned toplevel gear lets me crush newbies mercilessly but while rofflestomping nubs after a long day can be fun theres nothing quite like a system built around player parity to drive the most fierce and rewarding competition something thats important to me in pvp is the facilitation of preferred playstyles through character roles and dota ticks that box nicely in team pvp im most attracted to a support function and im very happy with dotas wide array of characters that let me play behind the frontrunners making sure they stay alive im already seeing other roles i want to try too but for now its great being able to learn a game in a role that makes me feel like im playing from my core strengths rather than feeling like a square peg in a round hole for me multirole gameplay makes for varied and interesting play both for pickup games and premade coordinated team competition does the team go all out offense what about defense should the team be balanced or not dota enables high flexibility in that regard so its down to the players to follow through on their tactics or adapt accordingly again that makes for involving interesting and fun gaming its not just a slugfest or shooting match its more subtle strategic and measured which brings me to the cadence of the game some pvp games are frenetic and require practice simply to attune ones brain to the pace of the action dota 2 does not while it certainly does have its frantic moments they are interspersed with quieter periods where youre moving to the next tactical location or perhaps sitting back to heal or regroup having this space to breathe is really enjoyable and while you have to still keep your guard up to ensure youre not ganked by some stealthy foe its generally more forgiving that most pvp games and gives you plenty of bandwidth to learn rather than feeling rushed and panicked the whole time but while the game is generally forgiving the players are much less so as with all multiplayer games the experience of playing with others can be a bit of a mixed bag early on i had a few matches where my n00biness got me called out a few times and seemed to enrage one particular person to the point of apoplexy  probably exacerbated by us losing badly while ive been pvping long enough to know that this is part of the landscape i was nevertheless annoyed that i was playing with people who were clearly leagues ahead of me in terms of ability perhaps the matchmaking bands are too broad but as ive been developing my skills i have found myself consistently feeling like im pegging my team back and i hate being that guy considering appropriate matchmaking is such a fundamentally important thing for multiplayer games im consistently surprised that more effort isnt put into creating a variety of multiplayer options to more effectively smooth new players transition from botpractice to human play dota 2s ability to rate players and give feedback is good  but why not have a few more options that perhaps let lower level players play together let veterans be leaders of teams of newbies or have a more effective mentoring system maybe these things are harder to implement than they seem but seriously how hard can it be pvp matchmaking and tools complaints notwithstanding dota is still a terrific game when players work together against a similarly skilled team the result is a dynamic involving and nuanced tactical battle and ive definitely had a few great matches  not all of which ive won but like all pickup pvp games there are also frustrating moments where you can get absolutely flattened or end up stuck in a team with a couple of nutjobs whore off their meds if those sorts of moments are not for you then you already know dota 2 isnt something you should subject yourself to but if youre of hearty pvp stock thick of skin stoic of nature and moderately understanding of the human condition dota 2 is a must it really is a fantastic game

in most games i play players lash out at enemies and accuse them of hacking in this gamelike other mobas players will lash out at their teammates and use the report feature as a weapon to get them banned oh also players will try to convince the enemy team to also report you to get you banned still less toxic than the league of legends community such a shame such beautiful game has such horrible community

dota 2 is a simple tower defense game with a huge number of unique hero options that give the game great depth and variability i have never had so much fun with a free game if you like rpg and tower defense then you are going to love playing dota there is a bit of a learning curve but i found mastering one character first helped me get over that hump then here are only like 150 other heros to master after that

recommended
i just want to start with that this is one of the best games ive ever played the first rtsesque game i ever touched was warcraft iii i remember playing it together locally with my big brother and a friend of ours so my brother fell for this game league of legends too at the time i was a big fan of the musician with the name of basshunter so i had to try lol too it was free what had i to loose my interest for it right away it wasnt as actionfilled or exciting like the games i played at that time minecraft and call of dutysorry so yeah i was more the fpsguy but about a year later a friend of mine got a free betacopy of the game dota 2 he wasnt especially good at it and probably ruined a game or two for his teammates though it sure was fun a other friend of mine got it from him it was nothing special about it but after all they started to play together a day when a friend was over on a sleepover he had this bunch of copies of the game so i asked him might i have one and he said yes like it was obvious eventhough i only had watched the cinematic trailerwhich was damn awesome and listened to basshunters song it felt damn promising and finally my to alreadyplaying mates invited me to play a match my first hero was sven i picked him for his looks but he was a truly badass character now sven is my personal favorite and best played hero well i suppose the game didnt go so well and i lost my hopes for it but a month later i was back in the track and i enjoyed every single second of that match the akward satisfication i felt inside when i was autoattacking creeps now i play dota 2 alot alot and i felt since september this year ive felt that ive learned alot by watching promatches professional players like purge and by playing the game in general being a proplayer is a target i really want to reach which i think is worth going for dota 2 is a very fun and competetive game that has its up and downs but is pure entertaintment

no doubt it is one of the most popular game

dota 2 is a game about getting fat and whoever is the fattest of them all wins if your 5 man fat orgy gets fatter faster than the other growing pile of mass on the other side of the map then when these two hideous blobs of lard collide youll still have some fat to toss around at the enemy while they scream at each other for not being fat enough on the other hand when youre both at the weigh in and the other teams got some bigger numbers to boast about youll find yourself being smothered crushed by the fat it betrays you they pull you in absorbing you into their ever growing blob as your teammates are yelling to stop feeding their mass it becomes increasingly apparent that you are not the fattest of them all and you start to wonder why you ever started playing dota 2 in the first place

ahhh dota 2 this game is severaly unbalanced since no matter how well you play your team will always blame you for the loss it is also insanely luck based because the team that gets most russians usually looses a lot of functions in this game are completely broken as well for example even if you pick english in the language bar everyone still speaks russian sometimes german or french but never english playing this game i had a few mental breakdowns and smashed three windows in total it sometimes feels like my life is fading away and i imagine life in prison with a really musculine inmate would provide the same level of  to sum up this is game is ing terrible 1010 would recommend

in my opinion dota 2 is the best moba being the offical succesor to dota and having a deep metagamemechanics that changes now and then valve game too so the quality is pretty much assured and the free to play model is just superb all heroes unlocked no paywall you dont have to pay for anything expect cosmetics and tournaments some tournaments are free to watchmlg and international it has some flaws including the community but that is an issue that cannot be fixed and i would recommend to everyone who wants to play a mobais currently playing a moba almost perfect but with room for some improvements

this game is insanity at the time of this writing ive played hundreds of games spanning about a thousand hours ive murdered innocent creeps for their wallets drank alone from a bottle by a river been screamed at in languages i couldnt understand and in general have made more mistakes than a fledgling emperor penguin in polar bear infested waters yet im still playing this game is incredibly hard this game can be incredibly rewarding this game can make you scream at your best friends and question your deepest seeded belief systems im still playing because one day ill stop making so many mistakes one day my team will be fully able to speak english one day gaben will rise up the skies will part and all with be laid forth in glory and splendor and then only after the skies have lit up and my rares have been nearly depleted my winrate will finally reach  5050

i have clocked in about 250 hours on this bloody game and still i feel unqualified to review it what has been my dota experience thus far 50 hours vs bots to sort of get the idea what the game is about going into pub matches to get yelled out to realize you know noooothing eeeeediooot omg lina y u ks get more wards or report report my team all noobs lol feeding altf4 uninstal noob 250 hours of this sht and i only know how to play 5 heroes wtf icefrog why u so mean i do recommend you play this with some friends it will make the russians and asholes more tolerable  i read somewherre that dota is like the most disfunctional relationship ever its like having a bipolar gf and some nights are the worst ever with nothing but hate yelling and throwing sht against the wall but sometimes sometimes the sex is so great that when it is you hatefck the sht out of dota and its the best damn feeling in the world in the world so yeah that about sums it up

i looked up the wikipedia page on psychological abuse and dota fits it almost to the letter 1010 emotional and mental abuse this game will keep you from meeting social obligations enjoy meeting people from around the world as they all cuss at you in various languages including spanish and russian but that shouldnt really be a problem since team communication is almost nonexistent if you play willingly play support you are 110 in the game almost always even if they have support on their team theyll go semicarry at the minimum enjoy your stay  game is hard noob they gave diretide trading keys you forgot to ward again dont buy boots first

ahhh dota 2 this game is severaly unbalanced since no matter how well you play your team will always blame you for the loss it is also insanely luck based because the team that gets most russians usually looses a lot of functions in this game are completely broken as well for example even if you pick english in the language bar everyone still speaks russian sometimes german or french but never english playing this game i had a few mental breakdowns and smashed three windows in total it sometimes feels like my life is fading away and i imagine life in prison with a really musculine inmate would provide the same level of  to sum up this is game is ing terrible 1010 would recommend

so you look at this games store page and youre like this looks like a fun game so you download it and start it up so you play a few games against bots and have fun a few more against bots but with real people on your team youre thinking wow this is a real fun team building game but you arent ready to be up against real people you think so after training for a month and getting over a hundred hours played you think youre ready you put down your prefrences us west server english speaking people only and you hop into a game after six minutes you find a game finally and after loading into the game you see your teammates names   38    and   well those arent english at all you think to yourself your enemies all have english names though anyway into the game you go 3 of your teamates go middle 1 goes bottom and you are at top there is no courier by the way the 3 at mid are arguing in some language you dont understand and the one at bottom is afk within 10 minutes your teams t1 and t2 towers are gone the enemies towers arent touched also   has just abandoned for being afk and in a few short minutes the others will abandon leaving you to be killed multiple times the people on the other team are saying i feel bad for you son and other such things after you lose you try another game thinking that this one will be different its not you try again and again look for a game that you arent matched with foreign speakers that are terrible or you win so quickly and easily its boring but you never do and you cant quit now youre to deep in youve caught the bug cant stop playing you are devoted to finding that one game that isnt a disapointment will you ever find it though probably not all in all its a good game 1010 would reommend

if you cant afford to purchase cocaine to lighten up your weekend then dota 2 is the next best thing highly addictive and as equally life destroying as any drug dota 2 will make you question your own sanity and send you on a spiralling quest about what the meaning of life actually is answer could be dota 2 if you cant speak russian then dota 2 will enable you to become fluent in the language but only if you put some effort in yourself this means that holiday to russia youve all been wanting will be like visiting home rather than a foreign country learn great words like  and  and repeat them to your new friends ive never felt more free than when i play dota 2 im sure my life span decreases every time i play it so whats not to love go buy it now for free and ruin your life play with friends so you can venture the darkness together 1110 must buy very win

this game will teach you about life it will teach you about the futility of being an individual unable to cause real change it will teach you that no matter how hard you try if the people around you screw up it will fall on you and you will be blamed for it it will teach you that everyone expects to get the spotlight and leave you in the dark it will teach you many many things it will also make you hate russians and well just about anyone who doesnt speak your language your life will never be the same you are not ready run while you still can its too late for me 10010 would play again

dota 2 is hard but theres a huge reward for those who commit on the surface the game is a likeforlike reproduction of the genrecreating and still updated defense of the ancients modification for warcraft iii now transferred into valves source engine the games punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall but its worth sticking the hours in success in dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details if youre not aware of the basics of the burgeoning moba genre two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structurein dota 2s case the ancientin the opposing teams base with most games lasting around the 40minute mark and occasionally edging past an hour watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff aiding these two teams named the radiant and the dire are waves of ai assistants called creeps batches of creeps spawn at 30second intervals and charge merrily up the maps three pathways in the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle where numerous ai opponents spawn offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully finally and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one anothers base each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game your individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero you mostly control a single unit in dota 2 though there are exceptions some heroes can summon controllable allies such as bears gargoyle babies or wolves one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three and one item lets you take control of certain creeps for each rule in dota 2s impressive houseofcards design theres usually at least one character who completely ignores it or finds a way around it via one of 130odd items available from the inmatch shop for instance try negating magic attacks with the black king bar returning damage with the blade mail or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb the aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players its almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group which is why its rarely a good idea to run about on your own then its a case of splashing all your hardearned money on some ultrapowerful items from the shop while levelling up your base stats and abilities and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few fiveversusfive team fights rarely does it feel that simple however at the time of writing 102 of the original dotas 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role such as supporting other players as omniknight roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as spirit breaker or evolving throughout the course of the game into an allpowerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as phantom assassin theres only one map unlike in many other moba titles although valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time and has previously offered gamechanging modes with seasonal events at halloween and christmas but dota 2s single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger more intricate and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre unlike in league of legends the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide flee and ambush their opponents there are multiple layers of additional information that become increasingly relevant as you invest more time in the game how do you effectively divide your forces when should your team attempt to vanquish roshan the maps most powerful creep what are runes whats the significance of the fact that creeps get slightly stronger every seven and a half minutes often the games dizzying scale is seen as offputting or simply too complex but the truth of dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of likeminded friends is a lot of fun start by buying your characters recommended items try your best not to get caught out of position and get into the habit of buying observer wards and watch out for riki as youd expect from valve this is a beautifully presented game with the halflife and portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of ui voice acting and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings however and even now mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end efforts are being made to remedy this though right now there are a couple of tutorial levels some welldesigned ai bots and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters and with communitycreated hero guides now built directly into the game itself dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past play a match every evening for a couple of weeks and you start to see how dota 2s wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition the biggest problem which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool it is a complicated and exhausting game and for the first few weeks its challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match but invest enough time into dota 2 and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the gameperforming actions such as sending the slightly fiddly ingame courier over to the faraway secret shop to get some rare items for instance after a couple of hundred hours of dota 2 what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically latenight skype calls drawnout conversations down at the pub and lost lunch breaks follow very few games can withstand so many emotionally charged discussions when everything goes south the psychological toll can be surprisingly intense and this is very much a game with the power to both start and end close friendships dota 2 is an overwhelming intoxicating and emotionally dangerous game that can quite easily take over your entire gaming life while dota 2 has transferred the core of the original dota into a cleaner modern engine the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful death in dota 2 not only gives your opponent money but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn by the time youve trudged back across the games massive mapor spent money on a teleportation scrollyour opponent is now stronger and richer die two or three times in quick succession which is easily done and a match of dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment but dota 2 positively revels in its complexities the rich just get richer

felt like giving dota 2 a try and like most other moba games its very addicting i played a fair amount of the game as well as going through training the heros were interesting and had a lot of diversity selecting the lane you preferring in hero select was a nice feature thats the end of the good things i have to say about the game now for the bad still full of bugs no good information on how to cancel auto buy resulting in odd issues with ui which you cant tell if its a bug that prevents you from buying things and putting a large item icon on your screen an insane amount of leavers during games then when you attempt to disconnect when its safe taking minutes for it to give you the disconnect screen region ques seem to be a joke always selected just the two north american ques and one in three matches getting multiple people who do not speak english pretty rediculus when this is supposed to be a game where you need to communicate with your team this is also in addition to the very long que times more time spent in que today then actually playing the game this ultimately made me quit playing in digust summary some great heros with unique abilities ui has great features when they work correctly drop system that keeps you wanting to play worst community i have ever had the displeasure of playing with que times far too long picking a region to play in doesnt seem to matter though its out of beta still a large amount of bugs training system needs some work

i love dota 2 it has quickly become my mostplayed game on steam and i feel like ive barely scratched the surface of all there is to experience in it despite being limited to one map the game still feels extremely large and always offers a brand new challenge with every match with so many heroes to choose from and so many crazy combinations for teams i have a feeling that ill still be learning the basics of this game for a long time coming i cant write a dota review without mentioning the competitive aspect of the game im a huge fan of esports and have been following various scenes since 1997 ive watched the production values of these scenes increase slowly throughout the years to the point where there is enough media coverage and hype to reach nearly anyone with dota2 i feel that things are taken to a whole new level the ingame interface itself makes it very easy to view the latest big tournaments and watch them live from within the application with commentary you can watch the games using a guided camera or you can take control of the camera yourself and track your favorite player all while the commentary is running in the background to give you constant updates of the action its phenomenal and its another big reason why ill be playing this game for years in short yes you should definitely give this game a try no doubt about it

dota is a competitive game of action and strategy played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes forming two teams of five players radiant heroes then battle their dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape waging campaigns of cunning stealth and outright warfare irresistibly colorful on the surface dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike this is one of the reasons that the dota phenomenon has continued to grow originating as a fanmade warcraft 3 modification dota was an instant underground hit after coming to valve the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience so that the rest of the world can experience the same core gameplay but with the level of polish that only valve can provide

if you are looking for a moba i would highly suggest you download this game as it is sequel to one of the best and one of the first mobas ever and unlike other free to play mobas with this one you are not required to pay for other heroeschampions you start off with all heroes available to you the way valve makes money off the game are skins which are cosmetic items which are not required to be purchased and are only there for looks overall i would definately recommend this to anyone as it is free to play and doesnt have a pay to win model anyways pick it up when you can 1010

this game is an absolute blast to play once you get into it the only problem is getting into it the learning curve for 90% of the heroes makes it hard for newcomers to the genre to get a grasp of not to mention the overly hostile attitude of the majority of players towards newbies but you can just choose to ignore them the game requires at first almost more research into playing the heros correctly and learning how the game flows than actually playing it putting the time and effort in to learning how to play is highly rewarding i recommend this game to anyone who has the patience to learn and study the mechanics of the game and be able to put up with trashtalking and an obscene amount of russians once you know what youre doing this game can kill an entire day easily 910

this game is going to take control of you the graphics are among the best in mobas the community is well not as good as you would want it to be but if you have friends you can play with it doesnt matter as much there are over 120 heroes to choose from and after 100 hours youll know all the things you need everything is available to you from the start so you can quickly master a few heroes and play on all pick if you want to or play on single draft for additional challenge there are also 8 gamemodes and a lot of events are coming out for nearly every festival eg christmas halloween etc overall i recommend the game its great if you want to learn the basics go play on bots for a while with a guide dota 2 gets a 910 from me just because of the community

dota 2 is an excellent game especially for a f2p a lot of heros that are availble to everyone from the start and the only thing you pay for in this game is coesmetic items or tickets to watch pro games any money spent on the game doesnt effect the outcome of the game other then how many more hours youre going play the hero you bought items for lol how ever there is a steep learning curve and even if youve played fora while youre constantly learning new things because dota 2 is always changing

its fun after you get used to it it hurts at the start but it gets better the deeper you go in dota 2 is basically anal there are alot of servers availible which includerussia and other servers that are filled with russians you will experience noobs sometimes such as the infamous pudge jungle but its fiiine lycan didnt need the jungle anyways am i right tldr a dont be lazy read the damn thing

great moba if youre into mobas like league of legends smite hon etc then give this a try its free and its damn good first off a warning youre going to suck oh you have some experience with mobas oh in that case youre going to suck and get  dota 2 has a pretty long learning curve loads of heroes to choose from and heaps of items to go along the training system is a precious help and introduces you to the last hits denies shopping for items and combining items allows you to play with a few noobfriendly not easy and not weaker than the other ones mind you just not that complicated to master in the early stages of the game heroes to get you to feel the games pace from then on you still have a lot to learn everybody can use all heroes for free and theres no advantage anyone has over you except their own experience in the game but there are plenty of heroes to go around and until youve played them all or played against them at least once youll be feeling like a noob when you face one for the first time dota 2 is rather unforgiving when it comes to carries you die you lose time experience and gold and you need gold to buy items to allow you to carry not that easy for supports either most of them do have the uppoer hand on some carries on the early stages of the game but you need to know them in order to take advantage of that also your abilities damage doesnt really scale all that well to late game where the carries start to shine there are dozens of ward spots jungling tricks and control points you need to master every games different lanes are pretty unpredictable at dota 2 you can have 212 but you can have a 113 a 122 or if you have some jungler you can have 1112 os something like that the games pretty dynamic do check some guides and builds they can help you in your first contacts with some heroes but hey its dota 2 everythings situational sure there are a few core items on many heroes but all in all it all depends on the game youre playing and a change can make all the difference again if youre into mobas do try it now

i love dota 2 it has quickly become my mostplayed game on steam and i feel like ive barely scratched the surface of all there is to experience in it despite being limited to one map the game still feels extremely large and always offers a brand new challenge with every match with so many heroes to choose from and so many crazy combinations for teams i have a feeling that ill still be learning the basics of this game for a long time coming i cant write a dota review without mentioning the competitive aspect of the game im a huge fan of esports and have been following various scenes since 1997 ive watched the production values of these scenes increase slowly throughout the years to the point where there is enough media coverage and hype to reach nearly anyone with dota2 i feel that things are taken to a whole new level the ingame interface itself makes it very easy to view the latest big tournaments and watch them live from within the application with commentary you can watch the games using a guided camera or you can take control of the camera yourself and track your favorite player all while the commentary is running in the background to give you constant updates of the action its phenomenal and its another big reason why ill be playing this game for years in short yes you should definitely give this game a try no doubt about it

dota defense of the ancients  is a action rts game a great esports platform a fun game to play if you just know the mechanics of this great game 10 random players choose from a strong hero pool with different powers and the players have to cooperate with each other understand the extremities of the game leadershipforgivnesssacrifice and great strategy is required for the win or you end up losing and wasting an hour or two the only drawback is a steep learning curve but when finally you learn this game you will just love this and play all day it is also a great way to connect with players of the world a large community supports this so a word of advice play hard die hard go pro

good game but lol is better cuz you dont have to deny so positioning becomes more important so its a more skilled game also all this channeling times in dota2 are so long i have to wait foreva time is money lolol btw many dota2 champions are just copies of the lol versions there are some cosmetic items in dota2 but i think they do not change very much i prefer to confuse my opponent with skins so they do not know which champ im playing when i do my skilled ganks its ridiculous that you have to spend almost the half of your all the gold you earned in one entire match for a in blink its an item with this ability called blinkdagger and cant chose it at beginning nobody would buy such a crap item that does not even give any damage or stats lololol see you in lol broz <3

there doesnt seem to be that many serious reviews so i will give it a shot played dota ever since wc3 must be 7 years at least by now and its always the game i come back to always that says a lot it really isnt a game that you have to play every day you can stop playing it for days weeks months but the thing is that you almost inevitably get the urge to play it again it is a cooperative game where you play the same map over and over but with different sets of heroes you always control one hero and have different items to choose from this may sound boring but keep in mind that there are about 100 different heroes and loads of different items that is surprisingly enough to make every game a new experience the learning curve is really steep but there are options to try out a tutorial and to play against bots to improve before jumping into the fray this is recommended because the community is what i would call a bit unforgiving but the real action with other players and friends its a huge bonus to stack up together and play is the best gaming experience there is it is a freetoplay game and no purchases give you the advantage over your opponents i love this about dota purchases are strictly cosmetic or give access to watching tournaments played by professional players you will get rewarded with items just by playing too as a summary it is really simple to grasp the basics but it takes a lot to become good at the game and it is always challanging you will bang your head against the wall in frustration a couple of times but i and many of my friends really love the game it is the best cooperative game out there according to myself 1010

dota 2 is not for everyone dont get me wrong this is personally a time consuming game if youre planning on going to play a match before you go to bed in 10 minutes you must be mistaken this game has so much to offer to the players they have their own market for you along with team fortress 2 type of things but thats another review i have to write dota 2 has so many characters you can play as its mind blowing 98 to be exact this is a strategetic game that i think is a mustplayed game by all gamers if possible this is an exact type of game some game companies should look at and see how much success theyve had for the past few years i am excited for the events they have been coming up with as if frostivus i know it was canceled again id have to recommend this game to almost anyone who has games in their blood i give dota 2 a full on 9510

i recommend dota2 because the community is very friendly especially those people who doesnt speak english words like bobo and  are words of encouragement the matchmaking system is the best and you will definitely pair up with someone like you or better you never report someone in fact you will run out of commends the game is so easy to pick up and you can learn it in less than 3 hours to see if you are on the right track play an online match and if people called you bobo or  you are definitely on the right track of becoming the next best dota2 player in the world people here are understandable and smart and will always pick according to your teammates choices you will never see 2 junglers or 2 mid ever  though if you see people going to the wrong lane which never happens just simply tell them  or bobo and they will understand the situation and do what they were told to do i highly recommend this game 1010 cykapower

i recomend the game to many people for a intresting fun moba however people seem to not understand its a game and go off the deep end when someone does badin ranked there is no comuniacation only yelling and blaming other people or crying and sitting there thinking you are the best and everyone sucks sadly people still dont understand that the other games modes like all random and single are to have fun and not be all up tight so with this said if you want a moba where you can play a intresting set of heros and customize said heros play dota 2 if you want to play dota 2 just to yell at people in casual games then go play league or tf2 i think that would suit you better all in all i give the game 810

when i started with such types of games shifting form first person shooter i was confused and i did not know if league of legends or dota 2 is better so i downloaded both starting from dota 2 i played it was complicated but the games i found fast and the understanding of the game it made sense after playing about 100 hours i decided to give a try to league of legends hearing that it is one of the top ones i expected it to be better but frankly i was horrified by lols quality the gaming is very arcadish u get defensive upgrades at the cost of boots yes that cheap anyone can hide anyone can get back to town withouth scroll it was senseless to me i never the less gave it a go played league of legends for 30 hours the waiting for games were long choosing for sides was irritating so then i removed lol and havnt looked away from dota 2 ever since oh the game the lust for getting those kills one map infinite possibilities i specially enjoy the ability draft makes the game even more enjoyable as u may make a new hero all together the community is friendly and the best part about dota 2 is it makes sense a lot of sense and the physics ingame are very much realistic the devs have done some amazing job in the game and i thank them for their constant efforts  so after such a  strange review my point being is its an amazing game and hence must for everyone to try it  ull be hooked m sure of it d

nice original game from valve if youve never played it the most simple example will be other game from valve  team fortress you have to choose one of the characters with different abilities before game starts and fight other team to complete games mission but there are also several differences between dota 2 and tf battles are going in fantasy world so you can control not only humans but also monsters robots and ghosts you are unable to control your alter ego directly as well you can only order him who to attack and where to move with aerial viewpoint it makes game similar to red alert or any other realtime strategy game for the moment dota 2 needs a lot of improvements like adding new maps there is only one map at all more game modes like storyline coop with friends vs mobs and let players write only with latin letters in text chat and speak only with english words in voice chat

it was one of the first big freetoplay games and one of the first big multiplayer online battle arenas or mobas but going on five years later league of legends still holds firm as an example of excellence with its amazing variety of champions rewarding progression systems and fast but intensely strategic team play it easily hooked me and refused to let go that addictiveness and competitive spirit combined with a generous freetoplay approach and frequent updates from developer riot games has created one of the biggest and liveliest gaming communities anywhere like most mobas league of legends main attraction is its fiveonfive matches on its staple threelane map called summoners rift this map is brightly and colorfully designed and it creates a distinct playstyle with the way its dense brush allows you to conceal yourself and surprise enemies i particularly love how the distinctive jungles on either side of the central river are filled with npc monsters that give buffs to players who take a break from battle to go on the hunt  its a constant temptation to risk venturing into the other teams territory to attempt to steal their buffs the choice between engaging the other team directly or attacking their resources allows for interesting strategies and depth beyond simply fighting until one champion or turret is dead inside each teams base also lies an inhibitor which if destroyed causes the opposing teams side to start spawning super minions its an extra strategic objective to target in the enemy base and having one more building to take down often leads to exciting and gameending team fights from ziggs the bombloving little rat to jinx the bluepigtailed maniac its electrifying to coordinate with your team to mow down your opponents and push lanes with leagues inside each teams base also lies an inhibitor which if destroyed causes the opposing teams side to start spawning super minions its an extra strategic objective to target in the enemy base and having one more building to take down often leads to exciting and gameending team fights as freetoplay games go league of legends is a model of generosity though it doesnt give everything away like dota 2 does it serves up a weekly rotating selection of 10 champions for free and you can purchase and play with any of the 117character roster for a reasonable price of between two and eight dollars each yes that adds up to a princely sum if you intend to buy every single character but theres no need to buy more than you intend to actually play the champion rotation is a nice way to try before you buy and helped me to pace myself by learning just a few characters at a time you can also unlock every champion at a satisfying rate without spending a penny which is not only fulfilling but it sets league apart from the type of freetoplay game that deliberately makes it impractical to play at a competitive level for no cost since many players opt for a completely free experience its exciting when the roster changes and pushes the community to try out fresh characters and new strategies if you want to go a step further you can buy cosmetic skins for every character they can be pricey but each skin has tons of detail and its impressive that most of them come with unique spell effects and animations my panda annie skin for example changes the little pinkhaired girl into a minigeisha of sorts and her ultimate ability calls down a panda version of her grizzly bear tibbers yay tibbers in the opening minutes of a match leagues champions distinguish themselves with lots of lowlevel areaofeffect abilities that make killing minions quick and easy unlike some other mobas theres no way to attack your own minions to deprive your enemy the experience and gold making it simpler to focus on other tasks like getting last hits the absence of those denial tactics definitely takes a competitive aspect away from league but its one thats often frustrating i dont miss it relative to other mobas where management of specialability juice magic points in this case is key i also enjoy how often abilities are available for use in league its awesome being able to constantly harass opponents with spells rather than having to worry about conserving them all for one crucial moment but that doesnt mean abilities dont matter some of the strongest attacks are skill shots projectiles requiring precise manual aim and failing to hit your target can have catastrophic gamechanging consequences in team fights from simple slows to huge super mega death rockets that travel across the whole map snagging enemies with these moves while dodging theirs is a giddy thrill the importance league of legends places on these skill shots helps set its style of action apart you dont lose any money when you die in league making it easier to save up for new weapons and armor in the item shop the item selection is decent but most players always seem to rely on you to build your character using expected items like the bloodthirster or rabadons deathcap straying from the recommended builds doesnt make you useless but some of these might as well be called required items instead of recommended considering their power on the bright side this means spending less time shopping and more time playing also the recent addition of a variety of support items like the frost queens claim and talisman of ascension which grant passive gold are a good move in the right direction for diversifying builds it might be easier to coordinate unusual item builds if league had builtin voice chat unless youve set up a teamspeakventrilomumbleskypeetc call with your prearranged team before joining a game the only ways to communicate are via text which often goes unnoticed or through four alerts to indicate danger on my way missing or assist me nothing sucks more than watching a crucial surprise attack slip through my fingers because a teammate was too busy to see me pinging at least when your team falls so hopelessly behind 20 minutes into a 40ish minute match that four of five teammates agree its all over the handy surrender option prevents you from wasting time fighting a losing battle even though you play on the same few maps with similar items theres so much depth and strategy going on that no two matches of league of legends ever feel the same its distinctive style encourages surprise attacks and frequent use of skillshot powers and its colorful art style makes everything pop on the screen learning how to make the most of its characters and to become an asset to a team is a long and challenging process but once youve got it down its incredibly satisfying to work together to destroy your enemies in this amazing moba

pardon my slightly irrelevant paragraph for this review but out of very strange consequences blizzard allowed valve to purchase this ip dota is what is potentially the most competitive gem of all time the known mod for warcraft 3 reign of choas or the frozen throne it is famous that it had no marketing no montization or any advertisements and grew its popularity in numbers for its strangely addictive gameplay and emphasis on teamwork considered to be called a ction real time strategy or massive online battle arena as a genre the legalities that were abound during the time the game was being made caused massive problems for valve i can sympathise with this blizzard had nearly sued valve such as keeping the ip not too close to the warcraft characters changing the azeroth world to the mad moon this meant changing names and lore such as necrolyte to necrophos skeleton king diablo to the wraith king and many others like obsidian destroyer to outworld devourer which the latter sounds much more frightening to avoid law suits just recently pudge has his damaged body sewed up because it was too similar to diablo 1s the butcher who was inspiration for pudge and his line ah fresh meat difficulty hardcore is tough for those new to this genre publisher valve producer valve special mentions eul creator abdul ismail icefrog guinusso factors introduction gameplay cooperationteamwork graphics features replay value audio introduction verdict dota 2 stands for defense of the ancients an assymetric map made by eul a modder of starcraft who started the mod off made headway for a guy called icefrog who helped eul port it to warcraft 3 and made it esports viable dota 2 features many rts inspired elements from warcraft and ability use multiple unit control is used throughout gameplay verdict the goal of this game is simple  destroy the enemies ancient  a building of pure immense power of both evil and good radiating from it launch attacks with friends or players on the other persons ancient in hope the destroy it to win the game while defending yours to aid you  you have heroes who will come to your aid when facing enemy heroes with each demise of creeps and hero gold is rewarded to get better items attack your own creeps to stop the enemy getting your gold commonly referred to as farming  engine is powered by valves source engine it provides the flexibility of modding d2warecom and steam workshop it is completely free to play and uses microtransitions and has a workshop for those interested for making items to be appoved and sold on the game itself aiding animators modellers and sound producers gain a slice of the profits about 1025% goes to them and even more if you donate directly this is assuringly one of the most competitive games you and i will experience even if you dont know me we will assuringly meet as allies or rivals >d you play in a team of five versus five as heroes special ability units which can cast spells and are controlled and gain levels and gold by killing creeps which contain gold and experience these creeps are noncontrollable unless you buy certain items like helm of the dominator or you are this guy called chen units which attack other units or youenemies as time progresses you can use this gold to purchase items which aid you against your enemy and makes you stronger and stronger dota 2 is very well kitted out with leauges clans tournaments cosemetics spectator mode downloadable replays a somewhat rudimentary report system and fantastic looking graphics that focus on fantasy very vivid and pyrotechnical the games mechanics are similar to those who play warcraft 3s version of this modification you are 3 main attributes called strength agility and intelligence strength focuses on being tanky meaning they take a lot of hits before dying and are relatively the first to be sent in while their team some strength heroes contain better stats or gain which makes them able to use their spells often most strength heroes focus on other strength heroes which are capable of dealing massive autoattack damage agility focuses on speed and movement which most heroes will have quite fast spell casts they have a high amount of options for escaping enemy heroes and usually have a form of invisibility or entrapment intelligence focuses on spammable as in can be done over and over again magic damage dealing spells which can silence disarm or drain the mana of an enemy intelligence have by far the most mana which is the bar like health which is used to cast spells which drains them requiring management intelligent heroes utilize strategy far better but become weaker at late game capable of burst damage on certain heroes like lion cooperationteamwork verdict cooperation in dota 2 is highly dependable on who you play with i recommend not playing with peers that do not know the support roles carry and semicarry roles will result in a less favorable outcome for the final stages of the game referred to as the late game i shouldnt really say this but prepare for a lot of russians pervuians and foreign folks in the wrong servers this is not a gripe i actually prefer multicultural lobbies graphics verdict source engine has been modified to present higher graphical fidelity including hbao a type of shader called horizon based ambient occulsion which makes the shading much more realistic and increased resolution on textures models and the animations are excellent dota 2 has its immersion split slightly with too much fog of war blackness border to hide sight from enemies that affects seeing enemy players i havent found a way to tone the fog of war to become more or less visible or to disable it not in the form of hacking but in the form of console commands and you still cannot see it features verdict download it and see for yourself very kitted out with tons of stuff to use too numerous to put here but it will appease and appeal to many replay value verdict each battle is dynamic and changes its course superb concept is that the trees surrounding the dota map allows for juking a form of evasion by confusing the enemy by moving into the fog or into a position which entraps them audio verdict soundtrack is nice mix of ochrestra and slow drum beats the music adapts to your teams aggression start pushing and the game starts to change to a heavy orchestra of war

when i started with such types of games shifting form first person shooter i was confused and i did not know if league of legends or dota 2 is better so i downloaded both starting from dota 2 i played it was complicated but the games i found fast and the understanding of the game it made sense after playing about 100 hours i decided to give a try to league of legends hearing that it is one of the top ones i expected it to be better but frankly i was horrified by lols quality the gaming is very arcadish u get defensive upgrades at the cost of boots yes that cheap anyone can hide anyone can get back to town withouth scroll it was senseless to me i never the less gave it a go played league of legends for 30 hours the waiting for games were long choosing for sides was irritating so then i removed lol and havnt looked away from dota 2 ever since oh the game the lust for getting those kills one map infinite possibilities i specially enjoy the ability draft makes the game even more enjoyable as u may make a new hero all together the community is friendly and the best part about dota 2 is it makes sense a lot of sense and the physics ingame are very much realistic the devs have done some amazing job in the game and i thank them for their constant efforts  so after such a  strange review my point being is its an amazing game and hence must for everyone to try it  ull be hooked m sure of it d

i started playing dota since i was 14 dota is a team game so team work is a must dota has taught me a lot of things you can only be good at something if you focus on it learn from mistakes be aware of your surroundings trust your instinct use common sense trusting on your team to always have your back believing in your capabilities always try to be better than you were yesterday i mostly playing supports in dota i learn playing support role from good guide but it just teaches you the basics i have spent my time playing for 3000 hours and i realized i have spent 3000 hours of my life in a best game ever after all i recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain suffering and torment because at the end you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better

this game wont make anyone bored i have playing dota 2 for almost 920 hours and i never get bored  even if it the same map and the same concept this game combine strategy and team work and skills all at once timing and knowledge of the items players in lvl 1 can beat lvl 200  everyone here is equal and all the heroes are free to play i think this game is the best yet i found that i can still play it all the time and never get bored cuz everytime i try something new new hero  new strategy  new items  and every time its new party to play with and a new combination of heros that you can try to combine the skills with most of the people see a moba game and just wont start to play it cuz they see the gameplay looks from the top watch the character from up and they think the game sucks i think its what makes that game a good game you be able to watch your back and looks out for your friends there also the option the add mods from workshop and get the game more funny adn try new stuff also you can play with different mode like  least played or all random and its make the choices of the heros more fun to play and learn and the game mode have alot of options i recommend everyone to play dota 2 and more recommend to play with friends and talk while the game just keep positive feelings and be happy when you play  its just a game xd

yes dota 2 is a true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming yes dota 2 is one of the best mmo  mmorpg game and it is true that it is one of the games that have awesome heroes with their awesome abilities and lores it is all true what they say defense of the ancients may be the best game in existent i can actually say that dota 2 was one of the most addictive awesomest and best experience in my gaming life but it may be also one of the worst guess what there are over 108  112 heroes and over 20 difficult heroes 40 relied heroes 40 carries in which you will be expected to be excellent in fact when you first enter the game you are already expected to be excellent and skilled in that game even now i am playing this game and may be planning to quit it but it is not the game i blame it into nope i have been through hundreds of heavy or light games from super mario to pacman to minecraft to zelda to call of duty left 4 dead and every possible heavy game you might even know yes i have been through dying games like crossfire mercenaries twelve sky dead game and world of tanks and i recommend for you not to play this game why its community is one of the worst im not talking only about the russians which most people are probably too concerned about im talking about everybody in generalized everyone repeat everyone will bring you down once you cling to this game this game may have lots of good recommendations but i beg to differ those people are the ones who will also tear you apart from this game trash talking coarse words harsh statements bullying its just like school only 100x worse and they tell you not to play the game if you cant take it its like saying dont bother living life if you cant take the hurtful words not to mention the imaginary boundaries between choosing heroes people tend to choose the less skilled ones even though they wanted to practice hard ones because they might bring the team down its that feeling when you want to use an invoker a very hard hero to use where people expect you to be good at him when you use it but you say nevermind just to avoid being blamed for loss people tend to treat this game as their life and may change their characters just because of certain problems with their peers this is one of the most ungodly and evil games yes i am a filipino and i am not proud of my trash talking inhibitants and neighbors in fact i am ashamed of it there will probably even more of them who will comment on this review adding more insults to me yes they might say i am weak or noob just because i cant play the game the way i want it to doesnt mean i have to give a bad recommendation no i have the right to speak my fellow brothers let us enjoy the game like we enjoyed minecraft and super mario let us embrace loss welcome our fellow newbies teach them our ways if they fail to do so give way to them let us respect our professionals embrace this game as one love our enemies as mentioned in the bible love our teammates forget trashtalking it doesnt bring you any good i just hope that this message will be viewed to all to remind them of what true gaming is like god bless happy gaming

the core mechanics of this game are fantastic and the diversity of gameplay is a strong selling point however it is a multiplayer game and the matchmaking is one of the worst i have ever come across it does not matter how long youve played or what level you are level is a good indicator of timeexperience you will be matched with complete noobs and elite players alike this is an attempt to balance the teams but all it does is create a scenario in which 95% or more no exaggeration of the games played are one sided stomps theres already been numerous complains about region locking i will not expand upon anything said by others it is a team game that requires communication and yes its difficult when a team mate does not speak the same language as you regardless of that language is not the main problem the main problem with dota 2 matchmaking is the enforced 50% winrate valve fanboys and other people will claim it does not exist but anybody who has played the game long enough knows otherwise it works by judging your skill level in one game and placing you with appropriate players in the next game if you do very well you may be matched with 4 very inexperienced players if you do poorly you may be matched with 4 very experienced players this wouldnt be a problem if dota 2 was not such a complicated game new players will be absolutely destroyed due to their lack of knowledge at the time of writing this i am level 50 in the game this has taken me over 1000 hours to achieve to put my next point in perspective as i said most games are onesided stomps and to prove this i usually check out the levels of every player before or after the game in games that i win my team usually consists of players lvl 50300 in games that i lose my team usually consists of players lvl 150 yes ive actually had a few games with lvl 1 players while i was lvl 30 when the total level of players on one team is hundreds higher than the other something is clearly wrong with the matchmaking system when one team has a few thousand more total hours played than the other something is clearly wrong with the matchmaking system playing well in one game will almost certainly cause you to lose the next game unless you are on what i like to call a valve permitted streak wherein the matchmaking decides to pair you with good players or awful players for a number of games in a row yes valve actually punishes players for doing too well and rewards players for losing too much a typical week of dota2 matches might look something like this wwwwwlwlwlwllllll repeating there can be longer or shorter streaks this is just an example this is not to alleviate myself or any player of fault everybody makes mistakes and we are not all professional players however when the teams are grossly imbalanced as explained above the fate of the match is decided before it even begins the reason i keep playing is those 5% of games where both teams are equally matched and the game is actually funchallenging winning a game in under 20min because the other team are mostly noobs not fun same goes for losing when its your turn on the noob team if valve ever fixed the matchmaking this game would be amazing both mechanically and socially that will probably never happen because dota2 has a lot of players and matchmaking isnt easy to begin with but please anything would be better than the 50% enforced winrate that is ruining my and many others desire to play this game if i know im going to losewin every game for the next 3 days why bother playing at all ps the community is notoriously toxic i would recommend avoiding if you have thin skin or get frustrated easily

this is a great example of how good games that are free can be dota is best described as so easy to learn difficult to master i have over 450 hours on dota and barely scratched the surface its an experience to learn each individual hero master them and get better as you play more and more getting better is what this game is all about are you a leader a follower a team player at 107 heroes the choices are lengthy and will take you an eternity to play them all and its impossible to master every single hero the community is a turnoff for some people because they may have run into unfriendly people this is not the case for me i choose to ignore anyone who doesnt want to play as a team and have a good time while doing so i recommend that everyone should play dota at least once youll thank me later 910

this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all

side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk

in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

this is an awesome and addicting game with many features to notice the game being updated every day makes it even better experience new games modes and additional events daily but dont miss it everything moves fast  the gameplay is sick as is awesome sick because there is always a new way of playing  you can play over 100 characters and each having their own 46 abilities new matchmaking from over to america to russia if you want  you can specifically find a match anywhere of your choosing and dont worry there are a lot of people out there to play against the way even the main menu is set up is astounding just because actually that one i messed up anyways this game is amazing to play that why i play the game a lot its just that fun this game is also cool because it can improve so many things that you wouldnt think of or would have thought of i dont know you this game improves hand  eye coordination very well and improves your speed of processing even though you may not be well concentrated on the outside world in one of any world you will have great concentration also even though there are hateful russians that will never speak you language no matter what you want and no matter what you care and no matter how much teamwork you need and no matter who you are fighting you will learn to not hate them after a while it took me 5 hours to learn dota 700 hours not to hate them and 5000 all accounts combined [sorry valve i only have 2 accounts >_<] hours to start recording and being successful in life  for once jk lol community is a big problem in this game but you will learn to love it when you get with those nice people on the mics or those guys with music playing or static yeah hope you found this helpful just know that you will learn this quite quickly about this game and you will especially learn it is amazing and fun and addicting

recommended
very naice game i receive a boner
recommended
having never played the original dota or league of legends i happened upon this game in my library and was originally going to just ignore it and play tf2 however i decided to install it and give it a trywell needless to say im hooked this is easily one of the most awesome strategic games out there the fact that valve took it over and made it incredibly similar to tf2 backpack cosmetic items using item rarities from tf2 such as strange genuine unusual vintagewell i dont pay much attention to that stuff because i get so easily lost in gameplay and completely forget about hats hats hats the inclusion of the ability to watch live tournaments is just plain awesome and its the type of thing i would normally avoid but i find myself unable to stop watching live tourneys just to see what the pros do so i can hopefully pick up some skills myself if i had to give anyone three words of advice those words would be play this game
recommended
amazing beats any moba

great game for friends to play  its free with many heroes to pick from get it and you wont regret it

this game is amazing dota 2 does great homage to dota 1 in that it hasnt alienated itself from what made the original so fun the game is always evolving which keeps the metagame fresh there are tons of cosmetics and other things now that you can buy trade or get through random drops to show off to your friends did i mention that it is free theres no reason not to play dota 2 unless youre some sort of lolhonsmiteinfinite crisis fanboy to each his own though

did you ever want to learn russian maybe the ancient language of portugese or are you a person who takes joy from their own suffering regardless of the reason you will love dota 2 which combines the fun of a torture apparatus and the educational aspects of rosetta stone 133710 would do the dew again

okay well about two years after my first review i thought it was a good time to revisit this this is by far the bestfree game out therei have spent too much money on tourney tickets and  and any of you losers still playing league of legends really need to take a step back and think about your life are you ever going to take off the training wheels and step up your game probably not because youve become too used to babys first dota and the thought of having access to all the heroes is too daunting and youd rather only have the small pool of free heroes to select from because you dont like having fun and you like spending money on things that should have been free from the start if you dont want to buy cosmetics or tourney tickets then all this game will cost you is your sanity and your faith in the human race 1110 would sacrifice firstborn to continue to play
recommended
very good game will destroy friendship
recommended
free to play this game play now

the best thing about dota 2 is its player vs player action the worst thing about dota 2 is its player vs player interaction all and all great game 1010

great game would recommend to my friends besides the fact that its freetoplay getting your friends to play or making new friends is key unless you want to be stuck with annoying players who kick you for being insolent anyways the community is far from perfect but it isnt downright horrible either it is in my opinion pretty decent to say the least 1110 stole my friends life and my life he spent over a lot on this game
recommended
here a list of what benefit you would get while playing dote2  made you realise that the term teamwork is literally just a 8 letter words learn different language with each matchs play up to 9 language pergame the most recommended language learning tools a best way if you have too much friends and want to lose some just invite them playing together for 1 match guaranted get abused by a totally stranger and learn how to abuse them too give you a dream about startin a digital sport proteam yeah go on assemble your team and start feedinerr i mean practicing today 1110 would play again oh did i mention that this is also report simulator  ps  mid or feed
recommended
it started with an innocent how to play video then a few more matches then a few more and then a blur and i suddenly have 139 hours logged in a months time i think i am starting to look like lifestealer from all the time i have spent slouched over playing this game 1010 would play again
recommended
i do not want to be a troll but recently i have left behind lol to start playing dota2 and i do not regret this decision since it has more indepth at every fight when compared to lol sure the community seems a bit more toxic then lols but i can get used to it since all the time i do not write in chat and mute the flamers and wannabes playing with friends its more fun then alone and more rewarding especially the events or being in a team one thing i do not like about the game is the cost of the skins and items for the events they are way to pricey but on the other hand there is always discounts at the shop to mention that the graphics are amazing and optimized since it is running on the source engine see you on the battlefield champion ps if you want to do solo rankings prepare to learn russian and how to delete dota from steam do that at your own risk but i strongly suggest playing with friends
recommended
yes this is the best game ever
recommended
its good but it takes forever to get good at it ps if your not good at it the good player will just report you because there s so its a good game but the community is your welcome
recommended
alright so when i first got the game i thought cool but now everytime im not playing it my computer starts showing me pictures of hitler spams the  sound and keeps opening and closing the disc tray if im not ingame 60000006000000
recommended
litterally the best game ever thats all i need to say
recommended
if you want a game where you can organize fights and win 100% of the time with strangers this is not for you aside from the constant trash talk and a very long losing streak it is quite and enjoyable game for the first hundred games you will probably the feeder or the one everyone wants to pass the blame on but as you get past that you either play your role to win or lose want to learn some basic russian or perhaps some random language you never even heard of before this is the game you komrad oh yes you can always report random people for absolutely no reason lol

dota 2 is a multiplayer online game in develop by valve corporation and the stand alone version of defense of the ancient mod on warcraft 3 reign of chaos and warcraft 3 the frozen throne  dota 2 officially announced on october 13 2010 at the time of people who can play dota 2 is limited only certain people are getting special rights of the developer and distributor dota 2 was not like other online games that bermode click and play dota 2 requires another program to be patchernya namely steam the purpose of dota 2 is destroying ancient opponents protected by other players here players will choose one of 98 heroes that exist each hero has different abilities and strengths this is what makes dota 2 stressful as a realtime strategy game players are required to be able to decide the action as soon as possible if you do not want to die or lose gameplay gameplay of dota 2 is a combination of realtime strategy with topdown perspective and also systemlevel and system equipment adapted from roleplaying game  the game is divided into two teams the radiant and the dire each team has a hero respectively with their respective strengths but the player can determine the game mode to be played so that the players can use the radiant team the hero of the dire team and vice versa players are required to quickly determine the action to be performed when pressed otherwise the player will die and will provide benefits to the hero who killed him the more kills the player is getting rich and vice versa the more killed players will lack the gold so it can not upgrade the item itself dota 2 is a team game not a solo game because if you want to solo do not play dota go play chess therefore its useless if only one hero who has a hero equip decent but the other does not the team will definitely lose this game teaches us that we can not stand alone without the help of others especially the help from our friends players type server dota 2 in southeast asia people are always calling other people as pinoy pinoy is slang for the philippines for unknown reasons why if you have people like this in the game so if something goes wrong then you will be called pinoy by this person no matter where you come from countries such as indonesia malaysia or singapore you will still be called pinoy such people will assume pinoy is a person who can not play the game without seeing meraka national origin people who are considered by the other players as pinoy it does not matter if youre filipino or not if you make a mistake then you will automatically be pinoy this may not be too offended if the person who made a mistake is the philippines although the philippines has a bad reputation in dota 2 but not all filipinos will admit it filipino nationalists are people who if they were heckled by pinoy call then they will become more aggressive so i think you should focus on their mistakes rather than calling him pinoy people who do crowing bottle selfishly until the end of the game bottle crowing is a technique used to increase the survivability especially in the middle lane and it was fine that is not cool is to do it at the extreme stage do you have to be selfish bottle crowing from the beginning to the end of the game why although the role of support you are you realize that i also need a courier for example for the wards do you realize that there are 4 other people who also need their items if you make the team overwhelmed just because you need a bottle crowing to survive until the end of the game then i think you should review again the way you play this game people from europe or north america who complain about lag no such thing as dedicated servers i know it but sooner or later you will meet the person who decided to play the game on the server that is located in another part of the earth it is not wrong because the rules do not prohibit it i even tried to queuing at the european servers to play with friends there but if you experience lag during play because choosing a server far away there then stop complaining or worse pause hoping lagnya lost people who pretend to be someone singapore or malaysia with the purpose of pretending to be a person of singapore or malaysia people like this will continue to add le or la every time he says something and i mean absolutely everything top la b la nice la ggwp la how do i know that there are people who pretend to be like this because i know some of them why do they do it i do not know for sure if they want to retrace the footsteps of daryl iceiceice cai yee koh or mushi then they need to be more than just wearing this access people pinoy im actually not sure whether to be a player from the philippines could fall into this category but if you think about it i have never heard of the other players in southeast asia servers invoked with the country of origin besides pinoy this may be because the pinoy has a way of unique in the play and act in pubs it all comes back to you to consider whether the pinoy is a bad player or not but the bright side is they are quite creative in play dota they just need guidance in the right direction and sometimes a reality punch when pinoypride syndrome relapse pinoy doto best doto this review translatable in google translate

dota 2 defence of the ancients 2 is a tactical game that requires alot of time and patience in order to be good in dota 2 or just enjoy it you need time and determination because this game requires skill that you need to learn i personally think this game requires more skill than lol but games arent always about skill  for me it took me roughly 100 hours of gaming to start enjoying this game which is roughly 200 games because each game is 3555 minutes so if you play dota 2 for the first 3 hours and think this is utter  then i wouldnt blame you because you dont understand how to play still the positives of this game a good to improve your leadership skills a good way to make new friends or something you can do with your current friends a great start of thinking tactically a way just to kill time the negatives of this game a lot of time will go out the window people will annoy you known as feeders or just new players can be reptetive at times if you play the same hero over and over again unbalanced characters everywhere servers will put you with better players for me dota 2 is my favourite game at the moment so it may change my views for the game the teamwork in this game is crucial and ive said it before but the time you use on this game will never return to you overall tactical game for gamers with patience i rate 710

its dota its cant be good

awesome gameplay great graphics great sound acting if your a moba fan this is definetly worth the shot the onyl sidetrack of the game is the players if your playing this make sure your prepared to get insulted trashtalked and verbally abused by anyone either by your teamates and enemiesonce you get the hang of the game youll get hooked warning  extremly addictive so if your a student either a high school or college student make sure to play it moderately or just to past the time playing in subsequent amount of time will destroy your lifedota is both a game and a destroyer of a life of an individiual

overview i would like to start by recommending this game i think everyone should try this game for at least a game or two online before deveoping opinions for this game next i would say that dota 2s not easy to get into i admit but once you start to do well on your own you feel like youve actually acomplished something and that in itself makes you continue playing also i will use some terms you may not be familiar with itll take too long to explain them so find out for yourself gameplaygame mechanics dota 2 has one of the largest learning curves i have ever encountered ive played may games before which i was able to pick up pretty easily but dotas curve is disgustingly huge i have friends who have played lol for quite a long time  so theyre familiar with how mobas work  but when i introduced them to dota they honestly didnt know what was going on im not being rude to lol or the community but thats just how it was from a basic level there is as much going on in dota compared to any other moba however when looking how the game mechanics work one can see that there is a lot more the more notable game mechanics are denying destructible trees evnironement day and night cycle and highground and lowground i wont go into any detail with them but just those mechanics are enough to separate dota from the other mobas with 108 heroes and counting in the total hero pool there is so much veriety to pick from all heroes are unlocked straight away which i consider better than having to unlock heroes after playing for a certain time others may disagree with this saying that you work towards something when trying to unlock heroes but i say being able to handle the difficulty of certain heroes is when you feel a sense of achievement plus other mobas can just buy the locked heroes which defeats the whole point of that argument heroes like meepo rubick invoker earth spirit require considerable skill to be able to play which you work towards by playing other heroes first in the buildup gameplay itself will go from fastpaced action in teamfights  to slow cautious waiting sometimes strategic waiting sometimes not waiting for the next pickoff or teamfight without being too reckless games can be as short as 20 minutes thats quick in this genre to as long as a whole hour sometimes games can extend to over 1 12 hours just because its a stalemate because of this excitement will be a rollercoaster it can be extremely fun or painfully boring though the lows shouldnt put you off can a game really be fun all the time a major patch gets released every season or so which contains massive balance changes alterations to gameplay and possibly a new hero this way gameplay barely becomes stale and provides you with a reason to logon to steam and launch dota 2 when you are bored there is one problem when getting into this game the tutorial at best itll teach the basic mechanics of this game at best the game will force you to play the tutorial depending on what options you choose when the game first asks you if you have any experience with the genre oh god the tutorial is so boring that it cany throw you off playing completely not only that it doesnt represent the actual game until you play a limited heroes game against bots and even that can be mindnumbing because youre not playing against real people when the fun starts if you take this review to mind when you start playing please endure the tutorial until you actually play online withagainst real players matchmaking matchmaking has been improved over time with more language preferences and stricter rule on bad conduct matchmaking is very slowly reaching the point where you will search for a game and actually find people with similar experience to youyour party whom also speak the same language and have relatively low ping however this does not stop people from other countries who do not speak english search with english checked as a language preference and europe west as their their desired server what im tring to say is that russians queue on english speaking servers when they cant even speak english i would have no problem if they do actually speak english and if they werent so foul mouthed but when i have no idea what they are saying it really hinders teamwork a couple of russians explained why they search on eu west servers because the ping was lower thats fair enough i dont mind that they speak english but for those who dont they cant seem to turn off the english language preference if they turn off the preference and search on eu west theyll be matched with other russianspeaking players problem solved no players many players will cooperate when playing as it is a team game however many will not this game is so diverse that everyone has therr own way of playing it which can sometimes conflict with how you want to play dont be surprised when you somehow end up in an argument with a stranger just because they disagree with the slightest thing you think about a game which has no impact on your life whatsoever those of you may be thinking that will never happen to me111 xd youre wrong your online numeric skill matchmaking rating mmr will determine the likelyhood of you running into these people higher  less likely lower  more likely note mmr is independent between ranked and nonranked when getting your ranked mmr it uses you invisible nonranked mmr but after the first game they become seperate values community the dota community is mixed between people like me who want to happily play the game and trolls i understand that there will be trolls in every community but its quite severe in this one its not that they are the majority infact quite the opposite but they do stain the community the colour of cancer yellowgreen which as a whole may ruin the experience for some by playing dota 2 you automatically become part of its community you you either make the most of it or gtfo one positive thing about the community is that its filled with amazing designers who frequently submit there work may it be cosemtics or art to the steam community page and on websites like reddit this game actually provides revenue to designers who get there work added ingame and the community get a say into what gets added also the community is generally helpful when you need it making guidesbuilds answering peoples questions spamming rvolvo around diretide cancelled last year c  so be sure to count on people when you need the extra support [h1]final notes[h1] overall dota 2 is a really good game my game time speaks for itself but its no where near perfect the whole game is a rollercoaster  with so many highs and numerous lows  its a game you would have to experience yourself please do not lauch it with the attitude ive played other mobas it will be the same becuase youll be caught offguard good luck and have fun ratings gameplay game mechanics matchmaking sense of achievement hats community players matchmaking learning curve tutorial depends on your mmr matchmaking will put you with other people with similar skill and experience to you but there isnt a working filter for people who dont speak your desired language 910 when you really get into it 710 any casual dota player there is no such thing as a casual dota player 510 if you never have a good game note 34your score if youre antisocial and play without friends note 12your score if you cant stand the community but still want to play other review 1010 would feed again

all of which makes dota 2 an absurd video game to try to recommend being the largest and most immediately open moba with valve showcasing its talent for rewarding and fostering a community it demands and offers more than literally any game i can think of its almost more comparable to basketball than most commercial games something utterly opaque bearing no endgame but that could happily fill every waking second of your life

dota 2 is mastered by asians and russians league of legends is mastered by americans and japanese dota 2 offers you a challenge and teaches you that patience and cunning pays off league of legends offers you relaxation and teaches you that you should be eager swift and dont care about mana management dota 2 offers you the enjoyable experience of justified racism watch as minorities are living up to their infamy league of legends offers you the enjoyable experience of playing with casuals with no concern for their team and the game  anger issue underage players as a bonus dota 2 offers you a large roster of free heroes with a nice overall design and a fair amount of female characters league of legends offers you better artwork than better graphics with a paid roster of overdesigned heroes that makes it look like an allstar fighter game also with more sellout boobs and more fanmade porn dota 2 offers you height vision unforgiving death penalties buyback fortification daynight cycle that affects gameplay all chat a state of the art replay system over a 100 items with various active effects and more league of legends offers you [blah blah blah variety blah blah fun stuff] yes league of legends is more popular than dota 2 is what youre gonna say does it make it the best game no because if i followed your logic then candy crush saga & flappy bird are the best games ever or call of duty is better than battlefield rust is better than dayz counterstrike is better than insurgency team fortress 2 is better than oh  this one anyways its a breeding ground for casuals who cant handle frustration and competitiveness in videogames anyways pick your poison dota or lol

dota is a strategy game about choices who to pick what to buy who to kill where to defend what to do and you do all of this within a 2060 minute session depending on how well or poorly youve chosen but even in overwhelming odds theres still a chance to make a comeback if you play it right and capitalize on mistakes this keeps the games tense and exciting it takes hundreds of hours to learn the details of the game mechanics thousands to master them the premise is simple and tutorials guide you through it explaining it in a reviewrecommendation isnt going to help you more than experiencing it would so telling you just to play it is the best thing to do dota is time well spent and item drops can make it worthwhile for your steam wallet check the market items theres no reason not to find out what the buzz is all about just remember that 100 hours is about the time itll take you to learn the basics comfortably its similar with counter strike where thats around the time when you learn its not codbf so try not to say its too complicated before that point or youre going to miss out on your new favorite game

an excellent alternative to rosetta stone during your first 100 hours you can expect to learn how to communciate with and insult people in multiple different languages including  but not limited to  russian  brazilian cala bocaaaa and multiple chinese dialects  if you enjoy playing games that rely heavily on communication with people who dont speak a word of english noop despite selecting us east south america north or us west russia east as their prefered server then dota is the game for you the learning curve is steep so make sure not to give up if you dont do well during your first few games improve quickly by selecting a hero by slamming your face into the keyboard calling mid lane and using all your spells to quickly kill the creep dont forget that you can buy kitty ears from the ingame store to make your favorite character look cuter and give the illusion that you are good at the game

recomended game from next warcraft

best to download it and start playing its a addicting game and very challenging my advice for all players who want to win in this game is to have a good team that you can depend on so best to create your own team than joining random players from other countries that you cant understand what their saying

the best free to play game out there 170 hrs in and still going strong the pvp and tactical elements will keep you coming back take things with a pinch of salt for your first 510 hours expect to loose a lot things will get better as you learn the mechanics there are 100 heroes after all

what can i say about dota 2 well to be honest it is a fantastic game that really captivates you once you start playing it the community is so friendly especially peruvians and russians who are really welcoming and friendly they really make you feel at home when you play dota dont get me wrong its not just peru and russia that have such good communties there are plenty of north americans and europeans who are also so kind and generous of course though as with any game with millions of players there are a small minority who are bad for the community these players infrequently say phrases such as gl hf nice dont worry we can still win everyone makes mistakes etc such players really drag the dota community down and turn it into a terrible place however the amount of  and  makes up for these bad mannered people overall i would really recommend this game due to its engrossing gameplay and especially due to the nice natured community that plays it

well i decided to do this review again after playing it a bit more and trying to do a good review to get things started i will go ahead and name the categories i am basing my review on lore gameplay community and the overall judgement lore when i am talking about lore i mean development and actual game lore the development lore is that there once was a game called warcraft 3 which was a very good rts game soon an expansion pack came this expansion gave way to a modder that would create defence of the ancients the mod took over the warcraft community like a wild fire and got popular the way the mod was played was similar to that of a star craft map type soon this mod took its own community that would balance out the characters and give voting on new characters that are known as heroes soon the reign were handed over and over and over again to different people until it was handed to a person whose username is icefrog icefrog is still the current owner of the original dota mod the original mod makers went on to make the other games in the arts yes that is the genre name not moba genre such as lol and hon icefrog was approached by valve to making a sequel with a full team icefrog agreed and here we are now actual game lore the lore of this game is quite deceptive each of the characters has their own backstory and most of them dont seem intertwined but when you read them carefully you can see the connections but the centralised lore is that two beings fought each other until they were casted into a rock floating into space orbiting a planet to that planet the rock would be known as the mad moon the two beings cracked out of the rock but pieces of it scattered all over the planet making the inhabitants grow strange power they felt allegiance to the rock that gave them power and they decided to destroy the other rock the war of the ancients has begun rating it has a solid lore if you have the time to make the connections yourself it is quite a good read for some anyway 455 gameplay with the war of the ancients the goal of each match is to destroy the others ancient seems simple right wrong on so many levels the gameplay videos by the pros make it look extra deceiving by making it look like attack tower until it falls then run back kill some enemies etc etc however there is quite a lot of strategy when it comes to it even the before the match begins there is strategy dota to me is like an advanced game of rockpaperscissors if it had over one hundred and thirty different options to choose from one character counters this one but at the same time this one counters this and so forth so when the game actually starts roles start coming into play i am not going to list every role just some key ones carry your bulldozer your team fight winner your you get the idea these guys can turn the tide of battle quite easily if they get a good early game they suck early but get better and better as the game progresses support these guys keep your carry alive and well for them to start owning the other team usually these guys have high damage nukes that can decimate the enemy carry jungler these guys can be both of the above roles depends on what their strength is so that is just the picking phase everything in it has a strategy your items choice your lane the map is split in three different lanes and hell even the place you stand determines how a battle will play out sure there are varying degrees of difficulty between heroes and their roles and game style change between each other but the phrase of dota still stands getting the basics is not the problem it is climbing the hill of experience so in a nutshell this game will provide great experience for those looking for a challenge 55 community if there was a breaking point for game it is its community let me just say this all arts communities are crap absolute crap there are your ragers elitists noobs dumb arses whiny kids etc this community has a lot to offer i will not deny that parts of the community are creative and friendly as hell however the general community is absolute scum one little mistake could set them off that is in the regular match making let alone lpq low priority queue aka the  pool all in all the community does have its diamonds but it is mostly  25 over all opinion great game play interesting lore but semi hole of a community 11515

dota 2 is the most enjoyable and entertaining strategy game i have ever played the amount of countless heroes  100 the items and trading the modes  all pick single draft mid only ability draft hiliarous captains pick and a bunch more the graphics are realistic and persuading the strategy is really very nice complex and nicely frustrating if you catch my drift i would recommend some videos on how to play dota 2 due to its learning curve and dont abandon any matches yes dota 2 strengthens your teamwork with people throughout the world youd be amazed on how many people are dedicated and love to be serious and fun with dota abandoning causes your teammates to hate you and you will receive low priority matches which higher your match finding time and you do not receive battle points if you havent already check out free to play a movie on steam about dedicated players going for the 16 million usd dollarinos with really inspirational content pick up defence of the ancient on steam for free mac and windows and enjoy people saying things not word for word just what i remember the first couple of months during dota 2 will be a ride of hell  some guy on the internet which i have forgotten the way i would describe dota would be a cross between chess and soccer or football you get your team to the other side and win  this dude who says stuff in free to play the inspirational movie which i mentioned earlier best game ive ever played no joke

oh man dota 2 dont get me wrong here at the negative review hear me out first i say with confidence that dota 2 is an addicting moba game with great gameplay and fun then why the negative review you say well for one the community is scarcely better than russia under stalin if you play on any server you must be 100% prepared for racism s jerks and 12 year olds not only that but even if you put your language preference as english half the players you play with are obnoxious peruvians this does not make the game unplayable but can seriously  you off if you have played this game as long or longer than me you will understand this another bad thing is that i would willingly compare playing this game to a adrug addiction you literally cant stop playing it when you start and when life interrupts you you will start to think dota 2 is more important that my friends is when you quit the game i had to wean myself off of it for like weeks until i couldnt stand looking at the icon anymore needless to say i uninstalled my advice for new playes get a friend to play it with you and dont become addicted that is all

dota 2 is a similar game to league of legends with some differences that make both of them unique like how you can get couriers and have access to secret shops in dota while in lol there are summoner spells and masteries however this is a review about dota and what the game is about not a comparison about these 2 games dota is a moba game multiplayer online battle arena in which you are place in a team of 5 players to go against another team of 5 players with one main object which is to obliterate the enemies towers barracks and finally their ancient all of you start at level 1 and all of you have to destroy anything in your path while trying to not have any casualties along the way since the enemy who just killed you will gain lots of exp as well as some gold as simple as it looks its not as that there are many ways that your opponent can stop you from progressing like the occasional ganks that happen from time to time aside from the basics of dota the game is really fununless theres that sshole thatll keep calling you a noob or if theres that player that dies intentionally but other then that the graphics are good controls are easy and overall the gameplay is great so go on and download dota and have fun

ive been playing dota since dota 1 came up a decade ago in dota 2 the game mechanic is quite balanced every hero has its own strengths and weaknesses just like in the previous one definitely not a p2w kind of game however the solo mmr pairing is really awful i dropped from 3k to 2k in just a week and forever stuck in this level no matter how hard i play heres a few suggestions that i could think of they should also consider hours of playing and kda ratio instead of just mmr level to balance the pairing players who got into low priority should get more severe punishment eg longer period and add extra requirements to get away from low priority so they would think twice before they trashtalk and not obidient at this rate a skill in par with ti players is the only way to break out unfortunately you need to play a lot to get there if youre really lucky you could be paired with decent players and thats a one big if a casual gamer like me has no place in this game

edit 1 of course you would nerf wisps stun to slow yes because io is the hero who is totally op in every single game you play its not huskar its not pa its not sniper who need to be nerfed if that should be necessary at all never would such idiocy even slightly tickle my ans now that io finally recieved a more or less reasonable skillset dota 2 is the most balanced game in the whole universe edit 2 hey icefrog i came up with a totally cool idea but first let me lay down to problem for you you know all these poor people who only want to pick and play their totally imbalanced heroes they actually have to go through loads of serious trouble believe me until they can finally become overpowered beyond reason   that sucks so why on earth not provide them with a bit of a starting bonus right look at poor old huskar for example a possible maximum of 98% magic resistance so if i may ask you dear developers how to make up for those missing 2% heres where my idea comes into play why not just give huskar a set of six hearts before start so he can casually drain away half of his enemies health with one single burning spear at lv1 but this time without having to worry about maybe loosing an eighth of his own etc 010 worse than league of legends disclaimer review suitable for pub scrubs only not suitable for players of mmr >1000

so far the most competitive i have ever become in my life since tf2 and css great place to play and have fun but you have to be strong cuz many people will get angry if you end up dying a lot just say what the problem is and they might understand say that you are new or bad do not forget at all costs to say that you are new best case scenario is that they like you and are forgiving gl hf d

riot first game launches their company straight to moon with theyre fantastical sequal to legends of newerth to conquer the gaming industry  everyone go 5v5 n control a hero expect for meepo because he become not 1 not 2 not 3 but 4 except agh then not 1 not 2 not 3 not 4 but 5 hero  other than that there are many different forces involve to defend the ancient which is name of game but does not make sense because the aim of game is to destroy the ancient maybe dota 2 stand for destroy of the ancient 2 because icefrog made mistake on warcraft 3 overall riot has done well to please every player imaginable to cannibal naix drunk  pandaeren brewmaster fem dom  queen of pain  alchemists  alchemist  samurai  juggernaut   night stalker  uni professor  rubick  father of zyzz  zeus  ttrolls  troll warlod n many more no discriminatio in this game because every race species continent is embraced to play destry the ancient even in the game there is combo of riverr forest and dead landif you came from neopets then i would strngly recommend to play this because yo can buy your own coureir and upgrade it with red bull the community in dota 2 is very great too because eveyrone is always friendly teamwork leadership and forgiving 1010 would play again with rednecks

poorly balanced lots of rng like runes and skills with chances to do certain things heros that are clearly op and yet somehow the developers icefrog and co thinks are balanced then you have the childish community who i dont have enough reports in the world for much more frustrating and emotionally taxing then any other game ive played its really not worth it just go play something else not to mention the new ranked matchmaking which is just a glorified pub with numbers attached to it its no different and you will get russians and  teammates as usual the game is  plain and simple

dota 2 has a horrible community that makes the game far less enjoyable than it could be new players are turned away because of this and older players have a worse time leading to further negativity towards other players the graphics arent the worst but they arent that good for a game that thrives on detailed teamplay and champion strategies it stunts the potential the only reason this game could be considered as more difficult than other games in this genre would be the graphics and lingering hero gameplay the graphics make it difficult to see what exactly is going on and doesnt get much easier as you progress pretty much every hero has at least one ability that will rootstunslow ect for around 4 seconds when a game has that kind of kill security it doesnt matter if the champions are balanced ive played many other game in this genre and they were all much more enjoyable than dota 2 when i first played a game or two it was extremely easy compared to league of legends or other similar games it may be more difficult to see whats going on but the spells are so overpowered on all the heroes that it was easy coming from game that have underpowered spells the worst thing about dota 2 would be the item system that has been implemented its just ridiculous how its not user friendly at all this game has such a bad ingame and community experience that players uninstall it after playing 13 matchesat me after 1000 matchesit was just sadim ing done with this game 610 edit ok ok i cant stop play it xd

well i liked this game a long time ago when you could play a normal game here and there nowadays the only people you meet are russians mexicans and other things that can hardly be described as human as they do not seem posess humanlike inteligence the best part is they do play on european serversmexicans tend to invade us and wish to teach you their holy language in which every sentence seems to beginn with suka blyatdunno about the mexicans though they might as well speak burrito if you have low blood pressure and like the company of mentally chalaged people without the paper that would confirm this feel free to download this game oh almost forgot to mention that each new patch uses to add new bugs and overpowered heroes get even more powerful over time bless lord gaben and his minions for bringing us this gem hl3 confirmed

league of flamers served no less as mere training for dota 2 which holds in my opinion the state of best mobaartsasss call it however you want around no need to pay for heroes or powerups no need to grind levels to be able to jungle no need to pay for cosmetics i can earn them while playing and i can learn russian free of charge the essence and magic of dota combined with the powerful source engine and wrapped up in an userfriendly package with valve quality finition icing on the cake  the only moba around playable offline and bots arent exactly dummies

so some time ago i was hanging out with this girl from my new volleyball team it was during practice break and we were eating at this awesome salad bar in sm tarlac anyway i ordered a veggie burger and she had 3 three servings of some leafy salad it was like a bush decided to grow on her plate she had a very very large order and i was surprised that she finished it her plate was clean after she was done so anyway we went back to the gym for the next practice session i didnt play because i knew better than to move around with a full stomach but this other girl the one i had a meal with volunteered for the lineup i mean geez you just ate a tree maybe you should get some rest first so yeah during the game someone from the other team made a spike and the ball hit my plant devouring friend in the stomach she dropped down and curled and she was turning pale all over and she vomitted lots and lots of vomit it was like her mouth was a sewege system and nasty things were just coming out of it i looked at the puddle and i saw something orange i think it was a semidigested carrot but whatevs but anyway everyone went to help her but i was just staring at the vile concoction at the floor and it reminded me of something it reminded me of dota

dota 2 can be a very hard game to get into as the skill ceiling is incredibly high in essence the game is a 5v5 were you divide your team between 3 lanes and a possible jungle winning requires a combination of good team mates knowledge of the game and its mechanics and a healthy dose of luck the community for dota can be very toxic at times and most people will not hesitate to tell you what you have done wrong and how they are amazing players but if you can push past that the game is a lot of fun to get into trying new builds and tactics and if you get can get a group of friends to remove the chance of getting any random players then its all the better if you do not know how the game works id suggest watching a few videos and reading some guides to make your first few games less painful the guide i would suggest is httpwwwpurgegamerscomwelcometodotayousuck he does a great job of explaining everything you need to know and has a video archive of himself playing and improving on heros as i say the game can be hard to get into but if you can push past the ability requirements and the occasional  on your team you will not regret spending the next 23 thousand hours kicking

dota 2 is a learning game its a game about how good you are relatively everyone is terrible at dota you cant help it all that matter is how good you are relative to how good your enemy is i like dota because it keeps me saying stuff like wait that can happen and oh thats how that works on a daily baisis theres always more to learn the complexity of this game is so deep that you cant possibly expect to know all there is to know you will never come across the same scenario twice maybe the same team oor enemy team but never the same items gold skill levels couldowns mana and health levels etc the point is dota 2 is a game that you play to have fun and just because youre not as good as youd like to be doesnt mean youre not good at dota thank you three lane highway for insight into what kind of a game dota 2 really is

the game is great except that the game rapidly snowballs into an unwinnable position if you get off to a bad start and they brutally punish you if you leave before the game is over even if its the 20 minute mark your team has died 40 times and your opponents are all untouched you just have to pretend youre still playing until your opponents decide to end it which theyll often hesitate to do opting instead to spend 30 more minutes taunting and toying with you

as you begin to play this gameyoure given a tutorial on how the gameplay works as you finish completing the tutorial you would have options to either play with bots or with online players there is a wide variety of modes to choose from all of the heroes are unlocked from the start so you dont have to unlock them one by one like any other moba game each heroes have their own specific roles so choose wisely and dont anyhow go whatever you feel like there is no ingame money in this game and you earned different rewards as you play many matches there is a lore for you to read for each character if youre interested however these game have a steep leaning curve and those who are new to moba genre will struggle how the gameplay system work it require a lot of tactics & teamwork in order to win a matchthat is if your partner will listen to you cause a lot of player i found will quickly rage at you if you make a minor issue while some other just rage quit because they felt like they cannot make a comeback a lot of heroes are memorable mainly because sometimes you would see those heroes interact with one another depending if they are rival or allied

dota 2 is one of the most anticipated game that every player has been waiting for and its been a year has past since this game has been released after the test but now let me review this game with the exception of the graphics gameplay the gameplay is kinda sluggish at times especially if your internet has a very low signal but lets face it even though the game is bad sometimes due to your slow connection it can still carries some of the game if the net returns to its original state but if you have a very tough time fighting with the connection until you got the highest ping point for those who didnt know a kind of signal detector use to check the signal if the ping is too high lag can occur and can result a very bad reputation to your signal and if the ping is too low no lags can occur and the gameplay runs smoothly a disconnection will occur and it will gave you a low priority to your gaming record it is indeed bad though but if you have a good to better connection the game can responds the latest gameplay itself but watch out if your opponents hero kills your hero due to your slow web connection it can make you frustrating so fix your internet connection right away soundtrack nope i dont like it sorry community okay this is the most interesting part like for example you went home to play dota 2 after a rough time working in the office then when you hero dies due to your opponents will after you play for a few minutes a teammate of yours suddenly replied to you as a noob or any other kinds of bad words from any of your teammates or your opponents and then you felt bad after you do that thats my review on the community in dota 2 i mean let face it even though the game is good the community on the other hand is bad due to its nature and instead of respecting one another they just saying the things that they wanted to say just like youre at school and you got your self punkd at the middle of the school grounds in front of dozens of people so if you saw anything innapropriate you must report them immidiately but even though you report them is it enough to play this game just for fun after what happened well the judge is yours heroes ive saw a lot of dota heroes in dota 2 with only a few of them is missing like the pit lord but i wish they could do some solution in order to solve this lack of heroes and to make the game more cooler add more heroes with some original skills to make the game more worthful to play maps okay i know the original map is still great but can we at least add some mid wars or any kinds of maps i mean for me the map is already overated and boring to me final review the game is a must play to all dota gamers but its up to you if the game is kinda sick or totally repetative its your decision but for me i like how this game works and it introuduces some of its core of the game so my final verdict for this game dota 2 is a 710 it a great game but if they do some adjustment for some dota newbies at the community booth with some addons i could almost rate this a 9 but 7 is enough and the game is very tense though but dont be mad at me guys its just my opinion and thats all

dota 2 is just the best game ive ever had
recommended
got friend a who is a a and shouting like a a and he was like noob teammates but guess what he is the noob in the team totally worth it
recommended
the game was good but since the oracle update i no longer could play it in offline mode ever since that i dont appreciate this game as much as i did before the update
recommended
ive played dota on and off since the map mod in warcraft iii and if theres a game i find myself always coming back to its dota you just cant beat the variety of play theres a lot of strategy and lots to think about in real time theres over 100 heroes each hero has unique abilities each hero can have numerous item builds lots of possibilities here the other thing that keeps my attention is i can have a full game start to finish often in under 1 hour you know youll either win or lose in the next hour and the tides can turn at any point ive had games where we destroyed the other teams ancients defense towers and barracks causing the mega creep spawns only to have them come back and win the game dota is a game that requires some time spent learning to play before you can really appreciate it but its worth the investment its a nice jump in jump out game that you can play with friends often only waiting in queue a minute or two between matches valve really maintained the original feel that i remember and continue to provide regular updates a big plus is that i havent seen any cheating which is rare these days for online games and this game is free
recommended
great game not the best community but the team expereince is quite unique to this genre the game types are fun and often times even if you lose if you enjoyed trying a hero its worth trying again it has allot of complexity but is slowly getting better at introducing people take your time with it and youll come to enjoy how broad the roster of fun heroes to try
recommended

things ive learned in dota 2 russians do not cooperate and go off to do their own thing if they fail theyll yell out  full comprehension of dota players languages including portuguese spanish russian and rarely french if your ping is over 100ms dont expect to make plays playing for extended sessions will make you wonder why you dont have real friends youll go through many emotions mid or feed destroyed my social life 1010 would play again

dota defence of the ancients a game of strategy this game revolves around one team trying to destroy another teams ancient to do that players must destroy towers in corresponding order the game consists of 107 heroes currently there are still 5 more heroes to be developed 112 heroes just incase you forgot how to math this game is also free so why not give it a try ofcourse there is a shop in which you buy vanities for heroes loading screens renaming tools and various items

althou valve sucks i love dota its a fun game to play with friends if u have your team
recommended
honest review this game is a huge headache ive been playing mobas for over 12 years you want to progress without a team prepare to be at the fate of people that do not want to play as a team game this game is meant to be a team game the team idea of this game is for your entire team to pick a  carry  most cases a hero that can last the length of a game and skills scale very well hence everyone wanting to play this type of hero then you have support which i really do not mind playing as well as long as we are a team nope be prepared to be faustrated to the point of no return i have uninstalled this game as i can truly see no positive coming from this game people are rude the team play is near non existent unless you are on a team and everyone wants to have the score despite no record keeping being held on the game yes it is easier to potty train your children then to progress past a point in this game then if you make mistakes instead of being coached you get bashed on continuesly until your spirit is not even in the game no more yes potty training is not fun but at least your kids arent bashing you continuesly while your coaching them to aim their skills correctly soapbox out and ive uninstalled this trainwreck for the last time thank you valve for bringing premium entertainment at no cost but i think i would rather be in the bathroom at this point at least everyone there speaks english edit 12242014 the matchmaking is tons better most of the time you get a team that wants to win but on occaision it can be a drain to be in a game
recommended
i suck at this game but i still play it because its fun
recommended
the worst and best game on the world at the same time
recommended
may or may not consume your life 
recommended
got called a pubescent  by a guy and his friends later he added me then he 1v1 me and destroyed my  after that i got reported by the guys 1210 would get rekt again
recommended
its a moba  so far i have played hon league and dota 2 and as of this point this one is my favorite the user interface is visually pleasing and easy to use you have acess to all heros right out of the gate so you dont need to purchase them like in league theres still an insane learning curve if you are new to mobas expect to suck if you are new great when played with friends this game is always worth a try all of them are really theyre free
recommended
1 top game
recommended
its a very good game because there are over 100 heros to play so you will never get bored
recommended
the only game i played everyday the only game i will play for another years in the future the only game that will never uninstalled off my laptop the only game that will still played even after i turn 50 the only game that played by 10 out of 15 pc on internet cafe the only game that wherever we go people will always have knowledge about it the only game that often makes me mad happy envy angry grows at the same time the only game that worth 10000 hours for me to spent to i am loving it dota 2 the game that lives
recommended
do not play this game otherwise your life is condemned 
recommended
the real game ever i play
recommended
graphics are really cool lots of fun to watch id recommend this to everyone
recommended
smooth gameplay for a moba easy to learn you play the same map over and over but each time it feels completely different as different combinaions of ally and enemy heros makes each match unique and fun unfortunately the game has one downfall it is way too addictive and most matches last one hour long  so it is easy to waste days playing dota 2 but it is worth it p
recommended
best game ever trust me you will never get bored out of this one
recommended
the great game

dota 2 free is among that class of games that defines the casual genre easy to play and even easier to get addicted to dota 2 could easily suck up all your time and money if you let it if you want mindless heromatching then look no further
recommended

recommended
overview dota 2 is hands down one of the most challenging games to get in to the sheer amount of items heroes and mechanics can seem extremely overwhelming but dont let this discourage you as one grits their teeth and pushes through they will discover a game rich in content and a game that is very enjoyable to play dota 2 has been one of the most challenging games i have ever played and i find myself drawn back to it often for that very reason this game is not only fun but very satisfying to play esspecially in the team setting what i would like to see despite the recently implemented tutorials the experience for new players can still be very rough i would like to see a more community based introduction to help new players in addition to this i feel like the games interface is filled with hidden bugs that often get ignored in favor of ballance fixes lets see some client fixes bottom line if you want a challenge and can invest some time download dota 2 if you are looking to get into this game but are confused by the game message me and i will help you i love this game kanoobees score 910
recommended
1010 ign rates skyrim with guns
recommended
the most engrossing game i have ever played i started playing the game thinking that i probably wouldnt like it and would stop after a game or two 300 hours later here i am still improving and still learning all the subtleties of the game that only experience can give you a very steep learning curve requires you to play several games before you can even get the basic mechanics down not to mention the hours it will take to learn the nuances of all the heroes and items and how they interact with each other once you can get past the initial wall it is a game that can be played for hours on end and doesnt seem to have an end in sight as its gameplay seemingly will carry on years into the future plus its free so why not
recommended
aaaah this game remember when my brother suggested it to me i said yeah why not ive been playing since last year the game is awesome it has changed a lot since i started playing it if you have or havent ever played a moba before dota is an awesome option a great game to jump in and enjoy

best moba game on the market amazing and mature graphics awesome to play
recommended
dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game let alone feel competent at it but once you start to learn its secrets theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched even by its peers its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes and success is a rush the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all freetoplay games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount may the best team win but at least dota was a worth game to play overall i love it it just a verdict of the game
recommended
nice feed
recommended
didnt get to play much of it but the game itself is alright

this game is a very fun yet compettiive game it encourages teamwork and ive spent many hours playing on this marvelous game 99910 best game ive played in a while however there are some of those people that you just dont want to play with but the game can still be enjoyable and there are those days when you just dont have a good day and your teammates are yelling at you for not doing good you can just ignore those people because they dont know how it feels yet dota 2 is a very good game but can be annoying at times its very fun when youre playing a hero you enjoy
recommended
better than lol
recommended
yes but no russians pls
recommended
the only moba game to play
recommended
strategy team game what a nice game
recommended
dota 2 is one of my favourite games to date why im not sure is it the compelling nature to work as a team the thrill of a victory of the satisfaction of a great gank either way if my play time is to go by anything and its only around a modest 200 hours dota 2 is an engaging and addictive game for anyone that likes teamwork and a tactical moba the graphics are quite decent the sound and character design are solid and the gameplay mechanics fluid best of all its 100% free w the addition of microtransactions to bling out your hero however it can be rage inducing when things arent going your way which can be quite common this usually takes form of players disconnecting or generally being a little stupid ie running into pinch zones but never fear sometimes its all about getting the most enjoyable experience out of a loss you can get that moment the most stupid death becomes the funniest thing youve seen all day to some it might not be a comical death and that is expected when younger players arent quite sure on whats happening but they will soon learn hopefully in addition dota 2 is a free russian speaking class overall dota 2 is a solid moba with great mechanics a wonderful player base and glorious moments 910 would bang
recommended
this game is amazing although this is a free game i have supported it with $30 to the international tournament 55

recommended
its a cool game very fun team game the only down side is that it is hard to learn eg there are so many heroes items etc to learn making dota 2 a hard game to learn you have to be a hardcore gamer to play dota 2
recommended
remember that game where those horrible people pretend not to be russians and then go into an airport and shoot everyone same deal except the horrible people here are pretty bad at disgusing their russianness
recommended
after long time playing dota 1warcraft iii this dota 2 really makes me crazy because you know the graphic animation and all the things here are completely advanced when i try to play dota 1 again it feels like am i play this game before how ugly is itsorry
recommended
trial by fire straight up youre going to learn exceptions to the rule by being killed by them and its going to happen a lot dota is the most brutal learning curve of any game ive ever played sometimes in a welldone fashion sometimes not there are few games where i can honestly say that at 300 hours you have barely any true idea what youre doing amazingly complex game tons of fun especially with friends not a casually oriented game at all but enormously entertaining to play and watch no grind no microtransactions that affect gameplay in any way no outside advantages no premade skills everything happens in game and you need to be quick on your feet try it out just be warned that properly trying it out will take hundreds of hours relax youre doing fine
recommended

recommended
not enough time for accurate review
recommended
for my friends who have not touched this game whether they have heard its  garbage or simply because they just arent interested this review is for you dota 2 is a game of strategy coordination and combat all wrapped up in a letter stating take the enemys ancient before they take yours in this game you and 4 other players choose from over 100 heroes in order to complete the objective while the enemy team does the same each hero is unique and have their strengths and weaknesses after heroes there are another 100 items availible for your heroes to purchase ingame these items can strengthen your hero weaken enemy heroes or provide some kind of utility with such a combination of heroes and items dota expands from what on paper looks like a race into an infinite universe of tactics and teamplay in order to complete that seemingly simple objective  this game is complex you will not understand how the game works on your first try nobody does rather this game is based mainly on knowledge and on the abilty for a team to coorordinate with eachother so as you play research experiment watch others you will grow stronger hell ive spent over 1700 hours playing this game as of writing this review and i still learn i still can improve and i still question i could tell you in depth in how the game works but this is a review not a beginers guide if you are interested i have pasted two links containing guides on dota httpwwwpurgegamerscomwelcometodotayousuckuoqbsoikrie really good explanation of dota really helps a begginer put things into perspective httptwopnavigamingcomendota_2 this contains many guides on mechanics in dota

i like this game cause i love dota  i disliked this game when lagging  and sometimes im dc then i reconnect it becames black screen but i can see may net graph active in console
recommended
great moba the pace is very good and each game is uniqe game takes a while to get repetitive with the versitile heroes theres a crap ton of different game mechanics for players to play with which is good for developing your own style of playing which could be as varied as hell from strategic ganker to dunking duker and teamfight weapon of mass destruction support there is only one map but that shouldnt keep the game from getting old i give it a ten outta ten
recommended
terrible game dont know why youd waste your time on it
recommended
ive played dota 2 since the 3rd quarter of 2012 so ive had it for 2 14 years thats 19710 hours now lets assume youre supposed to have 8 hours of sleep every day so ive been awake supposedly for 13140 hours of that time now further lets assume you go to full time education like i did and spend approximately 4 hours a day in schooluniversity on average that leaves you with 9855 hours so ive had 9855 hours of spare time in the last 2 and a bit years to study get fit get a girlfriend find a job and get successful and this time also includes eating time and laying around doing nothingwatching tv time ive spent 13 of my time playing dota 2 is it an amazing game absolutely if i could go back and decide whether to start playing it hell no about 3k hours in dota 2 and probably about 15k hours in dota if i had done anything productive during that 45k hours i would be pretty rich or happy with my self by now but instead im fat and have no job and got horrible grades in uni so far now that was the disclaimer time to rate the game out of 10 for graphics gameplay storyline replayability and then an overall score mobas are not usually played for graphics so much the main focus of the game is on the actual gameplay but in comparison to the other big moba games dota 2 has quite good graphics if youre looking for a visually amazing game you can spend time on dota 2 might not be the best choice because its not really made for the graphics if you want a moba with good graphics look at smite dawngate or heroes of the storm none of which ive played but their screenshots look like they have slightly better graphics than dota 2 also dota 2 has a few female characters but if your in it for the revealing type images of characters go play league of legends because youre probably gonna never load into a game without seeing bewbs graphics score 710 gameplay dota 2 has amazing gameplay after playing so many times i still feel like theres ever so little more i need to know because gameplay is changed slightly or sometimes vastly by patches the patches are seeming to come more regularly now 2 months in a row with 1 patch per month the skills a dota 2 player needs to learn to be really great can take years and years to get good at reaction time isnt the only important thing but strategy and calculations are important in comparison to lol which is the only other moba i have played dota 2 has significantly more strategy involved in pub games i play lol game where people barely speak or plan out whats going on in dota 2 there are so many tense occasions where you and your team have to roam the map and farm in a group and avoid smoke ganks other gameplay factors which enhance skill required is the timer system of jungle spawns stacking pulling creep blocking denying allied creeps and heroes in some cases and the last most important thing is that whereas in lol where a majority of heroes can solo kill others you need to organise ganks very well with allies to get kills dota 2 takes a while to learn but the satisfaction is everpresent once youve gotten to a certain point gamplay score 1010 storyline the lore in dota was nice to learn about the dota 2 lore is pretty bad and not really linked to the original game valve doesnt release any storyline related videos for dota 2 really the advantage of this is that since the game has source film maker with it i havent used sfm yet a lot of talented people have created sfm videos on youtube which are really enjoyable to watch having said that if you want a game for its story i would not recommend dota 2 for that compared to games like smite and lol the character backgrounds arent really important and many including myself cant be bothered reading the only story in the game is kind of a tutorial form which is nice for new players storyline score 410 replayability this is self explanatory i have spent 45k hour around for this game and dota it is probably one of the most replayable games ever made you will almost never have 2 games with the exact same heroes and team unless maybe in captains mode where you can ban and pick and games can last between 10 mins and 1 and a half hours some are faster or longer but this is the general sweet spot with the average nonabandoned game lasting about 40ish mins replayability score 1010 overall dota 2 lacks a little bit in the story area but this game was not meant for that this game was made for literally endless fun and playing this overall score will not be an average of the other scores but more of the total enjoyability of the game ive been hooked on for the last 7 years overall score 9510 not 1010 because that would imply that its the most perfect game ever created which i still think it could be a little bit better

its great for guys who like to stay at home

addictive with graphics and strategic nature powering up with an enormous community services plus cross gaming culture around the globe where we dont have to group a party up outside to play just a pityful drawback for those with poor internet speed and access will face disturbing laggs and sometimes have to download huge updates to play but its a flagship though way to go dota 2

recommended
approaching 2100 hours playedwow while i do completely agree with the reviews that talk about how bad the community is i have to say my experience of dota on the whole has been very enjoyable the mute option is great i instamute anyone talking crap admittedly dota has an incredibly high learning curve and you will often find high level players playing on noob accounts so even the early matches for new players can be brutal if you can push through the first couple of hundred hours of games  and ignore the torrent of expletives thrown your way when you let the team down you will find dota 2 to be a competitive intense challenging and completely engaging experience
recommended
the most challenging and interesting moba game ever
recommended
fun and interesting game where it test your mentality cooperation and awareness
recommended
best moba ever a little difficult to learn for newcomers but its tutorial is pretty good

dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena game in a threedimensional environment presented from an oblique highangle perspective the player commands one of 109 controllable character heroes each hero begins the match at level one and becomes more powerful by accumulating experience points through combat thereby leveling up to the maximum level of twentyfive with every level gained the player either selects a new ability for their hero to learn or enhance their general statistics each heros method of combat is influenced by its primary property strength agility or intelligence dota 2 features items which the player stores in an inventory these items are acquired predominantly through purchase with gold the ingame currency items vary in function some enhance the statistics of a hero while others grant additional abilities the player automatically receives small increments of gold continuously though they can obtain more by destroying enemies killing nonplayer characters grants gold only to the player who lands the final blow whereas killing enemy heroes grants gold to the players nearby allies as well destroying towers or killing roshan gives gold to all players on the team denying is a feature of the game where players inhibit the enemys ability to accumulate gold and experience by killing an allied unit or destroying an allied structure before the enemy can do so each match of dota 2 takes place on a functionally symmetrical map that features the strongholds of two warring factions the radiant and the dire the radiant is based at the southwest corner of the map while the dire is based at the northeast corner the two sides are divided by a river that runs perpendicular to the central lane these factions are defended by up to five players in each stronghold is a critical structure called the ancient a fountain that provide health and lesser structures these bases are connected by three paths referred to as lanestwo run alongside the edges of the map while one runs directly between the two bases the lanes are guarded by defensive towers as well as autonomous characters called creeps which periodically spawn in groups and travel along the lanes attacking enemies they encounterfeatured across the map are hostile characters referred to as neutrals which are not aligned to either faction and are primarily located in the forests located in a tarn on the northeast side of the river is a boss called roshan who typically requires multiple team members to kill and drops powerful items dota 2 features seasonal events which provide players with the option of playing the game with special game modes that alter the aesthetics and objectives with the seasonal event game modes the central focus of the game shifts away from the standard battle composition in order to focus on new objectives central to the seasonal events so far there have been three seasonal events the halloweenthemed diretide event the christmasthemed frostivus event and the new bloom festival which celebrates the coming of spring

do not play this game you will lose your real life its too late for me but i can at least give you this warning i must go now master dota calls
recommended
way too easy to burn time with this game
recommended
great game
recommended
its a very cometative game which pits you against 5 heroes you must work with your teammates to overcome such odds though youll likely fail the first couple of times
recommended
i have a hard time recommending this game because if you can struggle through the opening noob blues you will be ensnared in the most nuanced multiplayer experience ive ever experienced if you see the fated dota square be prepared to surrender your life you will no longer have time enjoy
recommended
so nice to play but russians r u malnuud

recommended
before trying out dota 2 i did not really like moba overall until my friends persisted that i tried and i was glad i made that choice dota 2 is a great game that really requires teamworklike every moba but it just has this special feel that makes this f2p game a must play it has awesome graphics and smooth mechanics and one should definitely not miss out on this game
recommended
the best moba in my opinion great number of heroes and different skills thu usage of fog of war wards cliffs is very intelligent and a good fact is that cashers arent better than the other by itens beacuse they are all cosmetics
recommended
do you like league of legends then dont play this and go play lol you silly
recommended
great game and free well worth the fun i suggest trying it if its not for you then no harm no money lost
recommended
do not start this game  there is no turning back

recommended
this game is no1 pvp game in the world 
recommended
love this game

dota 2 like all the other mobas are hard to review mainly because the community the game itself is pretty smooth and really likeable there are tons of characters right at the beginning with plenty of builds for each one a huge point is the ingame build seeker where you can apply a selected build for your character and after that point the game will suggest which skill must leveling and which item need to buy to be succes its a must feature have for newcomers wait there is more after all match the system will give presents to the players however mostly these are just cosmetics for the characters but with that you can customize the look of your favorite dude and top of that if you dont need these items you can sell it on the market the replay tool is also a nice touch and now comes the dark side no matter how good is the game when the playmates ruins it for me its really hard to get a good team in pub mainly because i play on euwest and well hmpf so we have a hard time with the ukrainians  its far more better if you gather 4 of your friends and play together other than that if i just compare the game itself with other mobas i cant anything say this is the best 8510
recommended
hardcore strategy game i want my life back
recommended
this game is greatit just needs good teamwork with teamlovely a
recommended
dota2 is hard to pick up it has quite the learning curve completing the tutorial will not get you ready for online play and like any team based game youll get a lot of negative feedback from your team mates just for being new dont let this discourage you everyone started fresh at some point take it with a grain of salt there are over a hundred heros to choose from i recommend playing a few games seeing who does well and what you like about that here then looking for other heros to start playing with there are great hero tutorials all over the internet if you have your eye on someone check out a video of a pro playing them itll help you understand what makes that hero great dota2 is a great game and ive met some really cool people in my short time playing practice makes perfect and this game is no exception
recommended
i never understood why i keep playing this game dislike it if you disliked it like it if you liked it diskiked it still logging in and play the game hahaha liked it keep on playing the game hehehe

over 300 hours of yelling in my mic a mix of russian spanish and english actual review work in progress background of game dota originated as a warcraft 3 mod which can still be played then valve took this game remasterd it and made it one of the biggest mobas but still only has a fraction of lols player base the good valves got lots of money and so does the player base this causes some darn large prizepools which are also contributed to by the players the bad addictive as hell about 110 players speak a different language and dont care to learn english examples include russian spanish and portuguese other problems warcaft dota had a lot of heroes which were ported into dota 2 causing a lot of copyright problems between blizzard and valve gameplay first games should be with bots and maybe after 10 games you should start playing with people if you dont know what to buy valve gives you suggestions based on your hero in the buymenu if looking for a guide you can find one in the top right
recommended
this game is absolutely amazing but if you think you can get this game and make tons of money off of it on the market you are dead wrong
recommended
very addictive game a lot less flamers than in lol

recommended
what a nice
recommended
thanks for the guidelines
recommended
best game a gamer can play 
recommended
if i was to rate this i would rate it a 510 due to the mean players and if you want to test out how hard ppl are if you are a noob they say go back to bots your bad and some characters are all over powered and take no skill to use them they give you no demonstration on attacks and it takes forever to use all the characters i would say if you wanna play this go play league of legends i would rate that a 910 the people are more friendly and you use teamwork in it
not recommended
i like this game
recommended
ive played a lot starcraft like games and i really enjoy dota 2 it is by far one of the best developed mods that has a great community and its free

run run as fast as you can if youve never played dota you can still be saved this game is a drug its worse than a drug it will destroy your mental health turn you into an amorphous blob make you racist towards every race including your own and will make you rage so hard you might even uninstall it a couple of times and yet you will keep wanting more and more of it 1010 would get high on dota again
recommended
its so good
recommended
the best game in the genre and the one that started it just try to have some fun games without flaming and youre doing fine
recommended
the only thing i disliked is the different turn rates of heroes slow turn rates gives dota2 a slowpaced gameplay overall i think the game is great
recommended
best moba ive tried so far very interesting cooperative and competitive at the same time with twists of situation and tactics
recommended
i love this game
recommended
addictive
recommended
addicting
recommended
good game with a strange community at first dota is hard you need alot of time to understand it and hating your team all day and blaming them wont help at all but it can be fun if you are good in it or play with people you like on the other hand servers are flooded with people which only talk in their own language russians  whilst this language is one which no one even has the chance to understand maybe implement ipbans for every other server than the country you belong to
recommended
my recommend for too the people of the word  excellent
recommended
wouldnt play it ruins your life

recommended
its dota 2 everyone knows it good fun good rage and boy do       
recommended
no word to describe this first moba in this world
recommended
once again valve sets a new standard for competitive multiplayer games yes its very similar to the first dota the game that created a genre but the nonintrusive and addictive implementation of free to play miriad of new characters and pitch perfect imbalance that ensures a constantly changing gamestate make dota 2 the best competitive multiplayer game of all time hats off to valve for creating a platform that could supply some of the best moments in this medium without the necessity of paying a cent
recommended
cool
recommended
this is one good game to work out some stress or build it  its even better when you have a full team of friends d
recommended
help me this game is sucking out my soul
recommended
now i realize there are 2 things that are needed by man today 1 es 2 dota2
recommended
the best moba game in the world d
recommended
dota2 is a fantastic game but it requires a extremely thick skin and large amounts of patience if you dont have a coach to guide you through the initial difficult time when you are learning this complex game if you do manage to slog through the initial learning period you will find a very deep game with many rewards the worst part of dota is your fellow teammates who will become worse than your enemies if you let them bother you lol
recommended
even if this game has a terrible playerbase and is confusing at the start defense of the ancients is one of the most competetive challenging rewardable mobas out there and with the most forgivable freetoplay system gives you all the champions and heroes makes this a true free to play final verdict 1010
recommended
more than 1200 hours of fun for free depends on your defenition of fun souls are free
recommended
best game i have ever played lol players should swap over to a real manswomans game and quit it with that baby  trash simulator they call league

this is my humble opinion on the game dota 2 not something you have to agree or argue with i am playing dota 2 since 201213 and its still an awesome game valve always brings fresh air in the game by patching new heroes and such for me its one of the best made games ever because of the big community its influence on the developers helping them to fixaddchange things the gameplay and the teamworkmechanics you can play how and with whom you want its a great game for young and old which always be there without getting boring i want to list the pros and cons which may help making ones opinion about dota 2 pros  always patched fixeschangesheroesitems etc  not monotonous always room for creativity  free may be the biggest point  teamplayorientated  large active community  fun thats what a game is all about cons  difficult to get pretty gooddecent player  always glitches bugs doesnt affect gamingexperience though  broken mmr system  high chance of getting addicted i know what i am talking about d

pretty good so far

uh not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for pancakes instead ingredients 1 12 cups allpurpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 14 teaspoon salt 18 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 14 cups milk at room temperature 12 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter plus more as needed now to make it 1 in a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg 2 in another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla 3 melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat 4 whisk the butter into the milk mixture add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5 keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 14 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed 6 procedure for adding fruit to pancakes once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings nah great game highly recomended

dota is a great cooperation game that has the goal to destroy the opposing teams ancient to win however it has many game modes that are fun to play it may be the same map all the time but it never gets boring this game also has many systems so new players can get used to it quite fast however this game has disadvantages as well like bad lobbys because of communication shortages  european guys who cant speak english guys who are selfish and just care to win so they just dont care about communication or they may even play with friends in the lobby but they are using the skype exuse all the time and they are so bored to press a single button so everyone in the team can communicate basically the only negative is that there is quite often communication problems among the teams and that some players do care about victory but just play oneman army style  picking their tank character and just do kills and show off one big advantage is that the game has no cheats in any lobby it may have huge disadvantages but the correct lobby and the gameplay can cover the disadvantages often  so i would say that it is a very good game to play that can never get boring even if its free
recommended
awesome game to play with friends
recommended
come with me 
recommended
serious until now they have not put ff in this  of game you must stay waiting for the winning team to decide if they will make a final push or just play with you until they are bored of killing you if i leave the game i will be labeled as a feeder or leaver
not recommended
one of the best team games ive played needs a lot of time invested to be good but you wont be disapointed 
recommended
you will meet people who say you are noob you will meet people who say you are gay you will meet people who say you are cute in russian     you wont need to go out of the basement to get that social life that your parents are always talking about such social much dota dota is also fun such pleasing much funny there are many characters to play with such skeleton fat old men much mana burn enough with jokes now why i should dota because dota is like team chess without being nearly as predictable you probably wont get bored you only need about 100 hours of play to sort of understand what youre doing horribly wrong ps     does not actually mean cute pps much review such informative ppps wow

u will love it  its fun game u can learne lanuges for free d u will have alot of fun if u playing with friends for make strategy planes d u must try it d see ya  3

hello guys just a short review of this game there are literally 3 main facts to describe this game it is amazing exciting and supplies you with lot of fun i never played a game that requires more skill teamplay and strategy at once than dota 2 playing dota is accompanied by a nonstopable learning curve that means you get better over the whole time bit by bit you gain experience how to play your hero effectively how to communicate with your team mates to defeat the enemies and that it is teamwork is the main proceeding in that game and for this reasons it makes such a big fun in the average a battle is 45 minutes long one battle demands your full attention as well as concentration choose the right character fight well and cooparate with your mates try it out i totally recommend that amazing game
recommended

i cannot convey how enticingly addictive this game is and so i will not try play it for your own damn self

dota is not a game it is a way of life chosen by millions of players and enjoyed every day of their lives

dota 2 is incredibly fun although it may not seem so when youre sitting through that awfully slow paced tutorial and your first few games may seem overwhelming tough it out its worth it once you learn to play a hero or two and you know a couple items to go with those heroes youll do fine dota will show you that the only thing you were missing in your life is being screamed at by people in russianporteguese despite you already make it clear that you only speak english pro tip no playing on us servers does not solve this problem apparently every russianportuguese speaking person decided to play on us servers despite the awful ping and they dont know the mainstream language here

i never played a game like dota 2 before just heard it then my cousin came to me and tell me that this game is awesome at first time i dont think so because i sucked pretty bad but after a few days or weeks of playing i become more better than the last time and thats when i think this game was awesome too 1010
recommended
by far the king of all moba games this is one of the most fun and challenging experience i personally have ever had in a moba if you liked league of legends you may find dota 2 to be a really difficult transition as few things are similar there is no surrender at 20 you play the game until someone wins the game is time consuming and exceptionally challenging i would give it a solid 1010
recommended
realy good game
recommended
im failing college cause of this peruvianrussian simiulator  1010 would do it again
recommended
i hate this gaem
recommended
this game is tons of fun and you can play it with friends or alone and it will still be fun this is a more advanced moba then say league of legends but still very simular to other mobas so if you have played other mobas before you should really consider playing this one
recommended
you have to play it to feel how bad you are
recommended
this game is awesome

hey you yeah you dont have the brain capacity to control a massive army build bases and execute daring army battles even though this games mechanics were taken from realtimestrategy games and do you enjoy blaming teammates rather than doing something about it when youre losing do you enjoy picking characters who only need rightclickscarries to function do you say we no def when youre losing even though the game is called defense of the ancients then if so you hypocritical basterd this game is meant for you expect your first matches to be full of carries and practically no support plays at all but who cares youre having fun losing be careful though young warrior matches can be full of people complaining about your play or the items you buy dont worry theyre just jealous of your feedi i mean killing streak so what if they call a  play or a wrong item on you if youre getting killz then its all fine theyre just jelly that you found a secret new meta before they could so what if you play a support hero and they complain when you last hit not your fault my brotha theyre just too slow to react so what if youre a support hero and not buy wards those wards are expensive as shet if they want all the farm while you just stand there and then expect you to buy wards then they are  as  how can you possibly buy wards when you dont have any gold bunch of  amirite youll notice in your first games that people like to kill other people well thats normal people do that in real life but you must remember this golden rule always push kid no matter how many times you pawn their noob arses you cant win if you can destroy the ancient this game is not won by kills but by pushing for example there is an impending 5 on 5 brawl or clash as they call it but as your teammates prepare for bloodshed you notice at the other side of the map a pack of allied mindless soldiers or creeps as they call it slowly march towards an enemy tower this is the perfect situation to push because the enemy heroes are way too far to respond to their tower being pushed so what do you do ditch your teammates and head for that tower wait until they have started fighting and then you push with the enemy team busy slaying your outnumbered teammates youre free to burn that tower down to the ground results a bounty of gold and a pushed tower your teammates can complain all they want about you leaving them in fact they should be thanking you for giving them the tower bounty ungrateful s if somehow you managed to get to their 3rd tower youll notice that behind it are two buildings these two buildings spawn the mindless creeps unless you destroy the 3rd tower these buildings are invulnerable meaning they cant be ed with if you destroy the 3rd tower then they are stripped of their godlike armor and now are ok to  with pro tip destroy the melee barracks first why because destroying it somehow gives your melee creeps steroids and since the melee creeps are the most produced creeps giving them steroids is the most rewarding effect and also the building somehow has a regeneration effect meaning it will heal itself so if youre going to attack it might as well kill it or youll be forced to retreat and watch it heal which leaves you as to how is it able to heal itself if its just a building how because fck logic thats why and if you manage to destroy all of the enemys barracks then the ingame announcer will shout mega creeps signifying that all of the allied creeps have steroids at that point you can pretty much let the creeps swarm the enemy i mean why not you fought your  out the whole match and had to deal with the enemys at so why not let them have a slow and painful death sounds good doesnt it and if youre lucky you might witness an enemy hero get killed by being swarmed by your steroid creeps fun aint it when picking a hero dont be that guy who picks first and if youre notoriously unlucky dont bother to random a hero yes it does give extra starting gold if you do but youll just end up giving it to the enemy as you feed let the others pick first take your time this is the part of the game where you actually use the most of your mind with analyze be considerate and choose a hero who can both counter the enemy picks and complement your allied picks now that youve pick a hero its time for the laning phase if youre support then they will need wards and wards need gold to possess so what do you do go to mid lane why so you can last hit without any teammate hogging all the farm if youre carry then they will need you to get lots of exp and gold so what do you do go to mid lane if youre an offlaner then you need farm to get utility skills and items so what do you do go to mid lane if youre tank then they need you to get tanky items and lots of exp to get stronger so what do you do go to mid lane in fact any hero you choose is a prime choice for mid lane remember first come gets the lane but anyways this game is quite addictive and may ruin your social life if you even had one friends family love ones all seem insignificant when youre in a match if youre still in school study time may become dota time and if youre working well you know whats going to happen overall this game has achieved what all games should achieve making you play and enjoy this game so yes i recommend this game good day to you sir

dota 2 defense of the ancients 2 is one of the best mobas multiplayer online battle arena  where the objective is to competitvely push lanes and destroy enemy towers to eventually reach their base first one to take down the enemys ancient final large building wins and one of the most popular second only to league of legends it is very similar to lol although there is no surrender feature in normal games  yet and if you play lol or most other mobas i can guarantee youll have a good time in dota 2 provided you can get over the difficulty the difficulty in dota 2 is much higher than other games of the same genre league can be quite easy but dota is a complete other world where if you dont do even the smallest split second thinking right it can cost an entire teamfight and then lead to defeat dont let this scare you though practising against bots will allow you to get ability and item combinations down pat although if youve never played a moba before it may take a while to learn as wellknown dota 2 player purge says it will take about 23 months before youd be considered ok or decent along side this difficulty in game is the players sometimes youll get really nice players that joke around a bit sometimes youll get nice competitive players sometimes youll get people who joke around the entire game to annoy their teambut sometimes youll get players who want nothing but perfection i myself at times may be one of these people and detriment their own team if the smallest thing isnt done correctly there is a reason behind this which is like ive meantioned before even the slightest wrongdoing tower diving for a kill aka suiciding  but this is quite a large example the heroes not champions you get to play as are all given to you at the start rather than buying or unlocking them although this may seem like all the new players would get to play the best heroes from the start there isnt exactly a best hero heroes have many many downsides and weaknesses and if not played well can lead to some of those problems ive mentioned above once a hero is learnt to play well though it is possible to effectively dominate the enemy team when playing on pubs casual servers beware when going into ranked matches though  most people in ranked will know how to play and what to do as it requires a fair amount of playing to unlock ranked i myself unlocked it in 120 games which was for me 240 hours of playing the game overall this is a great freetoplay game that is definitely worth getting its free after all and it isnt a small game unlike some f2p games that have next to no content or games that need to have most of the content bought to be able to use it and actually have fun in the game it isnt paytoplay in the slightest as the only thing money can buy is extra looks for heroes wards huds couriers and loading screens there are about 10000000 regular users and counting how about you join them id give this game a 9510 maybe even a 10 because of a hero that is afraid of trees rizzrack10 i love you timbersaw httpdota2gamepediacomtimbersaw < hero referenced

recommended
a good twist on a mmo mostly focused on strategy this game is playable by a wide range of players due to its different playing style for each character whether you are a supporter role for a team or the leader or the pusher all of them offer unique gameplay styles the objective though rather simple is rather hard to achieve in fact and can lead you to racking your brains to think of the best way to destroy the enemies base this game forges camarderie among players as each player in the team have to work with each other and support each other with the different skillsets they each have i strongly recommend you trying this game for a classic game twisted into something fresh and renewed its worth a try and most certainly will find a playing style in there to suit you
recommended

really good game of all games
recommended
its good a very big graphic improvement from the dota i played as a warcraft 3 custom map but its too heavy to be played on a low spec computer still its a good game
recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend
recommended
in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had
recommended
and you thought real life was a struggle
recommended
i only played a little but it was fun
recommended
things i gave to dota 1 money 2 time 3 love things dota gave me 1 arthritis 2 carpal tunnel syndrome 3 hatred of russians mexicans spanish finnish and russians 4 broken keyboard 5 broken mouse 6 910 ready 7 server crashes 8 4 stacks of russians in euw servers on english prefrence settings 9 ranked matches 10 free to play but pay to win games ie  foreseers contract new bloom 2015 11 its in the bag spam especially skywrath 12 multilingual cursing  i guess this is a good thing 13 split second math  reliableunreliable gold and gold loss on death vs buyback availability  this is good too essentially  dota is a greedy woman but i love her all the same 11  10 would play again
recommended
the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

fyi dota stands for defense of the ancients hello ladies and germs today you are looking at dota 2 review dota used to be a gamemode in warcraft 3 it was so popular it went on steam if you havent played dota 2 or warcraft 3 dota then this review will help you out first of all dota 2 is not a first person shooter game it is a strategy game so if you do not like strategy games or you just suck at it then dont play it plz the goal of the game is theres 3 towers on each 3 sides fight your way and destory the radiantsdires ancient and you will win the game its a 5v5 game so you need to rely on your team too there are 3 types of heroes strength agility and intelligence strength are really tanky which means they have more health and less mana they are also mostly nukers pusher etc agilitys depends on items so most of them are carrys which means they farm intelligence have lots of mana and most of them are supports because most of them can trap heal etc but most intelligence heroes are squishy means they can die easily example crystal maiden idk if i spelled it right lol

valve distributes pillbox model freetoplay that is to try his hand in the game is completely free commercial developers interest is primarily due to the operation of the gaming market for buying and selling a variety of accessories for the characters occasionally cosmetic bun drop at the end of the match for free much more often players get chests with hidden treasures the key to which you can buy in the store dota 2 decoration characters  a purely personal matter buying things does not affect the balance sheet so that in general all the charm of bunkers are available to everyone investments do not open new gameplay possibilities as is done for example in the league of legends ultimately the outcome of the match is always open to the professional level player if someone is not familiar with the concept of dota briefly sketch it the teams of light and darkness task is to destroy the enemy base the composition of each party consists of five characters one of which management is performed by the player also they are involved in a battle creeps  weak units follows a simple algorithm to go on a given route and kill oncoming enemies for the destruction of heroes and creeps players get money and experience who spend on the development of his character it is here that concluded the full potential of bunkers heroes in the game for more than a hundred for the successful outcome of the match is not enough to choose a character you liked visually proven in one battle hero can be completely useless in another everything from the choice of the ward to set items purchased must assume the existence of a comprehensive plan for the match any action requires serious analysis of the situation during the game every decision is situational and success depends entirely on your ability to correctly calculate the potential opponent to see major trumps his team peak and predict the course of battles the longer you play the more opportunities disclosed over time you realize that bunker implies a simple but brilliant concept dota 2 seven one waiting and very often do not wait plot as such in dota 2 no some eventbackground is rooted in the world of warcraft 3 only thing that can amuse themselves histories lovers  small biographical summary for each of the characters however the knowledge of these facts does not affect the gameplay change the wallpaper the concept map heroes  all migrated to the dota 2 is almost unchanged yes and what changes can we talk on the bunkers the structure of the gameplay is strictly defined and any attempt to bring conceptual innovation is fraught with loss of balance mindful of the fact that the cart does not need a fifth wheel valve neatly confined to some cosmetic innovations first dota 2 as an independent project has got a stylish menu that offers quick access to the game itself store news as well as the creation of guides and translations professional matches all the opportunities provided by the developers organized very convenient greatly reducing the barrier to entry for newcomers for them the same way a special education campaigns where they can without spoiling the old residents of the nerves to master the basic principles of playing different characters after that  welcome to the expanses of the team battles at the moment there are seven game modes in which the differences relate solely homepage of the match  the choice of heroes for those who simply want to have fun and hone their management skills specific character fit popular all pick for daughtery with professional ambitions preferable captains mode in which more tactical depth of the game is revealed anyway interest in the proceedings increases proportionally to the number of familiar people in the team because only with them possible quality team play dota 2 loaf loaf anyone you choose as for the gameplay then we have good old bunker modified only visually from medieval graphics warcraft 3 left pixel and  characters look a lot more colorful than the first part pleasant texture pleasing to the eye each character has its own set of animations all the effects are traced in detail and spectacular often during a particularly massive battles replete with an abundance of picture paints at which you lose the essence of what is happening but overall graphics looks cool and is not satisfactory the same goes for the voice acting all characters engaging in activities unique voice give one of the harvested phrases the spirit of the games memorable soundtrack that valve recorded using a full orchestra also the developers involved in the game interesting chip passing in silence match climactic battle moments of heated disturbing music if we talk about very very small things that have changed the characteristics of certain abilities and artifacts a couple of characters renamed number of the latter incidentally is constantly increasing  valve regularly replenishes list missing characters from the first part and even threatens to create new heroes cancers to be boiled alive another nice feature of the new dota is a system of storing statistics all your defeat and victory shall be accounted for and matches are recorded so you can review your or someone elses game having studied the replay here you will find a very interesting camera mode allowing for the match as he went on the monitor who was playing fog of war mouse movement  a very useful feature for those who wish to master such heroes like mipo or puja dota 2 dying ogre  a sad spectacle valve also tried to create an advanced ranking system during the matches are levels that are nominally rated player skill opponents with whom you are dealing with will meet your performance that should ideally create balance in reality however some special factory new accounts in steam so start writing your stats from scratch or wait a low priority resulting from complaints yes the selection of the ideal community is held in the form of reportov which players throw each other as a result the cubs first infantrymen entered in the bunker meet experienced grandfathers ready without any hints to explain who is who so the problem autobalance not yet solved somewhat hampered by having fun and inadequate behavior of the individual gamers which incidentally is largely played a major role in the folding of the special status of bunkers although theoretically fans flunk chat trite platitudes and rough netsenzurschinoy should be in the lowpriority games that will have to deal with their own kind however the level of aggression here rolls however this is by no means a disadvantage of the game reasons for this lie as they say somewhere in time and morals dota 2 forest farm  a relatively safe way to get hold of experience and gold setting aside the problems of the community and popular mythology psevdointellektualnoy gaming abductor pillbox place exclusively in the consumer diet shkoloty it must be admitted that dota 2 is a surprisingly balanced development in creation valve she finally acquired all the necessary attributes independent game decent appearance great music and teaching campaign before us bunker is selected from the parental nest warcraft 3 with its own feathers and spread its wings only appreciate her flight for some reason not all are willing ps all gameplay features are available free of charge nice graphics userfriendly interface great music and sound

ive been playing dota since 2008 and the dota2 was a great remake from dota better graphic better features playing dota is different for each game once you win and watch the throne explode it is a great feeling the fighting spirit to win the matchmaking is going better from time to time try it the first time are tough but once you master it you cant stop playing
recommended
just started playing and found the game to be much better then lol
recommended
it takes a lot of time to get used to this game the bots and mechanics arent really comfortable for me if you have good strategies and good nerves it may not take a lot of time to like this game i dont like it because i think its for players that are too op so if you dont like strategies and not good in handling things that are found in this game i dont recommend you to play this game
not recommended
ing awsome game y
recommended
dota 2 is a very strategy encouraging game but it can get a little bit competetive considering its a game where you are put on a team of 5 heroes including you and you have to try your best to destroy the other teams ancient like a nexus in league but there are towers and barracks blocking your way so the game is not at all about kills it takes a lot of strategy and tactics to win and on that note i do in fact recommend this game to any hardcore and just moba players in general
recommended
while it can take awhile to get the hang of this game as it has a steep learning curve it is extremely rewarding when it starts to click its a challenging game that is fun to play with friends its not always going to be sunshine and roses but it will keep you playing due to the variety of heroes and people that you will meet also what impresses me the most about this game is how balanced it is there is absolutely no way for someone to purchase an item with real money that will gain them an advantage in the game all of the items you can buy are purely cosmetic and the heroes are all quite balanced and can all be countered highly recommend this fun game dont be discouraged if it doesnt click right away itll get better 
recommended
fantastic for the times where life isnt sad enough already and you feel a brief sliver of positivity or joy enter your mindthere will always be dota to fix that must play
recommended

recommended
i had a girlfriend and money before this game aside from that  the game is different from all the other free to play games you get to choose from a huge amount of heroes and set your own way of playing on top of a hero you use items to furthure adavance your hero matches can be 5v5 or 1v1 and you can even do bot matches if you hate human interactions pros hero pool abilites combat bots are actual not horrible cons not many different maps hard to learn fast paced cannot pause it overall 810 worth the price  free of course white

recommended
so what can i say i played original dota just a few times so when dota 2 was released as betaversion i wast so agitated as others but soon i got an invite and began to play so what can i say about positive moments  time moves faster  yes thats it too fast sometimes  a lot of matchups in each game  a good challenge for your reaction analytics and tactics in aggregate  a lot of characters and you can take each one even at the begining  donations do not affect gameplay and some negative moments  you need a lot of practice to become really good player  agressive community  it can eat all your free time
recommended
who needs a social life and a stable career when youve got dota 2 1010 wud crie everytiem

dota isnt a game  it is a lifestyle for those who had enough brain to live in this world

are you peaceful calm and collected do you like to shy away from anger do you want to become a more assertive more aggressive person well dota 2 teaches you a unique skillset one that allows you to speak to foreingors in a more assertive manner it allows you to be aggressive towards players that need a little guidance and most of all it is a more statistically viable option for inducing a stroke than having children is yay for anger issues

a game that should be played for fun and worth your time

this is no game  this is an addiction its a very tough game which provides new stuff to learn even after 2000 hours of playing it though its very hard to get into game mechanics it is a necessary thing to do a decent job in this game but its absolutely worth it dota offers so many intensive moments and chances to turn everything around matches which are obviously lost or won despite that ive met some nice and precious people which i never want to miss again
recommended
hard beginning forcing you to learn if you survive the starting phase you will love it
recommended
ive been a lover of dota since the allstar days used to take extreme pride in my wc3 dota fileshad quite a few let me tell you people that ive played a lot of games and this is the only one that makes my heart pound out of my chest not every match of dota 2 spikes my adrenaline but when it does happen it makes all the hard times way more than worth it this game is not for the weak it is for those who will stop at nothing to achieve victory this aspect extendes beyond the 1010001001s right into the human psyche

league of legends was quite interesting and then i played dota and said that league of legends must have been a lazy made version of what dota 2 has to offer fancy character customes outstanding quality items that consist of their very own personal buffs a quick rpg match with more than the average varitty for a rpg game ever created the easy matchmaking system to fit your player style for either one on one or 5 on 5 hell add some ranking matches and your good to go to top it off add the international tournaments to make dota 2 one of the most popular and well built games ever made dotadotadota thats all i can say and millions of others could agree

in january 1st 1989 the chinese government started a topsecret project at the requests of the inner chinese communist illuminati an offshoot of the original group and the red dragon triangle masons this was not the first project the two groups had attempted previous attempts include the chinese civil war and the great leap forward and both proved effective at wreaking havoc upon glorious cathay and not the world both groups decided that the new project was to be named dota or desolation orbital termination assesment the project was dedicated to the creation of a new chineserun weapon of mass destruction run by harvested peasant souls and refined with the angry souls of many crabby chinese ancestors millions of farmer peasants were conscripted and then sacrificed to quickly develop this orbital cannon of worldy destruction much like emperor qin and the great wall and after the cannon was secretly placed into orbit above china a crackteam of foreign computer experts and chinese mathematicians created a program that could quickly check the viability of humanity on earth if the program assessed hit negative on its tests the cannon would be fired and the earth would be destroyed and nothing but ashes and the screams of billions would remain an american spy gabriel newell discovered this operation and quickly sent word of it to anticommunist students and other misfits in china and used their protests as a smokescreen as he stole the program and detonator of the dota from a chinese agent named icefrog who was in the process of evacuating them after returning to his safehouse gabriel decided to desert america and in his moment of ambition created valve threatening all potential dangers away with his superweapon it has been decades since gabriel has established his now wellknown and allencompassing syndicate dota is still running assessing every report every text message every rapierfeed and every south american and russian dota has now been upgraded to its second and final form what chance do we insignificent insects have against this malevolent ai our chances of survival dwindle with every  madre and  blyat spat out by our degenerate brethren we can just sit here idly in the queue lobbies and mope and whine about no region lock while dota gains more negative information that brings it ever closer to pulverising this puny rock we call earth or we can charge forth mics and positive attitudes at the ready to rectify the failures of the abyss the sub1k mmr trench what will you do

simply the best around on second note this game is great youll hardly get bored of it the graphics are ok and the artstyle is intresting gameplay and mechanics are great the balance is really good for a competitive game the workshop system is genius easily one of my favorite games oh did i forget something yes i belive i did the community the most imortant thing maby i like the community or atleast i have almost no issues with it there are mixed feelings about it i do have one issue though and it is that there are some a whole lot of them russians that play in all regions and refuse to speak the language that is suited for the region they are playing on for example they join the eu west region and refuse to speak english they only speak russian despite the fact that there is a russian region i could     about this but that      cyk no one likes a   feels

this game was a russian social experiment that went so badly wrong they sold it to steam now it is a breeding ground of interracial abuse and hilariosly badly thought up insults some of the lovable characters include an old  in the woods and a tree this game has soaked up far to many hours of my life and i recommend it highly 88 m8

dota 2 is acording to me the best moba out there for someone that dosent spend time on this they arent gonna like it as much i think i played about 60 hours of this game before i understood it completely and it was worth it dota is the game i have played the moston steam that is and dota is the game i love the mostatleast right now for the people that dosent play it it can seem repedetive but for mewho have played it alot dont think so though the map is the same and new heroes dosent come out all the timelike on smite there is always new styles to chose new heoes to play and more fun to be had d this game is pretty unique i love mobas and im not saying other ones suck or something like that dota is simpely my favorite oh and you dont need to spend real life money on this you can spend money on chests with items and such but it does not change your gameplay so playing free is defenately pasible  i recommend this game to people who has the patience to really learn it i was lucky enough to have a great mentorfriend to help me out he learned me much of my knowlage but much of it comes also from personal expiriance oh and people who playes mobas should also test it out obviosly that was it thank you for reading and have a great dota almost forgot remember to place wards narta_ts

recommended
this game is amazing its like crack but more addictive the honest truth is that like many mobas it takes a little getting used to if you play bots or have a friend that will help you through the learning phase its learning curve isnt that bad i recommend this to anyone who likes having one game that makes them unreasonably happy and the very next game makes them suicidal 1010 i will play this til they make dota 3
recommended
cool game

tactical and fun game

love this game

recommended
arguably one of the best moba games out there a vast amount of heros and tactics as well as frequent updates balanced very well and a lot of fun the game has a tough learning curve however once you get the basics down it can be a lot of fun
recommended
this is a mans game compared to league of legends this game is hard at the beginning for new players but for those whos familiar with mobas you will get the hang of it ether way this game will take your life and social life also lol but if your not a big gamer then your fine but it will take your money xd highly recommend this game i mean you can have a octopuls for a courier

what makes this game awesome is that each game is never the same with such a large selection of heroes items and straregies it continues to keep you on your toes dota 2 is all about team work and finding combinations that will work well together and there is nothing like that feeling you get when your team pulls of an amazing combo move that wipes out all your enemies dont take the game to likely either as the scales may turn at anytime which makes for even more fun

never has a game enfuriated me so much yet have me coming back so often this game is rage induced crack straight to my brain via right mouse click it has made me hate any language that isnt english and has reduced my people skills to racial slurs and swears matches run from 3075 minutes and are filled with dissapointment anger and russians all heroes need nerfs followed by a proportional buff rat doto isnt strategy its a way of life rage as towers fall and teammates feed and all you can do is stand there helpless with your iron branch a tango and that ward the support planted in your own fountain for some reason your ancient falls and you throw your dog out the window punch yourself in the balls then sit down and queue for another match would do it all again

this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend

in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had

and you thought real life was a struggle

i only played a little but it was fun

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

this game has to be one of the most techinical games i have ever played dota 2 is emersive and with a good team of 5 players you can enjoy hours of domination but with a team that lacks the bit of communication and players that are selfish it will sink your team just like the titanic
recommended
a very fun and good to play with friends
recommended
this is truly an amazing game join now 
recommended
i used to play league of legends but i found this to be a less repetitive and overall funner game and the learning curve is very steep but its easy to get over the hump if you play wih people who know how to play and it becomes very fun indeed
recommended
fun but i rather play one were you have a complete view ya know like a 3rd person not an overhead view
recommended

defense of the ancients 2  known more colloquially as dota 2  is a masterpiece of modern video game design harkening back to the ageold starcraft 1 custom map aeon of strife dota 2 nearly perfects the elements introduce in that original mod the mechanics and gameplay are ageless simple in their implementation and flawless in their execution everything about dota 2 is a triumph of engineering  the individual heroes have fantastic character designs both thematically and mechanically and the game is perfectly balanced around its seemingly lack of scaling and at times stagnant nature it is a game where levels and planning take precedent over gold advantage and items and teamwork is a union  a celebration even  of independent player skill this variety of complex mechanics themes and interactions that coalesce into a truly unique experience i recall the time i forgot to ward bot rune and when mid lost illusion to a pudge from top lane i was only blamed four times as opposed to dozens in other similar competing games this unparalelled level of community benevolence and powerful inclination towards skillful play make dota 2 the best game on the market if not all of human history four hundred years from now when the paragon hyperscholars are uploading digiedu to the modbrains of the neo bourgeoisie dota 2 will forever be imbedded in the siliconcortex as the zenith of prehuman ingenuity 010 it sucks
not recommended
i love dota 2 because the unique blend of online rts and rpg action that has made dota popular with tens of millions of gamers and expand upon it in every way
recommended
the best game i ever played 
recommended
good and nice game
recommended
dota 2 is one of the most exciting replayable and addictive competitive experiences around though theres a lot of learning youll need to do to get up to speed the payoff is a sophisticated complex teambased experience the required investment of time and energy combined with the meticulously designed gameplay produce a hugely satisfying sense of fulfillment when you win on the flip side it also means an all the more crushing sense of failure when you lose but its worth the risk
recommended
addicting 
recommended
this is a very good game

dota 2 is incredibly deep game in a sense  is absolute such variation you will not find almost any other game except perhaps that of direct competitors in the same genre but they are few and they are usually made worse unreliable players here not applicable as send out a separate circle of hell where they play with the other trolls and flamers this helps to reeducate those in whom the piece is still some reasonable and good but finally lost souls will cook in this pot forever  of

dont think of downloading it just do it

this game simply revolutionises the concept of team playing many of the new rules of team playing introduced by dota 2 may prove confusing for a lot of people so lets do a quick test do you enjoy getting frequently yelled at or flamed for not barging headlong into a fight with low health just to die and feed the enemy team do you like hearing 10 pings per second from at least 2 people at the same time on a point on the map where you must go and die thus feeding the enemy team and then being called a noob when alone at home enjoying a quiet uneventful afternoon in a relaxed civilised environment do you feel the urge to throw yourself in a highly stressful xenophobic toxic sausagemeasuring slugfest of teenage mostly russian boys with barely any knowledge of english attempting to inflate their egos by virtually punching each other while insulting each other if the answer to those questions is yes then this is the game for you you murderous sociopath 1010 will play during finals

this game is fantastic by far the best freetoplay game out there dota 2 can take some time to learn but once you know what youre doing its a very rewarding fun game which encourages team play and cooperation overall a very fun game
recommended
great teamplay rts game you should know that it has a steep learning curve its the most fun when you play it with friends i prefer dota 2 over the competitors lol and hon because its cleaner and i have more trust in the developers in both lol and hon i have been disappointed by patch changes and the directions they decide to take the game in now dota 2 is not perfect for example they still tend to make every new hero slightly overpowered but still in my opinion this has the best integrity
recommended
its a nice kind of strategy game
recommended
this is ing awesome
recommended
this game is awesome 
recommended
if u want to compete in a fair battle with pure skill and no cash shop items interfering with your gameplay then dota 2 is the game youer looking for

dota 2 is like chess if someone makes the wrong move your team loses the game it requires a lot of practice to become avarage player anyway the game very good it gets new updates every month sometes new items and new upgrades for the heros are released its balanced game i think that valve should release the 3 remaining heroes just to normal match makeing public only first and then maybe on ranked mmr
recommended
this game is really complicated
recommended
this will ruin whatever so call life you have
recommended
so addiciting great game

recommended
the games beyond great but some people just cant admit it theyre afraid of the greatness of this game that made me a junkie the cost of this game is your life and soul but at least you get to beat up russians read not all russians are annoying or bat at this game ive met a few nice ones but the nice ones are really hard to find like really really hard
recommended

very bad game do not play 1010
recommended
a game that has changed a lot since beta theres what seems to be an endless amount of characters to choose from but only a few youll stick to and enjoy playing its one of those games thats very hard to get fully involved in but can be enjoyed on a basic level by playing coop mode along with other players if youre in it for the competiton aspect prepare for a deep learning curve and some heavy competition in normal mode depending on what level you decide to take it on at you can either be casual or advanced at what can be considered an overhead winner in the rtsrpg world
recommended
this game is amazing and free
recommended
the best game ever recommend all of the moba players to play it lifesteal 100%
recommended
pretty good
recommended
the best game ever 
recommended

i disliked dota 2 now because hard to find drop item should increase chance of drop item 1 game for 1 drop item
recommended
it is very interesting to play because there is no chance to have similar game you can only get smarter by playing with a smarter opponent  helical
recommended
my mate chris loves dota he eats sleeps and  dota my friend chris also has a very serious psychosis and dota is the cuase he tortures himself for hours and hours playing sinking his life into the game he cant stop he says hes having fun but all hed does is shout and scream it can be something simple that sets him off such as a russian joining the game or a jakiro that takes farm from an ember spirit i beg you to reconsider downloading this game its a heroin a drug and itss by no means glamorous please if your bored and need something to do adopt an orphan or become an arosnist but do not play dota its never just one game
recommended
nice hats
recommended
lost my gf severe depression lost my friends ruined my life 1010

addictive to your inner core you can get hours in this game and still you learn as you go balancing updates never stop and changes are made to keep you out of boredom
recommended
having played 1400 hours of dota 2 so far you can imagine im a big fan of the game and i love it so im going to talk about the bad things dota has instead of the good things firstable dota 2 is extremely hard to learn and play properly this is a proble because many players could just leave this game after a couple of matches yes there are some noobfriendly heroes but i believe that learning and using properly a hero in dota is the least difficult part of the game second bad thing about dota 2 is mmr im not saying that mmrranked matchmaking is broken doesnt work or things like those im talking mostly about mmr calibration matches ive played with some players that are actully able to play really well bur are still stuck in mmr hell with avg mmr of 15 k mmr when you are there you are in the worst place you can be in dota 2 because of the absurd amount of flamers trolls and trashtalkers well these are what i think to be the worst problems of this game but i still strongly suggest to play this game because its extremely funny and beautiful remember the community isnt just made of s there is a bright side i hope this was interesting 
recommended
you wanna play lol you better think twice and get your  over here
recommended
this game is best
recommended
get ready to get addicted
recommended
dota 2 is the first moba game ive ever played and it is amazing i have a lot of games that i like to play but dota 2 tops the charts it is an easy to learn hard to master type of game just the type i like most ftp games i know have ingame purchases that are practically crucial to progress through the game thats not the case here dota 2 has ingame purchases but theyre not absolutely needed to play theyre just for fun one of my favorite parts of the game is that there is no end dota 2 isnt you made it past level 2 now go to level 3 you progress through the game by understanding and knowledge another huge plus is that it gives so many practice opportunities from the training mode helping you learn mechanics of the game like last hits to letting you practice your favorite heroes in bot matches lastly the heroes themselves all of them have their own twist one the game and their own backgrounds they have names that stick like outworld devourer and razor if they were just called mage or brute it would sound like it would just be another spellcasting strategic war game but this is no war game this is dota 2
recommended
its nice but youll get mad a lot
recommended
i strongly recommend you try out a character hero in an offline bot match before using that character in an online match winning matches requires teamwork and a majority of the players get pretty frustrated if youre not contributing enough
recommended
buy some hats
recommended
even though map is always the same doesnt easily get boring best game ive ever played good work valve and icefrog 
recommended
this game is very interesting and good this game will test your knowledge about war
recommended
excellent game very challenging especially when your teammates do not get along other then that well done
recommended

recommended
good game  u should try it
recommended
i like this game  because this game so make me fun 
recommended
its beautiful and good game i recomended this game your 
recommended
play dota they said it would be fun they said they were right
recommended
its so beautfiul d
recommended
sounds good
recommended
simply because this is doto 
recommended
so addictive
recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend
recommended
in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had
recommended
and you thought real life was a struggle
recommended
i only played a little but it was fun
recommended
things i gave to dota 1 money 2 time 3 love things dota gave me 1 arthritis 2 carpal tunnel syndrome 3 hatred of russians mexicans spanish finnish and russians 4 broken keyboard 5 broken mouse 6 910 ready 7 server crashes 8 4 stacks of russians in euw servers on english prefrence settings 9 ranked matches 10 free to play but pay to win games ie  foreseers contract new bloom 2015 11 its in the bag spam especially skywrath 12 multilingual cursing  i guess this is a good thing 13 split second math  reliableunreliable gold and gold loss on death vs buyback availability  this is good too essentially  dota is a greedy woman but i love her all the same 11  10 would play again
recommended
the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you
recommended
one day a wise man intoduce me into this game it shall protect your virginity my lad he said
recommended
so many hours passed still a noob 1010
recommended
dota is like a basketball which it is not just a game but a teamwork game where you have to plan a strategy to win just like basketball
recommended
best game every and to think it all startet for warchraft 3 maps
recommended
i like this dota 2 game
recommended
great game for relaxation and enjoyment
recommended
once i heard about something called social life while playing dota i still dont know what that is 1010
recommended
schnaedur kille mi 103 tiems on a privat server it was fun
recommended
frustrating to learn dont solo queue but after you get the basics and learn more heroes it becomes very enjoyable then when you are decent and understand a bit more about the game and heroes you start to dont solo queue rage all in all it is a great game to help you become racist to russians and hispanic people dont solo queue
recommended
a game where i can also make good money d and now this game gives me a good business in real time 3
recommended
once you get past all of the whining from other players its still a fun game with team strategy as the critical piece
recommended
i want that this game has daily mission that has daily rewards i liked it because of its graphics and animation
recommended
a like this gameso favorite game

dota 2 is the spiritual successor to the warcraft iii the frozen throne custom game defense of the ancients allstars in which the player controls a single hero unit in a battle to level up collect loot and destroy the enemys structures all within a typical 3045minute experience games can be longer or shorter but typically fall within that window as the metagame has changed due to content update patches games have grown shorter over the years but in the past dota was likened to world of warcraft in an hour it is an accurate analogy as the player experiences many traditional rpg elements while competing headtohead against other players dota 2 is an incredibly complex strategydriven competitive game with over 100 individual unique heroes from which to choose as well as a variety of different game modes to mix up the drafting process each game is an experience unto itself no two games will ever be identical the one thing standing in the way of most players new to the genre of mobas is the unforgiving nature of the game for better or worse each mistake a player makes can be critical in the final outcome of the game especially as the clock ticks on in a couple of seconds the entire tide of the game could swing heavily from one team to the others if even one costly mistake is made as a result of this many players have developed a rather distasteful attitude toward others when mistakes are made a word that is often thrown around is toxic which isnt inaccurate the toxicity of the community can be a terrible deterrent to new players and can actively inhibit growth of the game thankfully valve have implemented ways in which to curb these behaviors through punishments dished out to players with nasty attitudes each player is given a number of reports per week which can be issued against other players who have exhibited poor form rudeness excessive communication spam or other infractions and as a player accrues reports he or she may face a communication mute or a number of games in the low priority queue which is sort of like rehabilitation back into society while i have spent a lot of time talking about the negative aspects of the game i want to stress that i have been playing dota since 2004 and i dont see a stopping point in sight even yet i am consistently captivated by the dynamic and interesting nature of the game of each individual game to offer me a unique fun and rewarding tradeoff for my time commitment there are few feelings in gaming as satisfying and enjoyable as coming away from a game with a hardfought win against other players with good attitudes it makes the bad stuff seem trivial by comparison in addition to the actual gameplay elements explored in this review dota 2 is part of the greater steam trading community a collective of games featuring ingame economies and persistent item storage for players through the steam platform even if you dont particularly like the game itself item trading from playertoplayer can be tremendously rewarding and fun and if youre lucky you could find yourself with an item worth up to many thousands of dollars of course with any relatively free market there will be unsavory and dishonest individuals out there who will not blink an eye before attempting to scam you rip you off or otherwise take advantage of you thankfully there are plenty of resources available to new traders so do your research in fact if you need help dont be afraid to add me directly and fire away im always happy to help in conclusion dota and dota 2 are without a doubt the games on which i have spent the most time playing each new game brings me a new exciting experience and as long as you remind yourself to maintain a positive attitude and resist the urge to treat your fellow player with disrespect you will agree that it is among the best multiplayer experiences available anywhere learn it love it and play on

recommended

recommended
i cant lie dota 2 is pretty fun when your team mates are so good that they lose the game for you pretty fun tbh also if you play a carry and lose your team yells at you because you didnt carry hard enough even though they fed and lost you the game but you get blamed for not farming enough even if youre doing amazing so overall great game 1010 so much fun
recommended
the watch game option is great for instance while waiting for the game matching you can watch the games playing by your friends or other profesional players the most challenging point in dota 2 is to remember all of the hero skills and items this is really a nightmare to the beginners
recommended
dota2 is a fantastic game it has a brutal learning curve and a nearly unreachable skill ceiling but offers endless variety replay value unheard of before it you could play this game and this game alone for the next few years and not feel like you wasted your time games are short and there is no grind skill and teamwork are the core of the game and the inclusion of cosmetic items gives you something to collect over time if you want away from dota for a month you can come back and not feel left behind by all your friends thats critical for a multiplayer game worth trying its free so get downloading
recommended
great game
recommended
very good game

recommended
hello guys <3 i really like this game
recommended
the game can be played at any skill level but the beauty is that at higher levels there is so much depth that no two games are ever alike the only issue is that it is difficult to improve without having someone friendly better than you who will actively call out your mistakes in dota 2 ignorance is not bliss
recommended
love this game just play it now dude
recommended
this game will frustrate you at first then once you get your first ultra kill you will forget you have other games

dota 2 has its origins in early warcraft custom games the style popularized by euldota1 later was handed off to guinsoodota1 20euls scepter of divinity was needed to make guinsoos scythe of vyse in earlier versions which was then taken into its final chapter by icefrogdota allstarsguinsoo started allstars originally but the bulk of the allstars era was under icefrog dota 1 was by far the best game ever made in my opinion due to the tight knit cult community the constant state of balance and updatesometimes 34 times daily if something was wrong they would fix it right away not funded so no money grab aspect just all was focused on a quality game with quality people playing having the forum voting system actually gave the players and community a chance to decide together how the game would evolve dota 2 since being taken over by valve has done a nice job to keep some of the great gameplay aspects that being said the invite only phase was the closest you would get to that dota 1 experience the community has been flooded with the free to play craze giving them a market to exploit this has caused the content the gameplay and the general enjoyment to be watered down from its vastly superior original it has a chance to be fixed the servers need to be improved and keep people that speak the same language and a similar skill level matched up it currently is a mess and you almost have to get lucky to have an enjoyable game i still give it a yes for the chills i get when i hear the lina announcer say hawt stuff and raaaampage also the nostalgia feels of the good days when games were developed to be art and quality and complete without the thought of how to make money
recommended
a game which i so strategic and fun learn bout teamwork here
recommended
this is a game where you can spend over 200 hours of gameplay like myself and still be little to no good but the addiction and the learning curve makes dota 2 by far my favorite game on my pc the huge array of different characters with different skills talents and attributes make the game diverse while the voice acting and graphics make the game a marvel both technically and graphically i cannot recommend this game highly enough i would suggest anyone to download it and begin your addiction trust me its brilliant
recommended
i play only dota 2
recommended
nice game
recommended
dota dota dota forever  great texture quality rigged model to perfections particles at its finest d gameplay of course all dota players should know
recommended

recommended
awesome 9910 would play
recommended
dire tide 2014 if u dont do this ice frog i realy leave this game 
recommended
from an avid league player its a bit hard to get into and understand at first but once you get your main role going and start to learn the heros you can play it can get pretty fun until you meet viper rage about one of his passives is a slow every auto attack compared to league it has a lot less skill shots and more lock ons however there is still a lot of skill to be had at this game not runes or masteries denying and losing some gold upon death just make sure you dont spam your spells your mana pool is very low and mana regen is little to nothing early game a very different game with not a lot to compare to but theyre both equally fun in their own way
recommended
my favourite game
recommended
a very good way to spend extra time to relax
recommended
please fix it its hard to loggin with another computer why that
recommended
just play it
recommended
the ablity draft mode is sucks  why must pick with a line
recommended

looking to cut yourself off from the real world life getting too boring for you or are you just simply finding for a way to throw your dull life away look no further this game is the game for you this game promises you hours of fun on end you fight in a team to claim victory over the enemy teams ancient hence the title defence of the ancients some heroes are easily grasped making it easy for beginners to learn the basics once you start getting the hang of things and master the basics there are a hundred other heroes to learn and master personally this game has ruined my life with about 400 hours of gameplay my grades have dropped i have no time to hang out with friends anymore my family hates me because im always in my room you name it im probably there right now but ive never been happier in my life girlfriend sorry i dont know what that is

greatest game i have ever played it helps build teamwork and cooperation while at the same time playing with friends or random people you have never seen or heard of you get lag spikes every now and then and the common trolls and new players
recommended
highly recommend playing it
recommended
the most frustrating game of all time this game will give you the feeling success failure and regret while at the same time it will fuel the furious need to take another game in hope that the teammates that you will play with will have a higher intelligence quotient than the average programmed bots in all you will end up with doubt begin to play as bad as the newbeginners and end up in matchmaking unfairness i recommend this game highly if you have bdsm fetish or if you would like to play a multiplayer game in order to experience ingame injustice and remember no matter how bad a game was always write a gg wp because it is really that great
recommended
ive been playing dota for 7 years i really love this game  i will marry dota someday lol
recommended
sexy as it is

great game a lot of fun requires lots and lots of patience and thick skin to deal with internet hats but if you have both and can preform a slight amount of team play youll love it

recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
about 90% of games have people not playing their roles 80% have disconnectionsleavers and about 50% have feeders or otherwise deliberate game sabotagers this leaves 1% of all games actually being enjoyed as they should be most of the game is rote learning of the map heros items and recipes and tactics communication and timing are key with almost no strategy involved pubs rarely have any communication if they even speak your language lots of bugs devs rather add emoticons than fix basic gameplay issues
not recommended

recommended
it is a good gamebut it is way too hard to level up
recommended
i have spent 1000 hours playing with a team of friends screaming and yelling and raging and raving about innumerable plays and moments that words fail to describe this is not an easy game when you try it you will run head first into a brick wall of knowledge it will be a brutal task to learn to play the 100 heroes familiarize yourself with the items and understand how everything interacts you will need patience determination and the humility to admit your own mistakes and seek out greater knowledge in order to triumph but there are no games deeper or more rewarding than this and its free have at it
recommended

recommended
i love this game
recommended
do you need an excuse to hate your friends and theyre too nice of people to come up with a good reason on their own dota2 is the answer within minutes of trying to learn how to play you will fail horribly have no idea whats going on and your friends will turn from the transcended ghandis they are into racial slur spewing homophobic rage cases smashing their mice on tables thanks dota 2 for being this and the most addicitive bad game i have ever had the displeasure of collapsing arteries for just to get a fix install defense of the ancients todayand hate your friends tomorrow ps if you have no friends then youll still find the above anyway mute them fast
recommended
the learning curve for this game is brutal and the community is full of egotistical twerps despite this dota 2 is a rewarding game
recommended
be wary of raging internet trolls
not recommended
the more i play dota2 the more i like this game i used to play lol so switching to dota2 is being a challenge more difficult everything is new completely newb here but enjoying the game thanks to the friendlyhelpful community who dont rage if you fail they come to help and always give you an advice to get better and better 10 would recommend
recommended
if you want a reason to get angry
recommended
this game is amazing
recommended
they say its not about winning their right and hopefully others know this too so what your getting into is fun its not as much of a social game as it is an arena figther but should be more social  easy to pick up  microtransactions are legit and wont destroy your wallet  strategy develops with slow learning curve  flying donkeys  disconnections in earlylevelgamers makes games redundant sometimes  thats all i can think of didnt fully get into the game but ive seen enough and heard enough and read up on it enough to safely say as a free game its just as addictive as counter strike also by valve and it is easy to pick up and play when your low it might turn into crack but theres a focus group for that
recommended
cool game
recommended
tons of teamplay and fun if you survive a community with the majority of jerks and hatters wellcome to dota 2
recommended
this game is just awesome

the best

recommended
totally fun warning not suitable for children
recommended
this is the best strategy games
recommended
this game improved so much since it was released on the beta there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1 i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers i know some people who play lol might bash in this game but both games are compleatly different its like comparing cod and battlefield they are so different that connot be compared no preference on either game i think bot of them are good give this game a try the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development try it out its free and badass
recommended
great game

dota is the best of the best xd

its like dota with better graphics

dota 2 is one of the biggest moba on market so when it comes to a big player it has some pros and cons first of all ive played many free to play games but this one must say is a real free to play in many others games u can spend some real cash on boosters which are giving u advantage on the battlefield but in dota you wasting all your money only on a heros appearance of course u can buy a boost here which will give u more experience from the match but this only increases your cosmetic items loot also forgot to mention that every item from the shop can be looted via match rewards second of all dota 2 was my first moba type game i was never interested in mobas never played mobas until i decided to try dota when it was in beta even in beta game was newbiefriendly first ive played matches vs bots all diff then moved to matches vs bots in coop with other players and then i was ready for the big one later valve added a nice tutorial for new players to moba games but anyway most of new people dont care about this ive checked this on playin on new steam account which queded me with low level of dota 2 not low level of skill players and ive met some pretty interesting people right there like carry wisp etc finally i must get to the biggest con of dota 2 for me european player the biggest con of dota 2 are russians no im not a racist ok to get things smooth i not saying russia country is all made of bunch of morons but this game really makes me think like this russians are the biggest and worst plague of dota 2 community in my all match history which ive played something around 25k matches russians were active in like 75% of this number in 1% of this matches i have met russians who can speak english and can even teamplay the rest of them are non speaking english selfish players who will always play solo and when you gonna lost game then its raining  dota 2 forum is filled with posts that russians are crashin this game but valve dont even bother to do something with this ending i must say dota 2 is a solid newbiefriendly game with some comunnity problems i absolutely commend this game to all moba fans and not only them
recommended
great game 1010
recommended
i like the whole game itself dota 2 because we all know that we started as noobs on dota 1 here we can practice and learn much faster than the previous game the game will guide you throughout its contents but the only problem in this game is that there are thousands of players from around the world that do not know how to respect other people
recommended
best game i ever played you always find something new and learn every game over 1k hrs and still a noob ^^ kotl geev mana 1010
recommended
i like the gameplay 4ever
recommended
very fun to play
recommended
that is good game
recommended
just loving it
recommended
had a friend who played this game a lot got along with him well for a few years i played this for a few hours and its a total trollfest nervewracking how terrible the community is in this game it is not worth the price of free one mistake early and you lose the whole game but it takes about an hour for that loss to happen so during that time you are forced to play a losing game or get penalties for quitting anyhow my friend played this nonstop for a few years turned him into a totally rude nutbar to the point that i unfriended the prick i think the community of this game rotted him out luckily i never met him in real life that would be sad to see a real life friend get degraded into an animal before you this game is toxic i played enough online games to see this right away stay away this is a moneymaking machine for valve with psychological sideeffects not worth the free pricetag on the game
not recommended
very nice game i think i very like it
recommended
stop fooling around play this game already
recommended
i hope that all the heroes will be soon released 
recommended
its alright ish
recommended
very very great game this is my favorite pc game of all time

really fun and competitve gameplay if you want to be a racisist andor you love russia heres an example mestun now the russian  meing russians
recommended
if youre a gamer you would probably have heard of the term moba which stands for multiplayer online battle arena and one of the games leading the way in that genre is dota since thats where it basically all began dota 2 is a direct sequel to the original bringing us updated graphics and easier controls making the already difficult game a bit more accessible to newer people for the genre this game is very much like a sport in which it requires lots of strategies and teamcoordination in order to win however much like a sport it requires time and patience to hone your skills in order to be good at it so if youre willing to put the effort into it dota 2 can be an extremely enjoyable and satisfying experience for you just be wary that there are a considerable number of players in the community who can be considered toxic and can be very unfriendly if you can somehow try to avoid them as much as possible eg only playing with friends you know youre going to have a blast with this game good luck and have fun 
recommended
so good and exciting game u must try it
recommended
just like a normal player with the normal capacity in clashing
recommended
i would recommend this game for all 
recommended
im playing dota 2 since its f2p its amazing gameprobably the best russian learning tool in the whole world is dota i used to use google translate when someone typed russian to mebut guess whati dont need that now
recommended
very competitive game nice
recommended
if you are bored or looking for some action try this one
recommended
ruined my life 1010
recommended
epic game of all time
recommended
since 2009 playing dota 1 and dota 2 is a must played game <3
recommended
i have had a large amount of experience with various mobas including lol smite dota ect and have found that dota 2 is the best i ahve played ballance wise graphically and game mechanics in general i enjoy more than other games and has unlimited replayability the main issue would be that i would highly recomend not playing unless you have atleast 3 or 4 other friends who would play with you unless you have a stack of people you can talk to the game becomes unplayable because of the community
recommended
let me make this short commendable gameplay dota 1 was one of my favourite game to play and this did not dissapoint several items and unique heroes are very much unchanged to the delight of old players thisis a f2p and requires no money whatsoever unless you intend to buy cosmetics which is purely for the eyes and ears only undesirable aspects of the game as far as mechanics gothis is as balanced as it getsso the game has no real major flaws that needs to be fixed howeverthe community is as bad as it gets with most players flaming you for screwing up or when you are new to the game it can get pretty harsh language barrier is also a thing herewith many of the people ive been paired up with speaks only russian no teamorkthis is by far the worst of allwith individuals trying to go for what they want rather than whats good for the whole team as suchi would like you all new players to remember this welcome to dotaa game whereby everyone killsteals freely and everyone is a noob
recommended
who hasnt played a moba in their life even if just one game dota 2 takes that to next level with graphics and gameplay strategies and the punishment of even dying once p this is truly the real moba experience in my opinion it has all elements needed to make you keep coming back to it and in my case i have bought soo many other games but i still just keep coming back to dota 2 and atleast make sure to play one game per day
recommended
dota 2 is my favorite game that i have ever played this moba has so many heroes to choose from but i would like to see a balance is the heroes
recommended
more drop item please
recommended
a very cool game 
recommended
better than lol
recommended
great game just wish players were more understanding of inexperienced players
recommended
good game item drops makes it addicting to play gotta collect em all
recommended
great game

you cant just only sit by seeing the others play this game try it and you will never doubt me a lot improvement from the old one under wc3 910 from me
recommended
i like dota 2 because i play for fun and i appreciate other players
recommended
excellent game only ruined by the moments when i get teamed up with newbiesthrowersleavers overall 910
recommended
its all about hiding in the trees hahaha
recommended
easy to understand i`ll definitley recommend it
recommended
this is a game that is relatively straightforward play but takes a long time to master the community is  especially if your a n00b but if u play well with others or just play well in general youll have a blast also you cant be stupid and play this game well you need a sense of cause and effect and a sense of strategy i would suggest playing with bots for a while then once youve got the hang of things public matches is a good idea
recommended
this game has taught me so much things that ill never forget  1 the only good russians are always on the enemy side 2 that the whole dota community would defend ukraine against russia 3 that brazilians dont only suck in football but in dota2 too 4 in low priority games your whole team is always full of hard carries 5 that excuse in which a feeder blames lag is overused 6 oh 2 russians in my team  gg wp every single time good game taught me how to swear in russian 
recommended
i cant play strategy 10 out of 10
recommended
its the sequel to the famous dota developed with icefrog the one that got dota its competitive charme what more can you say other than maybe one of the best games here on steam if you want to play with and against human players
recommended
great game ever
recommended
this is nice game for pro like me

after playing for more than 35k hours i finally decided to write this review pros great game very addictive fun to play with friends makes you better at thinking and developing strategies also you can learn russian for free cons huge learning curve tends to alter your personality and make you a bad person might induce rage hate and racism overall score 1010 ps if you have severe anger management issues do not play this game
recommended
has great female character design but got called a noob a lot and its not my kind of game the female character design
recommended
very nice game ever
recommended
dota 2 is the best moba game
recommended
i dont know what to say but of course this game is amazing 1010
recommended
ive been playing dota for more than 5 years play it for fun and dont take it seriously remember its just a game
recommended
the best game ive ever played
recommended
the best moba
recommended
i like this game very much even if iam a girl it makes me feel happy everytime i play dota i disslike every trash tlak they say ^_^
recommended
got hate messages on steam because i denied five towers in a single game 1010
recommended
its a fair play not too creamy not too dusty just that delicious right amount of crispiness that said just cause 2 is still my favourite openworld game and i feel the developers havent even tried to make it come close outrageous
recommended
most time i have ever wasted of my life on something without being bored of it
recommended
very good

recommended
pretty awesome
recommended
very good game
recommended
play the game get mad quit repeat
recommended
what a time sink >_<
recommended
dota 2 is the best games forever for me
recommended
why i always getting temates what always overfarming my enemyes even when i play support buying cour ward dust gem my temates feeding here is no rank by stats in dota just random generation of teams search system need to be reworked but at all game is updating slowly and one time it will be very wonderful game balance in dota 2 is better then in same games  i mean lol hon etc  maybe just because here is no items what giving players atk or deffence  donate previlegies etc all game depends on your skill but skill of your temates is important too so if you starting to play dota 2 you need to learn all abilities of hero you will play and also you will learn abilities of other charters just playing against them so get some honor and go fight the immortal xd
recommended
the moba ive spent too much time on the community is absolute crap the gameplay is complex difficult and unforgiving and you will lose constantly because of noobs trolls and pros in each game you will rage but you will keep on playing anyways for the rare and sick pleasure of a satisfying victory with an ultra kill you will waste money on the countless items and holiday events but you will find a way not to regret it i dont think ive ever played a game that is this psycologically scarring once you play dota 2 you will either hate it or love it its a game you cannot play casually you play hardcore every day or you do not play at all with over 1000 hours i can say converting to this game is far from easy and sometimes makes me rage beyond belief but i keep playing itbecause i have to because ive been latched onto it 1010 game only game ive ever gotten this many hours out of prepare to never leave
recommended
great game
recommended
i bet u cant stop playing this game

it is a good game dont have enough time to play it but it look interesting
recommended
best free game in the world 85100
recommended
this game much good very recommend
recommended
this game will steal your whole time
recommended
its really awesome
recommended
whew okay this is going to be a long one this game is in a league of its own the rare moba genre has to be ranked differently to other genres this game is not so kind to new players and has a steep learning curve which is fine considering the game comes with some nice tutorials for the new players volvo is forever adding content to this game and it shows in the heroes and maps solo que or with friends this game will always be fun the community is friendly depending on where you search just like tf2 this game has a vast trading community to back it up great game gets more fun the more you learn graphics  910 gameplay  910 content  910
recommended
awsome game ever
recommended
community is a pile of  the game will make you wish death upon all your friends after 2000 hours you are probably still  best game ever

dota 2 is for certain the best moba game on the market completely free to play with all heroes unlocked from the start plenty of patches have changed how characters work added different events and added more heroes to play with making it a great package for the price of well nothing if you are new to mobas dota 2 may be a hard game to get into due to the high learning curve do not have that discourage you however as plenty of hours are waiting to be taken by this fantastic game
recommended
well the first time i played this game is because i saw other players play it and it gives me the excitment that itll be challenging cause most of it is a strategy game and from my constelation im a scorpio which likes challenging stuff and thats why i like this game so much

dota 2 is a moba game which is the so called sequel to the warcraft iii mod dota surprising both old and new players alike as to how good it is compared to others or to its predecessor dota 2 is a game which is utterly repetitive who am i kidding same map same items same heroes every single time but i never got bored or got sick of it more like this is the reason i play it so much to be better at the same map using the same items and heroes at every other fight i play it weekly for about 8 hours yeah 8 is my favorite  all in all a great moba game maybe the best better graphics than its competitors and definitely more balanced in terms of both heroes and items

dota 2 is a very extensive and deep game but this depth and complexity in my opinion means a great ceiling of fun i really enjoy this game you can play as an oblivious person with your oblivious friends and derp around the game and have lots of fun trying to bash each others heads in while trying to break that coveted ancient but be warned if you enjoy this game you might want to try playing online playing online is a different experience entirely team work becomes so much much oh ever so much much so muchly much much more crucial than before drsuess reference xd if you are still playing with your group of friends though at this point that should help a lot but like many people myself included you will be in games where you are alone amongst 4 strangers all of whom have their own agenda seemingly it is not always like this you will try your best to help your team win but it will inevitably end in a couple of your teammates being headstrong idiots who fed the other team let the other team kill them to many times then the fed team is big bad and bulky then you lose there are games where you and your team will work together and you will destroy that will not always be the case so enjoy it when it happens and get over it when it doesnt if you plan on being great at this game be prepared to spend hours researching what the items do all of the recipes heroes skills especially ultimates and watch games of people who are good i reccomend purge hes on youtube if all this seems overwhelming its because this game can be crazy overwhelming however it has potential to be crazy fun the bottom line is what you put into this game is what you will get out of it at the time of this review i have 270 hours ingame and i still feel relatively noobish i have been having fun this whole time however so if you dont feel like putting away crazy amounts of time into a game then i suggest you get 19 friends who also dont know how dota works to get this game and just play private games together and have a blast because it is quite a lot of fun a little about me i played dota 1 the warcraft iii mod as a latecomer with 1 other friend game after game and we derped plenty but through those games i learned about the stats and recipes of about 90% of the items in the game giving me a pretty sizable advantage i could have made this review about ten times longer but then it would have been a guide it already kind of is 1010 by the way this game is great

i would say this is a great revamp of the first game which was a mod in world of warcraft 3 reign of chaos and in world of warcraft 3 frozen throne theyre still putting in some of the missing heroes but other than that it is a good game its doing well with these other mobas around again i recommend this game if you loved the first

i love this game before i know to play this game d
recommended
yeessss  in nice game  in dota 2 you will know the sensation of being bullied v
recommended
this is amazing game
recommended
it all started as a map for warcraft 3 today it is the best of its kind around not too surprising to be honest valve games are usually astonishing dota 2 is no exception it is a complete work of art in many ways graphics this game has a slight cartoonish feel to it with fitting colors and lovely particle effects it is not too demanding but at the same time not that easy to run an average computer should be able to handle it the skill effects for dota 2 are incredible well made and satisfying while not crossing the border of being disorienting sound incredible soundtrack with many fitting masterpieces for different situations and places skill sounds have a great oomph to them and are very well made overall what i absolutely love about dota 2 when it comes to sound would be the voices hero voices this game has the greatest voice acting i have ever seen in my life not only limited to video games the lines are incredible well thought of the so called responses in the game of dota 2 are full of different expressions they are the main thing that is funny about this game gameplay dota 2 takes alot of skill almost too much dont jump into public games if you just started even if you played the original or other arts games practice all heroes learn their skills and their playstyles if you dont know if your enemy can jump right in your face or summon a black hole right in the middle of your team you will not be performing very well controls in dota 2 are not as hard as the gameplay itself the generic skill buttons are q w e and r d and f are also used for heroes who use more than 4 skills no worries veterans you can use the legacy hotkeys in dota 2 when it comes to the actual gameplay dota 2 is more of a strategy game than some sort of action game much like the typical rts game you need to plan out your game and change up your plans according to the match you are playing one really important thing about dota 2 would be teamwork without teamwork you cannot do anything past your first few matches this game is built on working as a team and is best played as a 5man team items dota 2 like tf2 has items these items are purely cosmetic and have absolutely no gameplay advantages that come with them dota 2 is a competitive game and if you put a pro player with 6000 hours into dota 2 with someone who never played dota 2 before against eachother the only thing to matter is skill and teamwork there are absolutely no perks or runes as you have in league of legends not even miniscule bonuses everyone is equal the items in this game are made by the community you can make your own items and if they make it into the game you will actually earn money from this game dota 2 items can be sold and bought from the steam marketplace if a set is 13 dollars on the dota 2 store you can buy it for 2 dollars on the marketplace other the hud and main menu for this game are very well made while the hud is rather big it is actually pretty small compared to the amount of information it holds the main menu is well made and easy to navigate at most cases the matchmaking system for this game is not too bad but is rather lacking you will experience alot of difficulties caused by foreign players as you will not be able to communicate with them it is best to get used to being matched with russians when you are playing on us east servers with the english language setting dota 2 has a report system as well as a commend system the report system is rather flawed as people can easily banned for things they didnt do but still the amount of times this happens is rather low punishments for getting reported would be low priority which i will explain later and a communication ban which disables a bunch of your communication features and limits some low priority makes you get matched slower and disabled earing battle points  exp for your profile  and items during gameplay final dota 2 is a valve masterpiece can be played for years to come once you get past the learning curve
recommended
very nice game
recommended
moba game that ive known since i was in elementary school until this time i was 20 years old
recommended
i like that it`s addictive  that every game has its own style that you have to play and know every single hero`s spells and items and that once  year you find nice ppl to play with
recommended
this  is the greatest thing ever  lol
recommended
rating with  stars
recommended
this game is really fun once you figured it out but the learning curve is thick unless you got wonderful team mates to teach you or a really good friend to coach you overall i think everyone should give this game a tryout and learn to kick butt all in all this game is worth it and more so since its free to play so dont fear about wasting money this game will become your addiction soon enough
recommended
yes ing recomended for all of you gamer right there
recommended
i have no life because of this gameand i just love it 
recommended
great game but kind of difficult to learn how to play
recommended
everybody who wants to actually use their brain in a productive way should definitely play this game
recommended
imagine having fun now imagine having even more of that that is what dota is like
recommended
very challenging game
recommended
nice game
recommended
awesome way to loose your life great game say goodbye to friends
recommended
its all about the teamwork baybay d
recommended
ok boys i was trying to learn russian i was trying so hard and the only words ive learned were privet kak dela menya zavut pauls now i can swear in russian and say to someone to go f7ck himself so if you want to swear at ppl without being kicked in your butt go play this game then
recommended
this is very high quality game graphics are very detailed and good but still you can play on low quality and enjoy the thing about this game is that while starting  you wait too much time  match searching and player waiting players often fail to connect second thing if you like rpg games the fact that someone can be first and take the hero that you like want will be terrible and to be short if you dont have enough free time to spend 40 min1hour on match dont start it if you leave  you wll recieve abandon and ruin your teams game butin reality no one knows is it ruining or helping  couse in late game money is everything and your money will be spreaded between your teammates so yea you should try this game if you like competition and sometimes rage

the guy below me was my friend and invited me to play dota 2 with him he is no longer with us 1111 would do again
recommended
its the beste moba game ever
recommended
great game
recommended
this game is part of my life now extremely addicting
recommended
its a great game with so many interesting mechanicsplaystlyecreative playand just overwhelming fun but getting to the peak of funcan be aggravatingly painful and most of the time not worth itwhywell i can go on and on about itone thing that every multiplayer coop game has  teamwork and dota 2 is about teamworkteam synergy and all that stuffbut most players dont caredont know that in order to win the game you need a teama team that comunnicatessupports and work together if youre gonna pick dota 2 up and playexpect insultsexpect no courier but most importantly be politecalm and in controlbecause atleast you tryed and thats what mattersbesides theres always a quit button

recommended
nice game  with nice rules
recommended
this strategy game is awesome it have nice heroes and good skills very different skills with much heroes actually very much its quite hard for starter but if you try to practice or play with friends thats good enough so much items and everything have different stats and effects this game is maximum 5 on 5 no much more except for spectators and coaches you also can fight or team up with friends on lobby or you can make party and invite them to play real match with them team so much cool items i recommend you to play this game its really fun and addicting for me d ps no op hero is made here every hero is balanced

long review for incoming players ok this is a legit review of the game the game is a very fun and addictive game my first moba and i enjoy is a lot when i hook someone as pudge and kill them it is so so rewarding and fun i love it it is a fun game only hard part is learning the items and stuff i would rate the overall gameplay and soundtrack and yada yada 910 awesome game must download however there are negatives but it is not the gameplay it is the players im not talking about noobs hell im a noob like i said this is my first moba most people are really really really rude there are very very cocky players that think they are dendi if new players are reading this it is the winner of internationals and got a mill basically one of the greatest players however they are not they are on your team and the opposing team the ones on your team will constantly put you down for being new to the game they will tell you to uninstall and that you are aweful and should never touch the game because your so bad and worse that is honestly ing  some of the players think they are so high and mighty its honestly disgusting then dont even get me started on the opposiong team they will gloat and gloat when they are in the lead untill you fell utterly useless then they try and provoke you so that they can get a response out of you its like they honestly get enjoyment of just watching you fall ok in conclusion this game is good it looks and runs nice it is highly addictive with some cons like some heros that are above all else strong as  but they have counters that may or may not be actually good at countering lol the absolute wort thing about this game however is the community not everyone is like how i described but it is a good majority as a game is whole i would give it a good 8910 but if that includes the community i would easily say 610 reason being is that people just get to you also that you dont even want to touch the game anymore so you dont have to deal with them if you can take the brick of words that other players throw at you play it if you cant just dont play good game decent community

recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend

in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had

and you thought real life was a struggle

dota 2 ruined my life ^_^
recommended
so of my time playing it all i have to say is holy   d its a skillful game that you have to master and that isnt easybut even so its fun and addicting and its made by valve d everybody loves valve d and by the guy who originally worked on dota 1 packed with amazing heros from dota 1 and new ones coming that keeps it new and freshand all is updated and fixed and balanced in valve style again  now that its out you have no reson to not try itit might be hard to get into but the tutorials and bot games will get you into it pretty quickand the first real games are going to be the hardest but everyone has to go though it keep in mind that the community is harsh to new players and russians but do not let it get to you as its not as bad as it sounds overall a great game that with a little time spent will become your favorite game of all time and then the only problem will be to stop playing d recommended to play with friends for some coop team play and greastest experience
recommended

i think theres a bug or an error about the dropping of items and it seems like not accurate information about the longer you play the more chances of getting an item try to fix it and also the players that we are reporting are you taking of action with that because many players are annoying they ruin the game of others thank you for the authority to recommend d

recommended
after playing many mobas dota 2 continues to be the most polished option out there yet
recommended
its a fun and addictive game
recommended
dota 2 or defense of the ancients 2 is a great free to play game keeping real to the original mod of warcraft 3 many people dont know the origins but this title began as a gamemod for warcraft 3 it was so intuitive and successful that it spawned an entire multiplayer online battle arena or moba genre basically it is a game created maintained funded promoted and played solely by gamers to know that this formula has lead it into a limelight of success is a warm feeling to anyone involved the support this game has received has been phenomenal though the concept is fairly simple dota 2 is a professional game experience much like a game of baseball or football the stage is set in an online computer regulated fantasy battlefield arena which makes the action more interesting and the gameplay more fair players join together in groups of five to take on opponents casually with public matchmaking or by forming professional competitive teams each player picks from a rooster of 100 heroes each with unique abilities and statistics players then battle on a field of war where the two npc armies release waves of troops to engage each other this is where the game refines itself though the stage does not change each battle is unique and requires great concentration and mastery to defeat your enemy to become successful does require a certain level of prowess so it is recommended new players begin by trying out a couple hundred public matchmaking games you might think im joking but that is just the start of the journey as you become more successful your rankings will increase making you more attractive for recruiters unless you already have a team formed and have had previous competitive experience you might not be immediately ready for high level gameplay do not be discouraged however the game is great about teaming you up with players of your own skill level because the game is team based by nature it is natural to meet new friends online to play with it is important to be courteous and not overly rude because your reputation spreads if you are friendly and assist your teammates they may grant you after battle accolades or want to become your friend if you are rude and flaming your teammates will work against you or sometimes quit altogether in your early stages it is important to be open and respectful if youre not sure what to do dont be afraid to ask the game features an awesome built in microphone system so if you own the hardware talking to your opponents is as easy as a click as you complete more battles you earn more rewards experience accolades and friends rewards include special items and equipment for your heroes special effects and modifications to the user interface and stage design custom load screens custom courier graphics custom animations and plenty of exclusives which can be bought and sold on the steam market probably the only downfall here is the high intensity and length these games operate on it is not unusual for a good game to take hours to complete sometimes it can be really heart pounding when you have a close game and both teams are equally matched the minions flood the screen and team battles clash on eventually leading a single team to victory though the game lacks a lot of what a traditional game is expected to have it is still a full experience dota 2 has come a long way and its ambition as a flagship for competitive gamers is something to respect its an awesome experience to be part of having the full support of steam and by having content designed by the player base we see a role for anyone who is not successful with the sometimes overly competitive aspect much of the reason the original defense of the ancients was successful was because the community had such a large input into the designs of the game often the developers recruited within the games player base or other well known modders to help design their masterpiece todays dota 2 sees even larger support having systems in place to collect almost all 3d model submissions when new heroes are designed players are both testers and developers of expansion content this experience makes you feel in touch with the game ultimately however this game is for the players battles are tough and the more experienced you become the more difficult opponents you will become matched with there comes a point where being matched against a fully microphoned team is going to become common because i have played this game for so long and know a lot about it i am not immediately put off by this however be warned prolonged exposure to dota 2 is definitely not a casual experience though i always recommend one conduct themselves in the best manor for an optimum experience you will encounter those who do not agree with these principles dota 2 has become a source of income for some so it is important to those individuals to never lose if you dont really care if you win or lose and are just looking for a quick way to pass the time this game can provide you and a group of friend tons of fun if you are looking to follow the road of success prepare for a difficult journey i definitely recommend dota 2 for all gamers that would call themselves competitive it is simple sleek and sexy highly appealing and easy to pick up best of all free and highly compatible and supported link directly up to your steam account and find out which of your friends play already you might be surprised spending money in this game almost always results in only ascetic changes this game is definitely not a pay to win game in fact one might even generate your own steam dollars by selling the items won from this game download it today

i started playing dota long ago and my life became progressively worse i gained weight rapidly i began isolating myself from social interactions and the little interactions i did participate in  i was very rude and racist towards anyone who even looked at me then i quit because reasons then my life started improving i lost most of the weight i gained i was dating i got a nice job and i excelled in all my university classes then dota2 came out i was given a beta key and it sat in my steam inventory for many months taunting me its red glow symbolizing some deepseated temptation that made me think of nefarious djinns of stories long forgotten so inviting and so beautiful but i knew its secrets and i knew what those secrets did to me but sadly even the strongest and tallest mountain will eventually fall and crumble to the gentle peppering of rain after the fivehundreth im lying it was like 3 probs demand that i start playing my willpower gave in and fell into the blackness once again i could feel some etheral blackness grasp its fingers around my stillrecovering mind as the game finished installed and i pressed that play now button i realized that i just jumped off the bridge that i was so very carefully constructing ever since quitting the first dota everything came rushing back to me one game became ten and ten games became onethousand my girlfriend when i began again has left me already and i feel nothing but pity for her because she only wants me to leave the one i trulty love im gaining weight again but whatever i dont even care  i remember liek when my friend was like wanna come party after exams and i was like no  that lol i have an ih to do i skipped some exams tho cuz i didnt rly have much time to study cuz ti3 was hapepning and i wanted to watch enough games so i wuldnt be mad that i msised it but i had to quit cuz im failing university and its gettin 2 expensive 2 live in campus otherwise 1010 good game i have 700 hours logged into dota2 and im still casual as

cool game although the higher your level the lower drop rates for items would bethe graphics are really good and beautifuli must say this game is far more better than league of legends as most of the heroes in there is imbalancedi mean mostly every hero in that game can 1shot youand also league of legends doesnt have any trading systems and its graphics really sucksrecently i traded with someoneit went well at first but when we were gonna tradehe cancelled it and as result ive been scammedbut its not a problem the item is only worth 001usd better luck next time for scammers like himthats allgood luck to the devs d

recommended
the best game in the world thank you valve corparation
recommended
awesome moba game a little bit harder to play than lol and that scares many people but if you get into the game once its really cool
recommended
this game sucks and has wasted my time thoroughly yet i continue to play it im not sure why but just play it and you might see youll never learn the game inside and out and thats the beginning and the end of it which brings and interesting challenge to the table pros efficent language learning software included current supported languages depend on your region europeans have the special chance to learn russian while americans have the less exotic option of learning spanish russians get to learn the language of annoyed seven year old tryhards amazing learning curve provides intense through all skill and proficency levels one of the best games on the net if you have four friends to play with five counting yourself cons seemingly flawless matchmaking based on historicallyrooted and longlasting chess matching traditions falls short and is simply disgusting all around why you need a full party for it to be good i have yet to find a good fps config for this game but thats not a big deal in any way the intense learning curve intimidates beginners for some reason 70% of people who play cannot speak with any degree of moderate literacy some other  glhf

nice game so easy to play

love the new udate

dota 2 is an uncompromising wilderness survival game full of science and magic but its also about drows thighs now let me slow down for a second and give you a little bit of lore about these godly instruments long ago in the magical city of detriot or somewhere of that nature thighs happened and boy let me tell you they happened well they began their onslaught at roughly 50 hours in game now it was obvious that these thighs were valuable and had to be protected fortunately for everyone the thighs were safe within the innermost regions of the armour that blanketed them what im trying to tell you is that this game is based on the idea of thighs if you are playing this game to get pro dondo hookerinos then you have been mislead this game is not about said dondo this game is about thighs

this is a really good moba style game it has good graphics and gameplay although the community can be quite harsh  play with bots before you start playing vs other people
recommended
i dont generally recommend this game because i dont think people would generally find it fun the best way to try it though would be with friends that are already very familiar with the game and would enjoy teaching you if thats the case give it a shot if you want to play it solo however be prepared for an abysmal time
not recommended

dota 2 is a great game i really enjoy the realisticness of the game compared to league of ledgends and would reccomend it to anyone also plus side is that ithe in game purchase content half the price of league and some how is still has a big prize pool for the competitve scene and a nice setup with the compendium
recommended
therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets

this is a game of commitment you will lose but you will learn from your mistakes this is a very addicting game and if you get good enough the prize pools get to enourmous amounts larger than lol

only play this game if youre willing to get obsessed to the highest level and not play any other game amazing
recommended
have you ever wanted to be shouted at by russians well now you can with dota 2 1010
recommended
the best game
recommended
if you enjoy endless hours of bloodboiling rage this is the game for you features  russians who believe every server is the russian server and every language is the russian language that enjoy nothing more than to ruin a good game also known to play extremely solitary refuse to listen to tips and abandon after a torrent of stereotypical insults   your mom etc usually after having fed before doing so  matchmaking which will move heaven and earth to make sure you dont dare reach too highly above that 50% win margin it likes nothing more than to  on your parade when youve had a good run of games by dragging the scourges of the mariana trench tier into your team to balance the game instead of matching 10 equally skilled players together  reports did you get matched with russians yes [x] no [ ] if yes chances are despite having done absolutely nothing wrong you will be reported for god knows what you will be reported for going to lane going into the jungle taking a single last hit off a carry dying once getting a kill that your carry 1500 units away wanted giving out advice speaking english on english servers buying items they dont like picking skills they dont like picking heroes they dont like pretty much any ridiculous reason you can imagine they will report you for it this usually doesnt mean much but  mute system now with only two reports you will be automatically muted in game so you only need to annoy two people be it friendly or enemy in any fashion and you will get report for comms abuse even if you didnt say a single thing those games this system is ridiculously easy to abuse as i do it myself and everytime i jump on dota 2 to see that sign pop up saying someones been punished for absolutely nothing i just sit and think of valve and how they know what theyre doing supposedly not to mention people are overly sensitive and need to grow thicker skin in dota 2 because god forbid you say a bad word otherwise youll be stoned to death by hypocrites did i forget to say there was always already a mute system in game before this automatic one which worked completely fine because there was and still is im sure i could continue this list for another good while but i think thus far sums up a fair bit the game itself is wonderful very enjoyable and can be extremely gripping with the plays that can be pulled when you get that 1 in 100 game where everyone on both teams is of a good skill level these games are the ones that make dota 2 worthwhile however unfortunately you have to go through those 100 games of utter  and misery to reach these seldom found game

singsing is everywhere singsing is all around us even now in this very room you can see singsing when you look out your window or when you turn on your television you can feel singsing when you go to work when you go to church when you pay your taxes singsing is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth

this game is so good
recommended
dota 2 this game steals your life more than stannic and any other lifesteal item combined some people might this game hard well not some maybe everyone but once you get to handle the heroes you cant stop closing the game there is a fact this games such as dota increase your brain by 19% overall several of my friends hated gaming until when dota 2 was payed and it used to give like 1015 gifts i gave to several of my friends and they have more than 2k hours logged in to this game recommend this game to everyone 1010 plus point you might learn russian spanish and several other languages

recommended
this game well i dont know where to start for you looking at this game with out even playing it you may see a hero brawler that the objective is to destroy the other teams base but thats not what i saw when i looked at dota 2 on steam for the first time i saw an complicated version of classic hero brawler so i said no screw this ill go play a game that makes sense so i started playing league of legends or lol which lasted me about 3 months until i came to a realization that lol was simply dull it did not make me think and the people they just made the game horrible and enjoyable sure their was the few great games that truly said this is true teamwork but overall i every time i played a new game i would sigh then choose one of the 3 overly expensive heros i had purchased then stared at the unimpressive dull graphics and then got yelled at my team mate for stealing his creep last hit so then after staring at the dota 2 page on steam for a few minutes and watching a few video guides on how to survive as a noob in dota 2 finally i pressed download and slowly but surely it downloaded and after have a friend beat the tutorial for me i played my first bot match after four minutes i quit because it simply just made no sense i didnt comeback to dota until a friend invited me to play dota and i warned him to be careful because i would probably just feed the other team but he urged me on and forced me to play a bot game he explained the basics and while me and him coordinated the first blood play i realized the greatness in this game it was having great friends that you can rely on to pop a healing salve on you right before you did and they save your life or when you and your friend find someone jungling in your jungle so you and him just destroy him with mass damage and you both start laughing but in dota 2 another great aspect about it is that you must think you have to react predict hope about what may happen to you i feel i have just gotten started with this game and i already play over 125 hours overall dota 2 has some great features that make it step out from some hero brawler likes dota 2 has some great teamwork when you talk it is a great mind game that helps you with strategy that makes you think can be a easy win for you if you just use simple teamwork has great graphics compared to most mobas dislikes intense learning curve you can be matched up with a horrible team that just trolls you overall score 879

side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk

its like roulette fun until it turns into russian

causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend

in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had
recommended
and you thought real life was a struggle

i only played a little but it was fun

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

its like having an abusive girlfriend youll get yelled at stomped on and smacked around so much youll cry yourself to sleep every night but every once in a great while shell give you a peck on the cheek and a tiny little tickle youll feel the greatest sense of worth and acomplishment youve ever experienced until the beatings continue a few moments later you know youre being beaten and bloodied every minute you spend with her but you cant bring yourself to leave her and you never will 1010
recommended
imo if youre thinking about league or dota dota ill give the score but beneath that will be reasons dotas better than the next moba youll try to pick up dota2910 pros every hero is free so no real money needed except skins no real money to buy that good champ you want good community much more rewarding for a skilled player its not that other mobas are easy but more towards the idea of them taking less focus better graphics and particles imo because some can reason that their bad voice chat allowing skilled party members to quickly say what they need to say rather than typing very balanced everything is weak against something else cons laggy at times occasionaly youll find a toxic player very rude much harder to git gud at due to high experience needed  oh yeah and some people stay on the wrong server despite being spanish brazillian russian

dota 2 a moba or rts call whatever you like is a game with a sole purpose to destroy each teams ancients it originated from warcraft 3 frozen throne custom map dota popularized by icefrog this game can be played 1v1 solo mid 3v3 2v2 couple match or the most popular 5v5 with different game modes in a 5v5 match you need to have a good synergy with hero pools chosen or drafter a nice team play and nice communication to own and win a game lacking of one will entail difficulty in pushing defending lanes and team fights dota2 differs from other moba out there in terms of hero availability complexity of item and teamplay for some who wants try dota go ahead and experience a new game that will hook you to play more and more and forget about other moba you are in to
recommended

its good d
recommended
i liked this dota 2 the way it is
recommended
its a wonderful game
recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend
recommended
in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had
recommended
and you thought real life was a struggle
recommended
i only played a little but it was fun

this game has to be one of the most techinical games i have ever played dota 2 is emersive and with a good team of 5 players you can enjoy hours of domination but with a team that lacks the bit of communication and players that are selfish it will sink your team just like the titanic

a very fun and good to play with friends
recommended
this is truly an amazing game join now 
recommended
i used to play league of legends but i found this to be a less repetitive and overall funner game and the learning curve is very steep but its easy to get over the hump if you play wih people who know how to play and it becomes very fun indeed

i have tried rosetta stone i have tried rocketlanguages i have even tried tell me more but all have been proven to be naught but a midsummer nightmare none of those programs have helped my progression like dota 2 dota 2 has proven time and time again to have by far the most powder in its shot when it comes to russian language proficiency with its massive array of russian tutors who have taught me many useful words such as  and xaxaxaxaxax i can not comprehend how anyone would find anything better i have a face now 1010 would gg ez again

recommended
i love this game 
recommended
the game itself is something wonderful i who have only started by playing dota 2 and not any of the other forebears such as lol hon or the original dota must say that i love this type of strategy game the heroes are rather amazing to play with the vast variety and the dynamic gameplay is brilliant granted there are some problems with the amount of updates required that do screw up the gameplay at times dota 2 is by far one of the best games in my opinion
recommended
this moba game is really good to play with friends

dota 2 is a nice game to play with and so far the most successful and supported game in event ti1 ti2 t13 and the overwhelming ti4 but the recent change punishment for those who failed to ready up in a game is absurd i failed to ready up a game recently and i was prevented from match making for 24hrs omg 24hrs is just absurd for unable to ready up in a game how much more if abandoning a game 2days 1week 1month im just hoping punishments will be reasonable if ever i failed to ready up in a game not an abandon

i started playing dota long ago and my life became progressively worse i gained weight rapidly i began isolating myself from social interactions and the little interactions i did participate in  i was very rude and racist towards anyone who even looked at me then i quit because reasons then my life started improving i lost most of the weight i gained i was dating i got a nice job and i excelled in all my university classes then dota2 came out i was given a beta key and it sat in my steam inventory for many months taunting me its red glow symbolizing some deepseated temptation that made me think of nefarious djinns of stories long forgotten so inviting and so beautiful but i knew its secrets and i knew what those secrets did to me but sadly even the strongest and tallest mountain will eventually fall and crumble to the gentle peppering of rain after the fivehundreth im lying it was like 3 probs demand that i start playing my willpower gave in and fell into the blackness once again i could feel some etheral blackness grasp its fingers around my stillrecovering mind as the game finished installed and i pressed that play now button i realized that i just jumped off the bridge that i was so very carefully constructing ever since quitting the first dota everything came rushing back to me one game became ten and ten games became onethousand my girlfriend when i began again has left me already and i feel nothing but pity for her because she only wants me to leave the one i trulty love im gaining weight again but whatever i dont even care  i remember liek when my friend was like wanna come party after exams and i was like no  that lol i have an ih to do i skipped some exams tho cuz i didnt rly have much time to study cuz ti3 was hapepning and i wanted to watch enough games so i wuldnt be mad that i msised it but i had to quit cuz im failing university and its gettin 2 expensive 2 live in campus otherwise 1010 good game i have 700 hours logged into dota2 and im still casual as

recommended
best game ever 100 000 000 peoples play that game d

lol has nothing against this uprising in dota 2 not hating on league but dota has this feel mobas just wont be able to improve on or make similar to i stopped playing this game recently but my interests to it have drwan me back with the game becoming bigger and bigger its setting a new margain for the guys behind dota 2 but i feel what the community wants incorporated in the game willl be seen even though i feel the game is spot on for a moba even though i havent played hero of the storms yet p but in other words nothing is better then f2p so go and try this game you will not regret it

i thought i enjoyed this game i played public pickups for quite a bit having never played a moba before i spent a lot of time reading up and watching videos before even playing so that i knew some basic terminology and callouts and general strategy for two characters that i could get started with based on my pub experience i would have said i felt like an average player after a few dozen hours nothing special but enjoying myself and seeing that i could grow over time unfortunately experiences with other players generally sucked almost never got a full game going people always dropped out within the first few minutes nobody ever communicated because despite being on amer server more than half of the players tend to be russian brazilian etc im sure it wasnt enjoyable for them to be grouped with people that they couldnt communicate with either the one real positive aspect i felt was that i didnt experience much of the absolute hate and bile that mobas and dota are known for and that i was warned about before trying to play that was when i was playing in pubs then i was invited into a group to play i guess everyone i played with was much more experienced than me because the game was nothing like i had experienced in pubs i made them aware that i had no clue what i was doing and was completely new to the whole genre having a little experience and done some readingvideo watching i started the match off with high hopes by the end of the match i had experienced a bunch of yelling and angry correction by teammates most frustratingly i found myself being chastised by teammates for not doing one thing  and then when i did as instructed being chastised again for doing that  i dont mind being corrected im open to guidance and learning how to play    but this experience was so frustrating i learned nothing as a result of being told to do one thing and then chastised for it when doing it instead of something else not to mention people being audibly frustrated by my not being aware of complex combinations between characters and equipment and strategy something i dont see how i could be expected to know so early in my experience as a result that was the only grouped game i ever played the only higher ranking nonpub game i ever played it was also the last game of dota period that i played i logged off and after a few days i uninstalled the game i have not been back in almost two years i should clarify that im not easily dissuaded for games and i dont have a problem with abrasive communities racist hateful etc is a different thing  but i can handle fair criticism and enjoy trash talking this was just more than i could take especially combined with the incredible learning curve that ramped way up between pub seeming to be worthless to play as everyone told me you dont learn anything in a pub and actual games way more advanced almost immediately and difficult to be of value in as a newbie anyway i envy those people who have made it over that curve and somehow reached a point where theyre a successful knowledgeable experienced player who can hold their own in serious competition and dont constantly feel like the heel dragging everyone down that everyone wants to disconnect i just somehow couldnt get there as a result i ultimately despise this game but cant help but recommend that someone give it a try there are very few flaws that seem to be inherent to the game itself and the complexity and variety truly offers endless play
recommended
great game steep learning curve though
recommended
best game never get tired of playing it d
recommended
tiny is very happy rock 1010
recommended

recommended
totally fun warning not suitable for children
recommended
this is the best strategy games
recommended
this game improved so much since it was released on the beta there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1 i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers i know some people who play lol might bash in this game but both games are compleatly different its like comparing cod and battlefield they are so different that connot be compared no preference on either game i think bot of them are good give this game a try the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development try it out its free and badass
recommended
great game

recommended
great multiplayer game
recommended
very entertaining takes a while to learn but keeps you hooked up for a long time
recommended
had a friend who played this game a lot got along with him well for a few years i played this for a few hours and its a total trollfest nervewracking how terrible the community is in this game it is not worth the price of free one mistake early and you lose the whole game but it takes about an hour for that loss to happen so during that time you are forced to play a losing game or get penalties for quitting anyhow my friend played this nonstop for a few years turned him into a totally rude nutbar to the point that i unfriended the prick i think the community of this game rotted him out luckily i never met him in real life that would be sad to see a real life friend get degraded into an animal before you this game is toxic i played enough online games to see this right away stay away this is a moneymaking machine for valve with psychological sideeffects not worth the free pricetag on the game
not recommended
very nice game i think i very like it
recommended
stop fooling around play this game already
recommended
i hope that all the heroes will be soon released 
recommended
its alright ish

recommended
the game my favourite
recommended
really fun and competitve gameplay if you want to be a racisist andor you love russia heres an example mestun now the russian  meing russians
recommended
if youre a gamer you would probably have heard of the term moba which stands for multiplayer online battle arena and one of the games leading the way in that genre is dota since thats where it basically all began dota 2 is a direct sequel to the original bringing us updated graphics and easier controls making the already difficult game a bit more accessible to newer people for the genre this game is very much like a sport in which it requires lots of strategies and teamcoordination in order to win however much like a sport it requires time and patience to hone your skills in order to be good at it so if youre willing to put the effort into it dota 2 can be an extremely enjoyable and satisfying experience for you just be wary that there are a considerable number of players in the community who can be considered toxic and can be very unfriendly if you can somehow try to avoid them as much as possible eg only playing with friends you know youre going to have a blast with this game good luck and have fun 
recommended
so good and exciting game u must try it

recommended
best game for make a newfriend make a laugh and make me happy everytime i playing this game
recommended
after 6 years of dota here are my thoughts on dota 2 mmr is broken as  skill gap between players is as big as valves profits made from tf2 hats matchmaking is horrible even in rankeds got matched up with someone with 100 hours fed 317 as riki at least two russians guaranteed on your team on euw eu pubs are even worse dont get me started on them uninstalled also 682 ew ew ew ewwww

recommended
best gamed played ever
recommended
i can kill midgets with a sword if i please 1110
recommended
you lose faith in humanity opens your eyes to the sub par intelligence of the world makes you feel like life isnt worthy half the time
recommended
its a nice game so no problems is present in dota2
recommended
all i can say is the game is awesome
recommended
the moba that started it all just got better the original moba has been redesigned and tweaked to be even better now usually sequils are s% but this one  well its that good multiple servers and a rich online presence makes for a greate online experience and the social aspect of this game keeps you coming back for more online cursing russian experts noob namecalling has made itself a home here so if youre starting out be prepared to get $5% on once again the game has a flat match system so whether youve been playing for years or just started last week each and every person starts each match on the same level with the same heroes and same gold all items and purchased content are asthetic in short fifa for nerds but be warned this game will take over your life and ruin any chance of you having a career true story
recommended
addicting
recommended
pros requires strategy obviously needs teamwork to win makes you think for others rather than yourself awesome hero customizations and skins easy ui and hotkeys for your convenience requires technique and precision of skill execution unlike similar games cons not for the greedy player lacks old and new heroes from dota soloists will have a hard time playing around the map gives you the habit of overspending because of awesome items public pairings are very random you either pair up with noobs or quitters or maybe dendi or singsing themselves overall its a great game a chip o the old block from dota 1duhhh they need to add more awesome items and customization for heroes same goes with the selection no frost wyvern arc warden and other upcoming heroes whoknows icefrog and the others will put
recommended
this game is superb not only in the sense that it have a good graphics but also you can change the heroes outfits
recommended
ruined my life cant stop play
recommended
1 word to say awesome

this game is awesome and just want to recommend to all players in the world instead of becoming a drug addict
recommended

recommended
dota 2 is like a drugs so addictive hehehehe
recommended
cool game  download it d
recommended
adicting game fun to play with or without friends takes ages to master it in every way complex enough to have a pro scene with a bunch of money in it better than lol better than hon or any other moba game out there russians flooding western servers is the only problem there is nice one indeed
recommended
incredibly steep learning curve incredibly insane community  but also incredibly rewarding if you just choose to give it a chance you will definitely not regret it
recommended
this is the best story driven shooter of all time
recommended
really good
recommended
once you dota you never go back y
recommended
i think dota 2 is the best moba game 
recommended
this game is amazing ive been playing for a while now and i honestly have to say it has the best community ever i was playing in a low priorty match and got a full team of russians they are amazing players i never knew crystal maiden can play mid againt an outworld devourer until i saw the russians do it when i started out the community welcomed me by calling me their  i think it means brother this was an amazing game and im glad i left leauge of lesbians for it
recommended
yes i amthis game is so annoying than others and also its a free to play gamemany can play this game because of the liscence and also many love it because of the graphic game hope this can be the most number one game in steam

recommended

recommended
when your new to dota you feel as though everyone else overpowers you but then after ages of hitting that random button you find that one hero that just suits your play style in everyway dotas selection of heros pretty much covers all play styles from a tanky support to a stealthy nuker though your first few games can be painful just hang in there baby steps ect
recommended
very frustrating gamepublic matchmacking is made to test your patiencein half the games people dont speak english and in half of them they play as if they are on drugsdefinitely recommended
recommended
if you need a challenge in a team based game if you want to play a game without running out of things to learn if youre one of those having fun battleing and beating an equal opponent by outsmarting and communicating better this is the game warcraft 3 dota in better graphics you need it
recommended
it will waste your life but it is so worth it 1010

recommended
dota 2 oh what can i say  i had never played dota ever dota 2 was recommended to me by a friend of mine claming that its just like diablo but with pvp elements only i always loved diablo and thought well why not so i downloaded it the game got froze on loading screen and i was stuck i never played it ever after that only when i saw a friend total playtime 4000 hours i was swept from feets i reinstalled it looked for cure for that freezing bug found it applied it they game ran trust me for starting 20 hours i had no clue what the  was happening i was seeing a lot  and noob it was all disastrous then happened miracle i started understaning terms like feed feeder last hit kill steal stuffs and from then on i have lost my job lost my gf didnt even went to my parents funeral my dog died in the same room i lived thank you dota 2 u have given me heavenly pleasures

recommended

recommended
i cry when teammates are bad game wastes my time and money my keybinds are weird help 1010 would reccomend
recommended
dota 2 is one of the best games that i played good and bad wherever you are in the game it all depends on your own there not by others you are the one who determines how you will play
recommended
when i first played the game i was confused and didnt understand the strategy behind mobas frustrated i quit the game for a year but i came back to try again i learned from my mistakes and took in some advice along with watching a few videos on the basics of the game once i had a grasp of it and knew what i was doing i began to enjoy the game much much more the game has great lore simple controls and an easytouse shop this game is also truly f2p yes you can buy items from the market that use actual realworld money but these items are purely cosmetic and do not give you an advantage whatsoever most of these cosmetic items can be earned by simply playing the game which in my opinion makes it truly f2p this game also has excellent steam integration with free guides to help you learn the game in short this is a fantastic game that i intend to spend many more hours playing i fully recommend this title to gamers of all skill levels
recommended
u have to play it thats all
recommended
the only game that teaches you the correct spelling of russian curse words
recommended
multiplayer strategy based fps game  the best thing in game everybody is equal and a game takes 3060 mins you cant buy anything makes you advantageous its great but takes some time to learn it you can watch tournaments firstly

recommended
hello guys <3 i really like this game
recommended
the game can be played at any skill level but the beauty is that at higher levels there is so much depth that no two games are ever alike the only issue is that it is difficult to improve without having someone friendly better than you who will actively call out your mistakes in dota 2 ignorance is not bliss
recommended
love this game just play it now dude
recommended
this game will frustrate you at first then once you get your first ultra kill you will forget you have other games

recommended
an awesome game and im into racing and cars a bit of a learning curve but highly rewarding once you get into even the average skilled matches i suggest to read guides and practice last hitting and denying for a while in passive difficulty in a custom game you cant get too good at last hitting
recommended

with dota ive spent almost half of my life when i was 14 i started with warcraft 3 it was amazing  then few years later friends dragged me to dota since that time i never really stoped playing few years ago valve announced its own dota game in cooperation with icefrog a lot of my mates were sceptical because of previous attempts for new dota  lol and hon  were ultimate failure to them i wasnt because of icefrog since the very beginning i believed in icefrog and in valve and just few weeks after first international i got my own betakey and started to play it from the very beggining i was so excited about this icefrog kept everything same just upgraded things that needed upgrade graphics some key mechanics which were limited by warcraft ive spent over 10 000 hours in dota2 dont get confused by hours count on this account ive got a lot of smurfs and countless hours in dota overall ive met hundreds of amazing people on offline tournaments just because of dota countless of amazing people online for almost decade this game was part of my life and i gotta say thank you icefrog and valve and everyone involved in this dota 4ever <3

this game has given me sleepless nights i tend to play a hero and learn about its skills and practice on how to master the appropriate strategy sometimes i fail because i let my guard down but it is still part of the game the online concept of dota 2 is better since i get a chance to play with everybody the all hero challenge is the best feature i think since i have to play all characters to complete the cycle please fix all bugs on this challenge so we may be able to proceed and enjoy the game

most people on steam have probably heard the name of this game countless times now so let me give you a short and simple review on it get it now that thats out of the way try and use the tips i am about to give you so you can get he best possible experience that this game has to offer dota 2 has a steep learning curve meaning you cant just jump in there and expect to know what you are doing when you first launch the game as of recently you are taught how to play through the tutorial the game has to offer actually pay attention to this or it will bite you in the  when you are actually playing once you get that over with youre probably going to say to yourself ok i think i get what i am doing let me play online matchmaking heres one simple answer for you no dota 2 requires a team effort and what i mean by a team effort is that if 1 person does something it will affect the team if 1 person does bad the team will take the toll of that 1 person so if you are going straight into matchmaking with almost no experience you are most likely going to die a lot get yelled at close the game and never come back trust me i should know because that was my first experience with dota 2 now what i do recommend you do is either practice by yourself or with friends in an offline bot match that way if you do bad you dont feel bad for perhaps costing the team the game not only is this better as you keep playing you will learn more and more about the game try and find someone that is experienced to help you understand the game and help you progress in skill for it once you feel that you are more knowledgeable about the game you can go ahead and do perhaps coop bot and then onto the traditional matchmaking where it is 5v5 team fights dota 2 is one my favorite games to date the fact that i have this gem another chance makes me lucky try to follow the tips i provided in this recommendation and i guarantee you that you will not be dissappointed with dota 2
recommended

recommended
an evolution of the defense of the ancients a spin off from warcraft 3 it has the signiture and feel of its predicesor with a much added kick in graphics and almost everything else the game tries its best to branch out from its older version and i must say it is succeding with every step it makes the biggest thing though which separates it greatly from the the old dota is the market place and the punishment system which punishes players for leaving the game unfinished and for being rude to other players it is this system which separates and cements this game into something of a higher level the only downside is that you need a gaming computer with high end specs in order to enjoy the game 100 percent while most first world country wont have any problems with this players living in third world countries might have an unfair disadvantage when playing online overall the game raises the bar for other games out there in this genre

side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk

this game can make your mind to practice multi tasking 
recommended
the extent of the game is just enormous every game even with exactly same 10 heroes is different every time ofcourse community judging by ingame experience of 4000h is quite discouraging and offensive but which games isnt over the years of evolution and growth of players in dota 2 ive noticed that even people from all around a world can work together as a team sometimes even without any marks pings or words ofcourse there will be dissagreenment with players cause its competetivity that keeps hatred directing to anyone alse but yourself i can say that people should pay abit more attention to people in your team or at least watch a replay of your own game when you lost or won with quite a bad score examine your mistakes rather then blame others and youll find the interest and pleasure that i found n this game best regards to valve dont promise something youre planing to make on exact date better notify us with a word around on updates and changes dates  910
recommended
as you might know dota 2 is a moba game but despite the others games i think dota is better you may ask why   the answer is simple  you can customise heroes for free and as you want you can choose your favourite hud and announcernow about graphicsthey are really good even in low quality and imagine if in low quality are that good think how good they can be at high qualitydota has a darker concept for the heroesand at last the gameplaywellmost of moba players are saying that is harderi found it really easy once you learn the items and how that hero is supposed to gomaybe i found it easier because is a more strategic game than the other gamesi can say only this except dota 2 ive played 4 other mobas and the most ive enjoyed is dota 2 i dont force you to play and like this game but i hope you will try at least to play a while and enjoy your play good luck & have fun 
recommended
this game is really something lots of adventures and tactics it was superb awesome
recommended
this game has not got much to it on paper 2 teams with a base each with 3 ways in defended by evenly placed towers however it is still playable and addictive with loads of characters and item combinations across teams each game is different and lasts about 3040 mins it started as a warcraft 3 mod so expect some familiar concepts it is going to be free to play at some point so when it is i would at least give it a go you can also buy cosmetic items but nothing to give an advantage over the moaning cheapskates 
recommended
endless addiction the possible outcome from every game is different play till you drop

this game is very addicting and also very fun i have to say i enjoyed playing every single bit of this game with a variety of heroes you can use the servers are really near to where you live and i can play at around 2050 ping and with no lag although the game is fun it has a learning curve and it also takes a while to get used to my final verdict for this game overall is a 910 simply outstanding edit game also develops racism towards people best exclusive feature a game can have

its a great leap from dota 1 and it has a lot of visual enhancements and the interface is great where it allows one to get everything without having to jump around from site to site
recommended
this game rocks
recommended
dota is a game that can not be described in a few words nor can it be mastered in a few hours you will find yourself playing dota to learn it in the first 200hrs and then you will keep playing it because you just cant get enough one would think that 200 hours is crazy but trust me and try this game out and you will find yourself over 1k hours on it just like me who in all honesty started out as the biggest noob in dota maybe i still am but you just cant stop playing this game i give it a 910 9 because sometimes the community will get you mad and make you not wanting t play for a while just a while 
recommended
still the best rts game ever thanks to icefrog for making dota
recommended
perfect game
recommended
good game actually
recommended
without doubt the best moba out there but i got to be honest its hard to master its ruthless and the community is generally awful but if you can endure these things you will have an awesome experience playing it
recommended
although much easier than dota1 dota 2 is a circuit of sophistication and classic that brings moba games i recommend you to download it and enjoy every minute spent on it gl hf d
recommended
addictive but should have seperated into more servers for different country too much ununderstandable languages
recommended
youll play it a bunch
recommended
and
recommended
get this game i hate it<3

a standard match of dota 2 features the strongholds of two opposing factions the radiant and the dire containing critical structures called ancients which are surrounded by a number of lesser buildings the bases of these two factions are connected by three main paths referred to as lanes which are guarded by defensive towers as well as autonomous units called creeps which periodically spawn in groups and traverse the lanes attacking enemy units or structures they encounter the dota 2 map is functionally symmetrical despite having a number of critical differences conferring a variety of advantages and disadvantages to each side the radiant is based at the southwest corner of the map while the dire is based at the northeast corner the two sides are divided by a river that runs perpendicular to the central lane the two teams typically composed of five players each are pitted against one another to compete as the defenders for their respective ancients[6] featured across the map are hostile units referred to as neutrals which are not aligned to either faction and are primarily located in the forests located on the northeast side of the river is a boss called roshan who typically requires multiple team members to kill and drops strategically powerful items

why i would recommend this game is once u get your first item you will want them all love it when new things come out because ill want them and when u first get into the game youll have no idea what your doing but as you play more and more you will learn that the game is really fun the only downside is when the spanish and russian people are on us servers so thats why i think you should play dota i give it a 1010 best free 2 play game ever
recommended
this is a sport
recommended
pretty good game
recommended
pretty good game

awesome game what beats running around with a hero fighting other heroes while leveling up if you have not played the dota mod for warcraft iii or demigod give this a try why not after all it is free and no it is not pay to win kinda free the community is sometimes kinda rough for newer players so i would not let it discourage you from playing you could jsut do what i do and ignore them
recommended
why would you play any other moba thats right you shouldnt gg

forget paying money for a language learning software like rosetta stone no teacher program or audio book will help you as much as dota 2 will follow these simple steps 1 download dota 2 2 play the game mode all pick 3 leave and abandon the game 4 continue to do this until youre into low priority 5  6 brbrbrbr huehuehuehue gib mune pls as you can see i now speak fluent brazilian the only thing i dont like is that the program teaches you to curse before teaching you actual words 810 innovation 710 user interface 110 community 1010 would recommend if you br your hue and you gib mune plz

recommended
this game is worse than cancer 1010

im meat hooked to this game its amazing in other words fuq league
recommended
nice for competitive play need some patience matches are long

the remake of a popular mod that valve eventually bought like cs or tf2 but that doesnt matter what matters is that its a full game of that map that you loved to play on wc3 better graphics smoother gameplay easier matchmaking and items that customize your hero appearance potrait even spell animationsthat actually require money but you can get it by playing as for gameplay its much smoother that wc3 and has gorgeos graphics because it runs on a modified source engine easier to play even easier to pick up for new players and youll play with people of your skill level items are easier to build heroes are very well balanced there is no hero that excells in every area and no single match is the same every match different strategy different heroes and different enemies only downside that i really care about is the community people does not know how to put their language preferences on their native language or the language that they actually speak every game you have that 1 or 2 guys that doesnt understand anything you say or a bunch of russians thatll rage over every single small mistake you make sea na euwest eueast servers are all full of russians russians are everywhere except for the russian server and while ill admit that there are some good russians who speak english and actually communicates with their team and not yell  blyat through their mic but theyre not that common overall good game very well balanced i give dota 2 910 recommended game but beware of the russiansor pinoysor brazilliansor so ive heard
recommended
the classic wc3 map from icefrog totally revamped and upgraded to fit in the esports sceneone of the best games i ever played and continue to play without getting even a little boredit is getting better and better by the time as updates keep comingthis year every team member of the team that wins the main event of dota 2 will be a millionairethats astounding for 4 years of existence in the moba genre which changed after the arrival of this game

ive finished this game in about 40min its pretty cool tough there are some events like every 6months or so so every 6months you have 40min of gametime pretty good the best aeon of strife styled fortress assault game going on two sides created until now
recommended
this is awesome
recommended
i love this game
recommended
this is a good game it is not dumbed down and it sticks to its core more then any other in the genre the meta may change a bit every now and then and heroes rise and fall but it never feels too bad play it

very fun its hard in the beginning but if you played some games its really fun to play for all the new players i shall recommend to first play versus bots or else if you go online you get hate and maybe get reported also you need time for this game 1 game is about 3045 minutes if you dont have that time and leave the game you come in low priority that means you wont get any items or experience and first need to do 6 games in low priority to get out of it goodluck

it was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity it was the season of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair we had everything before us we had nothing before us we were all going direct to heaven we were all going direct the other way  in short the period was so far like the present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received for good or for evil in the superlative degree of comparison only
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
i recommend this game 
recommended
it a game for all

good trader man addme

great fun when you get a well matched game although that might be only 1 in 5 games due to the matchmaking system despite this dota2 is a hihly polished game and i would highly recommend it and of course its completely free thank you valve 
recommended
its a challenging game 100% recommended
recommended
to anyone actually bothering to read the review section for the most played game on steam i would like to say this is a wonderful game with tons of replay and the possiblity to be both the best and worst game you have ever played now while the game is fun and despite what many say mostly balanced as in any hero can be beaten through some means that arent throwing youre entire team at them it also houses some of the worst interactions between players in any game period constant hate from anyone who has the ability or lack there of to type is common for many games when you commit even the slightest mistake in a game with a notorious learning curve this will not stop you from playing if you can survive the horrible learning process as when you finally win a game after getting a double rampage you will never be able to stop regardless of how many slurs and racist comments are throw your way when you miss one stun overall this is a wonderful game provided you have the self confidence to survive your first few weeks but remeber learn from the horrible comments you hear dont repeat them some may acutally have some good advice emphasis on some

of the halfdozen people i started learning dota 2 with three still play regularly though there are hundreds of thousands of players of our approximate skill level populating the matchmaking queues the four of us are more like each other than we are like anyone else playing valves isometric wizardemup spending a year learning to shuffle a gaggle of fantasy heroes up dotas teetering stack of rules and game mechanics will do that to you weve developed a secret language of our own one that runs parallel to the talk of creeps and lanes and farm and rax common to everyone who plays the game whack a ward on the donkletron im going to stick one up their jungle is a sentence i can say out loud and be completely understood by at least those three people for some reason theres also a lot of singing involved its a lot like being a sailor

dota 2 you can love it hate it or both at the same time dota 2 is the reboot of the original dota game made in 2005 and is owned by the company valve dota 2 is a mmoba or massive multilayer online battle arena and the objective of the game is to be able to destroy the enemys ancient you do this by picking from the 112 unique heroes that are available for you for free for ever the game itself is similar to its predecessor as well as other mmobas but adds new mechanics as well as customization items for most of the heroes the game play is smooth and well refined all the heroes have there own unique play style and it fits well with the game dota 2 although it may not have mind blowing effects still manages to look astonishing as well as not stressing your computer too hard and if you dont like the way something looks you can change it valve introduces a cosmetic system that adds no benefits or hindrances to the game but it allows you to make the game the way you want whether you like cruel dire tide or crystallized manna there are cosmetics and other customization items for everyone the game also has a ranked system for more serious players who want to make it to a team replayability is a huge part of a game and dota 2 has it there are multiple game modes ranging from a random hero to drafting a whole team with this system it will take a while to be able to get board of dota 2 for a ranking all around i would have to give it a 9510 due to some minor flaws this is shown in ranked they need a way to measure the single person and not just the team as a whole this can lead to being trapped in low brackets
recommended
this game has ruined my social life and career why is this game so addicting
recommended
this will be the best moba in the world forever stick to the classics

seriously ive gone from paying heroes of newrth to league of legends to dota and the only game ive stuck to playing constantly out of the three is dota i find it easier than hon but more challenging than league i have no major glitches like i did when i played league and i love all the heroes that can be played ive gotten quite a few of my friends to either pick dota 2 back up or to start playing it like any other game you run into a few rude players but otherwise the community is great i highy recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play like league or hon

recommended
do you already have anger problems well you will have after 5 games of dota 2
recommended
great game
recommended
im exhausted from all this studying i havent done
recommended
this good game i like this game
recommended
its dota 2 play it dumbow lelele
recommended
one of the best team based games you can play today strong learning curve but thats pretty much the norm for all games that have spawned from the genre the original dota pioneered as a mod for warcraft 3 best played with friends with a microphone after some decent practice games cannot beat the price of free either
recommended
very addicting
recommended
the best
recommended
recommended for team play play with ur mates for extreme satisfaction xd
recommended
i like the game so much because i learned that no matter how hard the situatuion is if you believe in yourself you will win the game have many skilled players as well as new players im a typical player with an average mmr and ive played this game for almost a year so i can say there are different types of players some say that this game sucks because of noobs or noisy or annoying players that will make you play bad and look bad as well i cant deny that fact because i myself have experienced it but you guys know what i do i ignore them and play well for me the most difficult ally to have in a game is ourselves because if have short amount of patience or if were so boastful we might ruin the game of others remember any proffesional gamer in the world can lose if the team doesnt have a teamplay dota is a team competitive game if you cant help yourself being boastful and have a short patience dont play dota play solitaire or pinball would be better for you
recommended
before playing this game i never rage or flamed anyone prepare your mental before playing this game because most of the time you would get russianperuvianpinoy as your teammate and they will make you flame the  out of them after 18k hours of playing this game i am now calm and collected i just give up and play the game because whatever i say they wont understand anyway
recommended
this game is gonna start the 3rd world war against russia
recommended
full of strategy  recommended for you guys
recommended
the best team game experience  strategy game you can find in the industry  dota simply combines all the great ideas into one competitive match  many games try to copy dota 2s mechanism and playstyle but they fail by a long shot
recommended
intrested in a fight 
recommended
great
recommended
if you have basic from dota 1 you should explore here quite different from dota 1 atleast you have more friend to play with
recommended
1110 where teamwork is  and u dnt knw what you are doing
recommended
short review pros absolutely no pay to win really depends on your skills teamwork and connection huge variety on 1 map 100 heroes many items build to combine its fun if you have good team and own the match many game modes which is fun but some of them requires great experience doesnt really need high pc spec but need good connection but still got good graphich and gameplay customizing hero with the store item is fun the items are cool but some of them can cost like $400 for a piece of item i will be much fun if you are rich  kid you can practice with bot offline many more can get imba imbalance your enemies is too strong because of tricks and builds you have to be clever to counter usually players from  can get annoying rude behaviour noisy voice chat and sometimes they suck no offense can really2 cause you slamming your keyboard for many reasons meaning  stress even if you are really good 1 trashy teammate  1 trashy action from your teammate and boom uninstall this game feeder someone who dont kill but killed by enemy a lot stupid noobsht everywhere the community isnt bad but not the best at all trash talkers trade scammers ill tell you one more time if you are not the patient type at all i suggest avoid this game low prior system leaving an active game penalty for more than 5 minutes which is called abandon sometimes is annoying conclusion a really2 fun game literally its only 1 map but its just never makes me boring except theres a feeder but sometimes its really annoying because human make mistakes its really a fair game but can be really unfair 1 player can lose or win the game its all about balance i fucg love this game
recommended
nice and cool game

this is not a game this is life oo this is very addictive and life goes around it you just think only of dotadotadotadota

great game

dota 2 is the best game ever
recommended
when i hear the phrase dota 2 is good just look at how many people play it i cant help but make myself blue from facepalming so hard call of duty has millions of players the thing is theyre all 12 year olds with tourrettes and particularly ignorant mothers the gaming society is so fanatic about numbers that they forget that criticism and praise are reflections of an individuals formed beliefs that being said dota 2 is a terrible game and thats not an opinion its the truth valves fear of the number 3 has thrown them afar by pushing number 2s yes i did just say that laugh it up of all their other series portal 2 left 4 dead 2 and half life 2 as well as half life 2 episode 2 but now they are doing it to games they dont originally own repetition is useful in debates and extremely rarely in games a lesson valve is eagerly forgetting to the point where dota 2 doesnt even have multiple maps to change things up i see its up to the players to pose new situations how inadvertently lethargic i cannot comprehend how players can have over 3000 hours doing the same thing let alone 5 to put this in todays terms dota 2 is so stupid your mum asked me what i was doing and when i replied im playing defense of the ancients she freaked out believing that i was attempting to prevent her murder i weep for future generations that when asked to list 10 goods things about the 21st century can only find numerous references to swag justin bieber and the mindset that a large amount of players in a game means everyone in the whole world should enjoy it and before you ask yes i did just put a your mum is so old joke in an analysis thanks for noticing

this game is awesome
recommended
this game is why im dota_head from the depths of 2002s warcraft iii reign of chaos and later 2003s the frozen throne expansion released two different versions of defense of the ancients in use map settings custom game mode the game was a wild success the frozen throne version is the truest to dota 2s gameplay items heroes and spells roc dota was arguably more fun for hardcore players but tft soared in popularity this remake unlike hon which is honestly the better game in several aspects takes all the old skills revamps them gives them new aghanims scepter buffs and makes warding a nightmare seriously though warding in hon is a pleasure compared to dota 2 dota 2 is my mostplayed goto game it elicits the greatest feelings of disappointment and triumph alike the community in dota 2 is abysmal but that includes me the untrollable troll so if youre well prepared for pointless criticisms of itembuilds knowitall noobs whove played under 500 games and presume to think theyve already seen everything this game has to offer youre in luck honestly though this game is like a religion if youre not deeply invested into it youll never be particularly good and youll never enjoy the game not even once this game commands your attention like no other this game challenges your patience for other human beings like no other this game will drive you insane and you will thank yourself for it
recommended
all right same as everyone here hard game very nob unfriendly highly addicting full of russians did i mention that is hard to master and that people are going to kill you for every mistake on the other hand you have a free to play game that rewards the efforts put in learning everything starting with the jargon carry creep pusher warding ganking bot solo lane going rosh  try it dive in it forget life

im sexy and i know it 3

tough to learn but well worth the time
recommended
this game is good
recommended
i love this game d
recommended
this game requires time it requires your effort it requires your blood tears are optional if these requirements are met dota 2 is truly one of the best if not the best game out there it definitely provides longterm motivation if started properly once you get into this game you will not just leave it anymore additionally it is a decent russian teacher all in all after having played over 1300 hours i can say that dota 2 has so far given me the best experience out of all games i have played and it is highly likely the game i have played the most regarding time and effort even if you do play other games from time to time you will always get back to this one dota 2  100% lifesteal 1110 would recommend
recommended
due to dotas serverswhole world will be named russia soon enough
recommended
its a trap d
recommended
colorful and interesting game it has a plenty of heroes to explore and same with gear for them it will ge a good time taker for few days but then you will get to tacticks and if you enjoy this genre games you will go for scores if not most likely you will play something else
recommended
so nice to play this
recommended
its is a very good game with good balancing and intersting abilities but as you probaly read before you can compare the communitie with a waste bin people will just scream at you when you do someting wrong and leave the game after that and dont forget the famous mid or feed strategy communication in this game is hard the game does it good at that point but then the russians and arabians or whatever show up when you clearly clicked euwest and that you want to meet up with english people instead of other language so yeah game is perfectly with regulary updates and interesting events but the communitie really needs to get better i mean a lot better or valve should just link english people with real english people and auto search for the best server instead of choosing the server i would say 9510 for the game nothing is perfect and 210 for the communitie sometimes you meet a nice person
recommended
good game with high quality definition

normally i would reccomend this game as i have played it for a long time however it is now simply unplayable screen constantly freezes and crashes even when using a high end pc and updated drivers i have researched how to fix this problem and i have literally tried everything and nothing helps a lot of people experience this problem online and the valve tech support is nonexistent and useless for more than a year i tried to give this game a chance as i used to love playing it but with lack of consideration towards a great number players including myself i feel it is a waste of money and time until it is fixed here is a link to my thread and another related to this issue on the developer page please valve pay attention to your players and actually fix your product httpdevdota2comshowthreadphpt144013 httpdevdota2comshowthreadphpt141150

710  game and community are great if you are a newbie play against bots commmunity isnt noob friendly  it became a huge turn off for me the learning curve compared to lol is steep and youll be spending a lot of time learning the many champions in the game as well as game dynamics give it a shot you may end up enjoying it
recommended
me i never knew there were these many russians in the world
recommended
this game is fantastic i mean i play this game almost everyday i have had this game for a month and already have 274 hours in it and my friends have even more i liked how this isnt a pay to win game you can get items to make your person look better or cooler but the items dont have any benifet so everyone can play the same people at anytime and dota 2 is a fair fight in short i love dota 2

the most addictive game ive ever played in my life the infinite possibilities of every single game depending on very minute decisions juxtaposes it so much to our real lives although the learning curve is too steep once you give about a week for it the mechanisms in the game are clear to you definitely recommended

this is a best game i have played

this totally rocks this game is highly recommended

i am a professional dota 2 player with 6000 mmr i am the best brewmaster in na in season 3 i was ranked as the best teemo player in brazil i highly reccommend dota 2 however do not play unless you main brewmaster or invoker all the other heros suck i dont even know why they are in the game if you happen to main urgot please uninstall

this game is recommended for me good job dota 2

recommended
best moba game on the market completely free2play and no signs for future pay2win plans very balanced with 100 heroes still developing updates for the game and now start the game
recommended
so what can i say i played original dota just a few times so when dota 2 was released as betaversion i wast so agitated as others but soon i got an invite and began to play so what can i say about positive moments  time moves faster  yes thats it too fast sometimes  a lot of matchups in each game  a good challenge for your reaction analytics and tactics in aggregate  a lot of characters and you can take each one even at the begining  donations do not affect gameplay and some negative moments  you need a lot of practice to become really good player  agressive community  it can eat all your free time
recommended
i enjoyed most of the time playing the game but most people play it for being competative where as i just try to play it for fun i would personaly recomend it the only annoying part would be people from foriegn countries for some reason decide to connect to your area server ex russian connecting to us server or a person who decides that they want to connect to a server halfway across the world though i like it when there is a coopertive team who are there just to have fun
recommended
very addictive game but i would say this though the dota 2 community is getting worse from time to time more abuse player on dota 2 talking trash do trash keep feeding and stuff like that its kinda annoying but this game 10 out of 10  best game ever  d
recommended
i like it because it look classics
recommended
addictive

played it for 20 hours i just got my first angry russian guy saying  1110 would go io again
recommended
ive normally never liked games of this style but as a noob this game is fun and challenging
recommended
red hot game
recommended
dota2 so far is the best game i ever played highly recommended for gamers
recommended
this game needs a team work and strutegy
recommended
awsome game with nice team players and best action ever
recommended
i think people who gush over this game do so because its not league of legends this often strikes me as being the same as the person who plays say the secret world and bashes those that play world of warcraft where world of warcraft is accessible easy and enjoyable for the masses secret world is deep complex and very rewarding to those who really enjoy the minutae of figuring out how to get the most out of an mmo dota 2 is the game you play when you dont want to the handholding comfortable ease that league of legends has brought to the moba world i found dota 2 to be overly awkward and not particularly rewarding but for those in the mood for the more hardcore experience this is where to be i just wont be there with you

spending a year learning to shuffle a gaggle of fantasy heroes up dotas teetering stack of rules and game mechanics will do that to you weve developed a secret language of our own one that runs parallel to the talk of creeps and lanes and farm and rax common to everyone who plays the game whack a ward on the donkletron im going to stick one up their jungle is a sentence i can say out loud and be completely understood by at least those three people for some reason theres also a lot of singing involved its a lot like being a sailor

recommended
the best free to play game in steam
recommended
possibly one of the most interesting games in my steam library dota 2 is an enjoyable game to play with friends online and meet new people in the online matches after the recent success of the internations 2014 by raising a whopping prize pool of over ten million dollars this serves as an incentive for new players at the possibility to winning a share of the prize pool if theyre good at the game one will require the ability to quickly respond to the situation as the actions of your teammates and enemies are completely random i suggest this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable experience thats more complicated than the similar game league of legends i find both games equally fun and enjoyable however dota is ultimately the more superior game between the two samuraizheng
recommended
great game

more addictive than cocaine or any drugs recommend not to play this game it will ruin your social life and you cannot get away from it since your first play one more thing beware of racial discrimination there are plenty of them in the game for the beginner or avoid to be a noob or feeder in the public game you are strongly advised to play with computers in the first place  to be an expert of that certain hero

recommended
tadaa stupid people dont play this game
recommended
i love this game
recommended
this game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers then it taught me to hate them all
recommended
side effects include hatred of other humans lack of trust in others carpal tunnel improved hand eye coordination a large ego weight gain weight loss confidence despression extreme racism extreme racism increased strategic thinking capabilities mushybrain syndrome subconsciously learning a new language subconsciously learning to hate the culture of said language literally every ailment that is not a transmitable disease 910 doctors accepted this game on their recommendation list but the tenth was afk
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
causes anxiety problems low self esteem tourettes syndrome mood swings bipolar disorder breakdown of relationships raging erections racism would definitely recommend
recommended
in dota 2 not many people speak your language not many people play well not many people talk nicely not many people work as a team but if you find people that do youll have the most fun youve ever had
recommended
and you thought real life was a struggle
recommended
i only played a little but it was fun
recommended
things i gave to dota 1 money 2 time 3 love things dota gave me 1 arthritis 2 carpal tunnel syndrome 3 hatred of russians mexicans spanish finnish and russians 4 broken keyboard 5 broken mouse 6 910 ready 7 server crashes 8 4 stacks of russians in euw servers on english prefrence settings 9 ranked matches 10 free to play but pay to win games ie  foreseers contract new bloom 2015 11 its in the bag spam especially skywrath 12 multilingual cursing  i guess this is a good thing 13 split second math  reliableunreliable gold and gold loss on death vs buyback availability  this is good too essentially  dota is a greedy woman but i love her all the same 11  10 would play again

the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you
recommended
one day a wise man intoduce me into this game it shall protect your virginity my lad he said
recommended
its definitely exciting the beta phase has really matched up to its hype i foresee dota 2 to go a long way when it releases as a finished product if you love dota then this is a must for you
recommended
this game is without a doubt the freest free to game out there everything is free right off the bat and that makes a huge difference in gameplay there are no buffs that you can buy before the game that would have even the slightest impact on the match the only thing you pay for is cosmetic items which again have no effect on gameplay heroes are fun to play and range in difficutly so other charcters take more time and paicientce to master there is also a wide range of charcters types to play as so you never get bored from the ranged characters to the melee characters to the nukers to the tanks there will always be a fun and interesting character that fits your playstyle though dota 2 plays out similar to other mobas it is very diverse in its playstyles do not treat it like games like league of ledgends its a completly different game entireley and should be treated as such that being said the learning curve is very difficult and other players on dota are extremely unforgiving your first few games will be rough but after one good game or your first win its hard to step away from the computer and once you learned your prefered playstyle and find a character you enjoy dota 2 can be one of the most addicting games youve ever played dota 2 is one of the best games in the moba genre and for good reason gameplay is fun and challenging and there is a hero for everybody though it will take awhile for you to start getting the hang of things the rewards are well worth the time and effort
recommended
great game at all time death prophet is my best hero

recommended
well for starters take a look at my total hours played that should tell you how much i like this game i honestly find the idea of a moba very appealing although there might be other games out there in the genre that dare i say it are better than dota 2 i still find dota 2 to be the one game i always go back too the game mechanics are solid the character balancing is always changing adding new depths to the gameplay and many of the players in dota are relatively laid back is dota 2 the best game in the world probably not is dota 2 the game i have spent 1000 hours on and will probably spend another thousand on absolutely

dota 2  one of the best free games out there on the net its really fun once you get to play it better its also really fustrating when youre the worst player of your team oh the pressure they put on you is unfathomable really good game  its free so why not try it right ruined my life  so why not ruin yours  makes perfect sense 
recommended
this is a great game the graphics are good the sound atmospheric the game play is clean and fun and the heros are enjoyable and at some moments funny however the game lacks in some area some heros are far better then others when you play on a public server ie sniper riki and bloodseeker just to name a few all these heros can be countered easily but with an incompetant team theyll become gods on the battlefield also the tutorial teaches bad habits ie only teaching you how to fight in the middle lane poor hero selection and no team building tutorial altogether this game is great it is outstanding how open ended the battles can be every game is different and youre never left unsatisfied i give this game a 910
recommended
1110 lol d this game is so great thumbs up
recommended

recommended
dota 2 is probly one of the games of all time but if your dont have a team this game can really be frustrating because you might need have a comeback but with pubes everone will just fight with each other or people will speak a different language and you can not work together if you can deal with these probles you will find a very compex moba and fun game dont play meepo
