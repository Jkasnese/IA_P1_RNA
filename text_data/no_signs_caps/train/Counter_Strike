cs is one of the greatest and undermined games in history it is in my opinion the best game to ever have a crosshair it is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in it starts off with a team trying to kill another team i started playing cs when i noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer i started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks as well as a boom box to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game i wanted to play every chance that i could on my road of cs adventures i encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as i was about playing and that when we did play nobody was good enough so it wasnt a lot of fun then i discovered that i could sign up for a class with dboorn i was overly excited and signed up but with skepticism at how the class was going to be sure enough i was proven wrong we started off by practicing a little bit then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class i made some friends and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course when i play counterstrike the whole world disappears only i the mouse and my teammates remain we are united in a common goal we strive collectively towards an end we all desire each player has a spot to hold they stand ready and waiting eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory thus cs celebrates the unity of man the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence when i play cs i play until my veins pump battery acid and then i play some more cs is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny what destiny might you ask i spoke before of unity and it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family that is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one one machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves not that these small metal objects are actually animate im of course speaking only metaphorically over the course of the years i have increased in skill but i have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player i have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share even if that team is less than ideal i have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the ak the awp the deagle the sands under my feet in d2 or inferno and more importantly the teammates at my side i love them it is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness in conclusion i love cs i love to win i love pushing myself to my physical limits its that feeling that first drove me to the computer for every second that i am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play a thirst that grows as every minute passes by when i am outside sitting at the television or playing sports i had an extraordinary time playing this game and i will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how i used to feel this review may be over this game may be dead but i will never stop playing counerstrike 16

first of all its my first online game ever i was very young and i was playing with my friends lan matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments xd this game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a pc to playing this game at my home with the time i learn how to modding on cs 16 serversplugins and more stuffs about pc after this i learn how to aim on the enemy head how to fire inside the walls how to hear someone with his steps and how to fight i have played many fpsfirst person shooter games that they called me hacker of my fast killing i had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never for others its only a game for me it was my life this wasnt a review but a little story so counterstrike ftw es
recommended
counterstrike is a great series though the real change they made was in csgo counterstrike has been one of my favorite fps games of all time if you prefer a fast based shooter this game isnt for you counterstrike can have exciting moments where its you vs 5 others or where you have no defuse kit with only a few seconds left to defuse the bomb a comparable version of counterstrikes defuse gametype is the call of duty search and destroy
recommended
im sorry to say for other games but with counterstrike 16 i had best gaming experience in my life
recommended
old but gold
recommended
the game that started it all i love global offensive but i always return to 16 because of the hardcore oldschool feeling i dont even know why im recommending this because obviously you all have it right
recommended
its a real legend  legend of pc games

blame this game for the rise of the online multiplayer modern military shooter good game great custom maps terrible community not much has really changed since 2000 has it i dont think anyone still plays this particular version of cs though edit wait there are over 8000 people ingame right now wow guess i have to give this a yes then because it isnt dead

this game appears to remain no 1 fps action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years it is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs you should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common cs maps like dust or assault go on try it however they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame tactical shield and cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online that some pc criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials so you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and vac banned so please be careful but if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action gamebuy it soldier

i dont like because steam blocked redirections from server to server i know that people using it to slowhack but now servers with redirection are unusefull also vac not working good for counterstrike 16 maybe it could be good for some update or something i can give you anything you need for it contact me kinds and regards drag1c

old good game never dies i remember first time playing this game when i was in elementary school hiding teacher to play this game with friends is very fun you should let your kid have experiences like this
recommended
a still alive firstperson shooter since 2000 the game that changed everything along with halflife still the best firstperson for thousands and you know why because this games focus isnt on graphics its for having fun with your friends or even aim for world turnaments all proffesional teams such as fnatic navi sk still play counterstrike doesnt matter if it is 16 source or global offensive highly recommend this game
recommended
old times
recommended
wordless very very good
recommended
arguably the best competitive fps so far the skill ceiling is very high however getting started is easy
recommended
harder than csgo
recommended
this game is just amaizing if you have a game with cheaters then change the server with admins that actualy do stuff right like cskopidejalv yes the graphics are outdated and the physix may make no sense but this is what started it all if you havent played this and you play other cs games then you know nothing about this game buy it play it and enjoy for me this game is more fun than csgo or css because its calssic and was a my favorite childhood game 1010

quake was the first game i was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time counterstrike was the second  and easily more addicting theres a reason that i still compare every multiplayer shooter experience back to original counterstrike to this day theres a reason i still compare every server community to this counterstrike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day compared to these days where a server is just something youre automatically dumped into and feels like every other server despite many iterations nothing quite plays like the original its not hard to see why there are still 10000 to 60000 people playing this at any one time on any day  fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of steam this is where it all started without this theres an entire genre of shooter and multiplayer that just vanishes the original days of counterstrike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life its unlikely that will ever be trumped
recommended
it was one the best fps games back in a days would go back in time when this game was still popular 1010
recommended
the game may be old now but it is still a great game and full of fun custom maps its a good way to spend time with frineds andor family with low hardware requirments and cheaper pricing the game may be modded to improve your expierence as well which is allows for more customized game play that never gets old

counterstrike is a firstperson shooter game from valve the first of the counterstrike series counterstrike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist as a counter terrorist your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone while the terrorist team has to do the opposite weapons has hard recoil so you cant just spray and pray short burst fire can save you in critical situation before the round begins you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team this type of gameplay encourages team work counterstrike is a good game i recommend this game rating 810

now i know what you guys are probably going to say omg this game sucks the graphics are bad d and like pfff this game is old nobody still plays it well its not its a game thats made like 13 years ago so dont expect frosbite engine graphics etc instead you get the way more epic pixelish graphics and really classic sounds and this game is still active with about 30k to 40k players each daythats more then all cod games together and in my opinion its a must have game since its one of the best games ever and you still can install skins etc and its price is good its only 10 euro or dollars for this great game

this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games i am glad that i lived through the golden era of shooters and if id have to rate it itd 1010 ofcourse
recommended
great game a must have for any steam user
recommended
so old still a better story then twilight
recommended
i suck at this game 1010

if you cant get counterstrike global offensive this is great replacement for it its not as popular but it still has a big amount of players some servers may be in languages you cant understand but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill one of the best first person shooters that still holds to this day from 1999 although the games graphicsarent really the best even then you can get skins map textures etc to spice the graphics up a little bit though to me graphics dont really matter highly recommend this game 9510

counter strike a game which changed the era of first person shooting game since it was born made in 1999 beta version released on 2000 the game released on 2002 i think i personally think counterstrike or cs made steam what it is thou dota 2 and several others are there this game has been ranked number 1 since 2000 in front of my eyes ranked 1 by several industries and one of the most online server recording having more servers than any other game game trackercom not rs

the mother of all fps games although some may argue that this is a outdated game i still love it you get that awesome freedom of movement which you cannot get on css as much and on csgo in addition this game nearly runs on all pcs even potatos with wires it has a large modding team behind it amxx which isnt affiliated with valve but nevertheless it makes the game 100x better and adds amazing mods to it

counterstrike was an amazing achievement a free mod for the original halflife that outshone its parent game completely and become becoming incredibly popular so popular in fact that it was sold it stores as a individual entity back when it was still free to download for anyone that already owned halflife nowadays a mod turning into a full game is almost common place and happens sometimes even without the popularity but back then it was a monumental accomplishment counterstrike managed to become the most played pc shooter of all time and even to this day boasts both a strong competitive scene and tons of active public servers how many other online shooters can say that their online community is still alive and kicking 12 years down the line the game itself i never really cared much for i played it back in the 52 beta days and although there is something to admire about the simplistic purity of its gameplay this has never been the kind of game i could really get stuck into the developers tried to introduce a number of new gamemodes back in the beta days but quickly found that trying to complicate the game would only leave the players confused and unsure of how to proceed counterstrike is a simplistic teamshooter but it is a milestone in gaming history and one that we should be happy and proud of because counterstrikes simple existence is the reason why modding turned mainstream

counterstrike 16 is a great ing game what makes this game great is that i can write a review for it in one paragraph completely summarize everything that is included in this game and still fully recommend it to everyone this game is the most generic shooter at first glance but after your first few weeks of cs 16 you quickly realize that this games aesthetic simplicity only encourages more community map development and when you really begin to play more of cs 16 you realize that the shooting mechanics and first person mechanics of this game is anything but simplistic no other first person shooter feels just as a smooth as a valve first person shooter and the amazing mechanics that are in this game are backed by an amazing community of players who will never leave cs 16 behind the maps such as dust2 inferno and nuke are built to such perfection that they will suck you into the game as if you were in a modern militaristic tron the gameplay is pretty similair to that of its opponent cod search and destroy is completely influenced by cs 16 only downside i could think of is that really the only weapons that are worth using are the ak m4 and the awp all the other weapons are left behind in my opinion counterstrike 16 is a strong 8 out 10 its a total classic
recommended
great game

this is the game that started it all the original counterstrike  it isnt as populated as the new games of course but it is still a worthy investment in my opinion it has that same feel as the newer ones and i believe that it is a respective title

one of the classics of the shooting genre and precursor to most of todays modern shooters for all the good and the bad that may imply counterstrike 16 is the second iteration of the original halflife mod and quite likely its most popular incarnation the rather simplistic gameplay coupled with accessible system requirements and intuitive controls make it one of the most longlived shooters today still sporting a massive fanbase a game that must be tried at least once by any shooting game neophyte

death is a great teacher failure in counterstrike is as it always has been for this series the greatest way to learn where you should have gone what you shouldnt have done and how you could have done better counterstrike players spend a lot of time learning  consequently they are always getting better

i dont care what anyone else says but cs 16 is the 1 fps and it will never die 
recommended
best hours i spent in my life arguably <_< even after so many years im still learning thats ok because thats what make counter srike trully special the learning curve is so steep that youll never get bored if youre up for the challenge of course this game is the true tactical fps multiplayer many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what cs 16 did and fail terribly 16 needs more love from valve it was one of the games that made steam a thing hell back in the day it was the only game to bring loyal users to the platform the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance to be completely honest we all hated steam it was a broken nightmare valve could show some love for their baby adding trading cards bgs and emos or even skins would be a great start one call only dream  tldr steam was very broken and the 16 playerbase kept it going valve should recognize that
recommended
basically this game was released back in the year 2000 and still is one of the most played games on steam so clearly it must be good because so many are still playing it i definitely recommend this game and if you dont like to shoot terrorist or counter terrorists you can always try different game modes like zombie modes 1010

wasted too much of my life on this one

it was better before 2010 when there were not so many hackers now is full of hackers in csgo are like 30%50% of hackers but in cs 16 there are over 60% hackers poor game now

this was one of the best first person shooter and fps games after steam updated the fpsengine and made other changes to the game after more than 10 years of good gameplay i would rather say that this is a now a ripoff the game doesnt work properly and the developers isnt listening to the players when theyre updating the game if steam would roll back the game to before they update i would recommend this game because of the good gameplay at the moment because of the update i just want my money back

i first played counterstrike back in 1999 when it was still just a mod i went to it on a daily basis for several hours as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002 when other activities came along i only went back to it now in 2012 this unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game i have ever experienced as it is today this is not counterstrike it is a broken unrecognizable nearly useless form of the original game valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing the server browser is a joke it is simply broken the results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by nonsteam users with the game settings altered to who knows what and 90% of them playing the dust map the other servers are running nonofficial maps and pointless game modes in addition you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is forcefed through your connection to alter the game counterstrike has been so blatantly abandoned that it is shocking valve still charges something for it you will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed counterstrike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure it has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy counterstrike is bad

no never i hate this game and nothing is going to change that fact if you want to start now just prepare for those who have 10000 hours of experiance in the game you join a game you instantly die you then have to wait minutes till the next round then you die again and wait even more if i wanted to play a doctor room simulator this would be it nothing says fun like sitting in spectator mode let the downvotes begin

let me start off by saying this back when this game was new popular and all i would reccomend it hands down but the fact that you cant play with bots is devastating if you are playing this game right now so that means you will have to play on servers but right now most of the servers are completely empty and that renders the game almost impossible to play so i reccommend you get any of the other 3 cs games this game is just too dead to reccomend

in my toddler times i spent a great deal of time playing this many sequels have come and gone but so far i still think of this as one if not the best version however it did not aged well most servers are filled with hackers or oblige you to install shady protection solutions on your computer so nowadays youre better of following one of the following options  turn around and check tf2  turn around and check csgo
not recommended
all i see when i play this game is bots i never liked counter strike very much because i wasnt into the way the game was played and also the money system kind of confused me it seemed to me like if one team won two or three matches in a row they were able to have complete domination over the other team and that just isnt fun and maybe its because i wasnt there for this games glory days but source and global offensive just seem so much more superior so im gonna say pass on this game in favor of the two newer versions that have all of the same content but with more

this game sure is interesting although to start of i have a few things that really make a reason for such a bad review first of all the graphics are really disgusting the game looks like it was made with claymation so really for people judgy like me about gaming graphics i do not recommend purchasing and second the trailer you see really makes the game look great although the events that you see in the video are rare to come upon especially the great scoping aiming and trickshots if anything that looks as if the trailer creator turned on their own personal autoaim so dont go getting too excited over the trailer third when in gameplay if you die you wont be able to respawn until all other players of your team or the other team are dead so you could be sitting there for up to 10 minutes watching a bad quality cam of some one else playing fourth the game looks like there wasnt that much effort put into it like its home made when spectating when zooming out the exterior goes completely black as if all the map is is just a boxed maze in addition no sprint so for anyone looking for a good firstperson shooter i surely do not recommend this game
not recommended
its a great game but i dont recommend because nowadays there is a map rotativity of just two or three maps

counterstrike this one also known as counterstrike 16 is a teambased multiplayer realisticalmilitary shooter and a very well known one at that it was first available as a free mod for halflife 1 being patched regulary up to version 16 until recently it got its way onto steam as a serapately sold title so how is the player base counterstrike 16 being popular self has an active player base you will see many servers up to 32 players at very least there are many russian servers as it had a cult following over there cant really see past them on bad side most seems to prefer terrorist plant c4 mode and then de_dust2 is the most played map a lot of servers run small mods that may alter balance or other small things and most of it playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning counterstrike is a very well known realistical fps it gained its popularity while being free mod for popular halflife because it provided something else what wasnt overused yet  realistical shootouts using models of real weapons you know in team multiplayer unforgiving and furious or unbalanced and twitchy oneshot kills with headshots whichever one you prefer counterstrike has two types of map first de is a mode where counterterrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist one of the terrorists spawns with c4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of ts victory roles change as terrorists will have now to defend this place from cts whos aim now are to defuse the bomb in which case cts will win the round no matter how many more ts are left pretty interesting mode and most played otherwise this game would have been camping fest and if one site is too well defended ts can go to another one and then there is a second type cs in which cts have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base the problem there is that hostage npcs arent perfect though good enough and since cts have to rescue them all terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them since cts will have no choice but to come to win much less played and even if it does it goes like your everyday team deathmatch just killing all of opposite team much simpler anyway now the core gameplay there are few rounds each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map there is no respawning during round once person is dead he is out so you will have to worry much more about getting instakilled there are no items placed on map itself either on correct official maps no kind of medikits in spawn place you have 15 seconds to press b button or whichever you set to bring up buy menu where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far yep when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend with winning team getting more an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder what you can buy there is a pistol primary weapon and any of the equipment yep if it doesnt smell like prototype of modern military shooters once past purchase screen you are free to run and shoot and here comes the art of recoil and aiming for you see one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon if you move it drops if you jump it drops it drops while you are shooting too thus it becomes more importanly to get good position making assaults more compilated and you often have to relearn to shoot making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button you will have to be often walking instead of running to keep accuaricy while moving it also makes you silent so do it often or just stand and crouch sometimes burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons so dont be surprised for people shooting through door walls and even just over the corner it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind the game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a massive damage and you also got three kinds of grenades explosive he which explodes good for throwing into chokepoints flashbang which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds quite annoying but good for stroming into room and smoke grenade when you dont want enemies to see you coming and dont want to be under direct fire good for open spaces with snipers who instakill you when you peek around corner protip you run slightly faster with knife out and well while on theory it sounds interesting as well as empashises teamwork here comes the downfall of the game the weapons while make people with gun fetish happy are badly balanced around each other there are just best and bad weapons from pistols desert eagle is the best they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and assault rifles can kill even better at close range submachine guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving but are still inferior to rifles rifles category has two best guns allrange assault rifle like ak47 and allrange sniper rifle like awp which doesnt even require headshot to onehit kill exactly what majority of people use the only machine gun is pew pew pew cant hit and allrange is allrange random is random you may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your ak47 by luck or you may walk around corner thinking of your next grandious tactical plan just to get headshotted in instasecond by guy with sniper rifle from close range its just so full of cheap and frustating the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more not honest fun as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots slowdown when being hit doesnt seem to be good idea either making it harder to get away from the choke points and random spread is not actually random it just randomly follows one of the preset pattern and yes if you will learn them you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that counterstrike 16 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense and well once you spend your time to learn them you will still find out on top that it didnt make the game any more amazing but you know its not too bad it does teamwork well sometimes the game just works when you work along the team round the corners and storming the next room where you follow teammates supporting each other provide covering fire to the corner when upon entering next place each one covers his own direction as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases and its pretty damn nice at those moments until they get ruined by something stupid something you dont feel like could be prevented yea getting shot by sniper and yes this game has good enough sounds no music sadly the graphics are quite hl1 highdefinition era but otherwise are fine enough the levels are a bit of bland though cant really recommend it because everybody who will like such games are already playing it and player base of this game had too much time by now that they will be just way too skilled for new players who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level its not like there arent enough militaryrealistical shooters anyway

counterstrike global offensive is the current iteration of valves topinclass competitive shooter and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been learning from its experience with team fortress 2 valve has a miniature economy in cs go that revolves entirely around gun decals players get a few drops a week after matches which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate  the latter of which cost 149 to unlock with a oneuse key from the store obviously this economy is tailormade and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantasticlooking gun and knife skins with prices in the hundreds of pounds then a large range of other skins tapering down to the commonasmuck variety that trades for pennies i dont pay much attention to the cs go economy as a whole though its interesting enough but its important for a nonplayer to understand that a big chunk of the games audience takes it very seriously indeed in the days after a new operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on you get the picture i give such context on cs gos economy because  even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself  it is the molten core of operation vanguard cs go is a regularlypatched game but the major updates come in the form of operations that introduce new maps and new skins at the price of around 3 for an access pass  with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless or made so shortly afterwards to give an exhaustive history of operations would be no more useful than a general overview if you play counterstrike then the chances are you play a lot of counterstrike what the operations do is freshen things up a bit  naturally they dont disrupt the regular dustmirageinferno cycle of competitive play but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in the chance to score some fancy new weapons and in the context of a game you play almost daily 3 a few times a year is chicken feed operation vanguard is different and the changes are not for the better the first problem i have with it is major the way its sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception to participate in operation breakout you bought an allaccess pass for 239 to participate in operation vanguard i bought an access pass for 239 the difference is obvious sidebyside but of course when ov popped up in counterstrikes home menu i bought it more or less instantly thinking this was the same thing ovs selling point is two campaigns a series of missions with three branching paths the missions are things like win 16 rounds on map x and kill 20 chickens in deathmatch mode and completing one bags a predetermined award  either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection so far so ok but in fact ov has two more campaigns both of which cost 179 to access  which follow more or less the same pattern to be crystalclear about this the money is not the problem im happy to pay for operations and ovs combined total of around 6 in the context of the time i put into counterstrike is really not an issue but that switch from allaccess pass to access pass with the right to buy more access just  me right off first of all i felt conned i bought the ov pass in the same way id bought all the previous operation passes expected it to be the same deal and realised id been fooled by the removal of all secondly what the two extra purchases offer is basically a reskinned version of ovs mission book but thirdly and this is the real killer youre encouraged to buy them to selfmedicate the most egregious enormous climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in vanguard there are multiday cooldowns on missions thats right rambo you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up daytoday business in cs go but in fact vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time with the only limiting factor a bald external one cooldown timers let me set the scene for you i love counterstrike i saw vanguard was out on a thursday and cleared friday night got in a few beers booted it up and bought the pass i played the first mission cleared it in about 15 minutes chose a second the killing chickens one and that was another 15 mins so around half an hour into my evening of joy i was given a fourday cooldown for the next mission you can slice this any way you want but its  the sad thing is i get the thought process behind it consider youre valve in charge of a game where players a want new content but b put in so many hours that theyll rush through anything almost instantly for example mission chains operation breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc it was fine but the missions never felt important so operation vanguards missions are in structured patterns with defined rewards and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing you will not complete this content before we say so because you cant oh except that if you buy the extra mission packs your cooldowns decrease across the board because now youre allowed to do more missions in a set period thats right youre basically paying to reduce cooldowns in a valve game the thing is that operation vanguard is only a campaign in the same way that a pile of biscuits is lunch the missions are basic objectives like win 16 competitive rounds on season or get 100 famas kills in deathmatch mode and what do you get for completing them either a drop from an existing collection of guns with a minor chance of a rare gun or a weapon crate the first is fair enough but the second i mean at this point i already felt pretty rinsed by operation vanguard and now its rewarding me with crates that i need to pay more money to open there is a school of thought that says valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesnt flood the ingame economy instead trickling them in over the coming months to that argument the only appropriate response is  who cares i play counterstrike go because its a great game i dont play it because of the economy and while i accept the latter is how valve makes money the moment it starts intruding into the game  if indeed this explanation holds water  then the economy is not acting in the way that it should that is it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it the sad thing is that operation vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet including two in season and back alley that feel like potential classics yeah theyre all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other but this is par for the course with cs go and will be tweaked over the coming months every cs go operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else and the point of operation vanguards structure is to elongate this beyond a few days  to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semiregularly for missions it at least manages this i want to emphasise that im an enormous fan and c

addictive dull and repetitive counterstrike will eat up hours that youll want to have back there are two newer iterations of this game now both of which are similarly wasteful of time while one might argue that any game is not a productive use of ones days counterstrike ranks one step above almost anything out there unless youre freakishly good or an inveterate camper youll spend the lions share of your gameplay idly waiting to respawn more youll inevitably especially in 16 run into players so good that youll be unsure whether theyre superlative gamers or superlative cheaters and in counterstrike theres really no way of telling prepare yourself for frustration either way avoid
