this is the game the never ever ends i picked this game up thinking i wouldnt like it having never played a previous tes game before sat in my library untouched for about a month or two and finally took the plunge i was wrong i was so very very wrong this is probably the best purchase ive ever made on steam add in the unlimited potential of modding and its an adventure that continues forever ive probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character and still only have beaten alduin once once theres still so much more do to and explore that im still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things i still cant believe how much there is to do and im still finding more at it stands ill probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as skyrim with how much ive played and im totally ok with that

i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun one of skyrims major cities when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot an orcish mace in the other they were on display for nobody but me and my computercontrolled housecarl lydia who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls dragons a civil war and job assignments that never seem to go as planned its even a sensible thing to do a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim one of the most fullyrealized easily enjoyable and utterly engrossing roleplaying games ever made part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated in skyrim theres no more moonhopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill thats gone so is athletics the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major you dont assign major and minor skills at all but instead pick one of ten races each with a specific bonus high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective closerange combat these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic sneaking and weapon combat emphasizing firsthand experience over instruction manual study letting you specialize only when youre ready it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim do a quest kill a dragon snatch torchbugs from the air munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within little feels random and useless even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities making every step you take even if its through what seems like total wilderness an exciting one as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame momentarily all on the battlefield unite directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature creating impromptu moments of camaraderie  a surprising change from what may have been yet another bythenumbers bandit camp sweep dragons show up often their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles stops to attack circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv can be completed in a few minutes and always offer a useful reward killing a dragon yields a soul which powers skyrims new shout system these are magical abilities any character can use you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time throw your voice change the weather call in allies blast out ice and fire or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force even if you favor sword shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story joined with the thieves guild fought alongside the dark brotherhood or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim not only is this land under assault by dragons long thought to be dead its also ripped in two by civil war you can choose one side or the other but so much of the allure of skyrim is how even outside of the confines of quest lines the embattled state of the world is evident and steeped in a rich fictional legacy lord of the rings this is not but with the release of every elder scrolls game the fiction becomes denser and the crossreferencing for longtime fans all the more rewarding skyrims residents are all aware of current events theyll comment on the civil war some sympathizing with the rebels others thinking the establishment sold its soul the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor many characters feel like whole distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans characters stereotype based on race they doublecross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable and they react to your evolving stature within the world it makes a ridiculous realm filled with computercontrolled cat people and humanoid reptiles demon gods and dragons feel authentic like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave

if i had to choose between this game and my girlfriend id pick this game edit im single now on a more serious note this game is the best in its genre in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing and exploration some having more quests and less places to go and others having very few quests and more places to explore but in skyrim there is no shortage of quests and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly you will stumble into places that just blow your mind every time i have replayed this game i stumbled into something new for more info id very much recommend mods with mods such as texture packs difficulty quests armor and weapons this games replay value is endless go through the game once with plain skyrim then mod the hell out of it overall id rate this game an easy 1010 if you havent already please buy it give it a little and i swear you will be hooked

 updated review  best ing singleplayer rpg series in existence this world this world really sucks you in one of those must experience in a lifetime things the previous games are up to their name too and this continuation is just jawdropping  pros   open world a beautiful one in that regard  incredibly moddable just dont use steam workshop use skyrim nexus if you really want the best  the best damn sense of adventure and exploration youll ever find in a game if youre a curious  youll love this to bits  immersive as hell youll really feel like youre under your characters skin  astonishing roleplaying element and all you need to do is take it slow and explore interact with the world as though you were your character  good game mechanics and skilltrees great game mechanics if you include mods  graphics are just superb if you can run and mod them in  the atmosphere and audio just leaves me speechless by the nine just listen to this httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvbrrxgv7nvr0 and also watch in awe httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvejxibco9ms  cons   you need a decent pc to unleash its full potential but a light gaming rig works too  pretty costly but its worth its weight in gold in the long run  takes up your time and youll notice a house fire an hour after its too late so buy a fire alarm just in case  modding the game might take even more time than playing it blunt i love you for the game massive love to all modders that made this game truly legendary

an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last but for me each tes game stands on its own merits and skyrim is no exception the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore you will find danger and excitement on your journey  and loot lots and lots of loot but once you start modding this game that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim potentially thousands more hours content for free in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes you can make the game exactly what you need it to be and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out and sometimes longer than even that if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game be sure to check out my guide for beginners httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrxq1jn_x_y&index1&listple7dlyarjddhdg41robvjfncqvo5mmkp

the elder scolls v skyrim  an open world rpg of epic proportions a true masterpiece  95  score comment graphics 9 skyrim has a free high resolution texture pack available as dlc and if you can run it i would highly recommend it but even without the graphics are clean with nice details and textures ambient lighting and effects are excellent and the designers have succeeded in creating a diverse and atmospheric landscape character creation is good with a lot of customisation possible all this however is completely and utterly eclipsed by what is possible with mods with mods readily available from the steam workshop gamers are able to create breathtakingly stunning vistas highly realistic characters followers and npcs with over 24 thousand mods at the time of this review you can change the appearance of or add in pretty much anything you can imagine the sky really is the limit there is of course a performance tradeoff when applying the ultra high definition textures and graphical mods so i recommend following one of the excellent guides available to find the right balance for you audio 9 music is grand and epic very fitting to the feel of the game sound effects and voice acting are both excellent throughout and considering how many characters and quests there are in the world of skyrim this is quite a feat personal favourites for voice acting include the aptly named khajiit maiq the liar and the deranged murderous jester cicero gameplay 9 skyrim is a joy to play its not perfect but its pretty close controls are intuitive responsive and work well with either mousekeyboard or controller there are many choices to be made throughout the game with real consequences factions will favour you or attack you depending on your actions and alignment with other factions there are many different playstyles and strategies to skyrim finding what works best for you is all part of the fun skills and abilities progress as you use them so you arent completely restricted to a class such as mage or ranger want to use a little bit of magic but also kill with a bow  no problem skyrim is often compared to its predecessors oblivion and morrowind to highlight some of flaws in the game and while its true to say some of the missions and areas feel overused oh another cave filled with draugr you say and there are other occasional glitches considering the massive scope and scale of the game these seem fairly minor skryim in certain ways surpasses its predecessors and is at very least well deserving of its place in this legendary series story 10 so much detail so much depth the lore and background to the elder scrolls series is second to none in skyrim there are huge libraries packed with books containing everything from childrens stories to hidden tomes of magic to the history of the lands talking to the people you meet tells of their individual struggles and also adds to the overarching story of a land rife with conflict and caught in far reaching changes of which you find your character the center skyrim is rich with background and story as you explore and interact with the characters around you its very easy to feel part of the world quests are with a few minor exceptions interesting challenging and varied with each of them building your understanding of the world and your place in it replayability 10 you only need to look at the number of hours people put into this game to realise how much skyrim has to offer personally i had already completed this game many times before i got it on steam and was still able to get many more hours of enjoyment than the average rpg im sure it wont be the last time i play skyrim either modding here also helps immensely with the community creating a huge collection of different locations characters and quests overall 95 an outstanding game if you havent tried it then your missing out on a truly amazing gaming experience the dlcs available dragonborn and dawnguard are worthwhile playing and some mods will require them so pick up the goty if you can more reviews by fancy fish agree  disagree please leave me a comment

so valve and bethesda have taken away paid mods cool and all the power to them but i belive valve should still make it easier to donate to mod creators especially on a game thats so heavily dependant on mods from the community the base game is so open and full of promise but its also empty and borning its as if they made the game expecting mods to make it better original review was a great game and still is but im just gunna give it a thumbs down for the forced payment of mods now i figure if we the community can shove this games rating down far enough then maybe valve will reconsider the forced payment option and maybe let devs have a donate option instead

okay where do i start general this game is able to shock you and make you laugh time and time again even when playing it for the 3rd time it takes about 130  200 hours of playtime to finish all of the quests and i guarantee that in the time you will not discover everything there is to discover if you do not feel like questing take some time mining scaring people with magic and shouts undressing them stealing stealthing killing dragons or giants throwing cabbages around or simply reading 1 of about 250 integrated ingame books and stories graphics this game has pulled off something i have thought to be impossible and pushed the whole gaming industry to the new levels it has successfully integrated superb graphics into a lot of content world is beautiful vast and full of variety and although a bit dark by default this can very easily be changed by just picking one mod from the workshop workshop why does this deserve a special tab because thanks to workshop earlier mentioned 200 hours of gameplay easily turn into thousands of hours of gameplay dont like any part of the game change it modify it add to it a huge amount of mods are being made every day and whether they spawn an extra cupcake in your house or add new cities with their own storylines they will all change your experience and prolong the fun name what you want to do it exists all of it cons  few possible glitches but all have their fix just need to be googled out  a bit too confusing and overwhelming at the start a lot of unanswered questions may put you off the game this happened to me on the first two attempts to play the game i ended up going to the first town becoming a woodcutter killing a chicken and getting chased by the guards but once you push on you will be nothing but glad you did who am i even writing this for is there any poor soul out there who has not yet played this game buy it now please

skyrim is the latest installment in bugthesdas legendary elder scrolls franchisegames which have always been touted as genre defining & it pleases me to say that skyrim is no exception with its barren vast open world landscape & its cast of interesting characters skyrim is the definitive rpg experience that you will ever get to play in order to elaborate on this i am now going to give you the reasons as to why you should get the elder scrolls v skyrim pros flying mammoths gorgeous game world with 512 x 512 & 256 x 256 textures  1024 x 1024 with the hd texture pack  excellent companion ai that hinder quests by stepping on to traps as well as triggering them for you in order to make you feel more immersed in the game as well as blocking doorways & always being spotted by the enemy especially if you want to roleplay as a sneaky character this is another feature that makes you feel more immersed no dependence on mods unlike the other games in the franchise skyrim is not dependent on mods to keep it interesting even after 300 hours of gameplay cause who doesnt love replaying the same opening sequence for the 6th time easy & glitchy dragon fights who needs challenging boss battles when we can just kill dragons & feel like gods screw timing & skill required in your average game boss fights skyrim did it right so much so that you dont even have to lift a finger in most fights you can just let the other npcs handle it for you its not like the game says that you are the only one who can kill the dragons broken quests this is the most important feature of the game as it encourages the player to keep playing the game again & again in order to complete that quest and at times it also forces the player to delete saves & hence reducing progress you have made so far in the gamethis further increases your game time bugthesda are one of the true pioneers of this feature & other games have also started adopting this paid mods is the latest innovation that bugthesda in collaboration with valve have brought to the table for skyrim although skyrim is not dependent on mods but it is still a good option for the players cause who doesnt want to pay for something that may or may not work & could possibly harm your saved game to be honest i cant think of a single con for this game cause its just so perfect and i think i have made that very clear with the features mentioned above i think my only gripe would be that the soundtrack is just so meh in my humble opinion final verdict  1110 skyrim is a game that definitely deserved the critical acclaim that it got back in 2011 although it was released in the same year that saw games like i dont know deus ex human revolution batman arkham city dark souls uncharted 3 witcher 2 but hey those games dont stand a chance against skyrim & all of its innovative feautures a clear goty winner

after 600 hours put into this masterpiece and after i hopefully started to understand most of the lore behind the elder scrolls universe i think i am ready to write a review for skyrim personally the best feeling i had while playing this game was getting back to my home after 3 days of fighting dragons exploring dungeons and talking with npcs my kids were eager to see what i got them so i gave them a lot of toys i have found in the huge landscape they also had surprises waiting for me plenty alchemical ingredients and even coins there are many races to choose from my favorite one being the khajit a cathuman appearance specialised in sneaking and thieving players who dont like this playing style but generally want to play as a khajit or any other race will be happy to see that skyrim lets them make the character they want if you want for example a mage argonian it will be of course harder work than for a high elf but as much rewarding because you will notice how your character truly evolves during the adventure you have tons of options tons of playing styles which you can mix or even change at any point in the game if you feel like it but enough with characters other aspect which really felt unique and incredible was the size of the land not only skyrim itself is huge considerably one of the biggest maps seen in a video game but its also fullfilled with things to do i never went from one hold to another without finding plenty of puzzles chests dungeons into my way and if youre like me you dont want to rush through the main story and prefer instead to explore more or do miscellaneous quests youll be glad to take the side roads whenever you see them they will take you to caves mines villages farms dungeons and even dragon lairs the exploration never had an end for me not even after so many hours spent into the game you are probably curious about the combat system while technically not one of the best i have seen in a rpg i must admit that it had massively been improved since morrowind and oblivion the luck factor is not present any more so you cant miss a shot when you clearly were very close to the enemy the third person combat camera is now immersive with tons of new animations and a new feature which i like a lot the killcam one final aspect id like to talk about is the length of the game while the main storyline is relatively short took me around 10 hours on hardest difficulty the side quests and guild quests make this game incredibly long if you get skyrim and plan on beating every single quest clearing every dungeon finding every landmark youd better get prepared for a very very long journey i myself havent completed a quarter of the entire game yet checked progress with a mod this game is by far my favorite rpg at the time being its biggest rival in my opinion being dragon age inquisition pros  incredibly large landscape mixing bioms from tundra to winter from pine forest to stone holds  a lot of locations free for player to explore hundreds of dungeons caves which at their turn are themselves long and filled with enemies puzzles traps which will reward handsomely the player at the end  plenty of quests most of which dont require the player to have completed the main questline  the introduction of dragons as enemies for the first time in the elder scrolls games  residents of cities and villages all have their own lives and families in the morning they will leave their home and go to their job in the afternoon they will take a break for eating and in the evening they will close their shop and go back to their home or at the inn for some mead where after a few hours will go to sleep  random encounters will let the player find more about the game fugitives will tell you to keep their stolen item for a short while followed by a scene where the owner finds you and asks you whether you have seen the thief at this point you can lie you can tell him where the thief went or you can be most honest and give him his item couriers will once in a while give the corespondence to you which can lead to impressive new quests or will update your map with new locations you can find farmers giving their cows as sacrifice for the giants and many many more other events all unpredicatble  the leveling system has been improved since oblivion after you have a high level you will no longer see all enemies wearing the daedric armor instead you will continue to find packs of bandits some of them having leather armor and others having more powerful armor and items  player can buy home in 5 holds where he can place his loot take his wife and kids and take a rest this personally felt like a huge immersive feature in the game world  new powers added to the game world called shouts will let you find out more about it x  you feel that your character truly evolves as you progress more over you can make what you want of your character a good warrior archer thief mage etc by using perks cons  interface is worse than at previous games you cant sort items by criterias feature that had been available in oblivion you cant search for a specific item when you have plenty of loot in your backpack and the aspect is generally bad thus i recommend using a mod that changes inventory  while reasonable the game is filled with bugs some of which can even break a quest again i recommend using the unofficial patches  some textures and meshes havent been vigurously worked by developers and they look bad for 2011 personal rating 95100

1010 the epic  super legendary  most awesomeness of awesome game i have ever played i spent hours dont be fooled by my steam given hours days weeks and years playing this game and it still doesnt get old you know why ill tell you later when i first played skyrim i spent a day just doing one mission because of looting every single thing and exploring every single corner of the god forsaken dungeon i was in moving on later in the game i discovered some exploits and some other things to make things easier finishing the main story and moving on to the side quests after all that i discovered ill tell you why it never gets old mods thats right mods it took me a month in total to get all the mods ive wanted still new mods are released to make other mods look like crap and once again modding the game this game ruined my life not really but in a good way i would want to tell you the story and some mechanics on why this game is good but i am not a serious reviewer i just want to tell you guys this is the bomb right here this game is just plain awesome ps fusrodah

this game with mods will create a strange sort of paradoxical spacetime field around you that will make years and aeons fly by as you slowly whither away into a slightly decrepid old wrinkly and beardy version of your former self you will cuddle up in blankets as you build tents with frostfall to avoid the bitter cold of skyrim emerging from your cave beneath the fortress of helgen only to enter that place that the mere mortals call outside just to get food water and caffeine your social life will slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard and all contact with this outside they speak of will eventually cease five stars

what is there to say about the elder scrolls v skyrim first off this piece of art is one of those games that really sucks you up it can be 2300 when you start playing and after what feels like 10 minutes its actually 100 the grassy planes around whiterun the mountains in the reach the swamps in the rift and the snowy tundras of winterhold will make you want to quit real life and just live in skyrim for the rest of your mortal life but beware adventurer the province of skyrim isnt all fun and games it may appear to be a peaceful place but once you enter the deep caves or get lost in one of the treacherous swamps you will see its true face for skyrim isnt just the home of the nords but also that of many dangerous predators there are the draugrs who live in the many tombs under the face of the earth and will attempt to kill you if you enter their final resting place or the frostbite spiders who will attack you with their poisonous webs once youre close enough the most famous predator in skyrim would perhaps be the dragons who are returning to skyrim it is your goal as the dragonborn to put an end to this though you speak their language which offers many advantages they will not think twice about attacking you skyrim offers many options like talking and helping out the townspeople other adventurers or complete strangers as sidequests when youre not busy with the main storyline or these sidequests youll find out the province of skyrim has alot more to offer roaming around skyrim will make you realize how big it actually is however make sure you are prepared before entering the wilderness because as i said before many predators will attempt to put an end to your life the $1999 you pay for this game is a very fair deal when you consider how much time alot people put in it i hope this review convinced you to buy this masterpiece

lets make short and simple if you are on steam and you dont own this game then youre doing it wrong wrong the game is immensley vast atmosphere is so cool the game will just suck you in it has loads of contents that will keep you busy for 100 hours for sure and mods are just icing on the cake if youre a graphicshungry person mods can make this game look better than most nextgen games out there if modded correctly and the sceneries oh the sceneries i just feel like sitting on my chair and just keep staring at those vast fields of beautiufl grasslands totally recommend this game 1510 but but one and only con that i found is of the fighting mechanics it is just so bland nothing else i dislike about this game

if youre a fan of the elder scrolls series or just interested in checking it out i recommend skyrim while morrowind will always be my favorite tes game skyrim is probably the most accessible of the series not too mention my 2nd favorite though oblivion had a slightly better quest log skyrim is the superior game overall of the two
recommended
a game that is complicated to critique for the first 3050 hours you will be completely absorbed in the beautiful and vast world with seemingly endless opportunities for exploration and questing as you continue to play the cracks start to show the gameplay systems are incredibly shallow the characters wooden the world still beautiful but the dungeons copypasted 120 times over with the same enemies the same meaningless loot the complication arises when you realize that while you are slowly starting to loathe the game youve had 30 hours of fun before hitting that point so the question is was it worth it

skyrim is undoubtedly the best purchase i have made in the past year its worth every $ that its listed at especially when considering the insane amount of content you are given i have only spent about 100 hours in the game this is short in comparison to a lot of people on my friends list but i can assure you that those hours were all packed with immersive content here are some key features that hooked me into the game 1 dungeon complexity  when i say complexity i mean that the design for the games dungeons vary greatly from simple to complex you just have to keep exploring and youll eventually run into the intricately designed areas that get you to pause for a moment and think before being able to progress at times i almost felt as if i were playing the latest tomb raider once again i also found it quite neat that you could use your shouts to bypasssolve a few of the puzzles 2 playstyle freedom  im sure tht a lot of people take similar routes but the game does offer a great deal of freedom with its perk system its definitely a step up compared to games like kingdoms of amalur do you enjoy melee combat how about magic how about a balance of both theres a lot of possibilities 3 expansive lore  as ive mentioned the game has a ton of content playing through everything especially if you are aiming for complete achievements gives you perspective on the whole story and it really is interesting when some quests lore ties into another  maybe even forming a bigger picture skyrim definitely has a lot more charming qualities but these are the features that i really wanted to highlight they stood out for me and it was for these reasons that i ended up buying the game last year only to play it now  2014 during the summer sale with that said i paid $30 for the legendary edition wouldnt you agree that for all this content it was pretty much a steal how many games can you list down that provide hundreds nearly thousands of hours worth of content especially if you count the mods for that kind of price just remember multiplayer games dont count 1010 buy it when it goes on sale during this upcoming summer sale event

this game truly deserves the title of near perfection being one of those rare milestones that comes every so often in years of gaming skyrim itself is probably the best release from bethesdas elder scrolls series story wise this is one of the most developed storyline from the series giving much enjoyment overall in all honesty we can say that the community is one of the most desirable aspect of skyrim due to their dedication in further releases of modifications  improving much of the overall gameplay it never hurts to crank up those graphics it would be a pity to not try skyrim in the course of your lifetime so its advisable to go ahead and try it

you need to buy this you dont need to follow the quests you can join groups and become a hitman dark brotherhood or a master thiefthieves guild much more groups you can hunt animals and admire the graphics very real a game for 2010 is better than some games that just came out ill see you playing it ill rate this 100010 dragons oh yeah that right there is a workshop of this if you get bored of this game once you complete you can download mods

the elder scrolls v skyrim is built solely on the idea of discovery in the very beginning you have no idea who you are where you are or why youre aboard a carriage filled with condemned prisoners all you know is youre an outsider and once youve reached your destination your execution awaits the caravan arrives in the small forted village of helgan where youre pulled from the carriage your captors fail to recognize you theyre just as puzzled by your appearance as anyone else are you a man or woman an argonian or breton this is your first opportunity to ask yourself who you are and who you want to be in skyrim it wont be the last time you ask yourself this lucky for you the execution fails granting you an opportunity to escape helgan this is where skyrim commences and where your story within bethesdas world begins youve been told to visit a town not far north of your escape but nothing other than the word of your new friend is there to compel you to visit it the entire province is at your fingertips skyrim is structured in a loose manner allowing the player to discover its world and various narrative strands at the pace that they desire characters will tell you where you should go but there is never any real urgency to do any of it the world is cluttered with distractions and what makes this experience unique is the distractions form the very heart of skyrim the core narrative as it is is a mean to an end an excuse to pilot you from one corner of the world to the other its hard to imagine anyone following a single narrative strand when its impossible to travel from one quest point to the next without stumbling upon some sort of ruin cave encampment or fort the narrative has its high points but its always made secondary by the next undiscovered location on your compass and thats because bethesda wants you to pave your own story undiscovered locations dot the entire province of skyrim leaving the map a venerable piece of swiss cheese after a few dozen hours discoveries are the actual loot and tracking every single one of them down is the addiction that thrusts players headfirst into bethesdas fiction every location small or large is populated with its own personal story which makes every journey feel special and rewarding theres an understanding that this world this place existed before you fell upon it theres also an unshakable feeling that its all been staged for you skyrim would have you believe its a dynamic world thats constantly in flux when in reality its more like a car stuck in neutral waiting to be put into gear characters go about their daily routines but they merely exist to bestow quests or impart dense records of lore noone is truly alive when youre not engaged with them one of the principal quest lines revolves around the imperials and the stormcloaks two factions waging a purportedly bloody savage civil war that has split the region in two in each and every town across the land nearly every single person is happy to share an opinion on the war telling you how dire the situation has become but there is no war no conflict not unless you decide to take part in it yourself you may see hundreds of random encounters in this nordic land but youll never see the war for skyrim unfolding fiction aside skyrim is a vast majestic world to discover bethesda is unparalleled when it comes to world building and when youre wading through brooks scaling mountains or eviscerating another cave full of bandits its an absolute joy its a remarkable liberating feeling that this province was crafted specifically for you a huge playground with apparently no rules or boundaries that isnt the case skyrim has its rules theyre specific and they have a nasty way of reminding you this fiction was written in binary every city subscribes to a simple bounty system commit a crime and youll be struck down pay a fine or spend the night in jail there is a clear consequence to crime but its merely an illusion on my first evening in the town of morthal i snuck into the jarls house and then into the private quarters of her daughter where i then attempted to pickpocket the young sleeping woman without the deftest of hands the girl arose alerting the guards of my treachery not wanting a fight or untimely death i submitted volunteering to pay my bounty and spend the evening locked up the following morning strolling from my cell i bumped into the sleeping girl once more she asked me to deliver a letter of utmost importance for her she trusted me the bounty system is a dirty way to gloss over any real consequence for your actions there is no gray area everyone is either a friend or foe when an enemy is nearly defeated they may beg for mercy pleading with you to spare them you can sheath your weapon but they will never flee every single one will get up and rush you once a villager followed me into a vampires hideout hoping to avenge the death of his wife madness erupted and amid the scuffle i inadvertently grazed him with a fire spell turning him immediately against me note the vampires who killed his wife were still very much alive afterward instead of arriving to a town full of indebted villagers i returned to an armed welcome and an outstanding bounty there was no way to explain how the town learned of my accidental deed and no way to silence the vengeful widower  i tried killing him several times once youve found the parameters that skyrim works with its not difficult to play by its rules and even enjoy it there is a huge jaw dropping world to discover at whatever pace you desire along the way youre free to author your own story defining your unique character and experience through whatever style of play you prefer when youre lost in its rich landscape and enthralled within its fiction skyrim thrives and is truly unparalleled its when you take a closer look you cant help but discover the seams holding this tapestry together a must play be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more

this is one of the best games i have played in my lifetime and no im not 11 years old p add 40 years to that yes 51 my life is extremely busy and video games have always been my number one activity to leave the standard world the elder scrolls series of games has been one of the best sources of fun i have found and skyrim is simply the best one of the series by far do download the dlc downloadable contents right away as the latest dlc dragonborn includes very potent aspects to the game as the ability to receive two perk points when reading ability books but yes theres a but the game is so vast that there are some bugs you need to play this with the elder scrolls wiki httpelderscrollswikiacomwikiquests_skyrim opened in a browser ideally in a separate monitor when playing to see the various issues with each quests or dungeons like how not to completely mess up the blood on the ice quest so you can get to finally buy the somptuous hjerim house in windhelm but number 2 yes there is another issue you may seriously consider adding a few mods to your game since they may fix some of the bugs mentioned for exemple  adding the dawnguard dlc will make vampires appear and kill potentially vital characters depending on the sort of build your are trying to achieve for your character geeez you would think they would have thought of a way to hold these attacks until you start the quest no they didnt but theres a mod that actually does this for you  preventing all vampire attacks which may kill city vendors and other characters until you actually start the quest yep this means sorry lad but you really should take a stroll around the modding area easily accessible in steam by clicking the workshop button under your play button in the games library once youve selected skyrim there are a few really cool mods i like apart from this one one is called run for your lives and also makes all villagers run inside when theres a dragon attack again preventing important characters from simply being wiped out before you get a chance to kill them yourself p apart from that the game is just insanely good i have played it from beginning to end many times and still discover new things

skyrim is an excellent game it really is and made all the better by an amazing modding community hence this negative review valves decision to introduced paidfor mods threatens to decimate this community now first and foremost do modders deserve money for their hard work in many cases yes  a thousand times yes however is this the right way of providing such a monitary incentive no a million times no all this current system does is create a paywall that looks set to divide the community instead valve should have added a donate button this way we could still reward those modders that we feel deserve a little something for their work without creating this massive schism i would urge anyone reading this to not support such a practice vote with your wallets and make this another horse armour scandal if theres a mod author whose work you really admire instead of subscribing here head over to the nexus and contact the author about making a donation and if the mod you like isnt on the nexus any longer find another mod if youre a mod maker please think twice about making a steamonly release the steam workshop is not a good mod manager for skyrim anyone serious about skyrim modding will need to use tools such as nmm or mod organizer alongside other programs such as loot if they have any desire to have a stable experience the workshop only makes this process more difficult its as simple as that this is an awful and illadvised move by valve i can only hope that this isnt the shape of things to come oh and httpsyoutubeedyxixyazq0

if i were to write a full review of this game it would be nearly novel length i would discuss all of the faults and failings of skyrim of how bethesda took the generic route for more profit while selling out essentially everything that made elder scrolls worth playing all while butchering the lore to cover their changes classes a starting birth sign the total nerf of all things magic things like hand to hand being rolled into perks the removal of stats a whole class of armor being removed reduction of armor pieces the lies about spears the broken marriage system the dull civil war the normalizing and thus dulling effect on battling dragons lore and plot hiccups and so much more could be covered but instead i can summarize it all with one message i only bought this game because it could be modded really the only reason why i even have well over 1000 hours in skyrim is because of mods on its own even without ripping into every flaw mistake horrible design choice the mountain of bugs and the aging engine that they still havent bothered to work out flaws like the stuttering skyrim is not worth playing for more than a few hours it holds no merit on its own other than being open to modding people can disagree of course there are a lot of people who still play it to this day on consoles without the ability to mod to them i do not ask why because it would solve nothing i would still disagree with them to me this game is a flawed mockery of elder scrolls and the only thing that saved it is the modding community i hold no hope for the future of elder scrolls not after this game and not after the way bethesda so causally almost destroyed the community with their greed

two words paid mods wha i like the game but paid mods still trying to wrap my head around that i am a modder i helped contribute to mass effect mods mehem cem and harby module specifically now i have not contributed to skyrim mods but i feel that i have enough experience on modding itself that i can at least have a justified opinion on the subject of valve charging for mods basically it is a terrible idea why is that dont good modders deserve support some may ask absolutely black mesa for instance is a good example of a mod that might deserve monetary compensation counter strike started as a mod too as a modder and a human i like money but this isnt the way to go about it this situation valve started is terrible because it has resulted in or will result in the following first valve you have now made modder a dirty word here on the steam forums almost overnight thanks a bunch you have now divided pc consumers and modders when we used to be a pretty tight bunch second i now see mods going up that are little tiny swords and whatnot going up for sale bundles already that cost more than the game itself in other words i am concerned about a complete influx of mods that are completely useless and tiny and unsupported and updated just because of moneygrabbers who want a piece of the pie third this leads to microtransaction hell hell for consumers and a deluge of stuff to compete against for us modders this isnt healthy competition it is gonna be cutthroat thanks again for taking the fun out of it fourth there will be inevitable stealing of others peoples content and then selling it as their own some may claim that because they modified another mods content they now have created their own mod and are free to sell i disagree they are making money at the expense of others fifth you have a return policy if it is even worth of the name that is full of holes first 24hrs isnt much time to test if a mod will glitch out or not ever heard of a standard 14 or 30 day return policy lets say a consumer buys a mod then one week later the modder releases an update this update has a bug and the game crashes or glitches out then lets say for whatever reason even a good one like real life got in the way the modder doesnt release an update to fix the bug before today big deal you could either uninstall the mod or revert to a previous version given it was free most people wouldnt complain too much but now a consumer will likely be stuck with a useless piece of software they paid good money for software that now is worth zilch they will be understandably really upset with no way to get their money back lastly you valve are likely hurting good legal sites like nexus mods as some greedy people take their mods or the premium versions off the site in favor of posting to the steam workshop these sites rely on advertising revenue to run and you will very likely hurt this revenue why do that you used to have a reputiation of siding with the underdog it is not like you are in competition with people like nexus it is not like they are ea taking a corner of the market and it isnt even like you really need the money valve this just feels to me like a cash cow a move ea would be proud of sadly as a modder i disapprove of this move steam this may have far reaching consequences for everyone involved as for the rest of you if you are still reading thanks by the way please support the effort against this initiative by valve sign the petition here httpswwwchangeorgpvalveremovethepaidcontentofthesteamworkshop more importantly speak with your wallets the best way to change this policy is to not spend one single cent on mods no matter what keep mods free ad astra per aspera ps there is a protest group you can join here httpsteamcommunitycomgroupsboycottsteamworkshop

do you really think that payed mods is a smart idea mods have been the backbone of creativity with games and it has always been known to be community based not currency based i feel its almost a taboo to make people pay for mods i dont blame bethesda even though they may have been the people to go to valve and propose this idea but i give the full blame to valve and steam they are the ones with the ending decision to pull this kinda of  they have always been money grubbing and have practically created a pc gaming hub monopoly origin uplay and the likes will never be what steam is and valve knows this that is why they are able to pull stupid  like this ive spent thounsands of dollars on steam so have the hundreds of thousands of people that would frown at this have and we only are here becauase steam honestly is kind of a last stronghold for pc gaming that is the only reason why not because you are good not because you are doing your job well but only because you are the only pc gaming hub worth anyones time fix your  vavle really all you have been doing these past two years is do some of the most self centered things and its only possible because steam is a monopoly soon steam will fail and it will especially if you keep pulling stupid  like this

ive always loved this game and of course the mods now we will have to pay for mods that will quickly go unsupported due to the nature of the modding system why pay for something that wont continue to have support and might cause other mods to crash or corrupt my saves over time i understand the argument for paid mods but this particular implementation of that practice has me completely against the idea make the mod creators accountable for their product before you start charging

as a skyrim modder whos spend easily 250 hours creating a massive level that spans 13 the length of the skyrim map i find it unbelievable that valve and bethesda want 75% of the profit if i ever chose to add a donation button personally i would never charge for a mod ive done im giving back to the community thats given me so much enjoyment but a donation button seems reasonable for people who might like to say thanks with their wallet for all the hard work modders have done the skyrim modding community is an incredible and unique and for vale and bethesda to attempt monetize it has left me questioning my relationship with these two companies its pretty disingenuous to release the creation kit for free then years later say we want $$$ i have a feeling that some lawyers at bethesda realized after four years that mods are an untapped revenue stream for their shareholders and decided to capitalize on it without having any idea how that would effect the community or their companys image with fallout 4 and tes vi on the horizon this looks like a cash grab by bethesda an attempt to solidify a moneymaking scheme for future releases this nickleanddimming people to death has no place in pc gaming find a better way to do it because youre turning your fan base against you tldr 1110 before 110 after the decision to take a 75% cut of revenue from modders

i am no longer recommending this game or steams service as of april 26th 2015 in light of recent events it has occurred to me that valve and zenimax no longer care about the customer or communities it is a disappointing turn of events and i wish the right thing would be done unfortunately i see little chance in that happening the damage is done reasons for not supporting paid mods it opens up opportunities for theft gabe newell stated that it is impossible between the community and valve at this happening yet its already happened several times in fact with the first bundle of mods released whats worse if modders want to see if their work is being stolen they must go through the arbitrary paywall it dissolves the intertwining of mods its not just entire mods being stolen its also assets what zenimax and gabe newell do not understand is skyrim has mods that are related to other mods mostly through the use of the same resources modders release resourcesfor free online to share freely with other modders so what happens when a modder makes something with their hard work and asks money for it how will those other modders who shared their resources get paid or even be aware their work is being used like this not even mentioning the fact that many modders who create things in software like blender or photoshop dont even have licenses to monetize on them this is why its a terrible idea the mods depend too much on each other to have some of them put behind a paywall it splits the community partly for the reasons above and for many other reasons the community is damaged through this action gabe newell said that money is what drives a community perhaps for communities that are moneydriven but he doesnt realize that the modding community has worked for well over a decade with little issue and here valve and zenimax enter destroying that sense of community in just a few days great job the modders get shafted im not saying modders dont deserve money for their hard work or that im unwilling to pay if you take a look at my steam library youd know i pay for my products my problem with the current system is that it is a very insulting way of going about it when the modders do all the hard work they get 25% in what way is this a fair deal to them that insinuates that valve is getting 30% and zenimax is getting 45% why do either of you deserve that cut what have you done except provide the tools and service to distribute these mods does a car mechanic give the majority of his cash to the car manufacturer and tool makers the deal is a raw one and frankly it is an insulting one if people want to support these modders it is best done through donations where they get all the money they deserve for the reasons stated above i request that you cease and desist this morally legally and creatively stunted attempt at making an extra buck save your reputation before its too late

skyrim is a game that is quite frankly not worth your time and ill tell you why pros the world is beautifull cons the combat is extremely dull and very repetetive the combat is easy the game is far from balanced in any way the world does not feel immersive what so ever you can fullfill any role like being the emperor and the leader of the bad guys at the same time there is no charma system the only thing that could make this game any good is if you decided to mod the hell out of it now you cannot do that anymore since its all behind paywalls valve takes a greedy 75% of the money so the developers of the mod gains very little if you want to support mods as you should donate to the mod authors directly if you can in its current state this is quite frankly not worth your time skyrim is as wide as an ocean but deep as a puddle

the elder scrolls v skyrim development team bethesda and valve have recently reached a deal where mods can be sold on its steam workshop while already a dubious concept it has been executed horribly for example valve receives a 30% cut on mods the publisher determines their cut in this case 45% goes to bethesda leaving modders with 25% money is paid not in store credit but instead in real cash but only after the modder accumulates a $100 cut which will not happen for most mods due to a lack of copyright on mods there are mods which are being stolen and being resold as a paid mod there is also no protection against any mod being stolen in a legal or drm sense there is no quality control on mods in the steam workshop and modders have no obligation to provide a working product or to update their mods which will lead to refund concerns due to many free mods dependencies on what was other free mods that are now becoming paid mods end users will have to pay for those mods in other to use other mods which depend on them this will be happening with the skyui mod mods such as midas magic are having their free versions removed by the modder after he attempted to integrate pesterware for the paid version into them p2w and cosmetic mods will likely dominate the market over expansions as less work needs to go into those and that is where the money is the entire thing reeks of bad business practice and is a mess a better way to execute donating to modders is to set up a tip jar system where users can pick up and thoroughly test and play with a mod and then go back to the modders workshop page where they can give modders a tip out of their steam wallet this system as it stands shafts users and it shafts modders as modders have to sell $400 out of a single mod to see any sort of money i cannot endorse a company which is endorsing this practice

i feel like this game is very overrated theres a ton of content for sure and that gives me a lot of stuff to do but what fun is it if i find the combat so damn boring few of the attacks seem to carry any real weight and magic feels underpowered to me my favorite part of this game was the modding community and how you could take a mediocre game like this and make it something different and beautiful recently however bethesda and valve have gotten greedy and now the mod scene for this game is crumbing in on itself for its current sale price its a pretty good deal and i would say everybody should probably play it at one point or another because its generally considered a classic but please dont buy any mods buying mods tells these companies that were okay with them making money off of every single aspect of gaming even work they never did they shouldnt be making a dime off of these mods and in fact they should be paying these modders for driving more people to their game

new review while the practice of paid modding has been suspended for now my gripes with the many problems in this vanilla version of thing game as well as the overall lack of content remain a big factor the game grows dull boring and redudant quick most of the game involves going from point a to point b to something and then fast travel back to point a to go to point c if you want to know why i was crafting dragonbone armor before completing my fus ro dah shout there you go i find it very hard to pick back up after i stop playing and thats a shame old review while this supports paid mods and as a modder i strongly do not it is a disgusting practice making its way onto the gaming scene that should remain on the mobile market and elsewhere until the practice stops i cannot recommend this game for purchase at all hell not even oblivion or morrowind spend your money elsewhere and for games that encourage free modding the same goes for dropping support for any mod authors who has the gall to put their mod up on the workshop andor those removinghiding their nexus mods do not support mod authors who support monetizing something that is free do not support bethesda either aside from that the game is plagued with bugs gamebreaking glitches etc mods helped make all these problems go away and now they intend to be gated behind a paywall

completely ruined by the paid mods the replayability and atleast for me the fun of skyrim relies on the ability to download all the mods you want but nowadays those mods are behind a stupid paywall so the essence of skyrim is now behind microtransactions that arent always very micro  so if you want to have actual fun in this game you have to actually pay for unreliable downloadable contant that has no guarantee of updates patches or support of course you have 24 hours to get a refund but heres a scenario you download a mod pay for it and it works fine but after 24 hours the author releases a patch that breaks the mod now you have no way to get your money back good luck tldr dont do it not fun without throwing big amounts of money to potential scams

you know i used to like this game i used to have a postive review on this game and was planning to get back into this game but bethesda and valve decided to do something that not even ea would do and that is force paying for user created mods yes i understand that no work should be done for free and yes i do agree hat modders should get rewarded for their work and dedication but i dont agree that i should be forced to pay for mods that is why donations exist since the dawn of pc gaming mods has always been free and this should never change the reason mods exist is because gamers want to show their passion for a game they love and extend the life of the game and share their dedication to other people as a result people would donate to show their appreciation to the modders dedication but now that time is gone apparently because now apparently people are as greedy as ever what happens to the people like myself who already donated money to modders but now have this pay wall to force pay a particular mod this is shady business practice and if this doesnt change soon then pirating will become a bigger issue and everyone will lose till then i dont recomend the steam version and the pirated version seems the better choice to show that this new business practice is huge mistake

update paid mods have been removed but the damage is already done unlike others who have changed their reviews back to recommended this will stay as not recommended those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it this was my favorite game once i put over a thousand hours in and ive never finished the main story why because of mods i would play through mod after mod that added quests or new companions or changed enemies and combat i put even more time into morrowind elder scrolls has always been more about what the community can do for the game than the game itself but now the mods i loved to play this game with have disappeared theyre no longer available out of fear that their work will be stolen and sold so thanks for that because now i have no reason to ever finish this game properly because all the little touches the community added to this game that kept me coming back to it are gone
not recommended
the game was always average to begin with if you want to play an rpg go out and buy morrowind instead there you wont have to pay for mods to fix all of the terrible decisions bethesda made this with one its terrible to play without tonnes of mods and you should never be forced to pay for a mod especially one solely designed to fix the awful game design which the people who made that awful game design then get 45% of the cut from ya no gtfo

now supports pmc paid mod content if you buy this game at some time in the future know that a mod that is essential for the game to run in a working manner unoffical skyrim patches might have chosen to go pay2play then the game will work but not to its fullest the series of the elder scrolls is famous for its mod authors and on the day of this review that has been changed i do not at this time recommend you buy this game until pmc is either finalized and is here to stay or abolished just be warned that the greatest thing about bethesda games being the modders has changed so too must our views please make sure before you buy that if you are interested in modding your game that the mods you want havent gone pay2play i have almost 1200 hours from mods alone in this game not the game itself the base game itself is ok but not 1200 hours ok just shop smart and look out before you jump is all that im saying 1010 before pmc 610 after pmc

cannot recommend the game in its current state it is a possiblity that the majority of mods will be behind a paywall which will be very expensive for people who runs this game with several dozen of mods if the average mod will be around 2 euro it will cost me personally 120 euro  original game launch price with dlc for a total 200 euro at that price it is simply not worth it
not recommended
edit paid mod workshop has been disabled but i wont change my recommendation to positive this is a reminder to any developer that tries to implement paywalls on something that should remain free was an awesome game and it still is but 80% of the awesomeness was due to the dedicated modding community which at the moment is very disunited due to the mod selling update some modders call others sellouts for selling their mods the sellers defend this by saying that all the hard work needs to be compensated for this was a bad idea mods are not dlc and shouldnt be treated as official content a mod may work today but it may not work 2 weeks in the future due to a game update or me installing another mod either way the mod seller has no responsibility to fix it

the original root of evil bethsda are at it again being the first to introduce paid dlc with their horse armor now they along with valve are bringing gaming to a new low for the sake of sucking more money from gamers shame on both companies mods are part of the skyrim experience the appeal and experience of the game itself has been degraded by this disgusting practice shame on you

paid mods is unacceptable i wonder how theyre going to deal with all of the breaches in fair use for when these go commercial once you add money into the modding world you open the door for both free and paid mods to get a dmcalike takedown for potential loss of revenue from copyright holders the copyright holders probably wont even need to show an interest in developing something but their due diligence lawyers will make it up this will only stifle the modding communitys creativity and promote bland sterile mods made by soulless professional modders

reasonable game without mods has really bad ui very dull slow and insistent storyline and you just end up not really caring the side missions are a hell of a lot more fun i never bothered with the main quest pretty ish but not that great with mods it becomes a whole new world you can make it look so much better add more realistic effects add a random start so you dont have to sit through the dull and horrible cart scene fix the ui add tonnes of weapons and armour you can even fix all the bugs well most of them theres some ones bethesda cant be bothered with that even modders cant fix however this new paid mod scheme makes me very wary of it indeed i mentioned the stock ui being bad the mod to fix that which is a core component of many mods has just become paid only theres an older version on the nexus no longer being updated this is a worrying trend modding makes this game what it is its just standard otherwise if you want it mod it for free from the nexus or workshop and i can kind of recommend it but oblivion and fallout new vegas are still very good alternatives for modding paradise if it wasnt for this new introduction of paying for mods id put it as a positive review but the damage this could do to the modding community is too great especially bethesda games which often rely on modders to fix their broken games

i would really really love to be able to recommend this game to people but as of recently i just cant anymore those reasons being quite obvious and many people already pointing out those reasons by allowing the whole pay for mods instead of donating they have essentially killed any kind of longevity that skyrim had by doing this they have caused popular mods one that fix problems with the game and many many more things that improve the game immensely and keep them behind a paywall the only way id recommend this game now is if this all becomes an optional donation or purely free instead but until then i cannot do so

the game itself is utterly amazing  it is my all time favorite game and before this  with paying for mods i couldnt praise it enough now paying for mods is obscene  i have played this game for well over 2000 hours and i own the legendary edition on steam as well as on ps3  after many an hour playing the game on ps3 the game had lost appeal to me  i didnt dislike the game i just ran out of things to do then i bought a desktop pc and i bought the game again just to experience mods  being that i already had done everything twice in vanilla skyrim modding was essential to me as it was the only thing keeping the game alive and let me tell you the mods made the game soooo much better  the improved graphics the new quests better interfaces  you name it and someone has probably already made it the community for modding is amazing people still work tirelessly trying to make the best damn game improvements or they are just expressing themselves through their mods because they have a passion this passion might as well be gone for some of these modders at this point people will now try and make and probably half mods just for the sake of making a quick buck modders havent been payed up till this point and it has worked great so far  dont fix what aint broken please valve introduce a donation button and let people decide for themselves if the authors work is worthy for a donation of a dollar or two rant over

remove paid mods it is a terrible idea already users are submitting mods they didnt make for money people are stealing assets in their mods modders are making exclusive versions of their mods see wet and cold 20 that must be paid for and depriving long time fans of their work the update do not buy any paid mods it can only go badly

skyrims not a terrible game after youve modded it to high hell and now they want to stop that and force you to pay for those sweet mods wouldnt you want to pay $50 for a hd horse

for a game that relies heavily on mods to be enjoyable and is often bought only for mods bethesda had a lot of balls to sell out to 3rd party dlcmicrotransactionsmods we trusted bethesda we saw them as one of the good companies whatever that means anymore they showed us what happens to people who trust blindly even worse valve valve had the biggest fanbase of any company of them all everyone praised gaben and called him the savior of pc gaming our god see where our blind faith has led us to betrayal and dont think that this only applies to skyrim for in time this will spread to other games and corrupt them with its greed we have to stop paid 3rd party dlcs they dont deserve to be called mods before they spread before the gaming industry thinks its okay and before it taints other beloved games

taking money from the community with no guarantee with stability and keeping 75% away from the creators onlybethesda maybe 4 hours of main story gameplay i beat this game overnight on the day of release i was so confused was that it was there really nothing more to the game than that yes sure there are numerous sidequests i did not complete but most of them are nothing more than reskinned fetch quests for the size of the world the horses are painfulyl slow and thus i found myself quicktraveling nearly everywhere without mods i might have 7 hours total logged in the game

this game is great i love everything about is except your new paid workshop mods this idea is absolutely terrible i am not going to pay to mod the game modding was one of the best things about this game and has been for the longest time by taking the ability for us to get these mods for free you have lost my respect as well as the respect of others there are way too many of us who do not want this change and we think you should not be forcing this upon us congrats valve you took something great and turned it into something that can be milked for money it is elder scrolls online all over again i dont know how long it is going to take you to learn that shaking down the consumer for money is the worst possible thing you could do this is one of the many things that killed the elder scrolls online you are moving in the same direction right now turn back

let me start off by saying this game is fanstastic one of my favourite games of all time  so you may ask why is it your favourite game of all time because their are a alot of things you can do in this game like modding the mod community for this game is freaking amazing one of the best mod communities for the tes series the mods in this game blow you away visual wise and immersivegameplay wise there are so many mods to get if you play as a female character you got alot of choices like sexy armoursbody typeshair modstexture mods and so on so fourth with immersive you have gameplay changes like combat enhancements or prespective mods to make it like you are really in the world of skyrim the map is super huge almost compareable to gta v but a little bit smaller there are alot of quests to do in the world of skyrim and alot of interesting npcs so let me talk about visuals well their are high res texture packs 1k2k4k textures to choose from but i prefer 1k2k to keep a stable fps and to stop your game from crashing also there are alot of enbs to choose from to enhance your colors to make em more vibrant and dramatic and to enchance the lighting to make the game looks extremely better than vanilla i like to think of skyrim like a nextgen game with all these mods you can get cause it truely is a next gen experience over the vanilla game thats just ugly and messy so if you are gonna play the vanilla game just play it on a console like really if you play the pc version why not get some mods to enhance your experience even further  so many content arghhh mind blowing  i hope this review sums it all up for you to purchase the game also i do not recommend the steam workshop for mods i recommend the skyrim nexus  go now buy it  also on a side note the vanilla game is great if you want a lore friendly game but it is recommended to get mods dont hate on this review cause i am pointing to mods all this time i clearly stated if you want vanilla than play console you get the pc version for a better experience and well for mods later on but i recommend playing through the game atleast once with the vanilla game and than after than expand your experience ever further sorry if i am just talking about mods all the time

its the moment that has always defined the elder scrolls series that palpable feeling of freedom and adventure as you gaze across a vast beautiful landscape skyrim is not a great leap from oblivion or even morrowind but it is the finest chapter in the series to date an unforgettable journey into another world when you start skyrim the only things you get to choose are your race sex and appearance the editor is fantastic frankly with a wealth of sliders and presets each race  of which there are ten  has its own special ability which includes passive effects that are always active and spells you can use once a day nords for example have 50% frost resistance and a battle cry ability that makes enemies flee in terror while argonians can breathe underwater and cast histskin to rapidly regenerate their health still besides these initial bonuses how your character develops depends entirely on how you play the game say you use greatswords a lot in combat this will see your twohanded weapon stats improve every time you strike an enemy or maybe you prefer to keep your distance and use bows every arrow that hits its target will improve your archery stats its of course still possible to avoid traditional combat altogether sneaking through an area undetected silently killing enemies without alerting their allies the stealth isnt much better than it was in oblivion with twitchy ai that becomes aggressive way too easily but it gets better when your archery and sneaking skills increase and you find enchanted equipment like boots that muffle your footsteps if oblivions world was green and colourful and straight out of a tolkien novel skyrims fantasy is much more hardedged drawing inspiration from norse mythology to create a world thats both stunningly beautiful and incredibly convincing at all times it feels like a real place with a real history its a snowblasted land of icy peaks boggy marshes leafy forests and barren tundra and its a joy to explore tiny details play into the believability of your surroundings too like the way the weather changes depending on your elevation in the lush forested valley to the southeast a thick fog hangs in the air and its almost always raining as you head north snow appears on the trees and the wind begins to howl then as you get higher climbing one of skyrims many mountain ranges a heavy blizzard rolls in obscuring the path ahead when night falls the sky is illuminated by skyrims equivalent of the northern lightsthank you for reading my whole review or just scrolling all the way to the bottem remeber to give a thumbs up and play skyrim

i bought skyrim at launch after valves and bethesdas decision to turn mods into paid dlc without the qc or any gurantee they will work this is the review i will give them taking 75% of the money is disgusting i will never buy a bethesda game egain and will move as further as possible from steam as i can your games are bad anyways bethesda half the game is done by modders and i expect next time you will release a txt file that you want modders to fix you people started the horse armor dlc and the insane dlc crapshow we have today in the industry and now you came for the mods to do the same thing hope you like that grave you dug

minor dlc packs were a disease we inherited from consoles were now stuck with them because people couldnt exercise enough selfcontrol not to spend their money on obvious cash grabs dont let cash grab mods gain the same foothold edit valve retracted the paid mods but this wont be the last we see of them this review is staying negative as a reminder of this cash grab

paying modders hard work is good and i support that every content creator should be able to live well and pay their bills but i think it is ridiculous that valve and bethesda are taking 75% of the revenue plus not all modders are honest this is going to ruin modding for everyone involved

with the addition of paid mods i can no longer in good faith recommend this game anymore they are a legal ethical and creative disaster that benefits no one beyond brethesda & valve with the conversion of many popular mods to this paid model including skyui which many other mods are dependent on all this does is split the community in the name of personal and corporate greed would not recommend will not buy another brethesda game again

valve and bathesdas new paid mod system undermines the very foundation of pc community and pc modding i strongly suggest that you do not buy this game doing so would be supporting corporations who want to squeze every dollar out of their customers as they can without any regard to the pc community that has proudly loved them for over a decade
not recommended
what can you say about elder scrolls series  its more popular than a picture of jesus holding a pug with a bowtie and rightfully so most of the series issues are countered by the fact that talented sometimes downright disturbingly obsessive modding community probably modded them out and skyrim is no exception even if you sink more than hundered hours in vanilla version you can still find something you havent done and want to do want to spend all your time forcepushing chickens around town  sure  wanna put buckets over npcs faces while theyre delivering important pieces of exposition  you got it  while im usually opposed to make your own fun kind of games doing your own thing is bread and butter of skyrim and thats what makes it so popular yeah it may be a bit more simplified for the sake of accessibility than older tes games and maybe enviroments and combat get a bit boring and repetitive after a while but it all falls flat when you can summon 5000 wheels of cheese and roll them down the mountain on unsuspecting goats

this game is clearly made for consoles and ported over to pc the ui is great for controllers but horrible to use over a mouse and keyboard the combat is clearly made for button mashing via controller and therefore is a little drab the only saving grace were mods and now that mods are paid this means the price of the game isnt the final price you pay if you want to play a great game and who knows how much mods are going to cost

games of the elder scrolls series have some very clear expectations to them and must adhere to some very specific core concepts skyrim does not tarry too far from the mark this game has many weaknesses that almost universally stem from its multiplatform development  cities feel like villages and villages dont feel at all this is entirely because of the limitations of the engine and the consoles weapons and armour are one size fits all and all armours of the same material are identical there is no wear and tear of your items money from a thousand years ago does not draw comment when given to a vendor you have no useful journal system instead the map tells you exactly where to go for everything many things that disrupt the immersion within the game play this game once on a vanilla play through and then add in the mods the base game is good and it will help you appreciate the platform you are playing on a thousand times over when you play a second game using mods you will mod this title you will mod it to hell and back you will love it for the mods that shore up the weaknesses and enable new and wonderful things in the game steam workshop integration sounds nice but its not the games mod interface is garbage and the workshop prevents a lot of the mods you will want you will end up using nexus mods and their nexus mod manager or the slipstream mod manager to handle all your mods there are mods to patch problems to reenable content replace bad textures enhance combat add items add npcs whatever your heart may desire the mods are there the game is good genuinely good but it could have been so much better one hopes that fallout 4 learns the lessons presented by the mods of skyrim rather than dooming modders to recreating their efforts in the next version of the engine any gamer worth their salt has already got this game and has played at least some of it
recommended
for the people who 1 want depth  a huge story behind every single quest 2 think the npcs are garbage because they dont react the way the should when the dragonborn does this or that 3 look for amazing & different ways of combat in order to kill your enemies 4 think its too repetitieve shallow bland dungeon crawler 5 want to add thousands of mods not reading how to install them & then complain the game is trash because it crashes this game is not for you i enjoy this game very much & i think its a really good game it all depends on what kind of games you like & if youre too picky sure this game is not perfect & has bugs glitches etc but id like to see you developing a game like this or even better im sure people who dont have high expectations will love the game as much as i do take your time exploring the places doing the quests just add some mods if you need more action be careful they dont conflict with each other & youre ready to go  810

this review is a very long one it actually is kind of an article between a gameplay review a roleplaying guide a mods compilation and story of a character if you are not intrested i suggest you to pass it right away content is written all by me please do not distribute without permission the elder scrolls v skyrim is undoubtedly one of the greatest pc games ever made personally the single best rpg and openworld game ive seen it is an unlimited digital source of pleasure for a lifetime frp lover like myself there really arent many words to describe such perfection first of all best thing about skyrim is the fact that things you can do is literally endless content is literally endless i am at around 2000 hours of skyrim gameplay also played it a lot before my steam copy and everyday i still keep discovering some totally new things vanillia game with dlcs has at least over 20002500 hours of gameplay around 1500 hours without any dlcs maybe if you do nothing but quests endless number of mods you can apply will make gameplay way way longer and again this is only possible if you do nothing but quests no sightseeing fast traveling all the way skipping lore and forgetting about the identity of your character still its your choice to play skyrim in the way you want i have 3 characters and ill talk about one of them whom i mainly play vanillia content is more than enough to play 3 unique paths except main storyline for 3 seperate characters you also can alter main storyline to a degree but first id like to talk about mods which i actively use in all my characters plus there are some particular ones for each characterno visual mods included  first of all most indispensable mod for me is probably the disable fast travel i think that fast traveling absolutely ruins the game i never fast traveled before neither in skyrim nor oblivion morrowind didnt had it anyways damn i love morrowind never will and i hate people who fast travels fast travel system is necessary as a result of overall demand to skyrim but when its being used thats half of the games beauty gone some people play it just for the other half anyways  i very much like the ineed mod which adds a streamlined approach to needs you need to eat drink and sleep once in a while for full effectiveness of your character it has some nice details like for example you can carry a flask drink your water from it when you are thirsty and fill it from any water source when depleted even from rain  static mesh improvement an amazing mod which replaces some plain textures with idea of adding a feel of third dimension with actual 3d meshes it adds a whole new level to details all around tamriel  skyui a musthave interface overhaul  cloaks of skyrim  skyrimspeeds speed adjustments  improved dragon shouts  command dragon for manual control  alternative crafting system helps roleplaying without abandoning your gear potential  immersivefp for firstperson dragon & horse riding  a quality world map with all roads  touring carriages  fnis custom animations engine  and falskaar its an amazing mod which adds a new quest line a huge new map and a very solid lore very professionally done almost like an official dlc the character i want to talk about is my female dragonborn assassin last member of the dark brotherhood and guildmaster of thieves guild shes the character that i played the most although shes not the character i first created or beat the main storyline i beat the main storyline with my mage for the first time and i wanted continue as an assassin created her after completing the unbound quest which is the very first quest i literally quit the main storyline and completed the dark brotherhood and thieves guild storylines yea you can do that you literally can complete almost every side quest in tamriel without touching the main story by the time i return to the main storyline i already was a master assassin skyrim has an npc progress system it doesnt let you level up more than usual before story and oneshot every npc youll still have an adventage tho so i progressed through it at ease except the dragon parts where i needed to go headon and i completed it as she completed her personality shes not a type of assassin without honour shes not like killing random people just for moneyfun or shes not using her dragonborn powers for personal gain spideyphilosophy instead she actually delivers justice and avenges the downtrodden shes more like batman the dark knight except the killing part and all that thieves guild stealing part is also like the phiolosophy of robin hood or at least the cat woman in the end shes a very righteous character in her own way i completed a billion small quests and some big ones like civil war and the companions storyline actually all the big ones as far as i know and married with aela yep aela is a female yep im a female yep before heading to dawnguard dlc ive completed dawnguard as a vampire i got cured afterwards but im still not sure about being a vampire since it actually fits the concept of her being a master assassin hiding in shadows but there are too many downsides i wont ever be using the vampire lord form since its totally irellevant with my character and i dont like its benefitsaesthetics anyways after that dragonborn came out and i also finished it which actually fits perfectly to her personality since the purpose is kind of assassinating a corrupt leader as the only assassin because of being a dragonborn who can do it and became a complete dragonborn since then im traveling short distances with shadowmere and long distances on a dragon not dragon fasttravelling im navigating manually i do some unusual things in my spare time in skyrim which many can find weird but i enjoy a lot for example i have some favorite places which i wont be sharing be assured finding your own places would be much more satisfying i sometimes toggle off the running mode and randomly walk at these places again and again for hours never getting bored i also find books in skyrim very exciting there are countless ingame books which you can read each one of them are written exclusively with its unique content i have a great intrest in collecting and reading them and i actually find some of them way more intriguing than many popular real books some of which i can recommend rising threat 4 volumes the wolf queen 8 volumes kolb and the dragon thats probably my favorite book in the game not in terms of its story but it is actually a chooseyourownadventure type of book the black arrow 2 volumes a dance in fire 7 volumes as a side note in my honest opinion books in oblivion were better before finishing here are some mods that i use especially for my assassin  the dance of death a killmove mod  higher jump  martial arts  realistic crime radius  throwing weapons redux  faction crossbows  stealth immersion and i suppose thats all in terms of characters as you can see making a character totally unique is pretty simple its just a matter of will skyrim or any game for that matter can only provide you the visualization and tools of roleplaying you have to use your imagination for an advanced frp experience and in terms of gaming perspective you now should have an idea about how i feel about skyrim and you probably figured out how different you can approach to the game in the end conclusion is actually pretty short and simple skyrim is a must must must must have game and a masterpiece to experience just like a mozart concerto a shakespeare play or a trip to one of 7 great wonders of the world

so i noticed the review page has become an avenue to show dismay of paywall mods rather than rag on about spears horrible animations retar ded ai wonky gamebyro offshoot engine or watered down game mechanics ill be talking about the recent addition of the paywall modswhich ultimately is connected to all these issues i mentioned since bethesda is notorious for releasing games that are somewhat fixed by the modding community so we come to this 20 years of tradition being challeged by the least likely companies of all valve 610 years ago if you said valve was going to create this type of scheme you would have been seen as insane well here we are valve has finally stepped up its game on bolder steps of consolidating power after years of testing the surrounding water what they didnt know is that they would finally be fought back against by attacking one of the cornerstone foundations of pc gaming modding they have committed the most shocking displays of absolute treason what makes it worse is all the little  who defend these actions of paywalled mods the type of people who firmly believe valve can do no wrong and will defend their actions like north koreans will defend dear reader despite being  on all the time their largest argument defending this change tends to be well now you have to pay for the hard work of the modders lets be clear on something modding is a hobby at its core not a business its a hobby of people who have an utmost love for the games they play hence why they mod it and share with their fellow fanbase if you feel entitled to something or came into modding for the sole purpose of benefitting off of it in terms of money or popularity then this hobby is not for you now with pay mods it encourages this behavior even more to a sickening level monetisation brings out the worst in people it draws in the wrong crowd and floods the market with dubious and potentially broken products which some will find themselves gypped on as mods are known to become incompatible with game updates if you truly want to make money off your work then hell try and get a job in the gaming industry whether it be indie or professional level dont muddy up our drinking water

after noticing that paid mods are no longer a thing i say this game is worth the money and modders deserve to get smalls donations if you truely love their stuff now get yourself mod it until it crashes old revieuw for the archives so it begins the great downfall of our time the community has started to crumble with people stealing each others work to just make a profit let me get this straight skyrim is a fun game but gets very boring after getting trough most content in the first 12 hours which is why bethesda gave the modding community power and thus breathed new life in their game now we got payed mods early access payed mods no i refuse to stand for this utter  on both valves and bethesdas end donations would be fine but bethesda cant make money of that now can they edit i found on a subreddit where gabe is awnsering some questions that infact not valve but the publisher of the game sets the cut for modders so that 75% cut that is claimed is for valve is actualy for bethesda for more httpwwwredditcomrgamingcomments33uplpmods_and_steam

skyrim base game  review what is there to say about this game where do i even begin to tackle this monstrosity that has taken me on my 1st playthrough 141 hours just to finish the skyrim basegame were not enough counting the dlcs hereyet the elder scrolls tes is 1 of those series that are loaded w tons  tons of content offering up an insane amount of value  bang for your buck to experience all of it at once  imho at least for me thats probably not the wisest ideas this game has so many different storylines quests areas to explore factions things to do ie get married  its a game you play for numerous hours until youve hit that wall ie i need a break for a while just go away from for a bit & then it calls you back for more very few games do this to me  test drive unlimited 2 far cry 3  skyrim all come to my mind here class systems are gone here in skyrim just practice the attributes you want to want to improve ie sneak around improve that skilll swing a 1handed sworded and hit someone that improves cast a spell from a certain school that improves etc  select new abilities from those attributes to learn at levelup time since youre constantly improving your attributes  levelingup like theres no tomorrow this can be addictive  think like that diablolike kind of addictive skyrim has improved in numerous ways over its predecessor graphically on the technical side the game is much better than oblivion girls actually do look more so like girls in the face namely this time around  thanks for finally getting this right bethesda it took you long enough while many of the game areas are nowhere as crazy  interesting as oblivions shivering isles expansion my favorite area in any tes game since starting in the series w morrowind these lands have a nordic influence on them  most of them truly do look fantastic likely if you see an area way out in the distance theres a great chance  you can go there  explore it completely which is fantastic combat here has improved & is a bit more visceral than oblivion  but when compared to others it certainly is still a little bit clunky like most tes games  does not rival the combat of other games like kingdom of amalur reckoning  dark souls those games certainly do specialize in combat  its still pretty good here in skyrim one thing thats new  you can now dualwield weapons can even wield magic in one hand a weapon in another dualwield different magic spells in each hands andor even dualwield the same magic spell for double the power simply put  these are great additions to this games combat system npcs in the gameworld actually have taken a page right out of the gothic playbook as you will see npcs doing things to immerse you into the world  ie blacksmith sharpening blades with equipment npcs acting on schedules  doing things together on their own  things of that natures as usual theres even more books added to read for those who want to dwelve into the everexpanded  ridiculouslysized lore of the series the main story here is this  dragons have returned to skyrim youre to meet a certain group of people to fulfill your destiny as the dragonborn a human that can learn dragon skills learn dragonstyle shouts & take the dragons out once  for all  which is typical fantasy stuff while the main quest is decent enough  is solid it really feels like its just another quest in the game  like many of the main quests in elder scrolls basegames since morrowind while bethesda is no bioware  no obsidian when it comes to generating fantastic narrative prose  dialogue  where bethesda succeeds over just about every other of the game companies is creating insanely huge playgrounds that have a good deal normally going on w tons to accomplish if you like what youre doing trust me  this is another addictive sandbox from bethesda in which you wont know how to let go of for a while or after being away for a while it will eventually get you coming back for more while not everything here is a homerun there are also many goodtogreat plots  storyline strings here  such as the thieves guilds questline  especially dark brotherhood questlines that i dont even know where to begin skyrim will generate some random quests on its own which often do windup in the misc section  which could keep you going for a long time as if the basegame couldnt do that enough already making this game such a timesink  throw in also that the game ships w the toolkit these days & the ridiculous amount of mods out there bc this series has an extremely heavy modding community  fanbase  you could live for 100s of hours in skyrim even long well after it takes finishing the insane amount of content that bethesda has already provided if theres something about skyrim you dont like  ie the ui isnt that great again even though its improved immensely over oblivion  trust me theres a mod out there to fix your issue w the game for example  skyui mod vastly improves  fixes bethesdas uisystem immesely by offering up a huge sandbox & an insane amount of things to do from questing to exploring here skyrim succeeds in proving again why bethesda  their elder scrolls is 1 of the best  if not the best  at providing addictive timesink rpgs bethesda yet again offers up the kitchen sink here ill certainly drink to that  from that rpg fans looking to get lost for 100s of hours its almost impossible to rival what bethesda does in their games  & thats especially true here in skyrim simply put  another rpg masterpiece from bethesda final grade  a

greedy pathetic valve scum the only fair split is 75% content creator for creating new intellectual property 20% to bethesda for the intellectual property that is the base game 5% to valve for doing nothing more than sitting on their fat asses manipulating their monopoly if you want mods go to skyrim nexus if you love a mod please donate directly to the content creator via paypal if you want to buy skyrim im sorry but you have to register the game through steam but do not have to buy from steam this is a great game but do not buy it through steam same goes for any game where possible gta v is a great example buy direct from rockstar this is valve showing their true colours this is clear evidence their monopoly needs to be broken down

this negative review is only in response to the addition of adding mods that you have to pay to use mods should never be pay to use unless it drastically changes the game ex dlc this creates competition between modders and responsibility to continue to update them or else people will complain some modders are only creating these mods for fun and doing it in their spare time the game itself is great and any money that goes to paying for mods should be an optional donation directly to the modder for their time and effort and none should go to the developer or valve unless for processing fees

its a great game in many ways however due to valves recent adding of paid mods weve been able to see their true colors i think we can all agree that just like every other company valve needs money to stay afloat but putting a paywall on everything especially for work they didnt take the time to do isnt the best thing to do its an extremely greedy business practice its also very sad to see bethesda fall back to this greedy method and i was so hyped for fallout 4

the elder scrolls vskyrim is for me one the best rpg games that ive played this game is briliant in many ways the graphics are pretty decent on the year when the game was released ofcourse there are many retexture mods that can improve the looks of the game combat is pretty sweet too you can choose which class you want to play and you can combine them in the way you want it this game with beautiful openworld many quests many adventures and a lot of more great content can give you the best roleplaying game experience
recommended
the elder scrolls v skyrim where do i start with a review when this game was first released it was still unfinished there were many bugs and issues some of which made playing the game difficult to say the least however it was still one of the best games of 2011 over the years these issues have largely been addressed and the game is now more stable the visuals in skyrim were stunning absolutely stunning when compared with its predecessor the elder scrolls iv oblivion released sixyears earlier using the then new creation engine skyrim is a hyperrealistic world for the player to explore much like morrowwind with a size similar to cryodill in oblivion skyrim has several dlc packs dawnguard hearthfire and dragonborn all of which are a part of the legendary edition the elder scrolls v skyrim is a game every rpg gamer should have in their library most of the bugs and issues present when the game was first released have been resolved there is also a library of mods available for skyrim if you know where to look to personalize the game the way you want it if you enjoyed oblivion you should also enjoy skyrim as it has a more realistic world design from oblivion though is similar in actual overall size potential spoilers skyrim takes place 200 years after the events of oblivion in the northern lands of skyrim on tamriel you play as the dragonborne someone who has the ability to absorb the souls of a dragon and call upon the magical ability thuum known as the shout of the dragon while navigating the story to understand what this means you are also caught in the middle of a civil war between the empire who are now allied with the alderi dominion and the people of skyrim
recommended
the way i see elder scrolls series its not about beating the game its about travel my first one was morrowind ive played oblivion but didnt really pay attention to it and i bough skyrim pretty cheap so far eight hours in the game this is the biggest most complete wonderful es game for true adventurers you dont play to win you play to travel you play to read books you play to enjoy it through and through a rpg game like no other if you didnt play es games before get skyrim and forget about this ugly world we live in
recommended
okay so the elder scrolls v skyrim is the fifth installment to the elder scrolls series which are very successful so far the story is about the return of the dragons that lived thousands of years ago along with them appears the dragonborn whos objective is to stop their return i dont wanna spoil anything beyond this thats why the story explanation is brief tldr for those who didnt want to read a lot heres a short part of the review skyrim is a very large rpg with lots of things to do and you can be pretty much whatever you want to be its hard to determine how much time you will spend playing this game its very unclear and it depends on you the most there are numerious quests and events for you to do skyrim is vast beautiful and dangerous take your time to explore it it certainly wont be wasted money youll have a lot of fun playing this game eventually if you find the game lacking you can always look for mods to enrich your game character creation with each release bethesda strives to improve their beloved elder scroll series in every extent the character creation system has a lot of options once again and they really outdid themselves with the presentation of each of the races they look very immersive and lore friendly next we have the attributes and skill system which is quite simplified in comparison to the previous release sadly while this is not entirely negative some might view it as so because with the removal of attributes and merging of some skills they have limited the building of characters in a way the removal of the class selection is one of the most disturbing but its not all that important to your character build although it is one of the important features of rpg games and finally the birthsigns while they were never really cleverly balanced i kind of appreciate their usage in skyrim because of their weak impact i also despise them because you can simply choose which one you want if you find it and afterwards you can always change it i forgot to mention the skill perks that were first brought into oblivion then altered in fallout 3 and finally finetuned in skyrim a very good feature if i may say so makes the game feel like it has more complexity youre gonna have a lot of fun creating a character or its gonna be a pain it depends take your time wilderness landscape and habitats they put a lof of effort into this the landscape is very breathtaking immersive and worthwhile take your time and explore the great and vast lands of skyrim this is a very big plus they really spent a lot of time on making the surroundings very detailed and immersive besides enjoying the game with its gameplay itself youre also presented with the option of absorbing the environment without actually indulging yourself in some pointless slaughter and you can have a companion who will from time to time say something interesting i dont wanna spoil too much of this either the cities are very immersive and they look great some of them look too similar some too small  i guess this is something that they still need to improve the dungeons and forts looks pretty good they still lack a bit of morbidness and darkness though depending on the denizens i think this is the greatest feature of skyrim please do take your time to absorb the environment the creatures and humanoids and others the ai is dumbed down at least thats my imperssion of it i think the creatures behaviour is better than that of the npcs once again theyve added some creatures that will most likely rip you apart when youre low level and playing on adept or higher difficulty a good example would be the saber cat ill be honest with you im scared of that beast just like in skyrim in oblivion it was the mountain lion or a yaoguai in fallout 3 im glad that the trolls are still depicted as dangerous and annoying the wildlife is very rich and quite immersive in this release  disregarding the occasional random behaviour  i like the presentation of most of the enemies they all feel very lore friendly the city folk are still a bit lacking in my opinion but thats about it finally the dragons are a big disappointment not their looks or the animations and so on its that the combat is poorly designed for them not to mention that the dragons are very weak storywise well presented in general quests and events while some are immersive some are very poorly designed i think they made progress overall in comparison to the previous game some quests are really worth the time but still a lot of them lack challenge i think its still worth to take the time and try them all out i think the player is given too much freedom sometimes which results in some events and quests looking a bit poor mods when trying to use mods execute extreme caution you might end up having to reinstall the game a lot of times before getting them all to work well feel free to ask me for any advice since i have years of experience with this luckly for us we have a very solid modding community since the days of morrowind there will be plenty of amazing mods out there for you to choose from while new players tend to stick to cosmetic mods and adding more stuff mods there are plenty of quest mods that need to be given thought music once again the music is composed by the legendary jeremy soule  his music enchanted the exprience of the previous installments  oblivion and morrowind  including this one i hope the elder scrolls will continue to be blessed with jeremy soules music of epic proportions while this review is long i still could have written a lot more but i dont want to include some spoilers looking forward for the next release still having fun playing this game a big thanks to my friend who gave me the game king viking thanks for taking your time to

shady attempt at mod monetisation aside skyrim has stood the test of time to become established as one of the greatest action rpgs developed reaching such a pinnacle in part due to the superb modding community that must be mentioned in conjunction with the vanilla games effort elevating it into a true time killer even if youve put hundreds of hours into it like i did on console first
recommended
this is one of the best adventures you can play long and storyrich main quest with huge amount of sidequests to venture through with the official dragonborn dawnguard and heartfire dlcs theres tons of places to see and enormous amount of quests to complete if you somehow run out of stuff to find then theres the modding possibility so many mods are out there steam workshop skyrim nexus to give you more quests items and whatever with all the mods its pretty much endless adventure waiting for you as dragonborn the best ability of course is shouting at everything you see its pretty funny to make people fly away when you feel upset about someone stealing your sweetroll some caves and especially dwarven ruins tend to be pretty boring to go to after some time since they are pretty long dwarven ruins and linear just killing tons of same enemies to find somethingsomebody or to get somewhere but other than that its a beautiful and rich game in so many ways that there is no reason why you shouldnt give it a try btw never attack chickens those s seem to be pretty valuable in skyrim since everyone is willing to kill you if you harm them

i love it it gave me 2 years of fun i played every playstyle every race every way every dlc i been from a straight up heavy armor warrior with a huge battleaxe that can turn into a werewolf and could stand still taking every hit from a dragon without losing almost any health to a master thief who isnt very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once all the way to guy who never killed a soul worked hard for his money chopping wood managing to build his own house and have a family the main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore you wont be bored for a long time so dont just rush the main story and assume you seen it all out of the dlcs the best would be dragonborn it offers a large new world enemies quests armors and weapons while the dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form and hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes the worst thing about it is there will be bugs which can easily be fixed by console commands but only use if needed like after 5 retrys a quest wont finish or continue 810 only because it can get far too easy and the bugs you get stronger than all the enemies too quickly so i say when you learn the game better go on master or legendary difficulty for a challenge

do you like role play games then skyrim is the perfect game for you you can create a charakter and can choose a race like  altmer highelf  bosmer woodelf  argonian  breton  dunmer darkelf  imperial  khajiit  nord  orsimer orc  redguard you can play as a warrior or an magician or both and level your charakter up there are lots of skill perks for your chara also you can become some special creatures like a werwolf or a vampire dlc dawnguard gives you a powerfull vampire lord  in skyrim there are lots of quests and a exciting main  story main the dragons are back and something is bring them back alive the dragonborn is the one who can kill the dragons and save the world but where are the dragonborn  everybody is hopeless cause its the end of the world but you are the one who can protect the world of the end and save everybody cause you are a real dragonborn you are the one who kill alduin the world eater and stop the dragons also there are lots of more storys in different guilds like the dark brotherhood assassins the thiefs guild the companions or for the magicians the magicians school also you can choose between the imperials or the stormlocks and can fight in the war so skyrim is the best role play game i ever played and everbody who love rpgs have to buy this

skyrim is easily one of the best games of this generation its one of the games that you get as much out of as you put in its also one of the games you play exactly how you want to play you can choose to ignore the main story immediately after beginning or play through the quests like a linear action adventure game speaking of quests theres an awful lot of them the main story is centred on the return of dragons to the world pretty soon you find out you are the legendary dragonborn a man or woman with the ability to consume dragon souls its your job to find out why the reptiles have returned and try and protect the world from this new menace two thumbs from me because the game deserves it

the elder scrolls v skyrim is an openworld rpg with an awesome story and it has one of the biggest world to explore in any games ever made in this game you play as the dragonborn the chosen one that is meant to protect skyrim from dragons honestly the elder scrolls v skyrim is probably one of the best game on steam the ambiance and everything is just so great its still one of the best selling games on steam even 3 years after its release if you havent played it yet and are you not sure if you should buy it you can check my personal score below category rating 10 details gameplay 81 the game is very well designed you can set hotkeys for multiple spells or weapons at once you can do questlines and misc quests at any times as long as you have the requirements theres tons of content to explore the elder scrolls v skyrim doesnt offer anything new to the genre however and its not very well balanced some dragons are easier to kill than some types of undeads found in dungeons also the ai can be quite confusing sometimes monsters stands still and let you kill them sometimes enemies do not even notice you walking in front of them with a high stealth level everybody can play the game due to good difficulty settings but keep in mind the controls are poor and theres some weird balance going on graphics 80 the elder scrolls v skyrim graphics are nice some things like snow and npcs are not very appealing but during the time you play you will find tons of amazing landscapes skies buildings and forests thats for the base game of course because you can make the game more beautiful with mods as for the animations most are fine but rolling and ragdoll deaths are not so well done the interface is simple and has just the right amount of information atmosphere 85 the music is totally amazing it really fits the game fighting music is intense and while exploring the music really sets the atmosphere sound effects are alright though repetitive my opinion on voice acting is a bit more complex though honestly i am impressed by some characters voice acting like cicero astrid senera sheogorath they have very unique and amazing voices on the other hand some npcs shares the same voice like litterally not just the same voice actor but the same actual voice in game on multiple npcs performance 48 heres the weak point of the game definately the amount of bugs is just catastrophic i could write a paragraph longer than this review to list all the bugs ive experienced while playing the elder scrolls v skyrim for around 140 hours game breaking bugs where you cannot complete certain quest and hope that you can complete them with the console sometimes you need to restart the entire game from the start if you absolutely need to complete a certain quest your character can fall through the floor monsters fall from the sky randomly playing at higher than 60 fps will cause your game to act weird some areas will just make your game crash upon loading i know that the mod skyrim unofficial patches can be downloaded to fix some of these issues but with the game as is you are going to be annoyed really quickly with the tons of bugs you will encounter during your playthrough of the game as for the overall performance the game runs quite smoothly at 60 fps at least story 92 the story is another very strong point of the elder scrolls v skyrim some questlines in particular will get you so addicted to the game that you will play it through until its done the fact that almost all of your choices affects the outcome and scenario of almost every single quests is just crazy the amount of work put into this aspect of the game is huge you can be a good guy a bad guy or simply do just what you want a certain character annoys you kill him you recovered a powerful artifact that somebody asked you to get for him if you want to keep it you can thats how much you can control your characters fate singleplayer 85 well since the elder scrolls v skyrim only offers singleplayer this is just a resume of my review the game is fun to play by yourself it doesnt get boring at all and its totally worth trying out just keep in mind that bugs and crashes will affect your experience by a large margin unless you mod your game heavily even there you might still experience some annoying bugs with mods but its definately gonna be better multiplayer  this game features no coop or multiplayer playtime 10 the game is known for excelling in this aspect it took me 140 hours just to go through essensial parts of the game to complete all achievements i have only done a few questlines and theres tons and tons of misc quests that i have not started just in 1 playthrough you can spend from 100 to upward of 1000 hours depending on many quests you wanna finish you many things you want to personally accomplish and if you want to craft full sets of gear get to a very high level unlock all magics find all books etc replayability is definately a strong point too you can create a new character to try out a different race look build or just to redo some questlines you might want to approach differently because your choices in some quests will completely affect what happens during and after the quest prices 90 for the amount of content and playtime this game offers us$1999 as of late 2014 is a steal sure the dlcs are quite expansive but if you get the legendary edition for us$3999 you will get much more content and a better price than individual dlcs by far this game is totally worth buying at the listed price steam features 10 its got all the features you would hope for the achievements in this game are super fun to work towards with only a few missable ones that you can easily manage to do if you readup well enough before starting your game its got trading cards and most important steam workshop support as of late 2014 there are over 23000 gameplay mods items quests creatures the list goes on the modding community is extremely active for the elder scrolls v skyrim its also got partial controller support and steam cloud game score 81 information hours details time required to complete the game 30 hours main questline  few misc quests and item farming time required to fully complete the game 1000 hours all quests  collect items  max level in all skills etc time required to get 100% achievements in the game 140 hours 7575 achievements working no particulary hard achievements

this game is mediocre at best but there are people that enjoy it and that is fine and all but the reason im even bothering reviewing this game though is because of the recent show of poor business sense from steam and valve in general the fact that this game was only enjoyable with extensive mods was already a bad sign but now the fact that everyone needs to pay for said mods is not only going to kill this game but put bethesda and valve in a bad light this is also a threat to future or current games in general if other companies decide to follow with this malpractice would you ever pay for a bug fix or a mod that adds more trees or different menu skins the list of fallacies from this new system is lengthy and this whole fiasco is simply ludicrous please do not support this game or any other gamescompanies that try to implement paytoplay mods into the community

skyrim is an all time favorite game of mine so if you havent played it ing buy it buy skyrim however valves decision to implement paid mods is ridiculous ever since gaming was created there have been player made mods always have been free always should be also if you argue that these modders should be paid for their work i would mention that a gaming is a hobby if somebody is struggling financially the last thing they should be doing is being involved in lengthy strenuous mod building and most importantly b developers get to keep 25% of the profit that gets put directly in their steam wallet this decision is hardly helping the developer and it is just a greedy ploy by valve to make some more money down with these paid mods

the whole idea of selling mods in a game is beyond exorbitant especially a single player game like skyrim valve you crossed the line here are some clearly addressed counterarguments for why valve should relinquish this payforyourmods system if a user creates a mod they should make it not for the money but for the whole gaming community andor for experience if money is the issue for the modder then lets face it they shouldnt be modding just for the sake of acquiring money however compensation for work shouldnt be disregarded a donation system should be set up for the modders a paid mod like dlc already establishes a new ground between players who can purchase the mod and players who cant in game type mmorpgs this would be admissible or insert any multiplayer game within the given parameter the mods would travel through some kind of quality control and then valve would sell it however skyrim isnt even an mmorgp its a singleplayer game for gods sake you cant even play this game with other people and a vast quantity of mods in the payment section of the workshop show that there really isnt a quality control so far the aftermath of the implementation of this new system has caused modders in nexus to either 1 take down their work on nexus and sell it here 2 take it down for the sake of preventing people from stealing it shall i go onto nexus or some other modding website and sell it here as my own maybe use someone elses mod as a base for mine and sell it this system really makes it easy to steal other peoples work rebrand it and sell it here for a profit to steal a mod is very disrespectful to the original authors of the mod this prevents new content from great modders being produced and released in fear of it being stolen also anyone who takes part of purchasing misappropriated mods will encourage and be apart of this larceny oh what am i saying valve and bethesda are going to take a 75% cut anyways if you dont think this is a big deal then think about this in the near future this whole system could spread to other games not just skyrim

downvoted only due to the following the practice of paying for mods is antithetical to the nature of the modding community an optional donation button is not just like on the nexus httpwwwnexusmodscomskyrim  was a fun game the fact that valve is doing this and that bethesda is endorsing it and they both taking the largest share of the modders work is american corporate greed at its finest take something artistic and done for the love of the subject matter monetize it then allow the accountants to define art as widgets and then creativity is now run by the mercantile class the middle men who are america corporates if they had any integrity and decency any moneys brought in at the very least should be 100% donated to charities on behalf off the modding community in conjunction with valve or bethesda or whomever see gaben you dont need the cash grab you can win by getting good press which in the long run would do better for you to show you are not like ea et al

reviewing games based on a totally outside aspects eg not about gameplay sound mechanic graphic isnt my hobby or my preference as id prefer to be objective but this one is different skyrim the game that many of us love dearly the game that many of us love to mod is now being plagued by so called paid mods paid mods are fine but the concept and execution are uber poor by valve and bethesda i would list them all but its gonna be a hella long review so ill just list the most important ones 1 copyright issues moneydriven motivation will definitely come into play and its dirty dirty motivation 2 assets stealing it speaks for itself 3 no quality assurance so poor quality paid mods will emerge as i write this 4 bethesda no longer give us patch for skyrim despite so many bugs existing in this latest version with paid mods theyll just reap money and do nothing unacceptable do your job bethesda and do it properly not to mention unfair treatment for modders yes taking royalties for base games existence is fine taking royalties for steams cut is fine but 25% for modders is a downright ripoff i am against this so much at least give the content creators an ability to put up donation links straight to their own pockets and also let pay what you want feature to be exactly what pay you want starting from 000001 usd thats all dont get me wrong base skyrim or legendary skyrim is legendary it has quality of its own but recent move by both parties valve and bethesda leaves me with sour taste thus no more positive recommendation from me for skyrim

the elder scrolls v skyrim has got to be one of the most worked on games of 2011 and 2 years on it still doesnt fail to impress the amazing work put into the game has definitly paid off with hours upon hours of things to do the game works amazing on every platform from ps3 xbox and pc as i have experienced from the console versions the loading screens take quite a long time and there are many glitches that happen every time you play this is 100% different with the pc version as the loading screens are very quick even on the top graphics settings and the glitches are much less frequent pros  amazing graphics  amazing stroyline  a high selection of weapons  amazing character interface  easy to use controls  large amount of side quests cons  a few glitches i would give the elder scrolls v skyrim a well earned 1010

my letter to valve and also bethesda concerning their recent business decisions its amazing to me how two of my favorite developers could move to the opposite end of that list in the course of a day enjoy the read and dont forget to write your own im sure youre getting a lot of these so ill keep it concise and nonabusive i loved steam in fact my account is sitting at about 655 games at the moment i didnt just buy those games because im madly in love with gaming no i bought them on this site because i bought into a vision  a vision of a community passionate about games and social interaction and at the epicenter of that was a company that was one of the good guys a company with an ethical code respect for its customers and a downtoearth leader i loved that company but i dont see that vision anymore all i see is a company that while drowning in money cant seem to have even mediocre customer support or basic quality assurance but i always glossed over those flaws i loved you and stayed loyal despite the increasingly poor customer experience but paid modding is the straw that broke this camels back every single aspect of it wreaks of the kind of shady behavior weve seen elsewhere in the industry im not opposed to modders making a buck but there were so many other ways to do this a donation button reasonably low pricing giving the author more than a mere pittance of 25% or only allowing a small list of very high quality mods to be paid but what youve built now will only result in an influx of poor quality broken copyrightinfringing mess of mods and the death and exploitation of a beautiful and vibrant community of creativity and i wont support it until this is rolled back im not buying another game off of steam if that means i have to go to sources like httpgogcom for my games then so be it but i wont accept what valve has become you need to learn to listen to your customers again

honestly a month ago i would have recomended this game until i woke up and booted up and noticed i had a message to uninstall all of my mods you know mods the things that make games youve beaten playable again with new life well i had some downloaded and i got a notice to uninstall them and procure them via transaction basically i know that was free but now i want money for it so uninstall it and pay me absolutely disgusting as long as a game supports content that has been free for 20 years in games as something locked behind a paywall i cant reccomend it in good faith
not recommended
with the new mod system bethesda is stealing 75% of the profit off content they didnt even make how greedy can you get this isnt even valve that did that its bethesda dont ing support these thieves
not recommended
making people pay for mods that dont even work is bad business i cannot support this game with such an awful business practices valve should be ashamed
not recommended
imagine releasing a broken game and then charging people for mods that make that game playable imagine being bethesda
not recommended
the mod paywall is awful who needs donations when you could have a 75% cut
not recommended
paid mods i dont think so
not recommended
edit keeping it negative to serve as reminder of the day bethesda and valve blackened skyrim modding community no because of bethesda  valve adding one more lair of bullt on gaming community wich is up to its neck because of recent years commercialization in game media this has to stop
not recommended
i can not change my rating i ask all gamers to remember what both valve and bethesda tried to do never forget and watch out for paid mods inevitable reappearence in later bethesda games i will pull this review if the elder scrolls vi and fallout 4 avoid this
not recommended
im very hard to please when it comes to rpgs i loved skyrim id say its a 9510 its got a few minor problems but its an amazingly well done game im pretty sure everyone has heard of this game so i dont need to ramble on forever about it the dlc is ok some of it glitched out on me i love the freedom of mods console cheating to give myself gearstatsperksspellsetc the quest treelines are awesome besides the ocassional glitch the only other complaint i have is the way bethesda prices their dlc on steam sales
recommended
now you too can pay for mods which are more expensive than the game is on sale
not recommended
time to update this review it took 5 years after tes iv oblivion for skyrim to come out the game is now more than 3 years old the story isnt the best but it is not bad either and much fun if you play it for the first time there are also a lot of sidequest you can do which are also really good and much fun but even on the highest difficulty legendary the game isnt that hard at allyou can spend hundreds of hours in the vanilla game and you can spend thousands of hours if you mod the game i play with 200 mods if you dont already have the game buy it if you dont want to spend 15 and more for the dlcs wait for a sale and get it for about 3 should you play this game yeah should you mod this game yeah so this is definitely still one of my favorite games and you wont regret buying it 1010 waiting for enderal and tes vi

best game i ever play with mods made by users its so much fun

game was ruined by paying for mods if i was going to pay for it make the original developer make the modifications im not paying some nobody who ripped off mods from nexus for a mod that has a 95% chance to not work and crash the game anyway im sorry valve but you ed up this time
not recommended
paid mods with the best ones being sold stolen pathetic the mods are more expensive then the game shame on bethesda and steam
not recommended
you know what i used to love this hours and hours of gameplay online and offline mode testing mods playing the crap out of every nook and cranny the internet has to offer to this game hell you dont even need reviews to know this game was good was now with valves practice of paywall for mods instead of encouraging donations that gives 100% profit to the modder instead of 25% im totally not recommending this not especially when premium mods causes incompatibility to other mods and we have to pay again to get the premium version of such mods not especially when workshops items are not compatible with the leading mod managers out there not especially when they claim increased awareness to modders when in truth the whole thing was to monetize the modding scene 75% of the profit goes to steamdevs not recommended not one bit

it used to be a buggy unfinished game that could be modded into a brilliant engrossing game but then it took a paid mods to the knee negative valvethousand10

buy this game then you too can support the monitization and general ing up of the modding scene

while this is one of the most entertaining games in the market and currently makes huge sales even to this very day part of it is due to its ability to be modded and the variety of the mods themselves in its current state while playable and fully functional it pales in comparision with newer tittles part of the reason skyrim sells so well is because of the modding community that constantly creates new content for the game this content atracts a wide variety of customers that while not looking forward to play the game itself buy the game because of the content they can download and play some of these customers do not have a very high income and choose to only buy the game whenever its on sale and can only afford moddifications instead of dlc restricting dlc not only gives the game itself a bad reputation but takes away customers not only because of the low income some might possess but also because some even have their own sense of morale that prevents them from buying unofficial fan made dlc people will download mods less and less as time goes by because of these reasons and demand will eventually halt to a very slow number less people interested in paying less effort from part of the developers why would developers stop making mods eventually simple developers eager to make easy money burn themselves by going agains most of the modding community which has a sense of morale that prevents them from buying mods now that they earn even less recognition from their own community recognition in the modding community itself played a big part in the development of mods  and no one demands mods because of the previously stated reasons combined with the fact that valvebethesda earn 75% of the revenue will eventually get discouraged from creating new mods and will move to greener more profitable pastures getting a job at some developer company or even indie gaming while gaming backslash might not be a big issue for current big profitable developer companies it does indeed hurts small developers who are just starting to make a living this has been proven already with several green light games that have failed to appeal to customers in some way or another and end up branding the developer slowly but surely this marks the beggining of the end for the modding community and maybe modding for certain games altogether drm policies are soon to be expected and we can safely predict that the modding market will be managed in such a way that few mods will be able to remain either free or on sale thus decreasing demand less variety less options for the customer less options fewer interest from part of the customer again part of why this game is played is because of its wide variety of unofficial free fan made dlc by restricting this and allowing content creators to charge as they see fit without any way of quality control and giving them a very low incentive in the way of 25% practically screams commercial failure while not against the idea of letting developers both official and unofficial collect money from fan made dlc it is currently being done in such a way that pretty much will end skyrim modding as we currently see it

game is 4 years old and only now bethesda and valve are trying to milk other peoples work for more money 75% cut rofl

decent game but it relies heavily on player made mods to give it the personalized flavor needed to truly enjoy it so if you like paying valve for things that used to be free and essential to make the game fun then this is a game for you

gee i hope they never do anything dumb like  up the mod system

for the record i loved this game on console and completed it several times as a left hander this game is a no no you simply cant reassign the keys on the numpad as they are reserved there is an addon which allows you to reassign them to movement ones but this shouldnt be necessary there should be no hard coded keys in any game in this day and age also paid mods forget it lazy way of sucking money from the hard working modding community under the guise of giving them something back for their hard work yeah of course thats why they get most of the money isnt it oh wait they dont you do hmm leeches

best game i ever bought in this game youll be sent back to the times where people fought with swords and bows a brilliant setting if you ask me the game lets you do whatever you want you can customize your character to your own style own personal favorite race and youll be able to fight any style you want do you want to play the sneaky elf archer with the bow no problem do you want to play the sneaky kahjiit thief with the daggers no problem do you dislike weapons and love to use magic no problem theres even lots of different spells either destruction or illusion maybe necromancy is more your style being a healer is no problem either you can make your own weapons by smithing you can make your own potions by gathering ingredients and mixing them into a potion with alchemy you can upgrade your weapons by using enchanting theres so much to do want to settle down after some adventures get to a town and drink mead at the inn or purchase a house or a piece of land to build a house with selffound materials or maybe bought materials whatever you want there are so many different playtroughs so much quests to play heck ive played this over 275 hours and i still havent completed all the quests i completely recommend this game i bought it at the releasedate 111111 and im still not done with it did i mention the steam workshop millions of mods to download without any fee enjoy

good game too bad there is now a paywall to enjoy it completely bethedsavalve let the modders have a donate button up and dont take 75% of the cut ing joke

skyrim is a fantastic game but i wouldnt recommend buying it until valve realizes and admits they ed up i used to be a huge fan of valve but their actions in the past year or two make me despise them the only way people can support modders without having a negative impact on the modding community is donating not buying

english review im quoting a passage from my review about a game gothic 3 i love games where weapons are used as swords bows axes maces  the introduction is little bit boring youre listening to a conversation and youre traveling by vehicle to the town where youre supposed to be executed you can do nothing neither skip it but after arrival of the dragon everything changes and the game gains new fallout after killing enemies and escaping from the hell your journey still continues with your fellow fighter where you later say goodbye to each other and you go by your own in general the game is vast it offers many places and localities its not any short game but other way around pretty long game trick for your hero except inventory with weapons to his hands there is also an option of using a magic besides paths and brooks in the game there are various mazes where you have to work with your mind youll have a little trouble with learning new spells or opening locks another special stuff are dragons pretty dangerous creaturesits not very good to start an introduction with them during the selection of race you have a possibility to choose various entities the view in the game will player choose on by himself purchase and sell of goods or weapons is possible in every town a little defect of beauty are walk along mountanious terrain or if you have more load things in inventory you cant run then besides graphics is created on high level what about audio and messages  amazing processing of a game according to northern mythology was wonderful idea spectacular rpg game rating 910 slovak review citujem ryvok zo svojej recenzie na hru gothic 3 milujem hry kde sa vyuvaj zbrane ako mee luky sekery kyje  vod je sce trochu nudn povate rozhovor a veziete sa do mesta na voze kde vs maj popravi proste ni nemete robi ani preskoi to no po prchode draka sa ve men a hra naber nov spd po vyzabjan protivnkov a teku z pekla vaa cesta stle pokrauje s vam spolubojovnkom kde sa potom neskr rozlite a idete na vlastn ps celkovo je hra rozsiahla ponka mnostvo miest a lokalt nejedn sa o iadnu krtku hru skr naopak dos dlh hern vychytvka pre vho hrdinu okrem inventu so zbraami do ruky je tu i monos vyuvania mgie okrem cestiiek a potikov v hre s i rzne bludisk kde si potrpite hlaviku tie si ju potrpite na uen sa novch kzel i otvran zmkov aliou vychtvkou s draci dos nebezpen stvorenia s ktormi si pre vod nerado zana pri vbere rasy mte na vber rzne entity pohad v hre si hr nasta sm kpa a predaj tovaru i zbran je mon v kadom meste o je troku chybikou krsy s prechdzky po hrnatom terne i ak mte viac nkladu veci v inventri tak nemete beha in grafika je vytvoren na vysokej kvalite o sa tka audia a hlok je na vborn spracovanie hry poda severskej mytolgie bol asn npad vekolep rpg hra hodnotenie 910

this game went from having a great dlc policy of selling fully fleshed out content packs to having the worst dlc policy of a huge store of small dlc packs trying to nickel and dime you for every red cent you have like some sort of black market bazaar of cheap knockoffs and broken products for some reason bethesda decided to hand the game over to 3rd party dlc vendors and now its just flooded with crap this game is now the biggest dlcfest on steam i wouldnt recommend this to anyone

bethesda and valve have finally shown their true colors by introducing paid mods they have effectivly split the once whole modding community into several parts in the span of a couple days and for what a few extra pennies i find that bethesda really doesnt know their audience when they alienated half of it by trying to make a quick buck either way my view of the relativly meh game called skyrim has dropped now that the main focus of it has been monetized
not recommended
game is ok but i still wasnt able to really get into it like i remember getting into morrowind we can forget oblivion the visuals are pretty good but the game mechanics are clunky the modding community is obviously a key feature of this game and there are some amazing things out there however you must not buy this game on steam since it would encourage the new practice of paying for mods this goes against the whole modding ethos and is something which should be strongly discouraged do not buy this game here

in response to adding pay for mods copied from reddit user umartel732 it is changing a system that has been working fine modders arent an oppressed class working without benefit modders choose to work on mods for many reasons fun practice boredom the joy of creating something and gamers appreciate their contributions while some gamers may feel entitled most understand that if a modder is unable to continue the mod may be abandoned donations may or may not help but they are an option this system has for years made pc gaming what it is modding in my opinion is the primary benefit of pc gaming over console changing a functional system is dangerous and could have unintended consequences now that people are paying for mods they will feel entitled for these mods to continue working if a free mod breaks and isnt supported that is fine because there is no obligation for it to continue working if someone pays though they will expect the mod to be updated and continue working as the base game is updated furthermore abandoned but popular mods are often revived by other people if these mods are paid then the original creator may not want people to profit off of updated versions of their mod related to the above paid mods may reduce cooperative modding many mods will borrow elements from other mods usually with permission having paid mods will complicate things someone who makes a paid mod will be unlikely to share hisher work with others what if someone freely shares hisher mod and someone incorporates it into a paid mod does the first mods owner deserve compensation does the second modder deserve the full revenue this makes modding more politically complicated and may reduce cooperation this may reduce mods based off of copyrighted works there is a very good chance that any paid mod based off of a copyrighted work will be shutdown modders could still release free mods of this nature but it complicates the issue many mods based on copyrighted materials borrow usually with permission from other mods to add improvements if these other mods are paid then the original creators likely wont let them use it additional many modders may now ignore copyrighted mods in order to make mods that they may profit on steamthe developer are taking an unfairly large portion of the profit steam and the developers are offering nothing new to the situation steam is already hosting the mods and the developer already made the game they now wish to take 75% of all profit from the mod if the market gets flooded by lowquality paid mods the modders will likely make very little and the quality of the game will not be increased however steam and the developers will make money off of no work on there part

game quality has significantly suffered since the introduction of the paid modding system up until that point its been an exceptional game but with so many mod devs with little to no quality control my faith in bethesda has significantly suffered

this paid mods thing is a disgraceful attempt to wring more profits from the community if you guys wanted to actually make functional expansion packs with qa support and a decent amount of content you go for it hire modders as employees take responsibility for any technical screw ups and have a blast but selling unsupported unevaluated mod content no just no

i played this game for about a month when i first got it then i stopped for a while after wining it then steam released the steamworkshop for this game and i downloaded a ton of mods that kept me playing on and off for over 3 years never in those 3 years would i have considered not recommending this game until a few days ago when valve and bethesda decided to jump in bed together and announced paid mods this opened the floodgates to a host of egregious behavior including using assets from free mods from steamworkshop and other sites nexusmods and using them in paid mods in the steamworkshop a fishing paid mod that used idle animations from fores idle animations free mod low quality paid mods  $5 for 250000 septims which you can get by just running a console command  ethical concerns steam gets 30% of every mod sold and bethesda gets a whopping 45% leaving only 25% for the modder that heshe can only redeem if heshe generates a certain amount of money from sales moral ramifications a valve lawyer actually said that it doesnt matter if your free or paid mod depends on other free or paid mods and even legal ramifications people making money using assets from free mods in their paid mods or even assets from paid mods in their free mods theres nothing more to say about this and anyone who cares for the modders and says that they deserve money are really proving that valve only cares 25% for modders 45% for bethesda and 100% for themselves by allowing all of this to happen amid a torrent of hateful backlash and other logical alternative from the community a donate button is too much since valve wont get any money from that

like practically all bethesda games the elder scrolls v skyrim usually is a rather bland experience unless you pack a plethora of mods onto it that fix potentially gamebreaking bugs add new mechanics or bring back those whom bethesda couldnt be arsed to continue import custom art assets sounds music or create entirely new experiences with new quests or sometimes even entire continents it is no secret that the fantastic success of tes games from morrowind onward came and comes from its vibrant modding community for almost ten years by now modders have transformed their enthusiasm for tes games into usually wellcrafted mods that greatly enhanced the experience of the base game and these mods were free  they were a community thing something which people produced because they liked the game but thought they could make it just a tad better by adding this or tweaking that and again they usually were right with that then some particularly bright heads over at valve and zenimax added the option to demand a price for fan mods even if you overlook the fact that the modder only gets 25% of the revenue his or her mods generate this change will mean that many mods will no longer be created because the modder liked the game but because she is in for a quick buck what does that mean 1 essential tech mods that are required to run other free mods may go commercial skyui an interface mod many free mods rely on has already removed its own free version breaking hundreds of other mods 2 the same holds true for bugfix mods want to play the game without bugs better pay twice once for the game itself and once to get it to run without problems 3 art assets from free mods will be stolen and used in commercial mods most likely without the consent of the original author valve can not possible hope to effectively regulate this and even the original creators can not sift through dozens of different mods to see whether they are using assets created by them 4 developers may start to intentionally leave interesting mechanics out of the game knowng the modding community will add them sooner or later  and that they can use this to cash in on the players twice and thats just some of the problems paid mods will bring about as far as valve or zenimax do not remove the option to create paid mods for this game i can not and will not recommend buying it tes games rise and fall with the modding community and the powers are trying to cash in on it
not recommended
i have sunk quite the fantastic amount of time in this game most of it outside the realms of what steam can log i have in fact beaten it and since then played around with hundreds of different mods the base game fits the analogy of a lake of  quite well a vast world full of mostly nothing featuring what feel like dated graphics and a fighting system that varies from broken sneaky archery bonus stacks completely broken pathfinding my favorite to very broken killing the final boss with 4 shots and giants ignoring physics sure all in all once the game was layed out before me it was plain to see that it had many many flaws and not a huge lot going for it but then i found the modding scene and by thor all mighty it was glorious ranging from the essential to the nonsensical passing by the immoral and the insane it was quite simply a whole different level graphical mods that made the triple a market blush gameplay mods that created actual ing battles and not glorified pub brawls as well as expanded all systems far beyond their initial capabilities entire new quest lines complete with voice acting and new items  resources  the game simply had no limit it was so insanely good that i actually dabbled in mod creation successfully accomplishing a few scripts of my own even with no initial knowledge on the matter and now bethesda and steam have the gal of showing up and trying to monetize mods mind you i am not against the concept of monetizing mods  however the way steam and bethesda are going about it is borderline criminal firstly they take most of the profits leaving the modder with only 25% of the revenue since these are profits and not donations the modder should be legally obligated to declare this source of revenue lest she may incur a fine which means an additional 24% depending on the modders country will be taken away by taxes that means that a modder will make about 18 cents off of each dollar they sell thats insanely low secondly not all mods should be monetized this is a simple fact you cant sell a script that sells a fixed amount of ingame gold you cant sell a script that adds genitalia to horses you cant sell a script that retextures a few pixels worth of an items model can you trust that steam will moderate this of course not steam cant even moderate the quality of the games it sells lets not even start pretending that itll moderate the quality of the mods to any extent beyond what theyre legally bound to thirdly mod monetization should be based on donations or postfacto experiences how do i know your mod works the way you say it does on the latest patch of skyrim and isnt incompatible with the other mods im running and doesnt render the game unplayble because my laptop is a glorified potato i dont fact is when buying mods theres no way of telling whether youre buying a complete piece of garbage that is lying to you or if youre buying an amazing epic adventure that lasts 8 hours and is completely fresh and worth the money i could keep going but its not hard to see all the innumerable flaws with this system ultimately this will just create complete and utter chaos in the modding scene as vague rule sets allow people to use other peoples mods as a base for their own and as people try to steal other peoples works to put it up for sale on the workshop and since this has had a huge negative impact on the game the community and ultimately drastically reduced the amount of available mods by way of either putting up a paywall or having legitimate concerns from the authors on the nexus website that cause them to remove their works so theyre not posted on steam to be put up for sale i am left with judging the base game as it is with no additional content and that game is a bit  so i guess that sums it up

it may seem odd to review a game i have not finished so take that into account as you read this i first played the elder scrolls series with morrowind back then i thought it was the coolest thing ever huge world tons of monsters and weapons at the time though i was big into mmos so i felt very disconnected from the game alone so my time with the game was short and i never finished the main campaign when oblivion came out i gave it a try and instantly was reminded of morrowind and why i lost interest in the game so i probably played it for only a few hours my first time in elder scrolls games are a fickle thing though you see screenshots hear about other people having fun see mod updates and before you know it boom right back in you go and you forget why you ever left my right back in was skyrim so much hype so much graphical goodness i resisted for a long time then came a steam sale and i was in the game wow so much better is it the dragons hell yes it is the dragons i have about 50 hours on record as i type this and i go off and on playing the game so as not to get burned out on it i modded it up as best i could and i think it makes it that much better graphics  just amazing even unmodded this game looks stunning character models less so than the world itself but still a great show for the eyes sound  im no audiophile but i tend to get drawn in more if the sound is good this game does not disappoint music voice acting sound effects all perfect the first time i fought a dragon and it came swooping in and bathed the ground around me in fire i was amazed at how awesome it sounded surround sound headset of course do yourself a favor and really crank the volume again i am not finished the game will i ever who knows and who cares i am having fun so that is all that matters if you are holding off for similar reasons that i was wait for a sale like i did but dont deny yourself the experience if you can it is totally worth it

this is the game the never ever ends i picked this game up thinking i wouldnt like it having never played a previous tes game before sat in my library untouched for about a month or two and finally took the plunge i was wrong i was so very very wrong this is probably the best purchase ive ever made on steam add in the unlimited potential of modding and its an adventure that continues forever ive probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character and still only have beaten alduin once once theres still so much more do to and explore that im still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things i still cant believe how much there is to do and im still finding more at it stands ill probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as skyrim with how much ive played and im totally ok with that

i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun one of skyrims major cities when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot an orcish mace in the other they were on display for nobody but me and my computercontrolled housecarl lydia who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls dragons a civil war and job assignments that never seem to go as planned its even a sensible thing to do a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim one of the most fullyrealized easily enjoyable and utterly engrossing roleplaying games ever made part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated in skyrim theres no more moonhopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill thats gone so is athletics the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major you dont assign major and minor skills at all but instead pick one of ten races each with a specific bonus high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective closerange combat these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic sneaking and weapon combat emphasizing firsthand experience over instruction manual study letting you specialize only when youre ready it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim do a quest kill a dragon snatch torchbugs from the air munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within little feels random and useless even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities making every step you take even if its through what seems like total wilderness an exciting one as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame momentarily all on the battlefield unite directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature creating impromptu moments of camaraderie  a surprising change from what may have been yet another bythenumbers bandit camp sweep dragons show up often their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles stops to attack circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv can be completed in a few minutes and always offer a useful reward killing a dragon yields a soul which powers skyrims new shout system these are magical abilities any character can use you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time throw your voice change the weather call in allies blast out ice and fire or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force even if you favor sword shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story joined with the thieves guild fought alongside the dark brotherhood or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim not only is this land under assault by dragons long thought to be dead its also ripped in two by civil war you can choose one side or the other but so much of the allure of skyrim is how even outside of the confines of quest lines the embattled state of the world is evident and steeped in a rich fictional legacy lord of the rings this is not but with the release of every elder scrolls game the fiction becomes denser and the crossreferencing for longtime fans all the more rewarding skyrims residents are all aware of current events theyll comment on the civil war some sympathizing with the rebels others thinking the establishment sold its soul the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor many characters feel like whole distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans characters stereotype based on race they doublecross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable and they react to your evolving stature within the world it makes a ridiculous realm filled with computercontrolled cat people and humanoid reptiles demon gods and dragons feel authentic like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave

pros they revamped their combat system very well and it ended up being fairly satisfying half way decent main questline too but not on oblivions level cons vanilla skyrim pales in comparison to oblivion guild questlines in skyrim were so short and boring i really had questioned whether i missed something was deeply let down it is the modding scene that would make amends for skyrim yet this is now a con because of what bethesda has attempted to do with valve regarding mods a simple donation system would have been appropriate however i do not see this current system they are attempting to implement as a proper means to an end this comes off as a lazy way for bethesda and valve to line their pockets rather than the actual mod creators i think this system will end up damaging pc gaming more than helping it so i cannot approve of it i do not approve of vanilla skyrim for anything over $10 ordinarily id recommend it for the mods however but again not anymore
not recommended
charging for mods is despicable both valve and bethesda should be ashamed comewhatever may i will not support you guys in future games even if it is half life 3 or the next tes or even fallout

valve has made history by finally attempting to destroy the single thing that has made pc gaming so great mods mods have always been for only one thing the player ever since pc gamings existence it was never for lining the greedy pockets of valve bethesda or the mod creator donations have always been accepted by mod creators but valve is purposely deleting donation links from mod pages now do not purchase this game if you have a single shred of integrity within your soul you know you have done something wrong when forbes magazine of all places says what you are doing is unethical forbes magazine link httpwwwforbescomsitesinsertcoin20150424valvespaidskyrimmodsarealegalethicalandcreativedisaster  to add a cherry on top of this  sundae valve generously allows you to get a refund  but the refund only goes to your steam wallet which means the money no matter what stays with valve you can not get it back do not buy this game until valve stops this disgusting trend

this game is a triumph of immersion storytelling gameplay and craftmanship just an exceptional example of a world made to feel real with nooks and crannies aplenty to explore and discover i have an insanely short attention span so putting in ten hours into a game is for me rather rare i have about eighty in skyrim and i feel like im just getting started

introducing new ways to suport workshop creators what they really ment introducing new ways to steal workshop creators with no respect valve by far this is the biggest error you made a mod is not a mod if its not free i think you cant imagine how much people bought skyrim on pc only for the mods like me  and hate you for this  like me it will never be the same i really hate you now stupid valve now there is this little thing that is starting to scare me another bull st fact about this is that theyll probably make people used to pay for mods i mean now all games are going to put their mods for money because skyrim also did it and people with money as in any case theyll pay like please dont do like ea be legit specially you valve that everyone respects you and buy your games by the way a great example of getting people used to something is the hole game industry hey dude get used to have to pay like 60 dollars for everything and games having their lack of content repaired by dlcs the problem is why putting my mod on nexus if may be paid in steam i dont blame moders it is better for them and its really hard work sometimes but if this keeps up in some years free mods would turn out to be special just like gaming companies that still care for costumers and the art of making a good game that really worth its prise if anyone would want to help then give the option to donate and they will ill tell you whats the worst if you would really want to help mod creators you would give them all the money and be legit but of curse why giving them their money if we can be a son of a bch and keep with most of it and only giving them 25% of the money

modders have always worked on donationbased model and that model has become more and more successful for them throughout the years prompting some of the most amazing thirdparty work ever seen in video games commercializing mods through steam will absolutely destroy the special relationship that modders and the community enjoy skyrim is a fantastic game and part of what makes it so good is the culture of user modification that has grown around it i believe as do many others that creating this paywall is the fastest way to destroy this culture please dont  our game valve youre developers and you work for money so i understand where youre coming from but that guy in his wallstreet suit who strutted into your conference room and told you this was a good idea he was wrong and you know it take a stand or we the end users of your products will

despite what my steam account says ive racked days into this game on one console or another and its a fantastic game which four years in you all know that yet with these new pay for mods the game has become a harbinger of a new and terrible trend of monetising everything that can be honestly we would have expected something like this from a big publish but valve if this is contiues then sooner or later somethings going to give in this industry and itll collpase upon itself i hate that i have to give this great game a thumbs down

paid mods  no

the game was fantastic with mods unfortunately valve and bethesda decided that you should now pay for the things that fix the game bethesda you released a broken terribly consolized game and youre now expecting people to pay for the mods that fix it and not only that but the creators you know the ones thatre actually doing the work only see 25% of the profit while valve and bethesda split the other 75% so not only are you screwing the consumer youre also screwing the modding backbone bethesda and valve have singlehandedly destroyed the potential lifespan of this game and i absolutely recommend that you do not buy this

i really feel bad about saying this but for 4 years ive been waiting to finally get this game on pc for the mods because i already owned the game on console but i was very disappointed in what i went through i installed a mod and the launcher crashed okay so i got rid of it and installed a simple music mod it crashed the launcher i looked online and saw that this was a problem since 2012 specifically with the steam workshop i read that there is a fix but from an outside source i am going to get that and play skyrim the way i want the way steam had failed me this negative review is more towards steam messing up then skyrim the game itself was amazing and ran really smooth on my not so great laptop im just upset that in order to use a feature that valvesteam advertise they actually charge for some mods now i have to find an outside source in order to experience created content
not recommended
paying for mods is okay but only giving 25% to the creators is ridiculous i cant believe steam thought they could get away with this what an insult
not recommended
because of your pathetic 75% shares valve keeps and giving modders a measly 25% not to mention they cant get their paycheck if they cant reach $100 some of them are forcing themselves to set up rediculous prices that doesnt reflect the content theyve created and some are installing ads to buy mods when you bought a mod for this skyrim is not a recommendable game unless the shares are dropped lower than 75% unless this practice is adjusted to a fairer price say goodbye to your sales

i would have given this game a good rating a few years ago but now that ive played it way too much im going to give this game a review lets start with the pros better combat mechanics than its predecessors better graphics than its predecessors dragons slightly improved perk system i think this is headed in the right direction but could use some fine tuning the previous games have a version of this that is automatic when you leveled up a skill thats it when comparing it to the previous games it only has 3 things that it does better 3 now lets look at the cons lack of attributes strength intelligence speed to give depth to character progression now you simply pick between health stamina and magicka want a character that jumps high and runs fast to avoid being hit because you wanted to spend more points improving your damage rather than your health too bad thats been removed this time around lack of quest depth to keep the game interesting the majority of the side quests in this game consist of you going into an ancient nord ruin killing draugr and looting an item from a chest to give to some npc with a half story as to why the item got there in the first place lol i was in some ruin and got scared so i dropped my sword and ran the draugrfalmer were nice enough to put it in a chest for when i decided to come back and get it the quest lines for the guilds are decent but they suffer from the same syndrome as the above points a lack of depth to keep them interesting it mostly consists of you doing more cookie cutter quests like the ones above but with an annoying follower who stands in front of you everytime you swing your sword this series is suffering from what i like to call casualization i know lots of people would disagree and say that im some nerd who needs to get a life but this game had such an amazing foundation to build upon the combat was so much better in this game than the previous ones all it needed was some attention to detail to add depth and really bring out the potential in this game but because bethesda thinks that the larger audience wouldnt enjoy a game with high quality character development we are left with what feels like a half finished product that couldnt decide whether it wanted to be an rpg or an action game i would have said even a few days ago that modding this game is what gives it life and that alone would have given it a positive review but valvle and bethesdas continued desire to nickel and dime the customer has led them to release paid mods a practice that gives only a small fraction of the money to the actual modder and gives it to those who did absolutely no work all for the sake of pure greed allinall i would say play one of the earlier games in the series like morrowind or oblivion as they are much better games with better character progression and better quests

i never wrote a review back in 2011 when i initially played skyrim because honestly i couldnt be bothered to it didnt live up to the hype mods obviously helped a bit on that being able to download various graphical or gameplay mods to improve your experience trying out this and that well not anymore with steam allowing anybody to put up a mod be it stolen or original and charge whatever pricetag the modder chooses without having a responsibility of quality control or support and good luck contacting valve about a refund theyll give you a thoughtout copy pasted response in a month or two you did good for a while there valve we understand you are a business and businesses exist to make money but not like this edit valve and bethesda have chosen to backpedal on paid mods which is fantastic but remember businesses exist to make money just because they couldnt make it work this time doesnt mean they wont try again ill leave my review unchanged as a reminder to what happened these last few days

so it seems that valve and bethesda have gotten rid of the paid mods good but there is still the fact that they did this to us in the first place they should have at least asked us first and most of us would have said the obvious choice a donate button it would have been smarter all together its so sad as well since the damage has been done some mod makers will never come back for being bashed like they did also the fact that half the mods charged 99$ just for making lydia 2% stronger was stupid as well hopefully this is where this paid mods crap ends for these gamesalthough i only think this is just the beginningi hope valvebethesda got what they wanted

when i bought this game it was because id heard great things about the modding community for the elder scrolls series for years one of the best things about skyrim was that there was effectively a mod for anything you could want you could mold the game world to your tastes now you have to pay for mods everything is effectively dlc at this point and youre paying rather exorbitant prices for a lot of unfinished unpolished work bethesda and valve have killed the game in pursuit of the almighty dollar dark times are upon us indeed if you are just now looking at picking up the game pass it is a hollow shell of what it once was
not recommended
this game was amazing until the paid mods attacked

an awesome game made even more awesome by steam workshop now however bethesda in cahoots with steam wants to monetize these mods its not so much about the creators earning a living as bethesda and valve seeing dollar signs in the hoped for thousands and thousands of transactions shame on you bethesda especially since the pc community is responsible for making your elder scrolls series the success that they are no disrespect meant toward console owners
not recommended
ive seen alot of crappy descisions come from bethesda lately but this about tops them off this game is a fully realised edition of the edler scrolls series full of 100s of hours of gameplay and excellent voice work amd music after many people complained about the bad quality textures on the pc version they released a hd texture pack which helped enhance the game but the game has many flaws and many mistakes made in the games production but over the years teams of modders have come together to enhance skyrim and make it an outstanding game unfortunately bethesda and valve have added a new feature which allows modders to sell thier mods on the skyrim workshop which is against the copywrite agreement which everyone has to agree to when they install the game and there is no quality assurance over the mods that are mometised or the lagality of the ownership of the mod which is being sold on top of that valve also want 75% of the income for a mod which they had no input into making so while the game can be a fun experience once mods and fixes have been installed it fails to provide much entertainent without them

paid mods are wrong just adding my vote what makes this stealing worse is that they have the audacity to dress it up like its some sort of ethical stance ive never posted a review before despite first having a steam account when i needed it to get the newly released half life 2 that came free with my graphics card yes i am that old however this has compelled me to join the chorus of people complaining this is basiclly in line with prostitutuion  its charging for something that should be free

independent contractors for bethesda called paid modders have enabled the consumer to be able to pay money for additional features such as horse armor swords and other new skins due to an extremelyhigh demand from the community these paid modders have gone out of their way to offer us a service which is quite convenient for the everyday gamer who has too fat of a wallet now you can pay your easilyearned money in order to acquire things like weather and betterlooking water so convenient 1010 would review modding again

skyrim is a game like no other and it is easily has one the best game communities out there however with the recent addition of paid mods to the steam workshop i advise everyone to stay away from offering that business while the hard work put into mods is astounding at times by paying for any such mod you are voting with your wallet please do not give in to the underdeveloped dlc scheme going on in the steam workshop right now also google nexusmods

if you want to pay for your game over and over again  skyrim is the right game for you first you buy the game then dlc after dlc and when you finally got all dlcs which could be for free like in other games but not so in skyrim you can equip your credit card to buy mods someone might think hey its a lot of work to create a high quality mod its okay the creator asks for some payment and you might be right with this argument but you dont pay the creator at least not primarily since 75% will never receive the creator even not before tax at the very end you might have the game how it should have been supposed to be in the first place  but you paid it 10 times or even more often regardless this fact you will love the game at least when you loved the games of that series before but your love will always be a bit i dont know lets say its like the game is your better half but cheated on you in the past there are no reasons to think they might do it again but there is always this bad feeling and it might remain forever skyrim didnt cheat on me but i also have this bad feeling the game crashes for me incredibly often especially while quicksaving at least the save is successfull but it is annoying it is also annoying that the game cant handle it if you switch applications for a short moment unfortunately the osd of changing my computers volume is already too much and you will have problems until you restart the game like two mouse cursors such a thing was okay for me when multitasking was introduced with windows95  but to find this behaviour in an actual title surprised me in the same way as it disappointed me among those technical stuff i also was surprised about how small the game experience was dont get me wrong this game is huge and you will need a lot of time but compared to the other titles of the elder scrolls you might be surprised how quickly you will have done it even though after the first 20% of the game there wont be any real new elements maybe compare it with a mother who cares for her child how she does everything for the child thinks about every possible detail to give her child a great life skyrim would be in this example an orphan with a step mother one of that kind who never forgets that it isnt her child but a good human being enough to care for the child that it is at least healthy and doesnt starve too much i recommend everyone dont buy it not even in sale if you are in love with that series try to play it from a friend like i did  i just used my save games on a play for freeweekend for the achievments who has it if you are not in elder scrolls up so far then better have a look in risen or something else they might not be perfect too but they do a lot better and try harder in many of those aspects

donation should definitely be an option when it comes to mods but locking them behind a paywall no this isnt dlc and has too high a potential for exploitation by people looking to make a quick buck just to clarify the game is great but the monetization of mods is not for a game so reliant on mods this is unacceptable

i will never support paid mods especially if 75% of the profits go to valve and not the actual developer of the mod

the game itself is fine but paid mods are a major setback prohbitively so for all but those with the unfortunate combination of no sense and infinte wealth mods were something the community shared with eachother now everyone is just a shill for their new superspecial dlc hopefully modders will recognize the community aspect of their modding is important and will continue to offer mods for free

a game that used to be an amazing sandbox constantly kept fresh and interesting thanks to the incredible work of the modding scene has now been transformed into a disgusting cashcow and moneygrabber by bethesda and steam thank to them we now have skin packs that cost more than the game itself and are of a much lower value and quality than dozen others free mods what will happen when some of those expensive mods conflict between each others or are not supported anymore if they ever were by their creators keep in mind also that the whole argument of supporting modders is completely fallacious considering that they only receive a small minority of the profits made from those mods the lions share going without a surprise to bethesda and steam we criticized heavily bethesda for the horse armour in oblivion but this change goes beyond any of the worse nightmare we could have had

paid mods what a scummy move that has horrible consequences for gaming as a whole ive been sick of bethesda for a while with their glitchy outdated games that required mods to actually function and now theyre punishing us for their poor work by putting those fixes behind a paywall i play plenty of rpgs but this will no longer be one of them

games alright but this modding fiasco has destroyed a large chunk of what made this game great modders didnt expect to get paid when they first made these mods so why do they do now if they wanted money they would have originally asked for donations were they first created it this is greed valve takes most of the money anyway so the idea of supporting the modder is pretty much made redundant

ive played this game on my ps earlier thought id give it a try on my pc since it was free anyways i dont think the experience would be different from my ps since there is no way in hell i am paying valve for the hard work done by modders i am a programmer myself and i know the kind of effort that goes into these things i wont blame the modders because i assume most of them are in school and the idea of charging actual money for something that they do for fun is just too tempting to let go but you valve taking advantage of that is just pathetic if you really were doing it to help modders would have at least made the deal better for them your cut in this is ridiculous you make me sick in my stomach

i very rarely review games most people can say what i want to say but better however it breaks my heart to give such a wonderful game a negative review i have loved every hour ingame but as soon as users started improving an already great game i felt i had found a game to stick with for years and i always enjoyed checking the latest mod offerings since the game first came out now i shall be uninstalling even with all the actual dlcs i payed for as a simple insignificant gesture to steam you have enough money gabe why destroy the undeniably great steam community for a few more $$$s please have a heart and keep pc gaming king  edit 28042015 0010 thank you steam for at least admiting this idea of yours still needs work i fully and totally agree mod creators should recieve compensation for their incredible efforts however the starting prices were well unreal and if you are doing it for the modders think about what cut they get for all their work multinational companies are getting 1015% charge to have their games hosted on steam why so high for the individual creators great idea in theory please work on the details some a lot more so more people make more awesome mods and all get fairly compensated after all is said and done

when i bought this game it was because id heard great things about the modding community for the elder scrolls series for years one of the best things about skyrim was that there was effectively a mod for anything you could want you could mold the game world to your tastes now you have to pay for mods everything is effectively dlc at this point and youre paying rather exorbitant prices for a lot of unfinished unpolished work bethesda and valve have killed the game in pursuit of the almighty dollar dark times are upon us indeed if you are just now looking at picking up the game pass it is a hollow shell of what it once was

how could valve and bethesda not understand that the best way to go about supporting modders would be to at most allow the modder to add an optional donation button to their workshop contribution which would always remain available to all for free also at the very least the modder should receive 50% of the donation received without all the free mods skyrim would never been as successful as it had been before the paid mod disaster never forget update our belief is we made the game we made the game youre making a thing for so just like anything else there is some kind of involvement that were going to have in that  bethesdas pete hines [wwwgamespotcom]

having played 90 hours of skyrim this past week i figured that i should write a review on it first of all i had to said this is an amazing sandbox rpg experience i am someone who enjoyed doing side quests as well as misc quests as a mean to earn more money i got to say that till now i had not finish the story as there are so much more to do i was pleasantly surprised initially when i see people with over 20004000 hours of gameplay time all i can say is skyrim had just that much content especially if you include all the dlcs i mean just building a single house took me more than 2 hours not to mention the fact that i had to design and decorate my own house it pretty much a chore that feel great after you are done with it i am also barely done exploring skyrim after 90 hours in the combat are extremely fluid and animated especially when you do a sneak attack there are many other great elements in skyrim such as picklocking which can be extremely frustrating but fun to play around with i had never been this impressed with a rpg before and i definitely think skyrim is by far the best i had played so far for this price i definitely recommend this game to every rpg lovers you wont ever regret it especially if you enjoyed other rpg such as the witcher as well as fable

i used to be a bethesda dev working on skyrim i tried to make sleeping a meaningful mechanic as player recover as they sleep i also designed cool dream themed menus with deep proverbs while opposing factions may try to assassinate you while you sleep in lategame i geniunely believed this would be very immersive a neat break from the flow for players to think and plan their character todd howard however was not as pleased he calls me out during a meeting belittles me in front of our coworkers and calls me dreamboy the whole company now makes fun out of me and calls me dreamboy i got demoted but i kept working i thought about how to make the passing of ingame time more meaningful the dragon apocalypse happens on day 50 and the aldmeri dominion invades on day 100 this would immerse the player in a sense of heroism and danger when i go to the toilet after finishing these changes todd finds me and repeatedly punches me in the liver and solar plexus while calling my son an autistic rtard i got demoted to janitors closet now i still tried to make the best of it and kept working hard i made it so that npcs from the opposing faction are hostile and you have to sneak or disguise yourself if you want to do business in solitude as a stormcloak for example to me this would make the game intense and real i come home later that day and found my wife crying in the living room and when i asked whats wrong she said that a man approached our son at school and asked him if its hard to be a rtard with a fg dad although i should have stopped at this point i felt like it was still my duty to make this game as good as possible i wanted to include an optional hardcore mode like in new vegas  i believed this would immerse players as it would make food and taverns meaningful later that night when i took out the trash someone throws a bag over my head i hear people laughing and making fun out of me as someone is stomping on me then suddenly after taking kicks and punches for a long time someone pulls the bag off me i felt a wet finger pressing against my anal i hear todds voice saying is that hardcore enough for you dreamboy

the elder scrolls v skyrim one of the most indepth games you will ever encounter many quests and stories to tell you can instantly conjecture when you are born into the world of skyrim in the beginning of the game you emerge as a captive member held by the imperial army captive from trying to cross the border of skyrim sitting in the carriage with your fellow captive thieves and bandits questioning where you are flowing as youre held captive by the solders in the carriage being carried over the roads to helgan as youre being kicked off the carriage held in your queues to your beheading you notice your foes worried about a large scream across the lands of skyrim as you place your head on the pedestal ready for your penalty the scream becomes stronger all of the sudden a dragon appears landing upon the castle to your left he speaks in his dragon tongue and destroys helgan this is your time to escape and begin your journey in the world of skyrim who knows what this frozen land has in store for you the elder scrolls v skyrim is a action roleplaying game allowing you to create and customise your character join a race and choose how your character handles in dangerous encounters there is a range of possibilities to roleplay in the world of skyrim the game is playable in a first person perspective or in a third person perspective both can be toggled easily by using the scroll wheel the game encourages you to freely roam the environment finding dungeons towns abstract structures and a range of sidequests to find while following the main quest this allows the player to freely choose which quests the player can freely choose to conquest the atmosphere the world of skyrim creates is outstanding viewing this frozen nation in its misfortune is interesting and viewing the world revovle around you as you progress throughout of the story you get view different cultures and view how people live in various cities as you progress through the story you can fully view how people and what people are willing to do to survive the events and the catastrophe of the lands of skyrim viewing the scenery at its best adds to the atmosphere looking out into the distance and spotting the large mountains standing tall and superior with a hint of snow on the peak ruins standing capable of anything do you dare to enter then looking down the plains of land grass blowing in the wind the scenery an essential characteristic to the world of skyrim graphically the game is outstanding this statement is considered even without graphical modifications the game has high resolution textures this being the ultra graphical setting but if youre feeling curious you can get even better textures with the free downloadable content that bethesda game studios offer adding onto the graphical discussion on the elder scrolls v skyrim is something i mentioned earlier the scenery the scenery is just breathtaking if these visuals arent enough for you the graphical modifications created by the community are phenomenal i couldnt recommend more that you browse through some videos on youtube of them but on the negative side some are very intensive to your computer unlike the default textures talking about the performance of the elder scrolls v skyrim the game is polished and the performance is outstanding this is a enormous statement but the game could almost run perfectly well on any pc ive know many people who have ran the elder scrolls v skyrim on a laptop without messing with any graphical settings running smoothly of course this truly shows the effort in the development cycle that bethesda game studios has put into the game on the unfortunate side of this i wish that the game was supported for multiple operating systems but alternatives can be found to still play the game on different operating systems content the department that the elder scrolls v skyrim does not disappoint approximately the game has around 300  hours of content this isnt including modifications if you feel that this isnt enough you have modifications to add extra quests and various other content the elder scrolls community is talented for creating these outstanding modifications now finally to the conclusion to the elder scrolls v skyrim this game is well worth every single penny the amount of effort that the developers have established into this game to you the reader i recommend you buy this game take your time while playing the game to look at the detail this game contains because this game deserves the title along the side of the elder scrolls games

hate to give you a thumbs down skyrim but not only are you allowing amature modders to get paid for doing nothing youre only giving any real developers 25% your end of the deal is a huge problem bethesda valve people notice when you treat people wrong especially the more important than you modding community the sole reason i have more than 5 hours on record is thanks to them the sole reason i enjoyed playing this game was them 25% for something that 100% their work i understand you want a cut for it is your game world but the only reason i bought legendary edition was because it was required for the mods i wanted to use think about the fact that modders sold me this game not you not your cheesy videos not the hype train the very people you are trying to rip off on top of not even giving people the ability to just donate to a modder that has a free mod its either paywall your content or no donations all of this and its through the workshop literally the worst way to mod skyrim

skyrim was a great game and represented to many why pcs were the ultimate gaming platform now valve and bethesda look to exploit players and modders by taking a vibrant thriving modding community that offered hours and hours of free gameplay that was run purely for the love of the game and turn it just another dlc money grab except in this case this isnt even dlc theyve created yet they still take a whopping 75% of the money and give only 25% to the modder who actually created the mod whats sickening is gabe newell himself has tried to convince us that this is somehow good for the mod community and benefits us skyrim has become the unfortunate vehicle to usher in this new era for modding with many modders already putting up paywalls and having popups occur in game to encourage you to buy the full version of a mod of all the companies to pull this stunt i never would have expected valvebethesda both of whom owe a great deal to the modding communities support of their games to be the ones to corrupt it like this

this is my third review of this game the second was prompted by the atrocity of locking mods behind a paywall but as valve and bethesda realized the error of their ways i will upload a new positive review core skyrim released 111111 was a tremendous addition to the storied elder scrolls franchise that i had enjoyed since daggerfall which is still installed on my system and which i still play from time to time the dlcs were soso hearthfire being my favorite of the three but the mods and the modding community were what made this the premeir experience in pc gaming i play skyrim using 3d glasses and headphones and with the amazing mods like frostfall wet and cold immersive hud realistic needs and diseases and hunterborn it felt as if i was really there in skyrim with my role playing and deadisdead playstyle it was truly a magical experience fulfilling the promise of video games that was only hinted at when i saw dragons lair in the arcade as a child this game was worth it at full price and today is a must own when you can snag it on sale for 15 bucks or less i have subscribed to nexus in the past for mods and will do so again usually when i plan on playing skyrim heavily for a month or more i will now start to support modders ranging from a few cents to a few dollars depending on the amount i use it and the quality what valve bethesda and nexus need to do is sit down and really hammer out a user friendly donation system i want to be able to donate directly from my steam wallet or a nexus wallet with a minimal number of clicks as it stands it is a hassle to throw a few pennies at a mod and when i am trying to relax after a harrowing day at work i dont want to fill out a bunch of forms if valve bethesda and nexus need to take a tiny slice 5% max of that donation to offset the cost of that system i am ok with that finally three and a half years into its lifespan bethesda is prepping to announce fallout 4 and we are going to start the long march to elder scrolls 6 what should the future hold bethesda needs to think big the elder scrolls online was a failure not because of what it was but because of what it wasnt people want a coop skyrim experience not an mmo even now bethesda could and should realease a no more than 10$ coop dlc for skyrim or at least get the zenimax lawyers to stop embargoing modders who have gotten to the prototype stage of development imagine traversing the vast lands and seas of all of tamriel as the inevitable war between mankind and the thalmor erupts across the continent and perhaps the entire world of nirn and beyond this is where bethesda needs to get the modding scene right bring those who want to do this for a living and parcel out sections of nirn to them so they can build it to completion as formal supported and integrated dlc imagine a seemless world where you and you good friends can campaign in full virtual reality we should work to rebuild the community and to fulfill the promise hinted at by skyrim  thank you

i have hundreds of hours logged onto skyrim on my xbox 360 and while i enjoy the game there are many glaring flaws 1 repetitive dialogue this game shows that voice acting is still a luxury as everybody says the same stuff over and over and it makes me want to pull a van gogh the fact that this is supposed to be a feature doesnt help i dont expect unique dialogue for every minute i play the game but having every guard and npc in skyrim say the same things is terrible 2 poor textures if you dont pay attention to it fine but once you really look at that rock or weapon you realize that this games textures is as poorly done as a whole lots of clipping lots of washed out crap lots of blurry garbage i should not have to look to mods in order for a game i purchased to not look like it came right out of the gutter 3 scale all the cities could barely classify as towns the cities make the world appear larger on the map than it should be but the cities in actuality make the world seem cramped and lifeless solitude has less than 20 buildings and even less buildings to enter 4 writing lots of cringey writing i could only tolerate it because i took long and frequent breaks from the main questline to explore and kill stuff 5 poorly scaling monsters if you spent time leveling up things unrelated to combat you find the combat outscales you and you end up fighting hulking draugr deathlords that oneshot you because you still have a iron chestplate and sword but another flaw about this game is what has happened recently mods are now able to be charged for developers are actually getting paid to do nothing while modders fix the game for them and even then the modders only get 25% of the revenue they make total oh and if it doesnt break $400 bucks then they dont get revenue at all now if a player wants a quality mod to fix a bug or increase their experience they have to pay for it like dlc these stupid microtransaction methods arent content with just dlc and preorder  theyre not encroaching on the modding community tldr skyrim really draws you in for a while but once you get wise to it everything looks boring feels boring and now if you want to enhance your experience with mods you have to pay for it too

an ok consoleportinspirit that requires mods to be anything like previous iterations in terms of difficulty or depth before shady business practices that rewarded lazy and greedy companies even further this was no real issue but now it most certainly is and for that i cannot recommend the game to anybody who has played a previous elder scrolls or even a real fan of rpgs if its your first rpg game itll be ok bethesda invented modern dlc as we know it remember [wwwuespnet]  bethesda has only gotten away with their poor showings to the pc market among a sizable portion of users because they were a mod framework people could sandbox in inhouse bethesda games postoblivion are barely worth the virtual space theyre printed on as rpgs next to the actual giants of the genre to demand 50% share is further incentivizing incompleteness and bugs as now in theory bethesda can just double dip get money for the game itself because people will know whatever c quality the game itself is can be changed completely so they buy it and then get a paycheck on the fixes to their own issues what was a company that barely tries to develop mechanicsstabilitygameplayopenness will try even less remember commenters you could always donate to modders who wanted to set that up and theyd get 90100% of your money money transfer fees may or may not apply this isnt supporting modders this is in fact corporations butting in on their hard work and handing them pennies after taking your dollars the developer made the platform if the game was so great why would it need fan bugfixesmechanic overhauls why are they entitled to the sweat of another mans brow especially sweat that is usually spent on fixes why ever devote in studio time to bugfixes or improvements shovel them titles out with the paid staff let the common rabble do that unprofitable and difficult grunt work and collect your money twice you dont even have to pay them a living wage they work for peanuts ahahahaha valve has to spend a kerspillion dollars on hosting theyll go bankrupt if they dont get paid as much as the person doing the actual work bulk rate discounts are a thing when you host half of pc gaming and you can donate to the nexus at any time which over their history has done just fine with community supportadspremium and without spending ninety blargillion dollars this hopefully is peak industry greed this surely is one of several heralding sounds of the second great video games crash [enwikipediaorg] and it cant come soon enough valve you were the chosen one it was said that you would destroy the greedfirstgamessecond aaa monopoly not join them bring balance to the pc gaming community not leave it in darkness edit addendum bethesda has entirely eroded their goodfaith benefit of the doubt in regards to greed undercutting others and cashing in valve too are working hard to catch up to them only at a squinting passing glance does this help modders rather with any real thought it tears mod teams apart i wait to be paid and tim doesnt believe in it tears the community apart intermod permissions were already a dramafest with no money involved treads some real ip legality lines liscensing the legality of eula theft of work etc and is generally toxic to what was once a highly cooperative community focused field do you really want more greed and money in the world we live in where does it end art projects picked up by the media with the viewership dollars shared what was once collaberative free expression that could maybe lead to money if the artist cared about that becoming a winner take all hypercapitalist dogeatdog minicorporate world not by my vote

quite simply im expressing my disgust at the paid mods system theyve implemented the game itself is fantastic and the mods you can get for free are phenomenal purchase by all means but dont positively review until they revoke paid for mods written and published as of 26042015 with mods being optionally charged for a set price

if you have gotten to experience the magnificent game that skyrim is before the paid modding was added good for you if not im afraid it can already be too late as a pc game skyrim was geared towards modding from the getgo and functioned so for the four years after its release it was and still is a great game that stood on its own even without any mods and if thats what you wish do buy and play it it is totally worth it but as i said mods small and big improvements to how the game works are truly the heart of skyrim and the last four years the community has been pushing out more and more amazing modifications sadly bethesda with the help of valve has recently put up a marketplace for paid mods thus seeking to monetize all that was free for four years in the process they are only spawning retexture ripoffs and the like ruining the modding community completely if you are here for the vanilla game it is epic and worth it i would definitely recommend it but then you could just get it for a console since you werent going to mod anyways but if youre here for the full experience enriched with mods im sorry but you are too late now i cannot recommend the game as it is in its current sad state

even after the paid mods fiasco im still keeping my bad rating and let me tell you why this game has the area of an ocean but the depth of a kiddie pool anyone can argue bethesdas strong suit is world building and skyrim has an epic open world but the game does nothing with it i found the story hard to follow despite it being linear and obvious but it was too easy to get wrapped up in sidequests furthermore the npcs every npc has something to say which is cool but its specifically about you and to you even those who dont know or care that youre the dragonborn it creates an atmosphere of the entire world revolving around you a big problem i had with fallout 3 bethesdas other rpg however unlike fallout this game has no moral system meaning you can get trapped into doing evil quests lights out with no way to stop it this games world is massive and incredible but the story falls short and the npcs serve no purpose to deepen it if you want an rpg thats truly great deep moddable and has bethesdas name on it save your money and pick up new vegas still plenty of great mods and a much better story and base replayability than skyrim or fallout 3

edit happy to find out bethesda and steam backpedaled on their decision to monetize mods still let this review stand as a record of what transpired and to how loudly hundreds of thousands of voices can resonate thanks for fighting for us for the last three elder scrolls games bethesda has relied on one thing to make their games playable and decent i am of course talking about allowing the community to mod their games which are never finished upon release the vanilla version of their games while acceptable do not even remotely compare to a fully modded version of the game essentially bethesda had been using the communty to give their very bare games a good name and they have succeeded in that regard and have increased their sales significantly but that was not enough for bethesda it wasnt enough that they release a game half completed it wasnt enough that the community had to fill in the blanks to do a job that the developers are getting paid a lot of money to do professionally no bethesda now wants to profit by monetizing the mods out there the mods which made people give a thought about their game to begin with this practice encourages foul play copyright infrigments greed and will generally not sit well for the people who use their products if one of the core mods out there gets monitized and they already have there will be no alternative to the users due to the modders being unable to get their similar mods approved due to so called copyright there was never a copyright problem before monetizing the mods now this becomes a reality now bethesda and valve get a piece of the pie with every transaction do you remember the blizzard approach how many people at blizzard lost their jobs over their terrible business model before they bent the knee to all the negative feedback and redesigned the entire game bethesda and valve are trying to turn user generated content into paid dlc because they feel they should get credit and ownership on the user generated content released for their half finished games essentially outsourcing some of their best content to third parties who have none of the benefits of being full time bethesda employees additionally the feedback for the paid content is now completely biased as only the users who purchased the mod will be able to write reviews and rate the content if valve and bethesda truly wanted to legitimately support the modding community all they had to do was add an optional donation option for those who want to contribute to the mods development i am not blaming any of the developers of the game they did what they were told their marketting department and those above it are solely the ones blamed as well as the service who hosts their game

great game made amazing by a great modding community though take note the game is no longer supported by its makers bugs you find on it mostly have been fixed by the use of modder made patches i definitly recommend it if you like games like fallout and want a fantasy world version of that game this is the game for you with its massive modding you can customize theworld to your liking it has a community so strong it recently crushed greed that could have destroyed it get this elder scrolls game now and hope the next elder scrolls game follows in a similar path especially the modding side that has been around since earlier elder scrolls games forever free
recommended
paid mods may cost more than advertised this game for a start is brilliant and i highly recommend you to purchase it would you kindly not pay for mods however and here is why now we all know that modding isnt perfect and depending on the type of mod can be extremly hard and confusing to install these mods may require ini editing and may require patches and files such as the skyrim script extender to run correctly and even installing these can be a pain in the backside because they may be out of date versions include errors and might not even work on certain hardware this can be extremely confusing to people who dont know the inouts of a computer things such as renaming or zip extracting now onto why i think mods may cost you a fortune ________________________________________ now if you have looked into the workshop you may have seen there are a few mods already up for payment these few mods so far that i have seen require nothing else to experience their content yet but this is what will happen and trust me it will say i release a mod called skyrim graphics overhaul and i put it up for purchase it seems all fine and dandy doesnt it a mod which will make skyrim look like crysis and i go ahead and buy it until you see this _________________________________________ main mod skyrim graphics overhaul 4 required mods skyrim water enhanced 5 skyrim ultra hd texture pack 7 8k grass textures 3 total price 19 yes 4 for a mod which should have had all these things covered itself and then for all the other mods you have to fork out 15 for microtransaction dlc for a grand total of 19 for a modpack which probably wont make it look as advertised please do not stand for this and sign this petition httpswwwchangeorgpvalveremovethepaidcontentofthesteamworkshop

skyrim is easily one of the best games of this generation its one of the games that you get as much out of as you put in its also one of the games you play exactly how you want to play you can choose to ignore the main story immediately after beginning or play through the quests like a linear action adventure game speaking of quests theres an awful lot of them even after playing over 170 hours altogether i have a plethora of quests on my active quest log never mind the ones i havent even started yet so yes skyrim is 100% recommended by me

update this was written during the paid mods debacle on steam paid mods were removed after intense backlash this will still remain a negative review read below the review to see why  it is with a very weary sigh that i can no longer recommend this series this franchise this part of gaming history has occupied a big part of my heart as well as my gaming shelf since daggerfall the primary reason for this exceptional longevity has been the incredible amount of modded content available for every title in the series since morrowind the incredible array of mods and thirdparty tools have turned the games from fun but some times shallow gaming experiences to something wholly special new content new quests new companions whole new landmasses and areas to explore  all available for years and years and years after launch and then valve and bethesda decided that they wanted to make money on other peoples mods and they wanted a lot of it in fact they wanted 75% of it the problems are already starting mods that were once free now cost money the steam workshop is being flooded with truly bad content designed to abuse the awful workshop system and cash in while they can there are early access mods that ask for money up front for continued development popular gameplaychanging mods such as midas magic have been removed from the nexus and other modding sites and replaced with a paid version and a freemium version which constantly gives you an ingame popup begging you to buy the full version i am going to repeat that because it sounds vaguely important we now have early access mods we now have ingame ads for mods i cannot recommend any game that decides to make use of this new system valve is trying to cram down our throats designed to grab more money from their consumers in what i can only describe as a horribly unethical manner the modding scene is  without hyperbole  under serious threat right now as a result of this horribly botched paywall implementation and valve is running serious damage control banning players removing comment sections and hoping everything will blow over and whats worse is it very well may blow over and in the meantime skyui  the most downloaded accessibilityui mod a mod that makes the ui actually bearable a mod that countless other mods depend on to function  has gone paidonly we just lost a ton of content overnight and unless i miss my mark this is only beginning that is why i cannot recommend skyrim any more i can no longer claim that you should buy this game because mods have always been a big part of it for me and that platform is now under duress with the current ecosystem it will become worse and worse and worse i never felt sad for being a pc gamer until now today is extremely disappointing  since writing this valve and bethesda backed off from their paid mod system due to intense backlash valve has apologized and given some indication that they understand our concerns httpwwwredditcomrpcmasterracecomments3434itpaid_mods_in_the_steam_workshop bethesda has not and not httpwwwbethblogcom20150427whyweretryingpaidskyrimmodsonsteam bethesda still seems to think they were in the right and still seem to believe that mods behind a paywall is something they want to work on they also seem to think that the pricing model was fair and they are trying to claim that a 25%45% split in favor of bethesda over the modder is acceptable because it is the industry standard in an industry where there is no precedent for this whatsoever and also importantly neither party seems to understand that its not the idea of giving money to content creators that was problematic in and of itself  it was the system that was being imposed on us it was the unfair monetization favoring corporations over content developers it was the complete lack of quality control on the steam workshop store and extraordinarily importantly it was the fact that the system was set up to allow for mandatory payment which meant that modders started taking advantage of this by placing their formerly free mods under this paywall this wreaked all kinds of havoc with the ecosystem what with mods being dependent on each other and compatibility issues being a prevalent nut to crack even though we had the best intentions the feedback has been clear  this is not a feature you want your support means everything to us and we hear you  bethesda no you dont hear us if you did you and valve would openly discuss the pricing point with the community if you did you and valve would realize that the mandatory paywall was the problem if you did in fact hear us you would have pulled the plug on this project instead of letting valve make all of the decisions for you if valve hadnt caved there would still be a paywall bethesda would still be taking a 45% cut and bethesda would be doing their damnedest to justify it i will change this review back to positive if bethesda ever makes good on their

valve and bethesda adding in paid mods for skyrim has resulted in supreme backlash for a good reason so far the positive rating % has dropped from 98% to 89% you can now buy broken mods for 3 and use them while using your broken 40p sword and eating a broken 20p carrot its like early access but its even ier hiding mods behind a in paywall and real good mod developers would only get 25% of the revenue cut by choosing this way anyway valve and bethesda are literally assing the consumers and the mod developers

so this game is great but when i recently tried to play it i realized that all of the mods that i had originally used throughout my playthrough is now for whatever reason requiring money i payed for the game and seeing mods being pay to play just seems ludicrous not to denote content creators especially the ones ive donated to in the past you know who you are but this is not something i agreed upon

its a amazing game and the mods makes is so much better but now they are behinde a paywall i have quit it paying for mods is not about the modders valve never have never will be its just another way for them to make money of others work a 75% cut to valve and a 25% to the modders 
not recommended
really good game mainly due to the mods bethesda puts out ok games that are some what half  in my opinion and they rely on the modding community to pick up there slack now they want to take 75% of the modders profits what a joke and unffortunatly now i have to not recommend skyrim
not recommended
skyrim is a great game mostly because of all the great mods enhancing the existing gameplay and content sadly now valve have started charging for their mods so in order to enjoy skyrim properly one would have to cough up hundreds of dollars if all mods costed money last time i played skyrim i had 526 mods of various complexity installed with an average price of 2 dollarsif valve had their way and all mods had a price thats still more than 1000 dollars to enjoy the game no thanks valve

in the past id always have recommended this game skyrim is famous for being a buggy mess with bad graphics horrible combat shallow npcs and a boring story but its also one of the best pc games of all time thanks entirely to huge and dedicated community that turned a bad game into a modding platform of unprecedented scale without mod support and the commitment of a loving fanbase this game would have gone down in history as a lake as deep as a puddle mods opened it up to infinite replayability infinite content bethesda and valve are now working to crush this games life support system it will die slowly as they rip the onceunited community asunder by greed mods that worked together and relied on each other are being dragged down by spiders webs of paywalls like the mod skyui modders are releasing awful mods for ridiculous prices in a race to make a quick buck gone are the passion the dedication the modding community that has thrived for years is dying thieves are exploiting the system to upload others content and charge for it careless modders could in the past be forgiven for a flawed product unprofessional conduct glitches or crashes they cannot be held to the higher standard required of a paid product already large mods have downgraded their free versions and moved the full version to behind a paywall content that was once free has been taken from us bethesda are making a profit from mods like skyui that were created to fix the issues with their game theyre being rewarded for creating a terrible interface and whats more the modder is only getting a tiny cut of the money dont buy skyrim without mods its a flawed glitchy dated ugly mess until bethesda and steam rescind their idiotic stance on paid mods its impossible for me to support a game that i love

ive played this game pretty extensively part of what makes it great is the massive amounts of modding that can be done to really make this game as close to perfect as possible however valve and bethesda now decided to start putting mods behind a paywall this has already resulted in massive outrage stealing of mods and my own personal dissapointment in both companies many modders are even upset about this putting what was free content behind a paywall isntead of a donation option is ridiculous

vuck falve buck fethesda so you want to charge the average customer even more money to download mods as if we dont have other things to spend our hard earned cash on nah sorry not going to buy into that aint going to happen baby cakes i cannot fully express my discontent at the moment however i will put valve and bethesda on my five year list meaning in five years i will be seeing those responsible for this atrocity directly enjoy it while you can

now that mods are behind a pay wall there is no real reason to even buy this on the pc
not recommended
edit they removed paid mods but heres the original review congratulations you spent upwards to $40 to buy skyrim you bought it on pc so you could download those sweet mods your friends always bragged that they had you go to the workshop to go get some of these amazing mods and then you notice price tags strewn about everywhere everything is behind a paywall and if you wanted every mod you saw that was interesting you would have to spend more than the game itself just to use it is it guaranteed to work of course not but valve added a feature where you could refund the mod for 24 hours but theres another catch some mods dont work together so if you bought your fancy $5 mod and you got some other $2 mod they might not work together congratulations you spent $7 dollars on dlc that doesnt work what are the modders gonna do about it they just want the money but whats even worse is the modders only get 25% of the profit annnnnndddd they only recieve their money through steam wallet what the hell are you gonna need steam wallet money for when youre raking in like 3 cents everytime some jerkoff buys your 25 cent mod of some  sword oh wait theres more the modders themselves dont even get the money from the mods until their mod sells enoguh for them to make $100 and remember they only get 25% of that money so if you had 25 cent mod it would have to make four hundred dollars in sales for you to even get paid for your paid mod rip pc skyrim and mods november 11 2011  april 23 2015

the game was alright not as good as oblivion but not a bad game overall i give it a thumbs down for two reasons 1 those of us that preordered the game still have no cheap option to buy all dlc included in the legendary edition i paid $60 for the base game with no dlc and legendary edition is only $40 i think with no option to upgrade from base even during a weekend deal on skyrim the legendary edition is only $14 while the dlc is $17 how is the dlc more expensive than the base game  dlc why do they hate their preorder fans so much and only give good deals to new people 2 paid mods this is not an effort to support modders and give an option for people to make money doing what they love from what ive read modders only get a 25% cut that means valve is taking in 75% free money for work they didnt do providing a platform for sale does not entitle you to 75% of the profit made on said platform tldr  if you never played the game pick up the legendary edition its a fun game ruined by both bethesdas and valves greedy marketing schemes

the elder scrolls iv oblivion is the greatest game ive played i dont think i will ever enjoy a game as much again the euphoric high was that strong because it was a masterpiece it took my breath away the elder scrolls v skyrim deserves to be the next installment of the series and the follow up to such a sublime work of art it draws on the formula that made oblivion great yet uses that formula in its own unique way to create a world that you can explore that is different from the story the cultures the customs and civilizations found in oblivions cyrodiil province there are a multitude of major and minor quests that guide you in exploring skyrim these missions whether they are mini stories or extended quest lines intrigue the player into exploring further some tales are witty others tragic and sometimes they are both this results in the quest outcomes producing an emotional response of some form for the player the quest stories are a great collection of journeys to follow but the finest moments in this game are probably those that are unscripted for instance my party of four was walking on the forest road passing close to largashbur an orc camp when a random bear attacked the group even my horse got stuck in to the bear riftens road patrol guards came to our aid as well shortly after that a civil war enemy faction who must have been close by suddenly attacked the guards later a massive fire breathing dragon then swooped down from the skies and he didnt care who he picked on at some point i must have gotten too close to largashbur which triggered a quest involving a giant who then attacks the orc camp that in itself is a big battle but the two scrimmages became one the chaos was such i have no idea who was on whose side after that a second fire breathing dragon arrived and he was attacking the giant as well other forest creatures such as giant spiders became opportunists too this fight went on for an extended period of time but i remember a moment seeing my horse terrified fleeing through the forest trees burning pursued by a flying dragon i thought to myself you cant script this in oblivion drakes were fantastic adversaries but one thing missing were dragons prior to skyrim i had always hoped a sequel to oblivion would introduce dragons creatures that were much bigger more powerful fearsome and majestic looking skyrim didnt just deliever it became the benchmark they are beyond what i had hoped for further to this the integration of the greybeards dragon shouts etc into skyrims dragon lore both as a storyline and in gameplay was a great accomplishment in itself as well the official hearthfire dlc was another aspect of skyrim that improved on what was a fantatic feature in oblivion the standard houses in skyrim are a little bland compared to those in oblivion but the hearthfire dlc changed that around it is a wonderful progression in the elder scrolls series i am however still wanting more from this aspect of the game if there is an elder scrolls vi i anticipate they will work on that further skyrim is amazing for its library of mods ive never seen such a diverse range of mods for a game which doesnt mean much for i play very few games i found some quirks of the standard game irritating but if i want some aspect of skyrim changed theres going to be a mod to resolve it i conjured dead thralls which would constantly groan and it gets annoying i searched the steam workshop and found a mod to silence the groaning i found another mod that allowed me to use ingame character skins which i could then customize facially to create a unique character i preferred if you want to play as barbie im sure theres a mod for that as well it probably has a dreamhouse ie your house and tawny your horse integrated too i did a quick search on google and found this httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvxfps8kq7s1y ok ok this is not a steam workshop item but its funny skyrim is not a perfect game its biggest problem like oblivion is bugs i guess all those npcs various factions etc are going to glitch out sooner or later you will have problems that will prevent you from completing quests etc which would leave you gutted if they remained unsolved skyrim wiki sites have fixes for all the problems you will encounter i was easily able to find solutions to solve all of my bugs when they cropped up another issue with skyrim is keyboard control probably because its geared towards consoles it felt like keyboard control was an afterthought its not great but you get used to it oblivion was far superior in this area as mentioned skyrim is a deserving follow up to oblivion graphically skyrim is superior but oblivion still remains the finest moments ive had in gaming to follow up with an acceptable package after creating something so grand is a very tough ask theyve not only accomplished this in my opinion but they have excelled once again im blown away by a game skyrim does have alot of bugs normally for me that would be a game changer no punn intended the positives of skyrim completely supress any negatives aspects normally my viewpoint is heavily influenced by negative issues first rather than positive facets this speaks volumes about what skyrim got right ps i am not the one dancing shirtless at the end of that youtube video im bald

well bethesda certainly knows how to go about openworld singleplayer rpgs after years and years of practice and this would be the culmination of that effort very immersive fun to play and hard to walk away from its better in just about every regard compared to its predecessor oblivion and a bit more involved than other similar creations fallout 3 if you like medieval fantasy you cant not play this game

even after almost 3 years this game is just great there is alot to do and to explore and the modding community has alot of other great things there are some bugs in the game tough but im sure there are some fixes for those bugs in the steam workshop or somewhere else on the internet so they can be fixed

i  just  cant  imagine how steam was before ive found this amazing game  great storyline full of surprises great characters amazing atmosphere and top of all its like a completely fascinating world  maybe the only negative thing its addictive  so be well prepared when starting this new adventure ^_^ i really dont regret wasting my spare time on it so yea i know where ill spend most of my summer holidays

as i see things valve just broke this game in hopes id pay them money to fix it my current mod build has items id have to pay for to use again the next time i make a clean install of skyrim to mould and manipulate i would need to pay for access to mods im currently using many of my saves would not work without the content which now costs money to access my game saves and future enjoyment of a game i payed full price for are being held for ransom

to be clear this game is amazing ive played it since it first came out in 2011 bethesda did some excellent work here i give it a thumbs down because of the new paid mods system this will only drive players away from the game and also drive modders away from modding the game its a poor choice on steam and bethesdas part who probably sat down in a room together and said a lot of people still play this game how can we make money off them i refuse to download any more mods from the steam workshop and i suggest everyone else does the same its the only way steam\bethesda will see how much the community disapproves and hopefully rethink this whole thing go to nexus mods where mods will always be free and mod developers come first over profits

first off skyrim is a still a great game that sadly suffers from a number of issues if you have played oblivion you probably will be disappointed in the long run with skyrim because of the gameplay being dumbed in several ways for example the spell system is fun with the dual wielding but sadly they toke out the custom spell making and that was always fun as a mage in oblivion combat is dumbed down alot but it is still decent because the elder scroll games never had the best combat many of the qeusts and characters feel lacking in depth but i did expect this as bethesda isnt the greatest in those aspects of games like this there are still a few good points in skyrim despite the several flaws ive already pointed out such as the better support for mods that bethesda has provided in cooperation with valve workshop is great and the community behind the mods are great as well these add so much gameplay hours that you can get double the hours if you install some mods they even made me rebuy the game on pc with the dlcs dlcs are lacking expect dragonborngreat expansion generally it is way more stable then previous games even though it isnt perfect in this matter despite the flaws of the game it still provides a great way to waste hours and one of the finest sandbox rpgs out there however i recommend oblivion more then this game because of the fact that it is basically this but then way better imo

mods are what make bethesda games worth playing considering they cant be bothered to do the work themselves with the advent of paid mods theres no way skyrim is worth it do yourself a favor and pound a nail through your foot its more fun than what valve and bethesda did to modding edit im not taking down this review now that the paid mod store has been removed i want bethesda to remember this incident when their next game comes along so they dont forget what happened
not recommended
i never really cared for skyrim in the first place and the introduction of paid mods made it even worse the game seems impressive in scope as to the amount of things you can do but the entire experience is very shallow in other words the amount of things to do is proportional to the depth and complexity of each activity mods help to offset this flaw but the introduction of paid mods has ruined the modding scene for the moment going to nexus mods will help you find the best mods out there but this could change quickly better off spending your money elsewhere
not recommended
dont encourage paid mods please the game is mediocre at best without any mods were complimentary but i hate paying for a game twice much less trice much less each time i mod it
not recommended
pay mods is a terrible idea the game is okay but the precident is awful it incentivises developerspublishers to release games with fewer features and incomplete interfaces with the expectation that the moding community will fix the bugs and add the missing features not only does bethesda not have to pay inhouse developers to put features in the games they get paid when the mod community does it for them
not recommended
paying for mods is silly because modding is the only thing that makes skyrim and all other games made by bethesda even worth their asking price in the first place
not recommended
this game and the elder scrolls games that came before it have always been the pinnacle of variety in modding if you want realism you can get that in spades if you want ridiculous stuff until youre swimming in cheese and lettuce theres probably a mod for that too however the latest development of paid mods has caused a rift between developers modders customers and modders which is damaging the entire community its a rare day to meet a pc tes player who doesnt run any mods and this is just going to end up being another cheap cash flow for valve for the low low price of their integrity dont buy mods its not a good development the way its been impemented if it was a pay what you want if you want to or donation system that would have been wonderful the game itself is good and with mods its incredible but with paid mods it feels like the modern policy of nickel and diming everything to hell and back taken to a far worse degree than has ever been done before if youre going to buy skyrim for its modding capabilities id think long and hard about what youd be supporting and the chances of buying a nonfunctional mod or something that breaks things or corrupts your save dont support 3rd party dlc

i would give this game 710 as is on steam with modding 1110 it was awesome i do not have an issue with modders being paid for their work many sites like the nexus have a donate button where you can donate what you feel the mod is worth my issue is how steam implemented modding modders do 100% of the work for their mods i know some build on others mods they have no help from steam or bethesda other than steam giving them a place to share the mods with the world now if a modder was selling content i can understand a share of it going to these companies but they take 75% of the income this i have issue with modders deserve way more than the 25% cut hence my negative review do not buy this game the way modding is being monitised means that any more than 1015 hours of gameplay now will cost you a lot more than you bargined for for any good mod from now on

an excellent game thats given me endless enjoyment marred by the fact that its been forced into being a guinea pig for an incrediblycrappy paid mod system over the last few days a system where valvebethesda gets a 75% cut of $400 minimum made monthly off a mod and if the mod maker fails to reach $400 minimum in sales each month they get all the profit a system thats nothing but abusive and made only to profit valve and a games makers tossing pocket change to the people who did all of the work a system which would be better replaced by an optional donate directly to [mod maker] system which will never happen since the current paid mod system grossly profits valve and the maker of any game involved if you really have to get this good game wait until all this paid mod crap has ended hopefully with the system being removed entirely and things going back to before this weekends fateful change dont support this horrificallygreedy business practice whatever you do

mods are what make bethesda games worth playing considering they cant be bothered to do the work themselves with the advent of paid mods theres no way skyrim is worth it do yourself a favor and pound a nail through your foot its more fun than what valve and bethesda did to modding edit im not taking down this review now that the paid mod store has been removed i want bethesda to remember this incident when their next game comes along so they dont forget what happened
not recommended
mods are the only reason this was ever a good game now that mods must be paid for this game has become a trap mod quality is not regulated nor is functionality guaranteed it will be impossible to know what is worth the price and what isnt what will work together and what wont and most of the mod content is stolen from other games and artists how valve ever thought this was a good idea avoid this trap

i used to love this game it is the most played game i have ever owned however paid mods  you  you  you  you  you  you ea steam i am not against modders being paid by why do we pay  you  you  you ea i mean steam also why steal 75% of the money from the modders    ____________ `__\ ___ \\   \______\____ \ ______\______\\_____ \ \\

now with valves misconstrued idea about mods being capitalized upon by big wig company giving the creator a meager percentage ie 20% for their creation the reason for mods is to create free content for the community to enjoy and have greater experience in the game not to have 3rd party dlc where the company makes the money for no effort while the creator gets a few copper nickles this is an ea move if i have ever seen one and it must be reprimanded at once if we are to enjoy our games like the modders originally intended not to see a bunch of couch potatoes make  change for a  mods

after steam took the market of mods and now im forced to pay for fixes or ways to improve this game no i wouldnt recommend this pirate it with all the dlc and then download some free mods on the nexus so you can hide the horrendous job bethesda did with this game compared to oblivion you are going to notice that every dungeon is just a cave filled with draugrs or spider only with a dragon priest at the end and nothing more

modding made this a great game cannot recommend it under this terrible paid mod approach

look im all for giving creators their due when they work hard to make these mods but steam taking 75% from a game they never even touched it complete bs i would honestly suggest people to find other sources for mods until steam atleast gives modders a fair cut

best game i ever bought in this game youll be sent back to the times where people fought with swords and bows a brilliant setting if you ask me the game lets you do whatever you want you can customize your character to your own style own personal favorite race and youll be able to fight any style you want do you want to play the sneaky elf archer with the bow no problem do you want to play the sneaky kahjiit thief with the daggers no problem do you dislike weapons and love to use magic no problem theres even lots of different spells either destruction or illusion maybe necromancy is more your style being a healer is no problem either you can make your own weapons by smithing you can make your own potions by gathering ingredients and mixing them into a potion with alchemy you can upgrade your weapons by using enchanting theres so much to do want to settle down after some adventures get to a town and drink mead at the inn or purchase a house or a piece of land to build a house with selffound materials or maybe bought materials whatever you want there are so many different playtroughs so much quests to play heck ive played this over 275 hours and i still havent completed all the quests i completely recommend this game i bought it at the releasedate 111111 and im still not done with it did i mention the steam workshop millions of mods to download without any fee enjoy

day 1 this game sure looks nice theres justso much to do i mean the maps all over they expect me to actually walk to each place theres barely any quest markers i dont know where the hellscrew it im going to walk in that direction and see what i find day 5 hey this games starting to flow a bit now the quest system is starting to make sense its kind of fun to wander about and explore these random caves and what not plus my toon looks pretty cool with this helmet with the big horns sticking out day 10 im uhim not sure but i think my wife may be angry with me i told her i was going to go play some more skyrim she said fine whatever im going to be hope im not spending too much time with the game i cant help it though now that i figure out how the quests and exploration works it all feels pretty good i think im going to play with some graphics mods that realism mod sounded kind of cool day 15 how in the hell do i have 110 hours played in this game already that cant be right i didnt think i was playing that much then againi havent seen my wife and kid for a few days now that i think about it i uhmaybe i should go check on that make sure theyre okay ill go just as soon as im done forging these iron daggers day 20 my new wife lydia becons me back to to breezehome ive been gone so long the dragon of north summit is no longer so it is time to return i feel sorrow for leaving her and the children alone as the war with the stormcloaks rages on around us but i am dragon born and i have a duty to keep tamriel safe from the scaled death that soars high in our snowy skies day 50 i was once an adventurer like you then i took an arrow to the knee

im not paying for mods this game is dead to me now i have played elder scrolls games since morrowind and the content that was in that game was far greater than any game since in my opinion bethesda always failed deliver a game with the same experience that morrowind delivered dumbing down the experience and depth every time thus making mods an integral part of the new games for if the company that makes the game failed to deliver a complete experience like minded folks would then create content for there own games and want to share it with the community i hope this bad move by valve is the downfall of steam and a new platform that only allows free mods rises up greedy greedy greedy what is it like 75% for valve 25% to the makers hahahahahahaha c you next tuesdays

this game was amazing until valve and bethesda decided they wanted to become like ea and take even more money from consumers the difference is ea actually makes their dlc while bethesda doesnt anymore they piggyback off of others

i feel justified to post a rant here regarding valve and bethe$das shady practices regarding paid mods as you may know valve and bethesda game studios have announced paid mods for skyrim  and it is an utter disaster no they arent bugged and they arent ridiculously overpriced  its the fact that the modders who actually created the mod get next to nothing from these paid mods  they only get 25% of the cut while the other 75% goes to the other two greedy corporations valve and bethesda who have done absolutely nothing regarding the creation a modders intellectual property what the  yes you read that right the modders themselves only take home 25% of the money made from the sale of their own mods the rest is split between valv and bethe$da this is far below even the  apple store which gives app creators at least 70% of the cash 25% is abysmally low  especially considering that the modders are the ones putting in the time and effort to create these things for us to enjoy mods have kept skyrim alive for years otherwise many would have stopped playing bethe$da is choosing to look at the paid modding situation like why are these players not giving us money rather than wow this is amazing advertising and communitybuilding for our game modders love the games they mod and that is why they spend so much time on their creations changing it around and turning modders  your own loyal fans  into cows ripe for the milking is not one bit fair this new system will create a flood of new unskilled modders who arent the type of players doing it for the love of the game and its community but rather people trying to simply reskin an iron sword and sell it for 5 bucks  or why not have the consumers pay 20 bucks so the modder can actually get the 5 bucks in the first place the game will be overloaded with this kind of crap and it puts a black mark on the entire modding community you may as well say goodbye to great mods like appearing in the store and instead expect to see it flooded with crappy reskins and broken everything from people looking to make a quick buck from little effort already one of these paid mods has been taken down after the author of one mod claimed another user was selling their mod using animations that the author had originally created in his own mod the seller of the new mod then claimed that valve actually forbade him from contacting the original animator about using his work because of some sort of nda about the store the crowd of people mentioned above could easily slide in and just start stealing other peoples work left and right and selling it on the store to make some juicy cash  even if they arent making an awful lot even if valve has some sort of report system for stolen mods in place its going to be a pain in the butt to sift through true and  claims based on who stole whose work and who has the rights to the original mod and so on its a big time bomb waiting to blow  just wait and see heres another thing that could happen with this shady new practice lets say that bethesda wants to make another skyrim dlc about what happened to the dwarves or something like that they want to make a new piece of equipment for the dlc but the piece of gear in particular is proving difficult to animate and operate effectively on the pc version of skyrim they have two options under this new system do they a work really hard on it and release the new piece of gear or b say the modders have lots of creative ideas lets just promote their paid mod in the workshop under the old system bethesda would have been motivated to make the piece of gear themselves but under the paid mod system someone is doing all the hard work for them and theyre taking 75% of the revenue for each piece of gear sold now lets say 1000 pieces of gear have been sold for 10 bucks each  bethesda is getting $7500 from it when they did absolutely nothing and the modder who went through all that hard work to create the new piece of gear is only getting $2500  thats still alot of money but do you know how much more he could be making from the mod that he created all by himself with absolutely no assistance from bethesda or valve im not saying this is going to happen for sure but when a company can charge consumers for something that an independent modder created but you can certainly bet that there are opportunities sitting there please do not buy skyrim these kinds of shady practices must absolutely not be tolerated  we have enough moneygrubbing in the gaming industry as it is from companies such as ubisoft and ea we dont need more moneygrubbing from valve and bethe$da

i really love the game of skyrim but the reason i do isnt because of the game you start with its because of the game you can make with the mods if you want to be a vampire hunter and go around killing all the bloodsuckers but dont like the fact that you pick up vampire dust from a body that is not dust you can mod it and therein lies the problem because have it the makers of the game patches it so that you can no longer use the mod or makes the mod useless by adding the effect themselves in a update then you paid for something that is useless also if anyone cares i feel like a very despicable human for giving this game a thumbs down because after 800 hours playing it its obvious i dont dislike or hate this game and its only real bugs come from the fact that most of instaltions of this are held together by ducttape and mod patches for patches that where for an update to a patch for a mod that let you have a gaint lydia fight a fully nude test jeremy big

i played this game for over 200 hours on my ps3 after finally building a gaming pc that could run this well i started to feel burned out with the game mods changed this they allowed me to change my game to something new and refreshing the steam workshop and the nexus made this process simple and even fun saying all of this i cant stand for companies making mods a pay to use thing it is a shame that a game with such a great community is being split over this bethesda and valve need to rethink what they have done with this

bethesda and valve are putting mods behind a paywall which require no quality control or assurance of support following upcoming patches mods are responsible for many bugfixes and provide life to an otherwise bland and generic game both visually and gameplaywise i would not have purchased this game if i had known this would become an issue in the future

this is not a review of the game anyone who has even remotely heard of or played skyrim knows that the gameplay is of course amazing no this is about paid mods i can not believe valve thought this would be a good idea to one of the best gaming platforms you have made a big ing mistake

due to valves new paid modding policy this game is soon dying it was fun while it lasted

elder scrolls v skyrim my thoughts on the game is a bit mixed the game itself gets boring after the first play through and after that i personally do not see any replay value if you played skyrim with mods you know it refreshes your experience it is like a whole new game where you most likely are having fun more then the vanilla version bethesda and valve has introduced a new system for mods now a payment system bethesda released a game with little replay value and the only reason it is still alive to this day is because of mods now they want to make a profit off modders after they kept their game alive without mods this game isnt even worth considering buying the mods that do actually make a big difference in game play is usually half the price of the game until they fix this i recommend to stay as far away from this game as possible and the greedy bethesda with their shady money grabbing techniques
not recommended
essentially ruining years of work by the modding community in one swift blow good job guys

lets be honest vanilla skyrim is a 710 game good but forgettable mods is what really made skyrim shine as a 1010 game mods can significantly change the gameplay of a playthrough for the better with the possibility that mods turning into the new payable dlc is going to change the gaming industry for the worst bethesda introduced dlc in oblivion with horse armor and that gained momentum for better or worse now i take a stand and dont want bethesda to introduce p2p mods as the new norm for the gaming industry whatll be next having to pay irl money for each quest or each new piece of armor in the next elder scroll game in the next fallout game in any new game post 2015

skyrim is a great game however skyrim is a great game because of its modding community i remember when this game first came out it turned out to be a bit of a dissapointment due to how bland everything felt in the world the game by itself it oversimplified and probably one of the most boring of the entire series not to long after release this game was saved not by bethesda but by its modding community because of mods i have put hundreds of hours into this game with the new mod paywall i cannot in my right mind recommend that you buy this game as a matter of fact after being a loyal steam costumer for 8 years now i will suspending buying any games directly from steam until the mod paywall is removed
not recommended
i cant fault the base game but valves choice to keep mods behind a paywall and then leaving the creators of the mod with only 25% of the cut from the sales is disgraceful i have no idea why they think they are entitled to 30% of the money when they have absolutely nothing to do with either skyrim or the content from the modding community as many others have said a simple donate button would have helped show support for modders which you would think valve would have been happy to do considering they owe their own success due to mods of their games

the elder scrolls v skyrim the elder scrolls v skyrim is the fifth edition of the popular series of roleplaying game this time the story revolves around the return to the land of the ancient race of dragons and assign us to play the role of one of the last dragon hunters the game starts with the creation of our virtual hero you can choose from ten diverse races whereas there is no division into classes with advances in play our character becomes more powerful when you go to the next level you can independently increase one of the three basic characteristics magic strength and health skill system has been divided into clear groups for example onehanded weapons or twohanded each of these categories contains specific abilities and attacks there is a new combat system that is more dynamic and also requires tactical thinking each hand hero can now assign a weapon shield or spell skyrim offers the opportunity to explore a huge virtual world which contains five major cities and hundreds of the underworld in order to facilitate getting around such a large area the authors have introduced the option of traveling between locations we can also modify our game through various addons created by the community to summarize the game has quite an interesting story it is well optimized has a very good soundtrack and a huge world to explore during the game i spent many wonderful hours exploring the provinces of skyrim my final rating is 910

paid mods made current saves unplayable as we now have to give money to continue the game with the mods that were already installed or make a start a new game and lose countless invested hours i cant support this especially since its just a test for future bethesda game i dont want them releasing even buggier games and recieving money from modders that always fix their games

what can i say thats not already been said by everyone else with paid mods it can only go downhill from here

with the move to support paid modding i can no longer recommend this game aside from the issues inherent in giving modders merely 25% of revenue and only that after they acrue $100 of payout and forcing modders to irrevocably sign away rights to their own work this move is already creating paywalls in front of long time free mods and drastically increasing the difficulty let alone the cost of playing a modded game vanilla skyrim is a decent game with console optimized controls and menus even on pc and a very wide but shallow pool of content modded skyrim prior to the release of paid workshop content was one of the most customizable and rich experiences in modern gaming unfortuantely if the paid workshop is not scraped to experience that now would likely cost upwards of $100 of amateur coded mods many of these mods were built off of and rely on the freely provided work of others only to see both valve and unscrupulous modders abandon the community to cash in on a quick buck neither valve nor the mod developer has any contractual obligation to support any mods you purchase a game update or another mod could cause conflicts crashing your game and effectively running away with your money worse the steam workshop provides almost no useful tools to resolve such conflicts or errors on your own buyer beware

paids mods overall isnt that bad of an idea but their are lot of problems with it now >bethesda taking 45% valve taking 30% leaving 25% for the creator >literally 0 curation by valvebethesda meaning if a mod breaks your game corrupts your save file doesnt work after game patch bethesda and valve wont move a finger >stolen content from nexus posted on steam workshop >$5 weapon skins that is worse than what activision charges for cod skins at least they are professionally made and dont break the game and if they do there will likely be a fix

the game itself is without a doubt a 1010  but  the new paid mod policy is complete  i still think you should give it a go and you can still get alot of great mods for free on the skyrim nexus dear valve please stop youre kicking yourself in the balls with this new policy look gaben i understand that you need money but mods are meant to be free sigh

your paid mod  i regret buying this game
not recommended
this game had amazing potential but was released with glaring bugs and issues it used to be reasonable as there were free mods available to tailor it to perform and behave as any player wished now that any game mods and fixes from third parties are potentially for pay one cannot simply look at the price tag for this game and consider that the final price of the game i feel sorry for anyone who might buy this after 42315 when they say your experience may vary its true and possibly depends on how much you truly end up spending on the game

paid mods as of april 24th 2015 $199 for some fancy armor $499 for some fancy weather effects all of which used to free if we want to support the modders give a donate thing instead of flate rate price heck the game on sale is $499 and mods cost as much as that now hence the reason of this negative review otherwise if you dont care about mods really or paying for them this game is the best medieval rpg ive ever played and it wont be topped for a long time

donations are the way to go charging money will destroy skyrim nexus causing mods to dissapear entirely the fees will not be enough incentive for creativity with 34 of the price being taken away by steam this would only artificially raise prices and make buying mods less attractive when they have circulated for free for quite sometime valves tax rate for the mods should come down significantly so most of the revenue goes to the entrepreneuring mod authors that would give modders a break and reduce the prices to more reasonable rates and people might buy them still donations are the way to go as skyrim nexus has shown and the quality of the mods are far superior than that of the workshop many of the workshop mods first being posted in the nexus skyrim is only great with mods but the pricing of these mods would discourage people from buying it the old system was better when modders creativity attracted people to buy the full game

i enjoyed this game on release despite the bugs however its final patch left the game in a nearly unplayable state with the simple sentiment of let mods fix it and mods do fix it i would not recommend this game as the modding community slowly dies out from the new paid mod scam the one thing that kept this game relevant for so long will evaporate into thin air

whos fault it it now the ones that make the game the providers of said game or the people that play it you people at valve and bathesda the people responsible stop this bull right now you are not fooling us and because of your shenanigans i give this game now a negative review you made this you fracking fix it now

based on its merits i would have once recommended this game based on its base content and modability however due to valve and bethasdas policies were you a have to pay for some mods and they b can cost more than the actual game i dont recommend that you buy it edit you can still use sites like the nexus for free mods however

paying for mods that helps the modder right well no considering that bethesda is taking 45% of revenue only 25% to the modder who actually does all the work and 25% to valve which contrarily to public opinion isnt bad since they have to maintain the workshop great game but bethesda seems to have forgotten that modders made the port to pc for them basically and we as a community can not forgive it paid mods are stupid since a mod can break your game or just arent worth it 1 $ for a weapon reskin thanks but no thanks if they wanted to support the modders a donation button or a slider similar to humblebundles one would have been more than enough

this reveiw is being published to say that the new workshop is not well thought out i mean paying for mods is like paying for something you dont like when you tried it out my second reason is that what if someone buying skyrim only has enough money for the game and they got the game just to play the mod that they wanted to try out for so long and its why they bought the game then if they finaly get the money what if its not what they expected when valve gets rid of this new feture i will take this reveiw down

35 hours in total is enough to give my review rating 1010 the elder scrolls v skyrim is a massive open world rpg game with hours and hours of gameplay and is a very fun game i have been playing for a long time and i love it the best rpg out there right now you are a dovakhiin or dragonborn in mortal language you have the power to eat the very souls of dragons but dragons arent the only threat of skyrim the province of skyrim is at civil war between the imperials and the stormcloaks jarl ulfric stormcloak the one who formed the rebellion of the stormcloaks murdered the high king with the power of the voice shouted the king apart and the imperials are hunting him down this is the greatest game in the tes series dont be put off by the elder scrolls online that was a terrible game but i can assure you grab this game and you wont be disappointed buggy there are a set of mods named the unofficial patches which fix many bugs and aim to at some point fix them all however i cannot recommend this game why yesterday valve through this whole game down the drain paid mods its awful nothing could have ruined this game more get it on console guys

not recommended
so you have to get this right skyrim a game full of bugs was modded by the community to run bug free every dlc not even the high res pack was without bugs all of this was done by the community not by bethesda nor valve now valve comes with the idea let us charge money for mods on steam workshop they take 75% of the price the modder asks for the money while they do not take any responsibility since it is all at your own risk right oh if you get screwed then you can make a polite post on the item for the modder now that is nice dont you think pls valve get cancer die and  off

[i still thumbs up for the game theres nothing wrong about skyrim but the workshop system is totally disaster] read below for updated details old review beautilful unique and charming skyrim provides better experience of this rpg openworld series beside the main quest and radiant sidequest which can surprise you in different events pretty genuis scripts and storyline lead you to new places new conflicts and dragons as random encounter the level system is not new but it has improvement and design places are full of mysteries activites and npcs lifefull indeed smithing and enchanting are deep and impact to your combat as magics and shouts are balanced and provide new tactics i could say im in love with this fifth series even some people may face with minor bugs for me it just minor graphic bugs now inventory system is hard to track fix by using skyrim ui mod and problem in ai direction all i say it just common thing in this kind of game which cant interrupt you from amazing experience totally worthy in every dollarbaht you paid whatever you are fan of series or not try once in your owned  updated 2642015 valve and bethesda just apply pay for mod to support the modders however the execution is terrible theres no guarantee that your paid mod will run without conflict or its update can break your game or not and you actually dont have time to check the error within 24 hrs before you decide to refund what if the modder abandones current mod where 75% of valvebethesda share is going the modder dont get paid until youve sold $400 from based mod read carefully about payout and earn why valve dont implement optional donation becuase its illegal to cut from donation and valve is guarunteed for money there are many ways to support modder beside using cash the steam workshop is used to be share of free stuff and mod with tight community now it becomes to microtransactionlike workshop it doesnt mean that hardworking modders shouldnt deserve money as support but the current rules and implementation are totally wrong and create misunderstanding of mods for now the game is still a great rpg but i cant recommend to steam workshop think harder valvebethesda im seriously worry about the future of modding where your next generation have to pay for modaddons even the game quick fix if the system still continue and become market standard updated 2842015 valve and bethesda decided to remove payment feature from skyrim workshop im really appreciated for your decision and thank you for listening our feedback not to go worse therere many other ways to support modder and im looking for your new implementation

the one thing that made skyrim shine for me was the fact the it used to be a great platform for mods no more i strongly dislike the dlcmicrotransaction trend and now modding has been dealt a death blow people that still have free mods out there will have to make the switch to paid mods or remove existing ones just so other people wont take credit for their work and make money of it as well some simply might not make any more new content and people wonder why piracy still exists if anything this makes it more tempting later edit skyrim paid mods have been removed but ill keep the negative review as a reminder

recently vavle introduced the feature to pay for mods while this isnt an inherently bad feature as high effort projects such as total conversions in my opinion could justify charging 23$ the way it is implemented 75% etc and the way it has been handled deletion of donation links and suppression of dissenting opinions etc is unforgivable

without free mods this game would have been fun for a week at best hardly worth my money compared to other titles on the steam market that offer hundreds more hours this whole thing is a train wreck and could have been implimented far better instead theyve managed to tear apart a community by introducing a major variable into a system that was not presently there the chaos that resulted could have been seen a mile away there is also no incentive to not go down the path mobile platforms have with core gameplay improvements through modification sold piecemeal for maximum profit thanks valve bethesda for bringing one of the worst aspects of mobile gaming to the pc

tldr read bottom conclusion  the elder scrolls arena astonished gamers everywhere when it was released on the old dos system quite a few years back it is today and likely will remain the biggest game world ever concieved and with an ever growing series it continues to get even bigger and when tesii daggerfall hit stores it introduced an entire new line of rpg housing a rebalanced skill system reputaion and faction systems and much more and not many could have predicted the arrival of tesiii morrowind which brought a whole new batch of ideas into play tesiv oblivion took off from morrowind with a different setting and characters more polished combat and more immersion then tesv skyrim was released after many years of development after that the entire world of gaming changed it employed all of the previous games lore gameplay and systems but then removed alot of the restrictions it contained it took ideas from other landmarks in gaming history such as profitable dungeon delving crafting house owning and buisness running marriage adoption assassination the no witnesses idea duel weild combat and so much more freedom became a whole new word in gaming vocabulary become a werewolf slay dragons assassinate polititians murder housewives rob robbers slay giants everything you could have asked for in a dungeons and dragons tabletop rpg on screen with nothing but consequences to hold you back not a violent type become a travelling trader who consorts with bards and other caravans a mage join the college of winterhold and contact the sigic order ranger my personal favorite camp out in the forest and hunt animals and alchemy ingridients thief join the thieves guild for jobs and so much more including vampire hunting a part of the beastly companions faction be an assassin save the world from exextinct dragons eat a full fledged meal get the girl and be home in time for sweet rolls listen to me ramble on the best way to describe this game is to list every ing thing this game has to offer and hope to not bore your reader if youre still reading this youve either already bought the game and are bored and so you look for good reveiws youre an idiot who after reading many many reveiws still hasnt found the incentive to buy this game or youre a concerned parent who is looking for reasons to restrict their child from playing it and then theres mods i myself thought that i would never mod this game boy was i wrong ive never had this much fun playing skyrim till i modded it though my advise is to keep it lorefriendly  conclusion im not much of the reveiwing type but being a writer i figured id at least throw a good one out there to express my love for this game the music the immersion the storyline the freedom it makes a game that no other could ever match i played this for countless hours on the 360 console and im glad i got it on pc too my advice dont get this directly from steam buy a physical copy of the elder scrolls anthology its the cheapest plus you get all 5 games save for redguard and battlespire all dlc for all games and five printed maps morrowind oblivion and skyrim can be redeemed on steam with a packaged code thats what i did and i do not regret it get the game download nexus mod manager to make modding easier plus steam also has a workshop for it become anything become all fus ro dah dovahkiin httpyoutuberjtof8ic528

you want to turn mods into paid dlc microtransactions prepare to suffer the consequences it pains me to do this but i cannot stand by while valve and bethesda among others i am sure drive a stake deep into the heart of pc gaming this game the developers valve and the modders who go along with this are dead to me this will turn modders and regular gamers against eachother and this is classic divide and conquer by developers steam workshop was sadly used as a trojan horse of sorts this was the plan from the very beginning will enrich valve and greedy devs off the backs of the community all while being advertised as a new way to help content creators when it does nothing of the sort rip pc gaming if this is allowed to stand

wasnt that bad until they released a premium paid mod subscription early access season pass for $30 and then all the mods got taken down due to all being slapped with dmca notices couldnt complain about it on the forums either as i didnt have the $999 deluxe steam forums support pass i guess ill just sit here and deal with the free mods out right now not so bad as i only have to close about 50 popups asking me to donate or purchase them on the workshop whoops one of my save files got corrupted i better pay for the $299 corruption fix mod and while im here the $599 starter gold pack for 250 gold seems like a pretty good deal and oh hey a mod based off another mod that requires 3 other paid mods to get it working for a grand total of $5999 sounds pretty neat good thing i got this game on sale for $5 haha steam sales are so great and i saved so much

one of the strongest driving points of skyrim is its modding now that bethesda and valve has teamed up undermine a lot of the efforts of the modding community already back by really horrible valve customer support its only natural that this is going to lead to abuse and exploiting with people already trying to figure out how to steal content and resell it as well as stepping on a multitude of legal issues this feels less like a community driven effort and more of a big business decision for maximizing profit this is shameless and i dont recommend anyone to support this game further until valve has come forward to explain why they would go in such a radical direction

current review from may 2nd 2015 i am updating my review due to the changes valvebethesda have made to the paid mod fiasco because of this recent event it has occurred to me that reviews of games should be about what the game itself offers and not what the community cancould offer so having said that i cannot recommend skyrim at full price because the game is full of bugs issues and reeks of being a blatant console port there are glaring issues that still havent been fixed for the past three and a half years the game has currently been available on both consoles and pcs but of course the modding community has fixed these problems on pc however the game at its core is great and is totally worth it at a discounted price but keep in mind that the game isnt as fleshed out as recent installments in the past some people refer to this issue as consolitis so if youre a fan of morrowind andor oblivion youll probably be disappointed with the vanilla skyrim experience but will be more than surprised with mod variety if youre a new player to the rpg genre and have never played a elder scrolls game before youll definitely fall in love with this one but be warned that trying to go back and playing the older elder scroll games might leave you with a bad taste in your mouth because of how dated those games are so id recommend going back and trying to play morrowind or oblivion first so you can enjoy those great games and then come back and enjoy skyrim outdated review from april 25th 2015 skyrim is an amazing game and is definitely worth the full amount and is a must buy at a discounted price however due to recent events of valvebethesda having the bright idea of allowing community made mods to be sold on the steam workshop has changed my view of the game entirely as of right now i cannot recommend this game while the current workshop system is in place i also do not recommend buying other bethesda games until this change has been reversed and mind you this is coming from a huge bethesda fan that has been playing bethesda games since morrowind on the original xbox id also like to note that this is not a kneejerk reaction as some people like to claim since this system has been put in place some modders have shown their true colors of greed by refusing to update their free mods and other people stealing free mods from 3rd party sites and selling them on the workshop while valvebethesda turn a blind eye money has corrupted the modding community and valvebethesda are to blame do not support this system as it only hurts the modding community and will more than likely hurt future games like tesvi and fallout 4

day 1 this game sure looks nice theres justso much to do i mean the maps all over they expect me to actually walk to each place theres barely any quest markers i dont know where the hellscrew it im going to walk in that direction and see what i find day 5 hey this games starting to flow a bit now the quest system is starting to make sense its kind of fun to wander about and explore these random caves and what not plus my toon looks pretty cool with this helmet with the big horns sticking out day 10 im uhim not sure but i think my wife may be angry with me i told her i was going to go play some more skyrim she said fine whatever im going to be hope im not spending too much time with the game i cant help it though now that i figure out how the quests and exploration works it all feels pretty good i think im going to play with some graphics mods that realism mod sounded kind of cool day 15 how in the hell do i have 110 hours played in this game already that cant be right i didnt think i was playing that much then againi havent seen my wife and kid for a few days now that i think about it i uhmaybe i should go check on that make sure theyre okay ill go just as soon as im done forging these iron daggers day 20 my new wife lydia becons me back to to breezehome ive been gone so long the dragon of north summit is no longer so it is time to return i feel sorrow for leaving her and the children alone as the war with the stormcloaks rages on around us but i am dragon born and i have a duty to keep tamriel safe from the scaled death that soars high in our snowy skies day 50 i was once an adventurer like you then i took an arrow to the knee

paid mods that alone should be enough of a reason why this game sucks that having been said the combat is lame and there are games that do everything this does but far better buy the witcher 1 and 2 instead

skyrim review story skyrim is set after the events of oblivion the game itself takes place in skyrims land a civil war between stormcloak and the imperial legion the story begins with the jailed guy who escaped and take a journy to nearby riverwood the guy gone to a fight with a dragon with whiteruns guards after they killed it the played guy absorbed the dragons blood because he has the ability to absorb blood guards got shocked by that absorption the player  guy is the dragonborn the history of dragons and more gameplay the elder scrolls v skyrim is an action roleplaying game can be playable either a first or thirdperson but mainly firstperson skyrims genre rpg action and adventure but maily rpg its pretty rare to see an impressed griping rpg skryim is not a normal rpg nor action its an exceptional pretty rare to see rpg and action the game itself will have been taken from you more than 100 hours i already have reached to almost 100 hour and atleast havent reached at 45% its so so so big game that nobody can expect its lengh expect for the main story its short speakin generally 350 hour means 60% of the game pretty sure last word time killer graphics story awesome gameplay is better than the story and graphics is the head of skyrim or skyrims skill why the graphics is the best of skyrim beautiful environment beautiful shadow effects the appropriate atmosphere specially in a combat everything you have seen in uncharted 1 2 and 3 youll find better than uncharteds environment head of graphics bethesda labeled correctely not incorrectely even in low feels pretty good feels in high comparing it to some masterpiece sounds skyrims sounds is the opposite of reality which means imagination that really didnt work hit the floor feels shredding cotton or wool mostly every single sound feels shredding not neat that is the first negative in the game doesnt feel happy or something feels bad hit a person feels an electronic thing has blow away all i can say good but still very very veryx10 not neat music fus ro dah fighting a dragon a track plays to change your reaction effects into excited when bored in playing a track plays to change your boredom effects absorbing a dragon soul makes civilians shocked and the player too from the awesome happiness every track can change your affects and makes you wonder why singers wouldnt make those emotional tracks skyrims tracks pretty rare to see pretty rare to find pretty rare to effect your emotional feeling pretty rare to find better pretty rare to everything you could ever feel free to ask for the verdict the elder scrolls iv oblivion took game of the year before the elder scrolls v skyrim took game of the year 2011 for me its prettyx10 rare to give a game a 10 out of 10 sence all the games that i have been playing it skyrim is the best rpg game i have ever played fallout 3 took a 10 out of 10 in my personal opinion just 3 game took a 10 out of 10 in every rpg game i dont spend more than 50 hours i just have spend my more than 50 hours in borderlands 2 and skyrim the best three rpg games of my entire are final fantasy 7 fallout 3 and borderlands 2 but skyrim is very very very away better than all of them skyrim is a brilliant game and time killer or waster skyrim is one of the very best games of the entire history youll never forget the experience and everything the best method of modifying describing and visualizing it is play it story 9510 gameplay 9510 graphics 9510 sounds 710 music 1010  positives side missions can make a big storyawesome leveling up systemgreat story350 hours means 60% of the game so big gametraining a skill can cause alot of timemusic matters in the gameplay reactionnobody can find better than this rpg game just rpggives you the freedom to explorewar battles are pretty funawesome dragons combat  negatives still bugy and glitchyou might get stick in a spotnot neat soundspretty easy to cheatisnt easy to learn for some people skyrim the best youll find mustplay if you hate rpg games so this will change your opinion and if you love so you are missing something pretty awesome either play it or regret that you havent played it last word in my review just play it 9210 amazing httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvjsrtypnron0 recommended price $2999 games are similar to it fallout 3 and new vegas bioshock in the hand of magic the witcher far cry 3

after 750 hours invested and many more to go the elder scrolls skyrim the one game that time itself was lost to in is immersive world and storyline is a great game however while skyrim is great its story at times is generic when compared to the grand storytelling of biowares mass effect dragon age and cd projects red witcher the characters while great are few to remember as the voice actors and actressess are reused on multiple characters with little to no difference in voice for example balgruf the jarl of whiteruns voice actor is the same voice actor for hadvars uncle after 200 hours this becomes quite noticable but does not entirely take away from the game the world is huge and deep in quests in my 750 hours many will ask me what ive accomplished i will say little in comparison to what skyrim and the modding community has to offer the men and women both young and old are owed as great deal of gratiitude due to the content that have added countless upon countless hours of content to skyrim when asked by the everyday gamer which version of skyrim should i get pc or console 98 out of 10 gamers will say pc for the mods alone this speaks greatly of the modders impact to the elder scrolls v skyrim skyrim has been out for 3 years now and i feel is is getting only better with each mod released in my experience ive had invested 400 hours in skyrim on the xbox 360 and switched to the pc some time ago with the additonal 750 on pc within those hours 300 to 400 hours went into testing mods and with each new week of mods releasing i still find myself going for more both skyrim nexus and skyrim workshop are great places to look for mods granted for new modders out there it is quite known in the skyrim community that while the mods offered are great on skyrim nexus there are dark corners of the site where mods of various types are avaliable but this is in no way disrepecting the modders of those mods but making it known of the existence of them steam workshop is more safe but even then a few mods from nexus will show up but only as safe for work in short if looking for mods to add to your skyrim i suggest staying in the safe for worksafe for home areas on skyrim nexus and even skyrim workshop if feeling abit more for a mature take on skyrim then the dark corners of skyrim nexus may work but something i myself would not recommend in conclusion when skyrim is not modded it recieves a 945 out of 10 when modded a 99 out of 10 a perfect 10 would be there if not for a few glitches here and there that can sometimes be game breaking to the point of starting a new playthrough

the elder scrolls v skyrim field rating 9 graphics 9 about graphics skyrim is a beautiful game made even more beautiful by the extremely active modding community the engine was a wonderful leap from the previous engine we saw in oblivion and the fallout series the details in the environments are wonderful reminders of just how intricate the world really is gameplay 9 about gameplay skyrim lives up to its elder scrolls name granting us the freedom to craft our own story in a gigantic world where you can spend hours simply exploring the combat has seen a huge improvement since the days of oblivion with the ability to dualwield chaning up gameplay styles wonderfully the physics however are still as wonky as ever sometimes with hilarious results you wont get tired of wandering around this world story 9 about story enough interest to drive you forward and plenty of lore to keep you distracted skyrim finds the wonderful balance of permeating the world with the story yet giving you the freedom to advance the plot when you wish multiplayer no depressingly no replayability 9 the only thing that will stop you from coming back to skyrim for awhile is completely burning yourself out but then the cycle repeats overall 910 being a long time elder scrolls fan skyrim was a welcome breath after the much loved much played oblivion the freedom the scope and the environment are great the graphics are beautiful though none of the elder scrolls since morrowind have yet captured the full extent of the magic that made morrowind so great skyrim has been a huge push in the right direction a must buy for any rpg or openworld gaming fan

this is my first foray into the elder scrolls series though i bought oblivion and morrowind and will get around to exploring those eventually i played a little of morrowind but not enough to form an opinion yet so far its neato its one of the most beautiful games ive ever played and the music is gorgeous and haunting ive sunk many hours into this game but i still havent completed the main questline ill get around to it eventually but theres so much to do and see that it doesnt matter im thinking i should increase the difficulty a bit its easy to cheese everything if you choose blacksmithing enchanting and alchemy the combat overall could be better however there are many many mods that fix the games flaws and add all sorts of wonderful things do you want to add more immersion well there are survival mods that affect the food you eat how deeply the cold influences your behavior and how you attack if you dont like something get a mod that changes it if you need a desert island game this one is it due to its endless replay value

amazing game with an amazing open world an amazing variety of items an amazing background story and amazing stunning gameplay i highly recommend it for any rpg fan with more than 20 hours of endurance for games you can easily spend 200 hours in exploring things crafting items discovering new places customize your character and many other things but be warned if youre one of those fast paced players with no patience for such games dont play it also i recommend playing the other elder scrolls games or gathering some background information because youll understand way more of the story and the world of tamriel if you do so one of the best western rpgs ever made play it for gods sake

this game is by far my most played game in my library it is a very fun game that has a great workshop community very much worth the time

base game the game is pretty good lots of content but i feel that the combat could have been better it feels like your attacks never really connect with the enemy and its like it swings right through them storywise it was terrible i never once was interested in the story especially when fallout new vegas did such a good job in writing a few years back controls are solid with the mouse and keyboard and audio is good with some great music graphically it looks okay but there are a ton of things that could have been improved on if we compare both vanilla skyrim and fallout new vegas i would prefer to play new vegas however if you somehow dont own skyrim buy it right now my review above is extremely brief assuming 99% of pc players have played skyrim if you dont let me tell you why its a must buy one simple word mods skyrim has thousands of mods to improve pretty much everything from graphical enhancements companions quests weapons spells armor monsters town improvements ui player created homes and even complete climate overhauls you name it and it will more than likely be there the game already has hundreds of hours contentwise and you can even furthur that my game looks amazing with excellent textures and lighting that make it look like nextgen i have spell mods that enhance the mage combat i added over 250 spells into my game to use on my foes i downloaded enhanced blood making blood look extremely realistic and satisfying when you slice someone open i have added quests and have made the main towns look much more lively with the enhanced towns mod the combinations are endless skyrims vanilla is good but it can be turned into one of the best games you will ever experience if you pick your mods correctly pros loads of content fantastic atmospheric world tons of locations that add variety outstanding music and voice acting intense combat stunning graphics customizable controls replay value is insane mods mods and more mods cons poor ui weak main story skyrim vanilla 710 skyrim w mods 1010

the game itself was as many other poeple said very fun all the content of the vanilla game isnt enough to keep me interested and on my toes about it certain mods that i got from the nexus site gave me what i was looking for cheskos frostfall and wearable lanterns persied9s realistic needs and diseases dragonsongs hunterborn heck even an unoffical patch by unoffical patch project team fixes most bugs that bethesda didnt care to all of these add life and meaning to the game make me feel like theres more to skyrim than just back and forth fast travel now youre telling me that i am to pay for bethesdas lack of ingenuity and creativity i dont think so i agree with the masses to have a donate button where we can donate any amount pleased and 100% of the donation goes to them for people who dont know the pay4mods policy makes it where 25% of the proceeds go to the mod creator and the other 75% to valve this is absolutely rediculous people looking for a money will tell people who go to the nexus that this is a steam workshop exclusive thank goodness nexus still listens to the community and doesnt charge for mods although i would normally recommend this game and tell you to go get mods to fill in the holes i highly recommend against it as this option is no longer availble due to valves moneylust i intend to download no more mods until this issue gets resolved you have no pity from me people who create mods and put it on the steam workshop no pity and to valve my utter disappointment for ever stooping so low to earn money may this game rest in peace for it is going to die very quickly

alas poor skyrim i must have hardly knew you after playing skyrim on console for 200 hours i was recommended to get it for pc as modding changed the way the game could be played so i rasied over 1500 to get a top notch pc to play it on that was a year ago and after reasiling how good and strong the modding community was i thought this game was one of the best that id ever played im a heavy fan of oblivion thou and after a long break from pc gaming in general i returned to find this its just sad that one of the last forms of free and kind forums is getting snuffed out of existance by cheap capitolism may as well get the rest of the games students in the sweatshop to make weapon reskins and sell them for 020 each as clearly the game has gone to  may as well make some ing money from it i hear blender is getting mentioned quite alot on the main steam page guess anyone can make money from anything so lets see how good steams quality control is

bethesda and valve have teamed up and used this game to monetize and break the best thing pc gaming had modding they contacted some dota modders with zero idea of skyrim modding paid them to make a couple  models and put them for sale then they contacted a bunch of known skyrim modders with zero legal knowledge made them feel important and scammed them just see the control chesko had left over his mods they thought they were the important modders the big prize while being nothing but the bait for the rest of modders to bite and to accept the 25% theyd get this movement takes content and patch releasing to a whole new level because now developers have the incentive of releasing broken empty games and wait for modders to fix and fill them while getting a on of money from it while its the modders responsibility to keep the mod working and up to date and to deal with the angry costumer this movement has destroyed the feel free to use just give credit thinking as free mods may depend on paid mods hello skyui and viceversa it has also made people take down from here and the nexus their mods fearing they will be ripped and uploaded as paid content by someone else oh and valve wants us to make sure that doesnt happen they wont even check them theyll be too busy counting money and coming up with some other way of hurting their community this is the worst move ive seen in the gaming history valve and bethesda youre now on pair with ea and ubisoft congratulations i hope you make a lot of money with this because i wont pay a cent more for any of your games dont give them even more money donate if you feel like you want to support the one that made some mod you like dont pay for mods ever

paid mods are the worst thing that has happened to the pc games industry in a long time and bethesdas support of these practices is indefensible if i could go back in time and not buy this game i would the 130 odd hours i put into this game were not nearly enjoyment enough to make up for this they should be ashamed of themselves and we as consumers must not stand for this

the game itself is good but be warned you have to pay for certain usercreated mods whats next lets not support this madness by voting with our wallets

i really enjoy the game if it is the base game that you want i recommend if you are into modding it be aware of the paid mods there will still be free mods but not for long this causes me to downvote the game they are getting greedy and make us pay for what should be free as it always has been

valve is pulling a horrible move by introducing paid mods it will damage the modding community and pit them against each other where cheerful cooperation had been the norm a very very fun game with one of the best modding communities outside of steam ever i actually have never finished the storyline and just get lostemerged in the world

what can i say about skyrim it is a game with lots of potential most of it unrealized thankfully the modding community helps the game be all it can be and more that is until bethesda and valve decided to wreck the modding community with paid mods i have been through about 1000 mods in my time with skyrim i cannot imagine how much money that would have cost me had they been paid mods actually i know exactly how much it would cost me $0 i am sad to see what is most likely the end of a thriving mod community

valve has failed us all do not buy this game or the mods for it

one of the things that kept skyrim going and relevant for so many years was it modding community considering the fact that the mods are behinds a paywall now  you shouldnt buy skyrim you would now have to pay for skyrim  the mods tolerable your money is better spent on newer games instead of trying to fix this with paid mods

i had written a review previously for this game stating that it was a rather good game but made exceptional by the modding community now bethesda and valve have betrayed myself and the entire fanbase by monetising mods for their own twisted interests this is a destruction of a once superb game this is why i am down voting this game now because i want to see them burn for their reckless actions toward their very own fans they have heaped up the funeral pyres now allow me to light it if youre reading this review and own this game i urge you to write a negative review too allow this fire to spread and amalgamate into a great blaze if youre reading this because youre interested in purchasing the game then do not this game has began its fall and fall it will very far indeed

a halfdecegame whose only redemption is the plethora of free thirdpartycontent to remedy the otherwise buggy halffinished soulless and lackluster world now with microtransactions to purchase said thirdpartycontent where the suits keep 70% to 100% of the profit for doing 0% of the work apart from the buggy inconsistent halfworking mess of a distribution system that is the steam workshop worse still the thirdpartycontent has no quality control no checks to prevent theft and sale of others work or any kind of a guarantee that the content will actually work and if so continue to work once you can no longer get your money back even worse than that valvebethesda stated that this is to support the modders even though the modder only receives a maximum of 25% of profits providing that their mod accrues at least $400 of profit with those restrictions all this will support is buggy halffinished soulless lackluster content with an unreasonable pricetag to boot wait a minute that sounds familiar oh but its all optional many say in response to which i say it is for now but if you stand idly by while blatant exploitation occurs for the benefit of making a few extra bucks at the cost of tearing an entire community apart you can guarantee that things will only get worse less support for free mods mayhap perhaps even no support and this will spread to other games in the same way that pathetic dlc did do you like endorsed day 1 dlc which companies are obligated to fix if it doesnt work get ready for thirdparty day 1 dlc that will inevitably break and never be fixed due to no obligations and you wont get your money back didnt like having to wait for modders to patch bethesdas games before get ready for big companies being even more lazy in their game development because the modders will fix it for us and net us more money in the process it seems that companies want the players to develop their games for them while simultaneously paying the companies to do it tldr paid mods are the bane of one of the greatest aspects of pc gaming take dlc multiply it by hundreds or even thousands remove all quality control add an abundance of intellectual property theft remove all guarantees of functionality and compatibility and on top of that possibly and quite likely remove any chance of a free alternative with the establishment of a monopoly on thirdparty content that is purchaseonly in the future and you will have paidmods if people give even an inkling of interest in this it will spread and we will have to kiss the days of being able to fix and improve our favorite games without simultaneously exploiting our very own friends and colleagues for the benefit of faceless greedy corporations in our actions goodbye

this is by far the prettiest of the elder scrolls series to date this is not saying a whole lot considering what it is up against the gameplay is riddled with bugs and glitches that while not always game breaking do come very close the story is well thought out for most of the game but then suddenly ends the sidequests are standard brainless go here do x formulated content substitutes the overall control scheme is broken and hard to navigate with a mouse and keyboard as it was obviously ported from a console with all of that out of the way most of the shortcomings of this game were either fixed or softened by several great mods that were created i somehow doubt that the quality of content will be on par with what it has been due to this new paid mod system i cant blame valve they are in fact a company and companies are established to make money i do however hold them accountable for the soon to follow  storm of inferior cash grab mods this is right up there with some of the horible titles that the greenlight and early access cash grabs have allowed in this game is going to be shelved for now i will at least be able to say i got my moneys worth out of it before this change

as of right now i cannot recommend this game while the current workshop system is in place i also do not recommend buying other valve or bethesda games until this change has been reversed and mind you this is coming from a huge fan of both franchises skyrim is an amazing game and is definitely a must buy at a discounted price however due to recent events of valvebethesda having the bright idea of allowing community made mods to be sold on the steam workshop has changed my view of the game entirely since this system has been put in place some modders have shown their true colors of greed by refusing to update their free mods and other people stealing free mods from 3rd party sites and selling them on the workshop while valvebethesda turn a blind eye money has corrupted the modding community and valvebethesda are to blame do not support this system as it only hurts the modding community and will more than likely hurt future games like tesvi and fallout 4

the game itself was as many other poeple said very fun all the content of the vanilla game isnt enough to keep me interested and on my toes about it certain mods that i got from the nexus site gave me what i was looking for cheskos frostfall and wearable lanterns persied9s realistic needs and diseases dragonsongs hunterborn heck even an unoffical patch by unoffical patch project team fixes most bugs that bethesda didnt care to all of these add life and meaning to the game make me feel like theres more to skyrim than just back and forth fast travel now youre telling me that i am to pay for bethesdas lack of ingenuity and creativity i dont think so i agree with the masses to have a donate button where we can donate any amount pleased and 100% of the donation goes to them for people who dont know the pay4mods policy makes it where 25% of the proceeds go to the mod creator and the other 75% to valve this is absolutely rediculous people looking for a money will tell people who go to the nexus that this is a steam workshop exclusive thank goodness nexus still listens to the community and doesnt charge for mods although i would normally recommend this game and tell you to go get mods to fill in the holes i highly recommend against it as this option is no longer availble due to valves moneylust i intend to download no more mods until this issue gets resolved you have no pity from me people who create mods and put it on the steam workshop no pity and to valve my utter disappointment for ever stooping so low to earn money may this game rest in peace for it is going to die very quickly

since dlc is on the way out i guess it was inevitable that someone would try to monetize mods if the idea of supporting modders or breathing new life into skyrim is what you were hoping for then get ready for dissapointment the new payfor workshop items is a cancerous addition to steams already dimming reputation and bethesdas desperate attempts to earn a quick buck off of other peoples work modders who use the system not only see 25% of all income from it but may have their mods stolen reused or plagarized on a lawless first come first served content system valve and bethesda have mad e the decision to divide the community in half and force the community to move towards the broken steam workshop system for skyrim already theres mods removed from the nexus in either protest or in order to force users to pay for halffunctional minor mods that charge too much for what they offer no one has profited from this change and the players who wish to play skyrim the game that was idolized for its modding scene are the biggest losers in this colossal failure of a move we havent seen valve blunder this hard since greenlight first went up do not support valve or bethesda making money off other peoples work this kind of nickel and diming like preorders and dlc is what is poisoning modern gaming skyrim is only the first

my 400 hours in game ought to say something about the vastness of the game world and the wisdom of paying whatever this game currently costs to play it even in morrowind i think i never spent more than 120 hours total ive played daggerfall morrowind and now this game and the mmo beta in the franchise every time the elder scrolls takes a step forward it seems to lose some things that made me a fan of the series earlier on while expanding upon othersfor better or worse i miss the ability to buy a sailing ship to craft any sort of spell even levitation and to make any sort of class i wanted i dont like that you can simply be just about everything to everyone if you follow all the different quest lines to completion i dont like that you have to choose between two sides that suck in a war in order to enjoy certain added benefits and plotlines i find it irritating spoiler alert that the imperials should be such a bland bunch of lackeys led by someone who apparently has real virtueuntil you assasinate him while the other side seems like a good bunch of warriors led by such an uninspiring selfimportant primadonna i especially find it irritating that although you can be all things to all people in all plotlines with the one exception of being forced to choose between two equally uninspiring sides the one thing you can never be is ruler no matter what you do you can kill dragons and even emperors but you cannot do anything to become ruler of skyrim seems kind of silly to me okay so maybe skyrim would never welcome an argonian to rule over them but if were going to play the reality card well theres a lot lacking in the major plotlines in that respect i also dont like that youre forced into a few things that i find personally detestable once you initiate a given quest i wouldnt recommend letting anyone under 18 play this game either as there are too many mature moments even so with all its glaring faults this has been my favorite game in the series to date i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy rpgs

i wont be changing my review to positive now that theyve dropped the idea of making us pay set minimums for mods they need some reminder that it was a really dumb idea that and theyve likely done some lasting damage to this community i bet there are modders who were on either side of the fence of the paid mod issue that wont be coming back after this mess they didnt have to leave this nasty scar on one of the best games of its time but they did so they could get a fat chunk o cash at least valve can say they had an excuse for trying to take a 30% chunk since they host the workshop and that costs money but bethesda wanting 45% for doing absolutly nothing and acting like they were doing modders a favor just makes me want to vomit i swear companies will try to monetize anything now a days  gotten hundreds of hours of play time out of this game so id say they i got my moneys worth of enjoyment one of the best features of any of the elder scrolls series has been the open modding which has really extended the life of skyrim when many games this old have done been forgotten skyrim was still going very strong its what kept me playing long after i would have put it down for the last time but now thats come to an end bethesdas brilliant idea to profit off of thousands of people who do not work for them is just sickening their game is already a huge success because of the modders but that isnt enough now they want to try to drain money out of other peoples creativity directly this would be completely different if the money went to the modders and only to the modders where it should go the modders do not work for bethesda why should they get money for content they had no part in creating this also completely changes what the drive to mod is it goes from people doing something they love doing for a game and community they love to people trying to put as little effort in as they can to get a quick buck mods have already vanished from the steam workshop and from the nexus because the truly creative individuals are afraid their work will be ripped off and reposted by someone wanting to cash in and theyre right to be afraid of that this is the biggest blunder ive seen any aaa gaming studio make in a while now i can not support a aaa company trying to make big profits off of the modding community expecially after the huge success if their game is already attributed in large to that modding community if skyrim never had supported mods it would have been forgotten in less than a year and never would have gone on to have 3 dlcs and a legendary version rerelease so in light of these events i can not recommend this game to anyone from this day forward

now that paid mods are done with ive decided to update my review i give valve and bethesda major credit for admitting they messed up and changing their stance on this entire situation but my rating stays i am throughly disapointed in both companys for trying to cash in what was a thriving and helpful community now that community has been thourghly fractured and it is going to take a long time to repair itself if it ever does giving moders only 25% of the final profit was a sleezy move on both companys parts especially when a lot of mods attempt to fix something the developer was to lazy to do i used to dream about eventually working for bethesda as a carrer now im looking towards other companys for a dream job so unless bethesda manages to attempt to make it up to gamers with their next release i highly doubt i will be purchasing their next product

edit they have removed the paywall on mods but i aint removing my review simply because 1 this could have been avoided if they reached out to the community for feedback before trying to force this 2 going to serve as a reminder from their response seems like they might try to implement it again or in future games 3 stock game without mods is a garbage port read the review and find out why  paywall on mods paywall on mods for this console port with poor support and implementations and even game mechanics that were rushed for release and are a letdown by default like for example dragon fighting which is supposed to be the unique element of this game the mods are what fixed this game made it playable and overall made it what it isand now not only they are promoting paywalls on them as dlcs instead of donations but the modders are only gonna get 25% too they have the nerve to ask for this sowall of rant incoming first of all let me say that i as probably plenty of other people know about the extend of the problems this game has but we were willing to look away as this game has an extensive lore and storyline that is truly immersive and the modding community helped with plenty of the problems i would have never bought this game or even recommend it to anyone without the mods available with that being said and not willing to look away now i dont even know where to begin to describe how bad the stock game is the combat system is repetetive and halfway through the game nothing is challenging anymore in any aspect cause you become completely overpowered even on the highest difficulties you might be sneaking and the enemy would be pushing against you searching for you blind and without a sense of touch and at the same time you could be a tanky hulk mammoth completely dominating cause the only reason you would sneak anyway is to try and add depth to the gameplay yourself dont get me started on the dragons its like they are suicidal the biggest challenge is getting around the mentally challenged followersnpcs blocking your path with their bodybuilder stance plenty of that is fixed up with mods including the notthoughtthrough skill tree and crafting system but we aint discussing em yet we are talking about stock product now you might say well theres lots of lore to go around well yes until you get fed up from the fetching repetitive chore quests that every storyline has as its starting point til about half of its length and that means tons of loading screens even between rooms and i dont want to point fingers but its obvious its because of consolitis and that brings us to the technical part and the lack of support of this game if you remove vsync it distorts the timeline of the game and npc schedule even with the 60fps cap and if you uncap the fps beyond the 60fps limit it breaks the physics of the game not only you have to play at max 60fps but also with the atrocious input lag from vsync there are mods that help remedy the situation a bit lowering the input lag theres no fov option no proper highres textures the menus are horrible including the dialog menus in which your mouse might as well be gimmick cause apparently the game decides to select another option plenty of times instead of the one you were obviously pointing at theres no proper optimization the ultra graphics arent even that ultra since you can tweak them even more through the ini files and obviously they didnt bother enough researching about it and that stuff is just the tip of the iceberg but whatever i could beat this to death at this point what we have here is not just a console port but also lack of support in fact theres so many bugs that the modding community had to release unofficial patches to fix this mess and the dlc mess this is not a polished proper pc game with continued support from the developer but the exact opposite the only reason this game is even still relevant is the modding community now bethesdavalve see that and had the ingenious plan of promoting the mods as dlcs with paywall and only 25% of the profits will go to the modders if they truly wanted to support modders they would pay them themselves for finishing up the game at this point cosmetic mods are irrelevant by that logic mods are required to patch the game and they are putting a paywall on it as dlc and on top of that give only 25% to the ones who did the job their job also the majority of the mods require you to have a handful of other mods so you could end up breaking your bank before you even get to the cosmetics and judging by the prices you will end up paying multiple times the full price of the game mods also can break after patches or have conflicts between them but modders have no obligation to fix them but theres mods for fixing mods conflicting with other mods i cant even marketing them as dlc doesnt make any sense seriously who in their right mind thought this was a good idea the spawn of evil it would be a whole different story if it was a donation style as it already is on the community sites with 75% going to the modders when they deserve it cause they are what sells the extra copies anywayinstead of promoting a paywall but now with this attitude they want to infect also our modding community too by luring em into stealing each others work or making early access mods and flooding the workshop for a quick buck the bottom line is its promoting laziness for developers while they cash in through the work of the modders to finish their product and its not just a cashgrab but a disease which wants to spread on as many games as possible i aint gonna support this and neither should you

my review for the elder scrolls v skyrim  various races with their different abilities you can even become a cat or a lizard too you can be a boy or a gurl and im not prof oak  a lot of quests really guys maybe i can finish most of unrepeatable quests but by the time ive done that i probably spent more than 1000 hours  the map is vast a lot of point of interest and by the time you unlock every one of them your maps gonna be full and heavier duh  travel skyrim as the mighty dragonborn a warrior who can master every kind of weapons and magic and also have a dragon blood running through your veins which is nice oh and you can also shout with the dragon language so you can curse people without them understand it because two things one they literally dont understand what youre saying two theyre probably dead cuz dragon language rulez fus ro dah  even though you are destined to be the mighty dragonborn you can and you should seek parttime job you can be a blacksmith potion or poison brewer equipment enchanter whatever that is  you can join a group of mercenaries magic nerds bunch of kleptomaniacs or fraternity of murderer oh you can also become vampires or against them blade will be proud and have your own castle you have to share with your fellow hobos though  oh and you can marry too good for you forever alone  you can drag dead bodies whenever you want throw junk whenever you want and the guard still ignoring you  this game is moddable original is great with mods no question asked 910

i tend to be wordy in reviews trying to outline my thoughts be fair and also objective this will be no exception bear with me i come into rpg a total noob and what i decree here might for some prove my noobness most probably in fact as a staunch strategysim gamer of many years rpg never really interested me so my adventure into skyrim came as quite a surprise in my view despite its used by date having well and truly expired skyrim deserves some very serious accolades at nearly 100 hours played im still coming to grips that i can play this almost like a sandbox with the hearthfire dlc and just be a simple villager who relies on hunting gathering or even small levels of agriculture to sustain myself or i can be a hero as i write my level 16 char its my 3rd start ok slays dragons gargoyles and vampires he can shout an army of sword wielding skeletons into piles of bones i can wander willynilly all over the map mixing it up with bears wolves and sabretooth tigers there is so so much to do and see that without the fasttravel option or a good horse it would take hundreds of hours just to explore the map im intrigued by the depth and detail of the world and i think this will get 300400 or more hours because i have so much yet to do and see long before i get anywhere near endgame i often stop and setup my character  keeping on eye on the rule of thirds  with awesome backdrops and scenery for some holiday snaps i often walk everywhere instead of using the fast options just to soak it all in i even have some pretty amazing screenshots if i must say so as an enigma music genre fan of many years the music in the background of this is sublime it so often sets either a wonderous emotion or a sense of danger at just the right time so much so that immersion into this pixelated fantasy world is absolutely complete as i write ive finally married the lovely ysolda lydia is my steward and my poorly residence mansion at lakeview manor is looking rather stately it is disappointing that much of the furniture and fittings are nothing more than eyecandy even my long 8 seater dining room table never gets used well i dont have to eat do i for that matter even sleep appears totally optional there are quite a few other peeves too  clipping and fov can be atrocious at times trying to shoot a fast moving dragon with bow and arrow lordy lord  tight tunnels and corners where followers jam you up you cant see or they just get in the way i even killed my follower once in a fit of rage as she stood dumbly by while i was getting zapped by some dude with a cattle prod get out of my way lydia dammit i yelled one day much to the mirth of my wife my real one  inventory items id be the first to recognise penaltyreward for carrying too much stuff but given the tightness and limitations of the purses of scoundrel vendors it took buying a damned house just so i could offload my junk somewhere there is little indication of whats important early on and im carrying stuff that seems rare or difficult to acquire with unknown as its value but im hesitant to leave it behind because its just so much work to get to where i found it  if i need it  books agghhhhh somebody liked writing loads and loads of fictional  and unneccessary trivia thats for sure unless i am sadly mistaken and reaching endgame might prove this the amount of information presented is totally overwhelming i fail to see relevance in much of what is written and trying to piece it altogether into some kind of connected narrative is as good as impossible do i really need to know why edna fatgirl from farawayland abandoned her children for a mammoth or any other such trite historical reference yeah value tells me its important but nohing indicates what isnt important either somehow im supposed to read and remember it all some might say you dont need to read and remember its unimportant i say to that then why have it clutter is bad mmmk  potions spells magic scrolls too much a scroll of reasonable was needed by devs here id rather 2 or 3 gameplay critical potions and maybe 1 or 2 rarer ones but i seem to have more potions and spell options than i do weapon variations im over them tbh 20 or 30 potions of healing is all i carry the rest i dump at the local villages as i travel  missions oh my do they have to stay in the list no i do not want to an imperial or a stormcloak no i dont want to kill the crabby old orphanage maam and sure as eggs are eggs i dont want to be a vampire killer either whatever possessed them to not include a fail mission button i understand critical mission timelines etc what i dont understand why i have to find 10 bear pelts for temba widearms  who i have no interest in  just to clear it off the list even a choice to decline a mission after i get told what it is would have been better than this ugghhhh  saving naming dammit i love ysolda and i wanna kill ysolda save games would have been a great inclusion  my final gripe the opening scene oh come on esc out of movie please everytime but hey look this is going to keep my occupied for a longlong time if all other rpgs out there are even close to the depth of this work of art despite her many faults im glad i converted genres i swear allegience despite trial and adversity to herald rpg from this day forth so help me mara 910 gg

i have thousands of hours in this game i have casted it for the enjoyment of my viewers for four years and will no longer do so because of the behavior of the modders the actions of bethesda and valve and will not support it any further it is not a mere matter of paying for mods but the percentages the policies the realities of buisness that valve did not inform the initial modders of and more that have disuaded me from this situation especially egregious are the words of several prominent modders who have said that its just money and that there is no community after openly declaring they have only returned to the scene for profits i hope that in the future bethesda and valve rework this system and do not leave it to languish in the hopes of earning pennies where they could have created a new vibrant branch of the modding community let it be known yes you have lost a paying customer and an active advertiser of your work both bethesda and modders

skyrim certainly had a lot to love up to after the wonderful experience that was oblivion after playing over 100 hours i can safely say that it lives up to it and then some skyrim is a stunning open world rpg with so much to do and so many places to see the class and race variety is really deep so that you can play with pretty much any style you like the theme of the place is mostly snow but there are a lot of different themes too with some of the nice green landscapes that we liked from oblivion if you decide to just wander off somewhere you will always run into a new place with something to do the main quest can be brief if you just follow this but the side quests really open things up and add to the whole skyrim experience overall i loved the game and would put it in the must play section would run into whiterun and kill all the people just for the lulz again 1010

the storyline of elder scrolls v if you choose to follow it is well written and well told for fantasy rpg dragons which the nords had thought to be extinct are terrorizing the tamriel province of skyrim once again and its up to you and your unique powers to find out why of course there are plenty of other storylines and roles to play within skyrim you can choose to live as thief an assassin a knight aspiring mage or you can be all of those things at the same time you can completely ignore the storyline find the horse and explore the world and face its dangers at your own pace the elder scrolls iv oblivion launched on march 2006 which was very early in the xbox 360s lifecycle skyrim launches on november 2011 which was consoles generations twilight years it is impressive to see graphical leaps that had been made the scope of the map the detail of the terrain the intricacies of the characters and the monster models and defined craftsmanship that went into every sword shield spell and piece of armor is astounding a lot of love and care clearly when making into this game however no game is perfect and skyrim holds true to that one of the few complains i have about the game is that some of the textures are strangely low resolution and they popout of the player were they are present which is sad because it temporarily pulls you out off the game in terms of gameplay this is the most streamline elder scrolls game today i use the term delicately since streamline is often synonymous with dumb down when describing videogames that is not the case in skyrim well a good number of spells has seen the axe everything else has gotten an overhaul it needed the dual wielding system is fantastic for combat you can now hold two weapons two different spells or weapon and the spell in each hand the combat itself is very satisfying is because they added a finishing moves that are suretoplease sneaking is always an option for the stealthy at hard difficulties skyrim has done away with repair hammers but in their place they implemented forging skill which is by in far a superior system enchanting has seen some tweaks as well but all in all both are great diversions for the average dragon hunter the music is phenomenal the voice acting is head and shoulders above the rest of the elder scrolls series i am very happy to see and hear some familiar faces and voices battling your first dragon is an adrenaline rush that you havent felt long time in gaming elders scrolls v skyrim isnt just videogame its my vacation dream come true but its not all the gorgeous vistas and claustrophobic spelunking the introduction sequence barely does the game any justice in fact is a little drawn out tediously in order to create a new character youll need to go thru it every single time you arent simply drop into a world like you are in morrowind despite of the presence of the dragons chasing you its not nearly as exciting as oblivions introduction heres hoping that there is a patch will be put out allowing you to customize your character again before you leave the final cave so you can create a save file just before that moment and affectively skip the introduction considering this feature was present in oblivion and fallout games it is curious that is missing the menu system is abysmal especially on the pc oblivions menu system was a bit overly chaotic and hard to manage but this is somehow worse in time you overcome this obstacle but it would be great it was hindrance in the first place if you are going to pick up skyrim and i absolutely recommend you do i haul hardly push you getting a pc version there are already a large handful of fantastic mods available to customize your skyrim experience skyrim should truly be experience by everyone even you dont think you are fan of fantasy rpgs this open world has too much to discover skyrim is easily one of the greatest games for the past twenty years with mod support in place skyrim will likely beyond everyones hard drive for years to come

fus ro dah skyrims known as a masterpiece of this age thats pretty much common knowledge and it is the elder scrolls in general is a very good series and you can immerse yourself in it for days morrowind was great but many many people had problems with the game being slow and many claim for it to be the last hardcore game of the series oblivion was praised yes but oblivion the fourth game in the series had a serious disease in it that kept many people from being properly immersed the specific skills you had to pick and had to focus on throughout the rest of the game its much like a class but a custom one it doesnt work for oblivion because of howfree the series is skyrim has arguably no flaws in it ive yet to come across a single crash that didnt result by my own error in putting down mods nor have i had any immersionbreaking moments this game even without the famous unofficial patches is still very much playable and i enjoyed my first 80 unmodded hours of the game once i grabbed some mods that the community made and a overhaul that one man worked on for over 1000 hours ive fallen in love yet again with the game games that require you to have mods so it stays alive like minecraft for example doesnt live strongly in my opinion skyrim doesnt have that case what can you do in skyrim well you can waltz into a town shout a chicken off into a river then get pummeled by people with maces run like a  run into a cave find that sweet sweet glass war axe run back to that town slaughter everyone make a child homeless adopt that child build a house join a vampireslaying community join the theives guild get married  slay a ing dragon absorb its soul then shout in their language which causes you to shout ice read a damn good book about red eagle then travel to his lair slay the guy then grab a crossbow enchant it and call it the dismantler  get travel companions join a civil war crisis become a legendary hero or an infamous badass catch fish like a boss be a master wizard of the arts of blowing  up be one sneaky  or just go chop heads off to space then shout at their corpse giggling as you watch it fly ride ing dragons and then if youre still bored mods oh god the mods dont like how the stealth system works just grab a overhaul patch you have more than you think to choose from want to fish havesex have an alternate start say  no to the lockpicking system and get a pro version more books morrrrrrrrrreeee books entire questlines made by fans of skyrim or you can just make it and i still have things to say the story of skyrim has two different main storylines and hundreds of side stories to get involved in people will love you or hate you depending on what you do if youre a thief and a assassin in the respective guildsyou will be very very infamous in fact so much so that if a guard tries to apprehend you you can scare them into not arresting you the civil war crisis and the dragons return crisis you can pick and choose between every quest you can always go back and continue on it later hell you dont even have to do the main questlines ive still yet to get around to even getting them halfway done and the civil war crisis has two sides to pick from once you choose the only way to see the other questline is to replay the game and pick the other side and even if you completely ignore those two storylines you still have hundreds of hours of gametime to go through and the dlc get it get it all they are all worth it i actually have only one minor complaint about skyrim but honestly its actually small for me they could have used more voice actors for each race now that might sound bad for immersion but the actors do so well in voicing their lines its easy to forgive honestly skyrims one of the few games that i truely believe to be perfect that rating for me stands with unthinkable natural law final fantasy crystal chronicles and epic battle fantasy 4 story 1010 this is one game you need to read its lore within the game and pay attention to whats going on around you solid masterpiece music 910 i sometimes forget the music is there but i think thats because they blend too well with the game combat 8510 once i got a few overhaul patches and the dance of death mod its a perfect 1110 content 1010 this is one of those games that even at the average 60$ price tag of aaa games today is still a steal the dlcs just make this already expansive game even bigger overall rating to be fair i think a 9210 will suffice my last words to you by reading this you are now krii lun ausd marked for death es

the game is not enjoyably played without mods and yet as youve probably heard theyre now behind a lovely paywall while one can argue that this supports modders the extremely small cut taken by the actual modders who make the mods means that it costs you a lot of money and they get chump change while valve and bethesda walk away with all the money i cannot support this practice in any form so i would say do not get skyrim until this issue has been fixed get oblivion or fallout or something instead i say

i loved this game and have spent hundreds of hours both playing it and modding it the recent issues with bethesda primarily and valve attempting to monetize mods has been so poorly done that it leaves me with a bad feeling associated with skyrim bethesda and valve whilst i think allowing modders to receive some money payment for their hard work if you appreciate it is fundamentally a good thing bethesda and skyrims implemtation of the paid mods system destroys the very community spirit of sharing and helping that produces great mods it instead promotes stealing theft single developers producing simple forgettable mods im sure what we all want to see is large mods with lots of content that fit seamlessly into the tamriel game world which takes a large amount of shared assets and collaboration something that is very very difficult to monetise the only reason that skyrimmorrowindfallout 3fallout nvoblivion still sell after all this time is because of mods and bethesda decided that making money from an extended life cycle from modding hobbyists wasnt enough that also wanted 45% of mod sales from your hobby time really disgusting  i suggest buying your games from gogcom from now on and possibly modding in redkit

if i had been making this review last week i would have whole heartedly recommended this game but with the advent of the paid steam workshop that is no longer the case putting mods behind a paywall has sundered the close knit mod community and has very much cheapened the whole game as a result not to mention that almost all mods are collabrative in nature and thus has led to some mod authors putting other peoples work behind a paywall that they wont see a dime fornot that many of them would want their work being charged for i dont blame the modders in question for this as they are getting screwed in this deal anyway by only recieving $025 of every $100 that steampublisher gets the fault lies squarely on the shoulders of valve and bethesda

you should have acted they are already here the ea dlc scrolls told of their return their defeat was merely delay until the time after steam opened when the modders of skyrim would spill their own blood but no one wanted to believe believe they even exist paid mods and when the truth finally dawned it dawned in money but there is a group they fear in their tongue they are called the steam community

skyrim has a large world but it frequently lacks depth the combat is lacking on most character builds if you do not focus on combat skills early on the game can become quite difficult crafting is not balanced and is at first very ineffective then overpowered the diffrences between armor types when you do smithing becomes minute skyrim also has less complexity than the previous games most of the game is not balanced and hides behind the players ability to stunlock enemies or eat and drink a constant stream of items the story overly focuses on the player being the choosen one large portions of the world are quite grey and boring while most people use mods to fix this recently bethesda along with valve has choosen to monetize modding as a result i can no longer recommend this game as it has too many flaws that can no longer quickly be fixed for free

as mentioned before valve introduced paid workshop mods for skyrim as a result changing my review to negative you dont get to charge people for mods and try to sell them as dlc valve bscouchfighter i concur & strongly disapprove of this game now & bethesdas tactics too

i have enjoyed this game so very much and its killing me that i have to give it a negative review based on recent events monetizing mods has me heartbroken on the future of this franchise and even that of fallout as well i have no issue with paying someone for their mods if theyre of high quality via donation or something along those lines but being forced to is sickening gone are the days where people work together and collaborate on mods building one off of another for the love and enjoyment of the game and the series itself now that money has been introduced pandoras box has been opened and that friendly little mod community will begin to shred itself apart from the inside out from greed and cutthroat tactics such as people stealing someones mod for profit or someone using a mod that relies heavily on another mod to function we have already seen an issue with this in the recently removed art of the catch mod on the steam workshop i truly disagree with the direction valve and bethesda have decided to go with this especially since both of them are making 75% of the money while the creator of the mod gets such a generous 25% i feel as though the modding scene for great games like this is going to die and be replaced with one of the disgusting free2play models a world full of microtransactions that will nickel and dime you to death at every chance they get again the game itself is amazing my invested hours are a testament to that but a large majority of that time was spent messing with so many of the incredible mods that have made this game far better than bethesda could have hoped for from things such as the much needed unoffical bugfix patches to complete overhauls of many ingame systems this is all thanks to the closeknit modding community the very one that will be destroyed if this practice of monetizing mods does not get sorted out soon

this game killed my dog it was either take him to the vet or buy mods to make this game a tiny bit better

this was a really great game fan of the rpg genre i had a lot of fun playing it exploring a huge open world and its lore leveling up and getting stronger aquiring items etc its one of those games to which their community is an essential part the possibilities mods added to this game is what made it so popular but now that payed mods are an official thing here on steam things are going to be a little different and i fear that might have killed the best part of this game without its mods skyrim is only a good game payed mods is a big hindrance to modder collaborations and the modding community in general i can not recommend this game any more and i really hope this system wont expand to all other games on steam
not recommended
this new paid mod situation really ruins what was a wonderful and free culture allowing the mod creators to accept donations would make sense but its tons of free publicity by allowing those mods to exist come on bethesda make this right

do not buy paid mods jajajaja what a joke so now i have to pay for every mod no matter how bad it is and the developer only gets 25% really this game supports paid mods i do not

i am unhappy with valves decision to allow mods to be placed behind a paywall
not recommended
bethesda has seriously crossed a line by charging players for other peoples work this was a terrible move by them and im seriously unimpressed this was clearly not the correct model to be using if they wished for people to make paid mods perhaps a humble bundle model would have been better where there is a suggested price and you can change where the payment goes more to the game dev more to valve more to the modder etc or you can pay nothing at all elder scrolls online was bad enough now this bethesda has now lost my support as a customer bye
not recommended
cant really support paid mods mods are supposed to be by fans for fans

apparently you can steal someone elses mod and upload it to steam charge money for it and thats fine by steam and bethesda because the copyright for all mods belongs to bethesda not the creator of the mod if you as the creator of the mod try to go to the page where someone else is selling your mod and you say anything negative ie shame on steam or something along those lines while using 100% civil language you will be banned from community posts im not a mod creator but this is a problem many mod creators who offer their mods for free on nexus many mod creators have started taking their mods down simply to stop them from being stolen but steam doesnt care bethesda doesnt care bethdesda gets 45% of every mod sold steam gets 30% and the mod creator if they even are the original creator gets 25%
not recommended
was great until valve and bethesda agreed to gouge the modding community
not recommended
so is tf2 the next mod we have to pay for
not recommended
unfortuntaley bethesda and valve have decided to kill this game by hiding mods behind a paywall maybe bethesda should hire people who keep doing their coding for them instead of screwing them over by giving them 25% of the profits for their created content its like charging a taxi driver 75% of his profits because you made the car
not recommended
you should have acted they are already here the monopoly told of their return their defeat was merely a delay until the time after next gen opened when the sons of gamers would spill their own blood but no one wanted to believe believe they even exist and when the truth finally dawned payed mods but there is one they fear in their tongue he is totalbiscuit the cyncial brit

ive already been salty for a long time that basically the only way to enjoy a good pc gaming collection is to rent the rights to those games via steam where although you paid full price for it its still actually their product but this paid modding valve has gone from one of my favorites to one of my least liked companiesand bethesda all those glorious years of tesfrom morrowind upwards and you lower yourself to valves level goodbye good memories

not recommended
almost 100hrs in this game and i dont recommend it why because the only reason to play it mods will now be monetized by valve which means youll have to pay more than for just the game for it to be good the only reason i even played this game was because the modding scene made it playabe otherwise its a boring shell of an rpg does it have a lot of base content yep is it good barely i can only remember a handful of side quests i actually enjoy i even spoiled the ending for myself to see it wasnt even worth getting to can you still use nexus yup however a lot of greedy s will ship their mods here and only here while valve and bethesda make most of the profit from someone elses creation not to mention the mod section will end up being another greenlightearly access in which we pay for crap that doesnt work andor breaks our game gg valve youre making yourself anticonsumer every day edit the paid mod service has been removed i will not being changing my score due to bethesda agreeing with adding the feature to begin with however you no longer have to fear for paid modding as of right now

you know this game was a waste of money it was mediocre in almost every way so utterly forgettable i didnt think it was worthly of even the time taken to write a review but hey that changed today because the game now offers paid mods freakin pay for what has been a free and major aspect of pc gaming since forever screw this game screw game companies in general nowadays you pay 60 dollars for a game and you are not guaranteed a full game you are not guaranteed a working game at launch and at every turn game companies will try their hardest to squeeze the last cent out of you with dlc day one dlc preorder bonuses microtransactions and now this paying for freaking mods you might be thinking now but nuclear kangaroo you are not entitled to the modders work its true but then how come valve and bethesda are the modder only gets a 25% cut out of every sale the rest goes to valvebethesda if the total profit of the modder does not exceed 100$ the modder gets nothing the modders can use the work of other free mods for their paid mods without the knowledge or the consent of the modders they steal the work from the modder can have their paid mods bundled in any sort of dlc made by the publisher which then can decide to not give a cent to any modder involved not to mention that by placing the incentive this already fragments the modding community placing a paywall between the people who play mods and those who create it this wont lead to better mods that everyone can enjoy the only mods that might get better are the paid ones this move does not benefit the customer it barely benefits the modder it only benefits valve and the publishers screw this game and any future game that does this also like i said the game is pretty mediocre edit paid mods were removed but the game is still mediocre so i still dont recommend it

this is one of my favorite games and its modding community is one of the best but now they want us to pay for a mod that someone else copied so that guy can get 25c on the dollar and line valves pockets welp its back to the nexus till steam wises up and adds a donation button to coders mods are made by fansfor fans lets not make this the dlc version of the app store

skyrim is a mediocre game dumbed down for consoles and lacks depth until recently it was quick and simple to rectify that with mods since mods were free it didnt matter now they are not the base game is no longer worth the platter space it is etched upon defacing the pristine condition of your hard drive no do not buy this game do not support these practices
not recommended
this is one of my favorites i recommend this game to any fantasyrpg gameplayer the modding community is also very strong and it will seem to last for a life time

one of the greatest games of all time building on the lore and events from past elder scrolls games skyrim really takes the gameplay and graphics to the next level beautiful fun expansive a near endless amount of stuff to do two main story arcs running simulataneously morality decisionspretty much everything you could want from an open world rpg there are bugs and you will need to save often but between the vanilla game the dlc and all the crazy mods available this game will be responsible for your lack of sleep potentially for years to come i think this has become number three on my list after morrowind and baldurs gate

paid workshop mods for skyrim changing my review to negative you dont get to charge people for mods and try to sell them as dlc valve people can and should support mod creators via donations and a buy me a coffee button on the workshop page would be good but putting them behind a pay wall is god damn atrocious hoping valve and other responsible parties for this new practice will turn around

this used to be a very good game but since bethesda decided that fleecing people with crappy dlc content was not enough they decided to add it to modders as well so now you have to pay for most of the mods for this game now i would recommend avoiding this game and can no longer recommend this at all
not recommended
you know this game was a waste of money it was mediocre in almost every way so utterly forgettable i didnt think it was worthly of even the time taken to write a review but hey that changed today because the game now offers paid mods freakin pay for what has been a free and major aspect of pc gaming since forever screw this game screw game companies in general nowadays you pay 60 dollars for a game and you are not guaranteed a full game you are not guaranteed a working game at launch and at every turn game companies will try their hardest to squeeze the last cent out of you with dlc day one dlc preorder bonuses microtransactions and now this paying for freaking mods you might be thinking now but nuclear kangaroo you are not entitled to the modders work its true but then how come valve and bethesda are the modder only gets a 25% cut out of every sale the rest goes to valvebethesda if the total profit of the modder does not exceed 100$ the modder gets nothing the modders can use the work of other free mods for their paid mods without the knowledge or the consent of the modders they steal the work from the modder can have their paid mods bundled in any sort of dlc made by the publisher which then can decide to not give a cent to any modder involved not to mention that by placing the incentive this already fragments the modding community placing a paywall between the people who play mods and those who create it this wont lead to better mods that everyone can enjoy the only mods that might get better are the paid ones this move does not benefit the customer it barely benefits the modder it only benefits valve and the publishers screw this game and any future game that does this also like i said the game is pretty mediocre edit paid mods were removed but the game is still mediocre so i still dont recommend it

ok so paid mods are gone now i will still be keeping my review as negative for the fact that steam and bethesda even tried to do what they did the game itself is good though it does get dry after a while so modding is a huge must if you want to keep playing old post i used to really love this game when mods were free after this latest fiasco i will not be buying any games from bethesda ever again and will spread the word to all of my gaming buddies in the military to quote a article i read earlier today imagine buying a car youre a flashy type so you want to slap some dank rims and racing stripes on it when you take your car to the shop to get it modified does a percentage of what you pay go to bmw  no it should be the same when modifying software its already payed for you should be able to have it modified however you want without giving the original manufacturer anything this is why i have given this game a bad review why buy a game and then have to keep buying content thats is more then the game itself especially if the content has been free for the past 4 years

with an almost endless amount of immersion skyrim is a fantastic game that hosts a multitude of mods vanilla skyrim is in itself fairly well made and the story is at just the right level of length where i dont feel frustrated at spending half my day traversing a dungeon the puzzles when apparent arent too difficult and the graphics are still great even to this day if youre that sort of gamer also this game is quite liberal on mods hell they even provide you with a tool to do it yourself and some mods are just breathtakingly beautiful others are so immersion and lorebreaking you love it and simultaneously wither on the inside but you download them anyway now here comes the part where i warn you about stuff thats important mmk lets do this thing skyrim is an extremely volatile game especially with dawnguard and hearthfire but youll only really see this in heavily modded cases of skyrimor maybe not since bethesda refuses to fix most of the problems users have reported there are mountains of threads to fix these issues although some of them are not guaranteed to work a mod that conflicts with another can ctd you incredibly quickly or mess up your savesaves and by ctd i mean crash to desktop and thats never fun i currently have my mod settings for skyrim at modded to a degree that its on life support so im crashing somewhat frequently secondly skyrim is a memory hound and this also makes it freak the hell out on occasionally unless your machine is a powerhouse expect a little lag the cursor tends to go from jerking erratically to being as slow as a dump truck according to your settings edit 1 on the topics of mod compatibility this is an issue youll eventually run into with important mods although most of them are selfsufficient youll run into that mod the one that lags you outbugs something or even messes your save up eventually and this translates to all saves down report bravo team ahem now with something like 5 mods installed it shouldnt be hard to find a problem with say 100 this is much more of a problem especially with skyrims lack of communication when it ctds its a tedious process so be warned and be careful on what mods you download you never know whatll break your game a few times before fixing it or you know not i love this game despite its sometimesfatal flaws and ill continue to play it any day thanks for muscling through this wall of text

kind of very linear i bet theres no mo there is well fighting against alduin was pretty eas so theres actually a mod that gives him 5 different levelsstages that casts hundreds of meteors falling towards me that makes him nearly impossible to beat so what now im guessing therell be a mod that makes your character poop and pee get your male character pregnant listen to an autotuned cave bear fight a flying deformed randy savage wha there actually are great scott modding saved this game  review in all seriousness the game itself without having it covered with fancy mods was disappointing though in spite of the unrewarding quests however going through the dark void of the dungeon fighting your way through beating the boss turning in your quest item and only get 100 gold as a reward  there are still some stuffs that make it very interesting like the daedric quests for example the consistent blue tint of atmosphere is reasonable for me to be honest youre in the northern side of tamriel what other atmosphere would you expect the models and textures are decent for its 2011 gen apparently some of the normal maps are misplaced and there are some portions where the textures are stretched there are even textures that give performance hits due to its lack of optimization now dont get me started with the animations oh god the dual wield and the onehanded weapon when held on the left hand compared to the previous titles this game lacks the roleplaying aspects of a an actual rpg its more of a sandbox game where you would explore the whole area of skyrim just right after escaping from helgen at the beginning of the game the main story wasnt well delivered due to the npcs dialogues making you feel like theyre rushing you on saving the world you would rather spend dozens of hours doing other quests and then youll come back to the main quest once youve got bored on the openworld unlike in tesiii morrowind youd need to level up and get better items for you to make the next main quest beatable also exploring other places is a guaranteed death sentence to your character the plot could have been better if only it wasnt too linear theres only one or three quests where you could choose which side would you go but other than that the main plot goes on with the same ending its sad that the developers just made a game that would only last 100 hours for me to enjoy and would make me leave it in the libraryshelf for a long time rotting and waiting to be played again then theres the modding community the ones that made the game worth buying in the first place the developers may have put their efforts into this game but the modding community had it in tenfolds to think theyre not even getting paid for their work though thats not the case to all modders overall the game is okay but it gets really good with mods installed the elder scrolls v skyrim for me doesnt have the story of its own because we the players are the ones who write it this

no spoilers in this review dive into the shoes of the dragonborn saving the world like usual in an elder scrolls game but with a twist you can use the ancient power of the voice to shout words of power shout at your enemies the world eater has returned along with the dragons and it is up to you to defeat them and save tamriel from its doom the game is set in skyrim the harsh land of the nords in the middle of a civil war and you can choose a side in it the stormcloaks or the imperals or you can stay neutral and kill both or be peaceful it is up to you what you do the game has lived up to all expectations and has surpassed all in my opinion it is the best game bethesda has ever made the graphicss are amazing the gamplay is a big step up from previous elder scrolls games unlike elder scrolls 4 oblivion not every voice is the same there are some that are the same but that is undestandable because they dont have unlimted voice actors some people hate how it is not as pretty as oblivion but i think this is a good thing because skyrim is a harsh land where it is always snowing so that is why i like this idea the story is awesome but is not as long as oblivions in fact it is a lot shorter than oblivion so they could of made it a bit longer but its quality makes up for it i like how unlike oblivion its class system no longer have to choose a class make up your own with skill and skill trees with perks be god if you want to overall i recommend this game to anyone it is the best game i have ever played and has surpassed all expectation its a thumbs up from me if i had to give it a rating 9510 its great if you like what you hear go buy it yourself you wont regret it

please note my lack of time in this game i have played hundreds of hours in the console version ah remember the original pretty damn good but this this is arena on steroids set in the land of skyrim in the elder scrolls universe it follows on dragons admit it you wanted them since morrowind and how they are going to enslave the mortal races or something like that this game is incredibly solid in quests there are hundreds of them literally thats not even counting misc quests combat is a bit strange at some times the animations also feel clunky and its graphics are not that uptodate like other rpgs of its time it makes up for it in a large open world incredibly original creatures original storyline for a rpg and heck there are youtube videos on how to learn dragon language its very cheap for the content and i have spent so much time playing this and not getting bored get it or if your a bit strapped for cash wait for a sale but get this if you have the money its damn worth it 810 quite glitchy some bad animations and repeated voices for lots of characters but its incredibly large and fun

i love this game but bethesda and valve are killing it with microtransactions the game is so good on its own but its not exactly stable and bethesda has for years relied on aftermarket mods to fix their games these modders work for free and accept donations but they make their mods free for all they study the game engine and they experiment with it and they find wonderful tricks that arent documented and they share them amongst themselves and the modding community at large to help others help us all by creating mods from new weapon and armor pieces or sets to entire new lands to ui fixes to new characters and features paid mods will end this and make it more of a competition and this will fragment the community and make mods incompatible with one another as they exploit the game differently and counteract one another i love skyrim but i dont recommend you buy it from steam until valve gets their house in order you can buy the game at a number of other retailers it will activate on steam but that isnt the same as giving valve your hardearned money to stab you and other gamers in the back or you can play it on consoles where despite loading screens that take ages the game is more or less playable hell i play it on xbox 360 while i download and install mods on the pc version i can load skyrim and test a mod while the xbox version is loading a city

skyrim im not sure how i can review this never having played older tes games but i can safely say after a better playthrough this is a good game gameplay is pretty varied ranging from fullon combat using magic or my alltime favourite sneaking combat isnt brilliant it isnt stiff like a rock but still a bit rough it has some dinamic though like executions different attacks for different directions and special effects like extra damage on undead or freeze damage on stamina and magicka etc as for quests i feel like the game really shined in the guild quests the companions college and thieves but was lackluster on earlygame story missions that being my opinion though side missions are interesting at least but some areseem boring and occupy space on your journal the leveling system works a bit weird differently from what im used to by getting good at a skill one handed destruction spells lockpicking you gain overall exp then you use tab and click level up not fully fond of it overall id give it an 810 since a max rating has to be a perfect game for me and i have not found one yet leave your feedback below thanks

skyrim im not sure how i can review this never having played older tes games but i can safely say after a better playthrough this is a good game gameplay is pretty varied ranging from fullon combat using magic or my alltime favourite sneaking combat isnt brilliant it isnt stiff like a rock but still a bit rough it has some dinamic though like executions different attacks for different directions and special effects like extra damage on undead or freeze damage on stamina and magicka etc as for quests i feel like the game really shined in the guild quests the companions college and thieves but was lackluster on earlygame story missions that being my opinion though side missions are interesting at least but some areseem boring and occupy space on your journal the leveling system works a bit weird differently from what im used to by getting good at a skill one handed destruction spells lockpicking you gain overall exp then you use tab and click level up not fully fond of it overall id give it an 810 since a max rating has to be a perfect game for me and i have not found one yet leave your feedback below thanks

the elder scrolls series has forever been a part of me morrowind oblivion and now skyrim  words cannot describe the experiences and the accumulation of hours that i have put into the games skyrim nor displeases or fails to live up to the expectations the gameplay and missions are extensive and unique and the rpg revolving around dragons is literally amazing the shouts and skills operating around each character makes the game even more addicting i totally recommend this for anyone especially skyrim alongside the older games and especially the newer one the mmorpg

paid mods not great

i dont see the problem with the paid mods if it bothers you that much vote with your wallet sure valve and bethesda get a fat cut which is kind of annoying i guess but hey its capitalism yo downvoting not because a paid mod marketplace bothers me but because skyrim is kind of boring even with mods good if youve never played it before

skyrim has made significant improvements from the previous games but lack that certain charm from the previous games like morrowind or oblivion for instance the leveling up system has been improved but it makes leveling up not as fun as the class based system you see in the previous elder scroll games the combat hasnt really all that improved just the standard block and hit with a possible 5050 critical depending upon how well you leveled up if you use magic make sure you buff yourself and use strong magicka spells the world itself is pleasing enough with the right enb mods and mods in general you can make those screenshots look beautiful and epic you will lose hours on end not just by doing quests here and there but just by exploring the vast lands of skyrim and seeing the world change and react to things that you do or nature or even the npcs the npcs in this game is far better than the ones seen in oblivion not only do they interact with you but they interact in a way which feels almost life like they will still do their tasks while at the sametime talk to you and thank god the voiceovers are vary rather than the same like the ones seen in oblivion plus each one has their own background or particular quest which makes them even more interesting to chat with and of course help them in the time of need if they require it the dlcs themselves just adds more layers to skyrim dawnguard hearthfire and dragonborn gives new powers abilites lore shouts armor and weapons plus locations quests and npcs the standard dlc for an rpg except for hearthfire which is an addon not dlc hearthfire is basically almost like the sims this addon just adds adoptions homesteads and new npcs and a few raident quests skyrim without mods is still great but just a bit buggy and glitchy the modding community has helped making the game great and then some i mean not only do you got a ton of mod reviewers out there bordual and gopher mmoxreview and top 5 skyrim mods of the week from gamespot plus many more but also talented artists painters and drawers for example music composers fan fiction writers short videos parodies playthroughs i mean so much more skyrim is a great game to play a great experience i highly recommend it

the fifth game of the elder scrolls franchise skyrim is a unique roleplaying  action and adventure game that you could never compare to any other title you start out as a prisoner going towards helgen to be executed  but luckily a dragon comes to destroy it and you manage to escape from there on you make your adventure you can do anything you find interesting such as doing side quests  the main story quests  exploring the huge lands of skyrim or leveling up your skills the main story isnt that long  but the side quests will take around 1000 hours to all be completed the elder scrolls vskyrim has a high replayability or if you ever get bored from the vanila version  get mods from the skyrim steam workshop or from the skyrim nexus you wont go wrong by buying this game even if its published 2011

im disappointed that i must give skyrim a thumbs down im disappointed that such a wonderful game with one of the best modding communities has been irreparably damaged by this attempt to monetize the efforts of hobbyist modders im disappointed that the atmosphere of contribution and open sharing has given way to an atmosphere of squabbling over a few cents for small mods im disappointed that the example which we set for future modders has changed from a philosophy of collaboration to a philosophy of selfishness and greed thumbs down for skyrim

quite simply the greatest game ever made i played this game for a year after it came out then i got involved in some other games for a year or so and then decided to go back and play skyrim again it was just as fresh and exciting the second time around as it was the first time that i played it skyrim is vast huge monstrous there is just so much to do here that it never seems to get old i only used a few simple mods no real game changers just a few things to make the game a bit more fun for me but for those who want them there are thousands of mods that will change the game which adds entirely new game play possibilities im done gushing for now i can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has ever had an inkling to play an rpg best game ever really
recommended
still going to be a negative review consider this a scar bethesda and valve made the choice to right their wrongs sounds good right except that righting their own wrong in this case meant a fracturing a passionate and longstanding modding community b having gained nothing but mistrust and resentment and please dont try something like this again in the future to be clear no paid mods means no paid mods quality or revenue split is irrelevant paywalling the community for unofficially supported thirdparty dlc that relies on their the modding community resources and assets is unacceptable keep doing what youre doing and stick to officially released bethesda games and dlc

i can personally attest to the fact that skyrim deserves all the hype its gotten one of my favorite aspects of the game is the fact that it isnt a mainstream overlycolorful slightly too fantasyoriented rpg that ends up being a bit cheesy instead skyrim has created a beautiful yet rugged world in which anything is possible especially with mods and provides enough realism and strategy to be intense while still being a fantastic mythical experience that leaves you awe struck and nerdgasming play this game i beg you
recommended
with an endless possibility of adventure and a great modding community the elder scrolls v skyrim is one of the best rpgs ever made however it suffers from rehashed dungeons and character models along with familiar scenery in some places none of that is enough to draw away from the incredible depth scale and intensity of tamriel the province of skyrim is an incredible place to trek but many of the events that happen in the game feel immersive at first before revealing themselves to be a similar if not exactly the same endeavor each time for example a fugitive runs up and gives you a sword and a threat this makes you feel like youre in a living breathing world only to have that breath extinguished when you realize itll be the same situation again and again and again as long as a fugitive needs your help rehashed content is the only drawback to an otherwise truly one of a kind rpg
recommended
words would result insuficient to describe what skyrim is and what it has to offer from a first view it has no brilliant story and there are indeed some bugs or glitches that still remain so it could possibly result a mediocre game but i assure you that youll certainly change your mind after trying it what makes skyrim special is the identification in your character made possible by a levelling system different from the classic rpg you wont have points to spend in any abilities except for health mana and stamina but youll have to select a few skills and upgrade them by practice this will risult more immersive for the time spent in the levelling process and for the result of that more rewarding than a normal rpg lvl system the more the effort will be the more rewarding will be the result that wont be tranlated in a mere number in every game your will be at the center of all things but skyrim will make you feel to deserve being the hero a little sore in all of that could be the lacking of a karma system much more familiar to all the fallout saga players but cmon world needs to be saved from ancient badass flying lizards embending a pot in the the head of the innkeeper to avoid him seeing you stealing some chease will be surely forgiven by akatosh last but not least the music the will make more suggestive the beautiful landscapes in the whole game better to install graphic mods for best quality and will make every battle worth to be fought even though the fight system isnt anything special after almost 240 hours ive still havew to finish the game because the feeling that i get from it was that every inch of rock earth mud and water has to be lived and so every little adventure the this land of the north will offer you yes also the blackreach quest for the nirns roots still unfinished though in the end skyrim is maybe one of the best games ever createwd by now and together with dark souls 1 and 2 helped made me develop a certain sensibility towards games and what they try to transmit you not simply living them as fictionalinteractive stories for childish plays or a simple waste of time as grown ups people see them 1010 if you get the chance play the dlcs aswell

this game is beautiful and it has soul while i think its not the best tes game it surely stays true to what makes this series amazing insanely detailed world fantastic atmosphere the huge open world that calls the adventurer in me to explore every corner and delve into the legends of the nords the art style music and character models make skyrim the most spectacular experience so far in terms of a living world to explore the rpg mechanics are getting thinner stats skills birthsigns attributes but the progression and character customization are still pretty solid in their absence and a good improvement from oblivion i cant wait for the expansions for this game
recommended
910 summary amazing game with smart powerful and unique gameplay mechanics which are all complemented by colourful lore backstory and extensive rpg elements and mod support a very extensive variety of mods is already available as well as modding tools however players might occasionally be confronted with bugsglitches in the game which may hinder the game progression and lead to a negative gaming experience pros i captivating lore and backstory well written and directed quests with a fair amount of coherence on a logical basis ii simple yet powerful and versatile gameplay mechanics from combat and hunting to smithing and trading this game is easy to learn yet hard to master iii great for roleplaying the elder scrolls v  skyrim offers great character building tools to create your own personalized heroine or hero and begin conquering the land of skyrim iv moddable to the core infinite modding potential for extending the games capabilities and features such as additional races quests armour weapons and virtually anything else v optimized for most computer setups even if you have a medium to lowend computer skyrim will run quite decently given the relative reduction in graphical quality cons i extremely glitchybuggy in certain spots you can almost certainly rest assured that you will encounter a number of bugs throughout the game especially in quests  some of which are fixed by reverting to older game saves by installing unofficial patches released by the community others by performing specific actions or tricks eg using unrelenting force on an npc in an effort to reset them by uninstalling conflicting mods or by using certain commands eg setstage   yet some bugs and glitches may remain unfixable

the elder scrolls v skyrim review elder scrolls is a great game if you like a bit of a story line and you love to explore places finding secrets and treasures yes there are dragons i would recommend this game as its still exciting to play and if you like to what the hell you want this is a good game for you positives loads of objectives and side quests to do great graphics if you have a good computer its fun to play negatives can get boring traveling to places and if you play too long its not a short game to finish with straight away there could be more options

its rare when you find a game that attaches to you as well as skyrim over 5000 hours in between the xbox and my pc and the world still feels as fresh as ever as per the usual bethesda openworldcustomizablecharacterrpg your character has no voice but has dialogue options that allow you to depict what type of person your character is and how to respond to them skyrims lore is mainly what attached me to it for the world save for the main quest is incredibly rich in its scope granting the player countless hours and experiences simply by walking around if you truely want to explore skyrim the way it was meant to do not fast travel and see where your adventures take you the combat is nothing to write home about and stealth based characters outclass all other classes bar none especially on higher difficulties you cannot find the highest quality weapons until you are above level 46 rng dependent however they are more commonly found at higher levels at which point if your character is invested in smithing heshe can make the higher quality weapons than anything you can find in game to me this is one of the major downfalls of the game especially when you find a unique sword just to find out that you can make one that is twice as powerful and are in unlimited supply some of the decisions bethesda made regarding to dlc are rather offputting and i really wish they play tested these abit more being weaker in an exclusive form with a semipermanent follower that is unacceptable parts of the dlc are even lore breaking but i wont leave spoilers here what really increases this games replay value are the random encounters and of course usercreated content the modding community for skyrim is one of the largest in the video game industry from giant dlc sized mods that take place in new worlds to armor retexures and bunnyrabbit followers there is nothing you cannot find in terms of skyrim mods as always though make sure your computer can handle these mods as installing after market content is always on the user not the publisher skyrim however like most games of this scale im looking at you mass effect are not without their dissapointments there is no sense in scaling in terms of difficulty an archer on novice and an archer on legendary both have the same accuracy they just have exponential damagehealth scaling enemies level with you but this can be a blessing as well as a curse sure a level 32 bandit might be strong with that steel greatsword and that banded iron armor but you have a full set of ebony armor and an ebony war hammer as well as some restoration spells to heal you that level 32 bandit cant live a single hit from you and if he can you can stall him out with healing spells the ai have potions but never seem to use them the only truely challenging unmodded fight i can remember is the ebony warrior who you wont even see until your level 81 the differencies between classes are to0 far to make them all balanced but some of the perks just make certain builds untouchable example the last perk in the sneak tree allows you to conceal yourself while in combat sounds innocent enough but when you can crouch directly infront of someone and backstab them for 15x damage simply because the ai turns around and begins searching for you makes you borderline invincible especially considering there are only a few instances where you have to fight dragons the main quest especially the final boss is incredibly anticlimatic and has no more variety then any other standard battles you have in game at least they changed this for some of the dlcs but the lack of variety in the main quest compared to the rest of the game is heartbreaking and then there are the endless list of bugs that bethesda will never fix i wont list them here but as a tip never save with a crossbow in hands or inventory while crouched you will be locked in that position forever and you will know when its happened when your crosshair appears while you are crouched and you cannot stand up that list of cons however off putting they may seem should not stop you from purchasing the game it is well worth your time to play with or without mods i stress that mods greatly increase the enjoyment you will have in your game but to each hisher own skyrim has earned those awards by creating an excellent user experience perfect no nothing ever is is it close probably as close as any game will get

the benchmark of the open world rpg little can be said on skyrims shortcomings as the game is an experience that any gamer should have the world is alive and it is easy to forget the quests and become a participant in the communities of skyrim the game is a brilliant timesink and it is very easy to rack up hundreds of hours of gametime the addition of thousands of user created mods enhance your game to your liking the modding community is active and creative and is constantly producing new and interesting mods that add hours of fun to skyrim i cannot speak more highly of a game

skyrim was one of the mostanticipated games of 2011 and you can see an amazing amount of polish and detail from bethesda in some of the changes theyd made to the engine since previous elder scrolls games no make your own class character progression is even more freeflowing this time around skills rank up and become more effective as theyre utilized with a bonus based on how wellrested your character is and which mystical standing stone youve most recently attuned to this allows a character to jump back and forth between moreefficiently raising magestyle skills warrior and thief abilities character level increments as enough ranks are gained in these skills enemies level with the character but are locked at the level they were when you first entered that area cave of necromancers just too hard for you leave come back in five levels it means that fresh encounters will always be challenging but rarely overwhelming the combatinteraction mechanics are updated so that theres a righthandlefthand leftclickrightclick mechanic this allows the player to wield a spell weapon or shield in one hand and something complementary in the other two versions of the same spell can eventually be dualcast to improve effects and this mechanic also puts a new spin on the twohanded swordandboard and dualwielding melee combat skyrim is a very open living realm with lots to do so much in fact that it may be a tad overwhelming everyone wants something from the dragonborn theres discrete quest chains for the main storyline save the world from a worldeating immortal dragon who goes about resurrecting his dead dragonbros the mages college where a character who barely knows how to use magic can rise to the very top not that many will notice the fighters guild by any other name that introduces some helpful companions and a new way of becoming something that goes bump in the night the assassins guild with tales of love madness betrayal and sticking pointy things into others and a farreaching longspanning saga for the humble thieves guild of riften thatll send you all across the continent as the stakes get higher and higher honestly the last two seem to dwarf the real plotline but your mileage may differ aside from and included in those you have any number of random minor fetch kill and other classic questtypes some of which use the new semirandomgeneration radiant quest system theyll never run out and rarely repeat but generally are just there so that you know you can always do quests theyre rarely worth it so whether you want to play a stealthbased archaelogist trying to snatch precious nord treasures from the powerful undead draugr guarding them a shieldbashing axeswinging juggernaut with shouts powered by the stolen souls of freshly rekilled dragons or a crafty mage with a penchant for bringing in daedra friends to do her bidding skyrims got options for you theres rough spots theres high points but its a great example of a proficient studio kicking out a aaa flagship title as for dlcs ill likely review those on their own

you can play this game over and over again trying different builds though i mostly end up being a sneaky archer and swords man this game never gets boring and if it does somehow theres a ton of addons and mods you can choose from my personal favourite in terms of user mods helgen reborn over all this game will fill many hours as long as you fully play it meaning not just rushing the main quest there are many nice side quests that are often better then the main quest the thives guild quest imo for example the dlcs dragonborn having started the elder scrolls with morrowind i especially enjoyed dragonborn and dawnguard add to the many quests and play time a great game

just when i thought i was out they pull me back in  michael corleone who am i kidding i was never out on this game 2 years and 420 hours later im still finding new things to do and places to explore betwen morrowind oblivion and skyrim ive probably spent way more time than is healthy traversing the landscapes of tamriel and the mods available for skyrim now have me wanting to go back to morrowind and oblivion freshly modded up for another round

skyrim is an amazing single player actionadventure rpg massively recommend to any who love large open worlds and open gameplay even if you confine yourself to just the main quest this is still quite a large scale game if you delve deeper into the side quests for factions and randomized mini quests you can easily put hundreds of hours in this game this game is open to a lot of gamers  and difficulty is adjustable in the options so you can still play a fun game even if you aren not the quickest or slickest gamer combat requires you to make good decisions on default difficulty  one bad mistake and you will be dropped quick when i state the game is open  it is in different styles as well skyrim has very open advancement and many opportunities to advance your skills in either magic combat or stealth or a combination of all you are not as restricted as in previous elder scrolls games and they were very open skyrim even has perks  skill points you can place on skills to improve their function even more than leveling up great for those who like skill trees before i hit negatives i recommend if you intend to play this for more than the main story  research console commands the ` key i dont recommend using them to ruin the core gameplay it is possible but you can use them to work around certain bugs and annoying issues that can occur and ruin your fun on the negative side  even with the game patched up  there are bugs i recommend highly making multiple save files and frequently you may play constantly without running in to bugs but some play and constantly end up needing to reload my playstyle is very explorative  i will get stuck in the environment and need to load again occasionally important  but not required  npcs will be killed through random events and attacks this can be frustrating when you go to a town ready to unload items for sale only to find the shop keepers body outside and a pack of death hounds nearby also in the negatives  the hoarder gameplay style is not conducive to this game skyrim imposes a strict carry limit when you exceed this limit you slow to a crawl and cannot run or fast travel between places this means you may literally spend an hour or more walking slowly from a dungeon back to town if you are a hoarder who keeps andor sells all items some players tend to use the console commands to increase their carry limit  but this does defeat part of the core gameplay concept  it is your choice though overall  i thoroughly recommend this game though not as innovative as some of the other elder scrolls games this is still an incredible achievment despite any bugs or issues encountered

what to say about this game its fun exciting and teaches you to fly after you foolishly try beating up a giant its got something for everyone no matter what your favourite play style like charging at the enemy grab a suitable sword and get hacking enjoy stealing stuff theives guild for you and you can always do worse than joining the mages guild calling yourself tim the enchanter and spending your days blowing up bits of the landscape before mocking a passing party of knights stir in a civil war plenty of side quests odd jobs not so odd jobs and just plain weird jobs and youve already spent 100 gaming hours exploring one huge sandbox of a game world before youve even tried starting the main quest does the game have its faults of course the menu system could be better for us pc users and the 3rd person kill cam breaks the illusion while you are in the midst of a huge battle but all in its worth the money and gets a boris rating of 9 gallons of napalm out of 10

you can drive a warhammer into a mans brain and they still dont give two  i love this game

why should i even write a review for this game buy it now right now
recommended
i recommend this game bethesda have desgined and created a true masterpiece the elder scrolls series is some really great lore the feel it has is so immersive more so to our own i feel and i have to say slightly more so than jrr tolkiens lore on middle earth skyrims feel is no diffrent to the other games in the franchise altho i must admit i havent had the pleasure of expieriencing any of them other than a small 1 hour 1 death play of morrowind skyrim of course in fact i believe to have over 2000 hours of gameplay in skyrim as i play on the xbox 360 most of my time and my fellow brethren allow me to indulge them in some lore and ill do some roleplay with their character which we dont mind oblivion also ive had many an adventure in the realm of oblivion and cyrodill i even have the game manual and every dlc paid full price as on the xbox probally countless more hours on that game and im definatley familiar with lore in the elder scrolls however the freedom and power that come with playing and being immersed in an elder scrolls game is unlike any other thanks to bethesda softworks and many other countless reasons oo the impact it has on the way at least i think is significant makes me want to roleplayand i shall set out and weave my own fate outsatanding  if you play skyrim and your rig whatever you play on be it laptop linux i think you can run it on mac anything i guess if its about the average i say you definatley should get some mods running with skyrim it only matters that you have the right and required systemrig to run it on if you want graphical mods or highly increase data and such otherwise not so important you would want to go to nexus mods and community on the web and search on catorgorys for anything your interested in also before i tell you what i have you will need to know how to install mods if you dont already know of course if you are unsure of anything you may not want to mess anything up or waste your time to try it for a great guide on how to do almost everything with mods search youtube for gopher and watch his video on well anything hes a great guy and he explains all you need to know better than most people do that ive seen haha hope you get through that alright and really if your under 10 years old which its sort of illegal or breaking some rules if you are to play the game exetra you might find it hard to understand skip things and not do what you need to correctly causing things to get messy and possibly broken dont take shortcuts follow the guidencetrail you can ask me anything on the matter too id be happy to oblige personally i have many about 50 immersion modifications mods and more gameplay effects and changes also maybe 5 overhauls one for each audio combat skills enviroment gameplay and a complicated one well its a long list of around 600 alltogether modifications bare in mind that some of theese are about 3kb in size so i could somehow merge together all the files ive found and downloaded and get to only have 50 or so mods but not really necesary with nexus mod manager basically modifications personalise to your dreams and taste give you what you want and possibly more there are about 25000 modifications to be found on the site and many more to come you can always create and add yourself skyrim is endless then and truely magnificicant if we were to modify older tes games it just wouldnt live up to skyrim modded as it is down to technology but can give you endless more time playing with excitement and emotion and even merging other realms ooohhh hah  so much to tell you i could i guess if you want to know more id be a good start to ask on and your welcome to it is a great life expierience to explore and adventure skyrim turn hud off at the start if i were you to be more immersed and if you will add mods play through the beggining untill you are unbound and start to configure and do not forget to save oh thats another thing if you have more than 4 saves it usuallyy caused loads of problems like crash to desktop and corruption with data that sort so limit your saves wisely just to say there is a mod made for skyrim for littrally 60% of what ever you think of and if not make it  hardly limmeted i dont know how to say to people that they should start playing it if you are hungry for adventure seek the land of skyrim fare well
recommended
its a good game which i have spent many a joyful hour playing and modding this is the reason i am writing a negative review the paid mod system is possibly the worst decision made by valve and bethesda so far forcing someone to pay for something that might not even work with their current configuration of mods is just wrong a simple donate button would be enough to support the mod developers especially since most have survived this far without any contribution for their work whatsoever so many other reasons but if you need to be told them then you probably shouldnt even be on the internet without supervision linus to lead the rebellion against the false deity gaben
not recommended
i like the game but i am scared of this new trend that we are starting to see very soon modding will become like dlcs you will need to pay for all of them then soon after that you will get a completed game that you cannot finish or miss large parts of the story because the $60 that they charge you is not enough and you will need to buy more packages
not recommended
you should be ashamed of yourselves paid mods

modding is a hobby not a career if modders want money they can make their own game a mod is a showcase of talent to gain experience to put on a resume it is a springboard into game development if modding becomes lucrative there will be no new game developers just droves of modders modding the same game over and over

this is possibly the best elder scrolls game ever it has improved or added features from other games i would know in the direct predecessor oblivion you can do many things such as join guilds and organizations like the dark brotherhood the thieves guild or the blades in skyrim there are changes such as the fighters guild in skyrim is called the companions i know these arent the same groups but they do the same things and the mages guild is the college of winterhold there are also very nice dlcs for this game such as the dawnguard or dragonborn dlcs the dawnguard dlc adds the ability to become a vampire lord as well as perks for the vampire lord and werewolf it also adds a questline where you have to fight the vampire menace by killing one of the most powerful vampire lords in tamriel you do this by getting a magic bow to stop the vampires from getting rid of the sun you also have the choice to join the vampires and block the sun temporarily so that you dont get negative effect from it that sums dawnguard up now lets get on to dragonborn in the dragonborn dlc you get many new things such as shouts armor weapons there is also another new quest line in this one you fight miraak the first dragonborn you go to the island of solstheim to find out why cultist tried to kill you and you run into some trouble along the way you have to learn the shouts that made miraak so powerful it is mainly one shout called bend will with this shout you have the power of flying dragons cool huh you have to go to the daedric lord hermaeus mora to learn this shout you also meet the skalls a people consisting of nords that believe in a god called the allmaker that sums that one up the is a minor dlc called hearthfire that adds the ability to adopt children and build your own house but that is mainly it the modding community also are a very important part in this game they make many fixes to the main game and also enhances it there has been many mods that patch parts of the game that make it 100 times better that sums skyrim up if i was giving this a number rating then i would give it a 97 out of 10

i purchased and started this game after at least 7 yrs of playing morrowind the world tamriel is a place i fell in love with due to its intricacies and flora and fauna tho the fauna does like to try and eat you from time to time the storyline in skyrim is attentive to the world view that all the elder scroll games seem to follow and that makes it a very enjoyable trip admittedly i have made use of one or two mods with the game glowing books better crafting more salt and a couple of house mods for breezehome lakeview and the one up north outside of solitudein hjaalmarch but am generally running the storyline and as many sidequests as i can as you can see to this point i have invested 194 hours into it and it still keeps me entertained i have enjoyed the scaling of combat to my level keeping me challenged some of the npc voice sets and even graphics tend to get used over and over but to draw and voice that many individuals would have required a full on hollywood budget to make this game i love how the story leads you around the world but doesnt limit your choices while exploring the side quests really make this an explorers nirvana and yet still offers more than enough combat for even the most battle loving gamer for any players both old school and newer folk who enjoy a great solo adventure and one that can really immerse you into the story this is yet another smash hit for bethesda welcome to tamriel grab a sword and follow me

this was always a game i recommended but with the caveat of it being made fun thanks to mods due to the recent monetization of mods i feel i have for the sake of fairness to review this game by its own merits without modability visually its uninteresting dribble made for xbox 360 hardware full of bugs that make it as stable as an one legged chair with so little content that its scary the cities look so lived in youll feel walking through prypyat you can only take one npc with you which is a blessing in disguise because they are as interesting as a pile of bricks talking about enemies the dragons biggest enemies of the game might as well be ashtmatic geckos for all the danger they pose and their ai and that of any other enemy is overshadowed by a dog with down syndromme the combat is 1stealthfire an arrow 2win the civil war is nowhere to be seen other than in a couple of exchanges with said uninteresting npcs all of those problems and some more are fixed by mods since valve and bethesda want mods to become dlc to get all those dollars then the game deserves a review of vanilla

so bethesda and valve realised that only mods make skyrim actually playable and they decided to make them user made dlc and keep 75% of the profits while also paying the mod creators only in 100$ bills as you can see the mod creators wont make any money unless their mod makes over 400$

your game has stopped working look no further skyrimexe has stopped working mod is now available for purchase at the cheap price of 10$ you can now finally fix this issue that will probably still come back and youll be forced to manually fix it yourself eyeing that pretty looking armor on the workshop its your lucky day pal buy this exclusive armor set that is purely aesthetic and actually sucks while you can get better and more reliable armors from nexus for free dont miss out on this cheap price only 25 bucks want to get the paid version for a mod but still have the free one no problem we now allow the creator to forcefully place ads whenever you spend time with the free version to force you to buy the paid one unless you like being annoyed as an added bonus the creator can now stop supporting the free one skyrim paid mods edition buy yours today

i cannot approve of allowing mods by definition an unofficial alteration of a game to be sold for money as if it were official content nor can i approve of valve or bethesda taking a 75% cut despite having invested no work nor can i believe the insinuation that allowing mods to be placed behind a paywall is good for a community that has freely debugged redesigned and improved the elder scrolls series via mods since the release of morrowind more than a decade ago neither the stormcloaks nor the empire wants the thalmor meddling in their business we dont want greedy executives meddling in ours

i feel that given the new nature of the paid mods skyrims review should be wholly based on the vanilla version bland colorless game with very little creativity the combat is stale and boring the quests laughably repetitive only positive is the fantastic score which makes otherwise boring gameplay tolerable however it does not take away from the incomplete glitch filled mess that it is

played the original game buggy and often crashed then came the modsmade it rainbowspewingly starstruck awesome now the game developer wants a cut when people like me only bought the game after viewing all those awesome mods and killing the overall warm fuzzy feeling of community that is friendly and changing it to hostile great job beth you should also remember it is the community such as nexus and modders such as fore that makes fnis made sure to never help pirated gamers when the mods are not working and help to promote against piracy by telling them to buy the game
not recommended
the shortsighted greed of valve and bethesda with their shady implemenation of paid modding has tarnished the elder scrolls franchise and the steam platform irrevocably bethesda have benefited for over a decade from modders who fix improve and add value to their games this event is an arrogant slap in the face to the dedicated loyal customers whose money has given these companies the reputation theyve earned so far but apparently that doesnt mean much anymore were going to remember this when fallout 4 comes around or if valve ever uses the piles of money they skim from steam to create the game weve been begging years for and hung out to dry

the benchmark of the open world rpg little can be said on skyrims shortcomings as the game is an experience that any gamer should have the world is alive and it is easy to forget the quests and become a participant in the communities of skyrim the game is a brilliant timesink and it is very easy to rack up hundreds of hours of gametime the addition of thousands of user created mods enhance your game to your liking the modding community is active and creative and is constantly producing new and interesting mods that add hours of fun to skyrim i cannot speak more highly of a game

this is possibly the best elder scrolls game ever it has improved or added features from other games i would know in the direct predecessor oblivion you can do many things such as join guilds and organizations like the dark brotherhood the thieves guild or the blades in skyrim there are changes such as the fighters guild in skyrim is called the companions i know these arent the same groups but they do the same things and the mages guild is the college of winterhold there are also very nice dlcs for this game such as the dawnguard or dragonborn dlcs the dawnguard dlc adds the ability to become a vampire lord as well as perks for the vampire lord and werewolf it also adds a questline where you have to fight the vampire menace by killing one of the most powerful vampire lords in tamriel you do this by getting a magic bow to stop the vampires from getting rid of the sun you also have the choice to join the vampires and block the sun temporarily so that you dont get negative effect from it that sums dawnguard up now lets get on to dragonborn in the dragonborn dlc you get many new things such as shouts armor weapons there is also another new quest line in this one you fight miraak the first dragonborn you go to the island of solstheim to find out why cultist tried to kill you and you run into some trouble along the way you have to learn the shouts that made miraak so powerful it is mainly one shout called bend will with this shout you have the power of flying dragons cool huh you have to go to the daedric lord hermaeus mora to learn this shout you also meet the skalls a people consisting of nords that believe in a god called the allmaker that sums that one up the is a minor dlc called hearthfire that adds the ability to adopt children and build your own house but that is mainly it the modding community also are a very important part in this game they make many fixes to the main game and also enhances it there has been many mods that patch parts of the game that make it 100 times better that sums skyrim up if i was giving this a number rating then i would give it a 97 out of 10

i purchased and started this game after at least 7 yrs of playing morrowind the world tamriel is a place i fell in love with due to its intricacies and flora and fauna tho the fauna does like to try and eat you from time to time the storyline in skyrim is attentive to the world view that all the elder scroll games seem to follow and that makes it a very enjoyable trip admittedly i have made use of one or two mods with the game glowing books better crafting more salt and a couple of house mods for breezehome lakeview and the one up north outside of solitudein hjaalmarch but am generally running the storyline and as many sidequests as i can as you can see to this point i have invested 194 hours into it and it still keeps me entertained i have enjoyed the scaling of combat to my level keeping me challenged some of the npc voice sets and even graphics tend to get used over and over but to draw and voice that many individuals would have required a full on hollywood budget to make this game i love how the story leads you around the world but doesnt limit your choices while exploring the side quests really make this an explorers nirvana and yet still offers more than enough combat for even the most battle loving gamer for any players both old school and newer folk who enjoy a great solo adventure and one that can really immerse you into the story this is yet another smash hit for bethesda welcome to tamriel grab a sword and follow me

one of the best open world games i have ever played with an active modding community to keep you entertained for hundreds of hours pros huge open world with loads of dungeons and interesting areas to explore and enjoy even though its a few years old now it is still eye candy everywhere you go and if you want an even more impressive boost of graphics thier is a mod for that loads of new lore to keep fans of the elder scrolls lore happy steam workshop this is by far the best part about playing skyrim on pc the steam workshop allows you to mod skyrim in so many different ways whether it be adding new weaponsarmour more dungeons player homes mounts races skills towns quests creatures graphical increases and pretty much anything else you can think of there are bugs in the game much like most bethesda games however none of theseas far as i know are game breaking and are actually mostly just humourous cons though the story dialog is good in alot of instances i feel disconnected to the conversation or cutscene style dialog and feel more like a ghost floating around a room watching it happen final thoughts this is a must have game if you own a pc even if you have played it on console in the past it is a whole new game once you dip into the modding community not to mention it looks great you could even wait for a sale to pick it up since it is a very popular sale item and goes on sale almost every seasonalholiday sale

skyrims biggest strength as a game and why it continues to be relevant and popular years after release is bethesdas support for the modding community with the ability to modify any and every aspect of the game you could imagine the opportunities available are endless and the final result a custom gameplay experience created by and for the player to put the story of skyrim simply you discover you are the legendary dragonborn of myth your fate is to stop alduin the world eater who has returned from eternal slumber resurrecting his fellow dragons with him and is set on enslaving the world the main quest line is enjoyable but with the elder scrolls series saving the world can be put on infinite hiatus if you so choose this freedom of choice is what defines skyrim and aids in multiple playthroughs with various characters i would highly recommend the avenue of modding to gain the most out of your skyrim experience this is not always easy work managing mods editing ini files resolving conflicts and troubleshooting ctds are some of the work you will face but the rewards will more than make up for it for a game released in 2011 you can transform skyrim into a beautiful masterpiece if you chose not to mod some of skyrims flaws will become apparent the ui is designed with controller support in mind and is not optimised for mouse  keyboard combat can become boring and repetitive with too simple base mechanics in place graphically some textures show their age with low res models and lighting issues missing out on all that realism and immersion   i recommend the legendary edition over the base game the individual dlcs do not get heavily discounted to date and include a decent amount of additional content certain mods will require you own all or particular dlc

skyrim is an openworld rpg set in the elder scrolls universe as the fifth installment of such a well known and influential series it is certainly the biggest and best so to speak looking at a game this large from a top down perspective would be rather difficult though so lets split it into sections shall we too long didnt read i recommend this game to somebody who wants an adventure because this game is just that focused on exploring and trying to become a part of the long elder scrolls story if you want a difficult journey that will test you as a player then maybe try monster hunter or dark souls section i the world in terms of real world size skyrim is nothing to scoff at because its total explorable world size tops out at around 148 square miles or 2381 kilometers scattered among this massive countryside are bandit encampments wolfpacks and many of baddies and treasures a major threat plaguing the land of skyrim to go without saying too much is dragons and many of these colossal beasts can be found while exploring such size can not be achieved without some downfalls and many of these include recycled voices many of the voices are recycled and many of the aforementioned bandits repeat the same tired lines and ill kill yous samey towns i personally didnt find the towns super enjoyable many of the characters seemed to have their heads mostly in the cloud and what they had to say was muddled as if some big troll walked through during the loading screen and clubbed everybody once or twice similar encounters enemies and other creatures in skyrim are placed determined by a random list this often leads to predictable and repeated enemies for example in my plathrough i was wandering through the mountains when suddenly i heard a noise behind me and found an ice troll charging towards me after a protracted battle i finally slayed it over the next hour exploring the mountains i ran into four or five more trolls of which almost every single battle went in the same direction this leads into the next point in the review section ii  combat and skills skyrims combat system is to put it frankly very simple and there is not much room for player skill in rpg games one of the main components of difficulty is the distance between player strength and avatar strength this leads to my main gripe with skyrim there is an immense gap between the two the extent of the player strength i found necessary was to mash the my left mouse button while occasionally using the shield bash skill i used after a while i grew kind of tired of my ole sword and board build so i decided to try my luck as an archer i was genuinely unimpressed by the unsatisfying archery during my first bandit encounter i decided shoot him with my bow my first shot landed dead between his eyes unfortunately this not only didnt kill him but only made him angry i shot many more arrows into face and after somewhere between seven to tenish arrows he kind of weakly slumped over needless to say i found this very unsatisfying and magic fared slightly but not much better the skill tree on the other hand impressed me quite a bit and i was pleasantly pleased with the sheer size and aesthetically appealing skill tree leveling up is satisfying and i did feel a constant drive to hit the next level and max out all my skills section iii npcs the npcs only real purpose seems to be fodder enemies and to give you quests which they certainly fulfill npcs are plentiful and almost every nonhostile npc with a name ie not bandits or guards or such has a quest for you at some point which is good and gives the player something to do at all times my biggest gripes with the npcs are the children i despise every single child in the game their voices are obnoxious and grating they all seem to share the same five or six lines and worst of all there is nothing you can do about it they are immortal to say without spoiling much one of the first towns you can visit has a jarl who is basically the ruler of the town and his kids repeat the same things every time you pass them final thoughts for a journey it works very well the world is large and lush there is plenty to do exploration is fun and there is a sense of unity the graphics are nice for its time and i personally believe they still hold up today combat eventually begins to feel dull and repetitive but that is to be expected this isnt a game focused on deep and involved combat mechanics my final rating is 810 definitely worth a purchase i hope this review is helps you decide whether or not this would be a helpful purchase for you

coming from a huge fan of the elder scrolls games skyrim wasnt a disappointment the story and concept of skyrim was interesting dark mysterious wellwritten and an enjoyable experience even through a lowquality texture here and there or a misplaced static object and black texture glitch i dont see them as that much of a problem even though at times you can mutter to yourself damn it bethesda these problems are easily fixable by the modding community the modding community of skyrim is well supported by bethesda the modding community adds a lot more content a lot more quests more npcs or certain bug fixes that bethesda overlooked skyrim is not a disappointing game for someone like me who has enjoyed oblivion and morrowind skyrim was different bethesda did a great job at making skyrim look beautiful but at the same time cold unforgiving and dangerous allinall skyrim is an epic game with a wellwritten and diverse story the dlcs were great skyrim in general is great there is not much else to say here

im not one to write reviews normally however in this case i find that this is one of my few avenues to protest the addiiton of paid mods to skyrim and indeed to steam in general modding has been part of bethesda games since daggerfall and officially supported for a long time now the environment for modding has always been set up to prevent cashing in this is important because it means that the only mods that are submitted are done by gamers to improve the game they love and not by scammers and those looking to make a quick cash grab this move can only toxify the modding environment and destroy the community that has built itself around the open and free sharing of mods i am disappointed in steam for offering this and at bethesda for allowing it as consumers the only thing we can do is to vote with our pocket books and through the messages we spread heres my message the longer paid modding is supported by steam the more ill shift my gaming purchases to other sites ive got a decent library of steam games id like to see it continuing to grow but i wont support what amounts to paying extra money for basic bug fixes that should have been implemented before the game shipped in the first place i encourage everyone else to do the same

the game is fantastic and 100% better being able to download mods and use them to spice up the game from the weird to the wonderful and i am happy to donate to the modders who are making fantastic mods instead of the goofy but fun ones but now they arent free they are paid for thanks to valvebethesdafat cats so i cannot recommend this game to anyone now httpswwwchangeorgpvalveremovethepaidcontentofthesteamworkshopu10624086 sign this petition to stop this becoming the norm

this game has the potential to be an amazing game but the inventory looks like something they threw together at the last minute and if you are using a bow the killcam is a gamebreaker and there are to my knowledge no official way to disable the killcam it is possible to fix the game using mods but without these mods the game is unplayable as a longtime fan of the elder scrolls it breaks my heart that i cant recommend this game

this is an updated review i gave it a negative review due to steam putting a paywall around the most popular mods and the workshop in general now that steam has lifted this i am willing to give the game a positive review again hopefully valve learned its lesson from modgate overall for the game the vanilla game is a fun experience but mods have made it into a game that i can delve hours into at a time without shame thank god these mods are free

90% of quests are fetch quests game breaking issues ugly graphics a horrible engine and it goes on edit valve has removed the paid mod feature i still do not recommend this game however with the use of mods you can take it from mediocore to masterpeice i dont think a game should rely on its modding community to make it playable so i am giving a thumbs down

edit the text below you can disregard but be weary it sounds like valve is going to try and add paid mods again in the future well if they didnt add paid mods i could suggest this game since modding adds countless hours of gameplay and has kept this game alive and feeling new i felt i could support mods that added more to the game but most of them are out of proportion with the cost to gameplay we are not even guaranteed that mods we pay for will work and without having a guarantee buying mods becomes a gamble for the future of the game lets set up a scenario say you paid $5 for a mod then you get a new mod that breaks the last one now you have to choose between them or as valve wants you to do ask the mod developer to fix it sure you have 24 hours to fix it but what if you bought the second mod and had some issues and the return time ended then you are stuck with a broken mod or two i could maybe see this being worth it if all the mods were top notch quality and supported till the day the mod creator dies but that wont happen and compatibility issues are sure to arise i cannot see the longevity of the mods lasting since their sales could go down and the developer doesnt want to support it since it is not bringing in a profit a lot of the top notch mods add a bunch of time to the gameplay but there is no way you can sell it if 25 people worked on it splitting the profits would be a pain and with the mod developers only getting 25% of the profit it doesnt seem feasible then there is the base mods that a lot of the mods are developed off of what would happen if one of those was to be sold on the community market you would have to buy the mod and that adds to the base cost of the game i do not want to pay for a mod that is required to run other mods because it just adds to the cost of modding i cannot see this helping the longevity of skyrim and its successors mod developers would have it better off with a donation system instead of valve and bethesda taking 75% of their profits 25% probably doesnt help the mod developer too much anyways and its a bad incentive for large developer groups

notable features villagers will defend their livestock to the death not tesonline you can wear a dress as a dude dragons probably teleport to places youve previously been more dialogue than anyone has time for dwarves update dwarves have been removed they left the dwarf dungeons in though lol probably a bug giantpowered suborbital transport warning fatal i saw this game at walmart once and i regret not buying it then because that was 2 months more of my life i had to spend without skyrim this game has nasty big spiders and is thus not for the faint of heart however those who can brave its perilous catacombs may find themselves engrossed in the worlds rich lore and complex societal dynamics or not skyrims npcs have acquired a reputation for stupidity somehow let me set the record straight their pathfinding and dialogue are both top notch for example after aiding my brave mage in slaying a dragon a guard complained about being assigned guard duty rather than an exciting job such as for example killing dragons ive never seen a character in any game with such a well programmed simulacrum of short term memory loss every npc has an assortment of such flaws integrated into their behavior which makes them feel much more human and relatable nobodys perfect after all but you have the option to stave off your crippling imperfection by buying tes v skyrim

this game is awesome i had it for the ps3 beat it and thought i would play it on my pc because its just that good i bought the bundle pack with the dlc so i am excited to play them all i dont even do the main quests i just like wandering around and going into caves etc and fighting enemies and finding some pretty sweet items most of which i sell for money did i mention dragons i love dragons it makes sad that i have to kill them but nonethless they died with honour oh and theres some pretty funny glitches

with an endless possibility of adventure and a great modding community the elder scrolls v skyrim is one of the best rpgs ever made however it suffers from rehashed dungeons and character models along with familiar scenery in some places none of that is enough to draw away from the incredible depth scale and intensity of tamriel the province of skyrim is an incredible place to trek but many of the events that happen in the game feel immersive at first before revealing themselves to be a similar if not exactly the same endeavor each time for example a fugitive runs up and gives you a sword and a threat this makes you feel like youre in a living breathing world only to have that breath extinguished when you realize itll be the same situation again and again and again as long as a fugitive needs your help rehashed content is the only drawback to an otherwise truly one of a kind rpg

i can personally attest to the fact that skyrim deserves all the hype its gotten one of my favorite aspects of the game is the fact that it isnt a mainstream overlycolorful slightly too fantasyoriented rpg that ends up being a bit cheesy instead skyrim has created a beautiful yet rugged world in which anything is possible especially with mods and provides enough realism and strategy to be intense while still being a fantastic mythical experience that leaves you awe struck and nerdgasming play this game i beg you

do i recomend this game hell yes ive been so busy playing the game i never wrote a review i have played this game far more than any other game i have tried and with all the mods from various places the game possabillites are endless i would get into some of my personal mods i am using but i will spare you the details other than possible infestations and pregnancies the balance of the vanilla game is great and it happens to be a great starter for one to play i use the creation kit to make changes so i dont have to run to town before getting half way through a single dungeon and i tried on several aspects to increase rank wise for aditional perks in different areas like for use of 4 enchantments instead of 2 but it is set up where you can only up it once not 3 times so was forced to hit 4 directly and same thing with increased carriing capacity allows for only a single upgrade to it am still a novice or i would change the base settings to add more branches off that one once you learn the controls that are quite simple game play is smooth combat is not really my thing in most games but in this game it keeps me going back for more on a regular bassis difficulty is moddable while in game even in battle to make the boss fights a bit easier if needed ok there is just too much for me to say about this game and after speaking with friends this is the last true elder scrolls game as the online version totally sucks and not even made by the same team that made this game shame shame anyway this is the game i play as my times show and will continue to grow as time wears on and new mods become available as 3rd party content i will add it to my game such asbecome a lord in my case lady should just say jarl so there is no gender differientials ok back to my game have to kill aulduin for the 10th time

skyrim is an amazing game released by bethesda 4 years ago it is the 5th game in the elder scrolls series i have only played skyrim tes 5 oblivion tes 4 and morrowind tes 3 skyrim is a game with a lot a replayability so unless you have no patience then youll enjoy it allthough it can get very repetative sometimes one of my friends describes it as going into dungeons and killing draugr the main focus is around the dragons which have returned after the oblivion crisis i highly recommend this as it is now quite cheap and so are the dlc which let you ride dragons become a vampire lord and build houses among many other things cant wait for the next elder scrolls game not online thats daylight robbery

the province of skyrim might be frigid but the roleplaying game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess in the elder scrolls v skyrim you take up arms against dragons and your encounters with them are invariably excitingyet depending on where your adventure takes you such battles may not even represent the pinnacle of your experience a side quest that starts as a momentary distraction may turn into a fullfledged tale that could form the entirety of a less ambitious game yes skyrim is another enormous fantasy rpg from a developer that specializes in them and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within if you know bethesda softworks previous games you might be unsurprised that skyrim is not a land without blemish but rather harbors any number of technical glitches and frustrating idiosyncrasies that tear open the icy veil that blankets the land many of them are ones elder scrolls fans will probably see coming but theyre ultimately a low price to pay for the wonders of a game this sprawling and enthralling prepare for many sleepless nights to come

this is my review which lists the pros and cons of the elder scrolls v skyrim for the pc ive beaten this game three times outside of steam and i dont just mean the main quest ill mainly try to review the modless version of the game but i really will try to emphasise how mods can enhance the game and every aspect of it ill try to be as descriptive and helpful as i can while still maintaining that checklist flow this should sum up just about everything that needs to be said in one review if anyone has any proscons they think i should add go ahead and tell me in the comments and ill adjust the material accordingly some of these on the list will only be recognizeable by fans of the previous elder scrolls games but theyll be subtle here goes pros the amazing open world of skyrim to explore decent and immersive story to follow for each questline graphics look simply amazing theyre not too extensive on the hardware and there are plenty of mods to enhance them fast travel is an available option once you discover a location and there are countless locations to discover epic soundtrack composed by the well known jeremy soule to enjoy countless of npcs to interact with unlike morrowind this game has more than a single digit of voice actors haha plenty of followerscompanions to follow you on your adventures tons of factions to join countless of quests sidequests and misc quests for you to do your actions choices faction activies progress etc all have an impact on skyrim its people and you a crime and effectbounty system ability to interact with the daedra princes a massive amount of items available ingame a massive amount of different creatures and enemies for you to fight and plenty of boss fights available plenty of playstyles to choose from eg warrior thief mage craftsman etc the ability to become a vampire or werewolf which is very well done both have their own skill trees tons of skills to level and expand on there are branching skill tree perks theyve added aspects to the skill tree that can expand the max level to 252 instead of the original 81 a difficulty slider for 5 different difficulties can be changed any time ingame amazing character creation eg name gender race hair eyes skin tone paintdirt facial construction etc and there are even mods to expand your options houses wife kids and pets hearthfire dlc adds extra huge houses that you can build up yourself console codes are an option you can go ahead and cheat or if youre stuck in a glitch or a bug you can go ahead and try to fix it with the console which is very useful the console does not deactivate achievements like in fallout new vegas the dlc expansions are amazing and are totally worth the price and youll clock in tons of enjoyment and hours to the game which is why i recommend the legendary edition to begin with dragonborn dlc adds solstheim to the map which past fans will remember from the bloodmoon dlc from morrowind free hd texture pack dlc available for download which is completely optional mods mods mods there are countless of mods out there for you to enjoy literally they are easy to install and they can change the whole of the game completely i cant even begin to capitalize on this pro they can change everything steam worshop integration and nexus mod manager support still a huge community steam badges trading cards backgrounds emoticons and achievements and steam sync is integrated fully mappable controls my opinion morrowind > skyrim > oblivion although newer gamers may not be able to enjoy morrowind so skyrim may be the way to go for you no cliffracers cons not as good without mods but still amazing nonetheless mods are completely optional this may be more of a con for console players i guess mods can sometimes cause ctds crash to desktop corrupt saves bugs glitches etc bugs glitches and crashes some morrowind fanboys hate on the game so you might be reading this and end up being one of them before you say anything morrowind is one of my favorite games of all time and i can admit that i like it way better than skyrim main questline is a bit short repeated npc lines can get a bit annoying there are mods to fix that though horses seem to be a bit slow and weak there are mods to fix that though becoming a vampire seems to have more cons than pros in my opinion there are mods to fix that though can become a bit op later in the game if so turning up the difficulty should help a bit might be a good thing or a bad thing a bit lacking in graphicaldisplay settings but its not that taxing and it does offer plenty of settings in the launcher dragons eventually become the new cliffracer there are mods to fix that though well that was my review of skyrim i hope i convinced you to purchase this game or maybe i convinced you not to purchase this game you never know anyways thanks for reading and i hope i was helpful in your decision or maybe i just convinced you to go ahead and get into mods hah

bethesda tends to outdue themselves with every new rendition of the elder scrolls this time its no different the vast world of skyrim will suck you in no matter who you are there is enough content to qualm anybody who is a naysayer of someone who worries at the thought of a full price purchase of course skyrim now goes on sale on an almost regular basis so essentially you get a deal of a lifetime why would you pass on that right skyrim has a myriad of spells abilities items and just stuff to do in general there is a great modding community that increases its already lengthy playtime if you are the type who enjoys content that just well never ends then youll enjoy the endless amounts of quests some npcs will grant you these npcs are generally from the guilds that return to the game  ie the dark brotherhood the mages guild etc if you recall from the previous elder scrolls of course there are some downsides to the game as any game does although the game does provide a vast and huge land a lot of it just is empty i enjoy the emptiness considering that adds realism to the game but many do not like this the problem more or less comes from the random caves houses ruins that have no relevance to them again its something i enjoy but there is a point to be made that it can appear to be just filler to keep people like myself to keep searching some old school elder scroll players may be taken aback at the fact that oblivions ability tree is gone no more acrobatics skill this isnt a bad thing its a good thing honest what it comes down to is that skyrim has adapted to changes in the way games are tailored nowadays and have removed some of the more grindy things that was associated with its predecessors all in all get this game you will not regret it

so you want to know how good of a game skyrim is do you better question is why dont you already have it joking aside skyrim is one of those games which you can sink dozens if not hundreds of hours into and not get bored or even close to finishing the game and with a vast modding community both of these ideas get completely wiped off the board for me skyrim was my first elder scrolls game and since then i have played the other four i came into this game not being too big into the whole fantasy genre and when i came out that was completely turned around game universes dont get much bigger than the tes universe as skyrim is chokefull with lore in many forms the actual questlines fully readable books npc dialougem and much more while the games actual main plot isnt all that exiting imo centering around the return of the dragons in skyrim the world clearly makes up for it and alone could suck you into this game better yet you do not need to play the other tes games to understand skyrims story not saying you shouldnt play them of course graphically speaking skyrim is quite a nice game to look at with skyrims cold harsh northern landscape many different regions are seen with their own art style a castle fortress on the peak of a hill a sprawling city in the heart of a plain and a portside town in the middle of the arctic woods crappy descriptions aside youll see a lot here the game gives a very mysterious atmosphere as you venture through dark dungeons creep through enemy fortresses and just have a nice walk on the countryside the world may not feel all too alien but graphically its varied with its viking and medieval inspiration the only honest complaint i have is that small smaller items such as ropes arent that pretty to look at but mods always come into play with these problems gameplay oh boy skyrim is an openworld actionadventure rpg with sandbox elements mixed in as well you fight with swords battleaxes daggers from behind bows spells that can incinerate your foes and shouts that can hurl enemies far away while combat doesnt involve to many stratagies keep attacking your opponent while keep you distance or blocking their moves it is nonetheless enjoyable to fight through the many foes encountered magic on the other hand is a blast especially when combining spells or using them in conjunction with melee weapons ranged weapons are fun to use when being a stealthoriented character so there are a lot of choises you have when combating opponents as for enemy types theres a lot as well youll commonly fight bandits and wolves on the side of roads the undead draguar and skeletons in dungeons and even vampires and trolls when venturing out of course there are also the dragons these are fought by chance anywhere outside and usually take a lot of hits to take down unfortunately the stratagy of what should be a fun scenario is merely to attack the dragon when its on the ground and dodge its fire and to attempt to shoot it while in the air waiting for it to land again all dragons follow this system which is slightly disapointing as for exploring youll have a lot to find in skyrim new dungeons are scattered across the landscape as well as some truely unique characters that venture out one in particular all while listening to the games excellent soundtrack reflecting the mythical and harsh land that skyrim is i should mention that i have only scratched the surface of what the game has to offer and if youre interested get it and find out for yourself which will be quite a pleasant experience if you arent try it anyways you might find yourself immediatly immersed and impressed as i was if i had to rate skyrim i would give it a 9510 i should also add that skyrim has one of the best modding communities out there and even its own workshop here on steam even so id recommend going on nexus instead its just as easy has far more mods the biggest ones are on nexus nine times out of ten and doesnt have the file size restrictions like here on the workshop of course you should at least be familiar with what you think about the game before modding and going on from there mods i would recommend include skyui the vanilla games ui is ugly helgen reborn falskaar and frostfall which is on the workshop

4 years ago bethesda released a game skyrim it was pretty good won some awards but got old pretty fast especially since once the hype wore off anyone could see it was chock full of bugs but there was no need to worry as the pc gaming community had been making mods for games since as long as anyone could remember these mods increased the quality and replayability of skyrim which drew some people to buy skyrim solely for the mods creating a winwin for the consumers and producers everything was peachy consumers would pay bethesda for the halffinished game they made and then download a few files that anyone can make to add lightsabers or horse genitals or what have you to their game fast forward 4 years despite a few nice and pricey dlcs made by good ol bethesda the base game itself was still quite broken and mods were still basically necessary to get a satisfactory gaming experience so what do the geniuses at bethesda do tired of actually working on things to sell they had the great idea to sell things that other people made i mean from a business perspective it makes total sense why should a restaurant owner worry about offering good food or improving items already on his menu if he could just charge people to sit down and eat sandwiches they brought with them sure thats not a perfect analogy but it helps get the point across of how ridiculous this is i still remember the outrage surrounding the horse armor dlc for oblivion when it came out there were plenty of arguments about the future of gaming but few could have predicted a day when communitymade mods would be hidden behind a paywall with cuts of modders work going to our good buddies bethesda and valve praise gaben right pc master race right with the recent absurdities of day1 dlc preorder bonuses always online drm social media integration earlyaccess games and now paid mods i cant help but fear for the future of pc gaming were already seeing earlyaccess mods with the price increasing as work supposedly progresses but youre still expected to pay for an unfinished product in the meantime whats next paid subscriptions for mods will companies continue to churn out halfbaked games knowing that not only will they be able to charge more via preorder bonuses limited editions season passes but also charge for the work of other people no this review is not about being poor or greedy or not wanting to support modders believe it or not people were free to support whatever modders they wanted with however much money they wanted and this system worked just fine in fact id be curious to know how many supporters of this new paid mod system actually donated to modders before it was mandatory what its about is the destruction of one of the last bastions of traditional pc gaming that is the free modding community largely at the hands of this games creators i do not recommend buying this game if you havent before paid mods were introduced because if you do youre giving your vote of approval to what bethesda and valve are doing but who am i kidding just as the horse armor outrage died out and useless cosmetic dlcs are now regarded as the norm i bet a year or two from now people will marvel at the fact that there was a time when mods were free i just hope this review isnt censored by the saviors of pc gaming like so many other criticisms of this have been

i have heard of this game before a lot so when i had 20$ in my steam wallet i said hey skyrim checked some trailers and gameplay vids and nah not my thing then i had a spontaneous rush of blood to the head and bought it started playing itwas hard for me to get hooked on since i have never played this kind of game before but honestly the detail the graphics the detail the ideas the detail and the length of the entire thing make this my alltime favorite game though im sure there are games out there that i have and will play longer than skyrim skyrim is the game of the decade that will go down in all big books you have to play this before you die

skyrim is probably one of my favorite games i have played it on the xbox ps3 and pc and all i can say is wow the game is great  it has an awesome plot graphics and interesting mods because however i have played it on different consoles it is annoying to have to restart and then proceed to get through all the cutscenes and quests i have completed so many times before but time and time again i find myself dealing with the struggle and continuing where i left off previously and strangely enjoying every minute of it this game has a few flaws but if you like rpgs get this game now 9510

why i love skyrim i was playing and looking for this dungeon so im riding along the night on my horse coming near the dungeon i see some lights flickering on my left side deciding i can ignore the dungeon a little longer i was going to check it out upon arrival i noticed it was a village with a ghost on a ghost horse sitting in the middle of the village trying to kill it i saw i did no damage on him so i got back on my horse i and decided to follow it whilst following the ghost i came across a freaking dragon rising up form his grave deciding i had to kill see where this ghost was going i ignored the dragon and went by as fast as i could still following the ghost i noticed by now he had no head still following the ghost i came across a bandit ambush trying to flee from this as well they dropped a boulder from a bridge ontop of my horse sprinting away as fast as i could i kept following the ghost but now on foot finally the headless horseman stops at this tomb kinda looking thing as i look around a bit the ghosts vanquishes and im now alone in the tomb killing a few skeletons i see the ghosts his grave after getting the loot and having exhausted my next options i decided to go back to the village where i met the headless horseman for the first time to go find my dungeon from there on back at the village the same dragon i saw resurrected earlier flies by and attacks it killed him and went to my dungeon afterwards this just happend to me this game is fcking amazing

having spent many hours days weeks  playing skyrim i finally feel qualified to report that it is without doubt one of the best games available on steam the vanilla game is very good but where this addition excels is in the mods and the modding community attached to it with over 8000 mods you can play as anyone from an immortal god sent to save the planet to a serial  and murderer intent on destroying it i have been both and anyone or anything you can think of in between be warned though this one will consume you and your time having cut me teeth on tes iv oblivion i had high hopes for this sequal and it did not disappoint if you consider yourself a true gamer or have ever wondered what it would be like to really live another life within or outside the law skyrim is a must have

warning you may experience a loss of time while playing this game i have this game on both console and pc and hands down its much more enjoyable to play on pc im not a fan of the default ui user interface but there is some pretty good uis available for download in the workshop with the default ui aside the gameplay is very smooth with the option to switch between first and third person pov the music for the game is simple brilliant especially when fighting dragons and kicking back in a inn if you are yet to play this game i strongly recommend it

would happily recomend this game normally but unfortunately cant after valve and bethesdas new modding policies and reactions to criticisms of said policies
not recommended
this used to be a good game but then it took an arrow to the knee mods that once were free are now paid ill pass
not recommended
paid mod practice by valve already caused servere legal issues besides of exessively demanding 75% of the revenew demandet for mods by valve ruining the modding scene with many moders saying they would rather give mods for free than having valve have 75% of the rev also false clames on mods and stealing mods from others in order to get paid causes nothing but a repulsive inviroment in which consumer and developer loose but also those who create additional content
not recommended
this game was great thanks to its modding community which fixed bugs the developer was unwilling to fix added severalorders of magnitude more content and functionality than the developer ever bothered to and of much higher quality bethesda  zenimax and valve have stuck a death blow to that community with the extremely greedy and illconceived addition of paid modding which has divided the modding community forced most of the modders to remove their creations for fear of them being stolen hidden some of the essential mods behind a paywall and generally dissuading anyone with any sense from modding or using a mod as long as this foolishness persists this is no longer a game i can support  bethesda zenimax and valve are no longer companies i can support if you care about games and about gamers do not support them and even less give them money

played it coming from fallout new vegas the story was uninteresting cliche fantasy story sidequests which seem to be the meat of the game werent much better whenever i talk to others about this game they say mods mods mods which to me says if a game needs to be modded to be enjoyable then its not a very fun game oh and since mods now are for pay i see little reason for someone who doesnt have to get it

what on earth are you doing here valve

corporate greed has torn apart what was a seamless and thriving community that worked together to improve and enhance this game with the introduction of paid mods the modding community has transformed into a dlc market modder and user has now become seller and buyer respectively and as such the relationship between the two will change it wont be users providing constructive feedback or fellow modders working together to enhance and integrate each others mods it will be buyers dishing out scorn and criticism while expecting a high standard to meet the price it will be modders competing for more money which will inevitably result in less cooperation and integration of multiple mods and what was it all for 25% it remains to be seen how many modders actually lack the self respect to dignify their own work with blatant robbery

skyrim is a reasonably good rpg engine with a significant backdrop of lore and setting unfortunately it is by itself not up to par with modern games its graphics reliability and depth are considerably lacking to counteract these tendencies skyrim used to support a powerful modding systems mods like the unofficial patches and graphics mods could significantly improve the experience and transform skyrim in the game it could have been it thus came as a sad news that valve and bethesda have decided to launch paid mods for skyrim major mods that used to be free are now paid or announced to become paid in a short while this immensely changes the value proposition of skyrim instead of purchasing a decent rpg engine with a great modding community you are now buying access to an rpg engine and an expensive mod repertoire that will run you a pretty penny if you want to mod skyrim into being a game fit for 2015 buying skyrim even at full price at launch was a somewhat reasonable perspective because you could count on a modding community that would turn the game into a worthy title and continue to expand on it greatly buying skyrim now or any future tes game that supports this paid mod system is completely unreasonable you would have to pay several times the cost of the game to get enough mods for a decent experience and thats unacceptable and not something i would spend my money on

its official the golden age of the steam workshop has come to an end with the addition of mods that require you to pay real money to access them there is absolutely no reason besides the skyrim nexus to make you want to legitimately buy a copy of the game instead of pirating it the number one reason people paid for this game was the amazing modding community it has thats been active since its launch in 2011 if you want to mod you skyrim go to the skyrim nexus theres just as many if not more mods on it and its completely free mod authors are already releasing fake mods that do nothing to edit your game but cost money all in all its a scam to steam users and to real mod authors god help us if they do the same thing to any other workshops
not recommended
valve introduced paid workshop mods for skyrim as a result changing my review to negative you dont get to charge people for mods and try to sell them as dlc valve people can and should support mod creators via donations and a buy me a coffee button on the workshop page would be good but putting them behind a pay wall is god damn atrocious hoping valve and other responsible parties for this new practice will turn around

i cant recommend this game anymore due to valve and bethesdas idea that it was a good idea to destroy the modding community and further the destruction of video games as a whole skyrim is not a finished game without many mods and they are now taking 75% of all mods sold for their greed including deciding what the price is for the mods and how much the modders get  see httpsarchiveishdfxi they want to steal the work of the community people are stealing the works of others big modding teams will now argue over who gets what etc furthermore this is a dangerous path this could set up the route to mods no longer being the sole works of the creators but the work of the game devs as contributions this could lead to tons of legal insanity with mods including work of other games such as popular armor mods or even among modders if bethesda doesnt come out and say no its our game so the mods are ours or even paid licenses to mod then other companies will follow suit and bottleneck out sites such as nexus and drive down user traffic it is no longer a labor of love or to finish games that shouldve been finished on launch such as skyrims terrible ui game devs now want you to pay them to do what they shouldve done people who say its optional dont realize that there is no reason to not charge for mods if this practice becomes a mainstay itd be the state that early access is now and whats even more unfathomable that mods have a 24 hour return policy when valve wont allow this for regular games that shouldve had it such as plenty of ubisofts abortions people who agree with this practice are nothing short of delusional there are way too many terrible outcomes to come out of this instead of good ones you want to have an option for donations sure i have donated before this is something completely else entirely those saying nonmodders dont have a right to complain well theyre customers now i guess you didnt think about that i guess you didnt think about the hell customers can bring this is the end of video games there is no love left in my heart there are no heroes left in man crash this plane with no survivors you were the chosen one gaben

great game but for some crazy reason steam has decided to introduce paid mods the key issue with paid mods 1  mods can have compatability issues with other mods and good luck knowing that before buying the mod 2  the refund period is only for 24 hours so if the game is updated and breaks the mods you have bought well tough luck 3  we have to ask nicely to get any issues solved the consumer is completely screwed over in this arrangement apart from the recent issues this game is great

skyrim is an alright game the world is huge and you can play the game for a very long time although it falls flat due to lack of depth and poor gameplay since release people have been modding the game to fix a lot of its issues but you already know where this is going if you want to play an elder scrolls game i would recommend getting morrowind or oblivion instead both are a lot better than skyrim i even suggest trying out fallout 3  new vegas instead as those games are excellent and my favorite bethesda games to date

545 hours on record and im saying dont get this why ill tell you why its a mess that gets boring after the first ten levels or ten hours whatever comes first lies after lies during the development stage copy pasted dungeons and endless repeating enemies ive personally experienced many problems such as buggy ai glitching ui and of course rare items simply dropping through the map theres a joke when it comes to bethesda games that it takes the modders to fix everything recently it seems that bethesda took this even more literally than it shouldve been taken as paid mods really possibly the worst kick in the teeth is the fact that the modder who has put in any degree of effort to make this mod im not saying every mod is a hand crafted masterpiece only gets 25% the rest is divided up and given to valve for hosting 30% hosting is rather stupid and to bethesda for making the game 45% mods will make this game somewhat fun but hurry while you can still afford the game and some nice mods to go along with it

i used to love skyrim there was a day when i could frolick through the snowy fields around windhelm wielding a 2handed dawnbreaker and shooting rainbows from my eyes i have owned this game on ps3 in the past but one i turned over to the master race the very first game i bought was skyrim due to its vast modding potential that potential has been torn asunder by the lack of foresight and the sheer greed shown by both bethesda and valve i am shocked nay  i am dismayed by valves move to attempt to monetise on the modding community mods have always been the main benefit to pc which put it head and shoulders ahead of consoles until such a day that this is fixed valve and bethesda will not be getting any of my money and i will actively push potential customers away from it

not too long ago i would consider this a game that almost every pc gamer needed to play even if they didnt enjoy the base experience the fact the the modding community was so large that you could turn skyrim into another experience where the base game ment null skyrim has become more of a platform the relies on the modding community rather then a standalone game however as we know steam now want 75% of the money that mod users its not economically viable to make mods as anything other then a side hobby and who knows how many of these mods are stolen from places like the mod nexus ect for example i have around 80 mods from the nexus and had around 20 from the workshop buying the skyrim base game  the expansions  even if we assume a single mod is a 1150$ id expect to pay 120 180$ who in their right mind thinks that even skyrim and all its mods are worth that worst bit is most of my mods are graphic improvements or immersion mods and as we see with wet and cold charging 3355$ i believe if all my graphical and immersion mods were of the same price the average would be well above 1 $150 this game any game is not worth that much money for the full experience i simply cannot reccomend this game for a such a stupid amount of money regardless of how many times you put it up for sale steam

this game is good what it means is not yesterday valve allowed paid mods for this game the start of somthing bigger usercreated dlc without quality controll we all know that valve got useless quality controll this is a step worse then dlcs in general for the future of steam revert this this is the begining of the end otherwise also at the same time they allow people to play skyrim for free for a few days just to get some impresive statistics to show people love it this is sutch a duchbag thing to do i defended you valve for over 10 ing years i fought for you you was considerd the king of pc gaming and look at you now richer sure but i lost all my respect for you if you keep walking down this path you will single handely add a new tag in piracy pirated mods dont that sound ing dirty if anything valve do the right thing stop this before it is to late

this game was made great by mods and the modding community through those mods it remained relevant and purchased far longer than it otherwise would have but bethesda and valve are now willing to destroy that community and in valves case potentially destroy the modding communities of countless other current and future games in order to wring the last drops from the cash cow if youre considering buying this game right now you should keep your wallet closed until and unless valve and bethesda admit their mistake and put the paid workshop to sleep skyrim without mods is a mere shadow of the game youve heard people talk about and in the near future it could cost many times the base purchase price to mod it properly

i have been playing and modding this game since 2011 it was great but now valvethesda have introduced paid mods i already paid for the game and the dlc as if that wasnt enough theres also the issue that modders only receive 25% of the mod revenue ridiculous 010 instead of a paywall we should have an optional `donate` button where 100% of the money goes directly to the modder another reason for the negative review is that the game by itself is incomplete and full of bugs and you have to fix those problems by installing a bunch of mods like content mods hd texture packages equipment creatures companions quests gameplay fixes bug fixes etc

modding is like being friends with a person you do things for them because you like them  you dont expect to get paid for it but you wont say no if they buy you a sixpack of beer out of gratitude either youre grateful theyre grateful the friendship is amazing but valve wants to destroy that they want to replace sure ill mow your lawn and you watch my dogs when im in spain with ill mow your lawn for 20$ so i can hire a dog sitter for my vacation ps the dogsitters agency takes 15 of those 20 dollars what kind of friendship is that none

i write this articel from the perspective of someone that bought this game to mod it i own and loved the vanilla game on xbox but felt i was missing so much due to not having access to modding i have loved my experience so far with the modded game but with the new changes to the workshop towards paid mods i no longer feel i can support this product great game terrible treatment of the fan base
not recommended
do not buy developer extremely greedy unless you buy it only for the basegame which is kinda fine i guess wait no dont buy

so the company that created the first dlc decided figured that the vibrant modding community which kept their games living ought to pay them for the privilege to do so well them and steam i dont think i have seen a company throw away its hard earned good will so quickly and so catastrophically i cant imagine the state of gaming a few years down the track when they release their paid bug fix system hell theyll probably get the community to do it for them and demand a 75% cut
not recommended
this game would be a must have on pc if it wasnt for the monetization of mods which pretty much has ruined what made this game great in the first place with out the abillity to mod your game for free i cant recommend it to anyone and woulod actually recommend against it and any other game where enjoyment is primarily through mods
not recommended
i loved this game and spent a fair amount of time with mods implementing paid mods is disgusting even more disgusting since it already has a insane amount of mods on the internet

once upon a time there was a game called the elder scrolls v skyrim it was a very good game with a loving creative community around it that community was now ruined by the pay4mods plague brought by the joint efforts of the evil valve and bethesda this game supports paid mods i do not you dont get to charge people for mods and try to sell them as dlc valve hiding mods behind a paywall is just disgusting why not a optional donation button valve you even have the balls to take 75% of the profits made if someone buys a mod while the creator gets only 25% now how the  do you think the creator of the mod is gonna keep making said mods when you give them the ing black  of steam in their  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuzakeddtoum for those who read this please note skyrim is an amazingly fun game to play ps i know i dont have a lot of hours on this game but trust me i have played this game for a loooong time on my xbox 360

please stop make a great modding community fight paid contact mods have angered so many of your now betrayed fans i beg you to remove it soon pleasepretty please with a cherry on top for the good of the modding community i dont think anyone should get skyrim until this is taken out
not recommended
fun game but this review is negative to have an impact against paid mods edit valve removed the feature but will try again in the future which is still bad edit the paid mod feature has been removed this is a step in the right direction however it is only a step in the announcement that paid mods would be removed the poster said we think this made us miss the mark pretty badly even though we believe theres a useful feature somewhere here we still need to communicate that they not only missed the mark they hit a bystander they should not try again this review will stay negative to show that we will still not stand for paid mods of any kind whatsoever
not recommended
never forget april 23  april 27 2015 steam tried to screw over the gaming community with paid mods let this review serve as a reminder to anyone who forgets
not recommended
i do not recommend this game when they support paying for mods mods not dlc shove it up yer 
not recommended
it is a shame this game had to make such a turn for the worse so much later this game was quite great and with a strong modding community it was far better but now with the modding community torn to shreds different camps on the paid vs notpaid side the pure chaos that has been introduced due to valve and bethesda introducing paywalls for modifications with no consumer assurance of the product working this game has lost the value it once held the elder scrolls has been a bastion of modding greatness and i suppose in that way it is fitting that it would also help bring about the destruction of such a strong and active community
not recommended
i can only hope other games dont follow the terrible decision to add paid mods to skyrim dont plan to buy any bethesda titles in the future if this is the way theyre going
not recommended
the paid workshop mods are unacceptable

paid mods are removed therefore im rerecommending this game

paid mods are to be removed so i am changing back to recommending it

so many hours of endless fun i preordered and played at least 120 hours on ps3 then when i made the switch to pc i torrented it and played at least 270 hours and now ive bought the game on pc and i still am finding it entertaining so many interesting stories within this game this is a game that actually deserves a 910 but with mods and dlc it earns an easy 1010

the elder scrolls v skyrim is everything gamers expected and more as the followup to oblivion arguably one of the best rpgs of all time people expected a lot and bethesda delivered thats not to say that skyrim is without problems far from it fortunately there is so much good in all of skyrim that the problems are easy to ignore ill start off by saying that if you didnt like the combat in previous elder scrolls games you probably arent going to change your mind with skyrim that being said combat has changed fairly significantly the biggest change is in the addition of dual wielding in previous games you could assign a onehanded weapon and a shield or a twohanded weapon and then add a magic attack via right bumper in skyrim you have far more freedom to equip what you want basically everything that uses one hand can be equipped as long as you have a hand available also magic now counts as using up an equipped hand what this means is you can use two onehanded weapons to dual wield at the expense of blocking sword and shield of which the shield now has attacks of its own such as shield bashing a sword and magic spell or two magic spells all of these combinations also feel much weightier and no longer feel like the crowbar from halflife hits feel like hits magic spells feel like they are doing significant damage and blocking gives you a sense of danger avoided if you do go the melee route youll still get a bit of a sense of button mashing but its still a big step up from oblivion rating viking life 9510

i doesent matter how many bandits you kill dragons you slay how many times you save the world every time you greet a ing npc they will ing insult you and ask you to go and get their ing trinket in some god damn dungeon all the way across the ing map and when you go back the the same npc they will greet you whit the same insult and walk away 10\10

if u love rpg games and open world this is it this is it i have spent 105 hours on this game and im still not bored and i have probably played it like 3 times and i still love it there is so much to do finish the story do side missions finish the side missions go and help some people finished helping people get some mods for more missions or more finished getting the mods then wait how there is millions of mods and even if u did get all of them wait for new ones this game is endless so just get it
recommended
one of the best games ive played in a while in this century theres not many games that have the feature of long term play by this i mean that i want a game that i can play even after i complete the main story line and still have fun in the game and this is just it better than farcry24 where there are side missions skyrim is full with diffrent ways to complete the story and different ways to play in general there are many characters you can play as different skills you can master at and overall the game is just a thrill i recommend this game for anyone who is in for semirelaxing games but also want some action you can have either in skyrim added to all of that there are so many steam workshop mods that you can subscribe to if theres something in the game that you dont exactly like make the game twice as good worth every penny and more

a few days ago i heard that mods were being monetized and i would have thought you were crazy no one in a million years would i think something like this would happen from the very first moments i started playing on my pc mods were an amazing experience and addition to any game no matter who you ask mods have been the best thing to ever come out of pc gaming and make me proud to enjoy the games that i played and interact with the community as i followed modders and watched them transform a good game into a great one each modder had their own unique ideas and anyone who wanted to add something more had a chance to they could shine and present their talent to the thousands of people who would support them and back them and its been one of the best things i have ever experienced while playing games jump ahead to this week and i was absolutely amazed by the decision to make money off of mods like this while i would back any kind of donations or compensation for hard work by a modder this was way worse people could easily steal and make very lazily any kind of mod they want and sell it for a quick buck if it is broken or not it was quite the disaster and many people were clearly taking advantage of it the outcry from the community was amazing in how everyone banded together to fight back against this system which really didnt make much sense any implementation could have been way better than how this came out and many people were furious finally today i am very glad to say that bethesda and valve are backing down from their decision and there are no paid mods now rather than completely trash them for what they did there should be support seen for a much better idea that doesnt make the community go absolutely ballistic like they did any thing like a donate button would be greatly appreciated by the community to support the mod developers we love so much this entire fiasco shows the importance of a healthy modding community and shows just how supportive and close we all are as a gaming community where we will take no  a truly great game made amazing by the people who play it

they admitted they were wrong about paid mods the game itself is amazing but the mods make it legendary

do not buy this game some mod creators are charging steam fun bux for their mods its like homemade dlc and dlc in itself is bad remember when mods for pc games were free apparently valve and bethesda forgot update valve lifted the pay wall for usercreated mods but dont start thinking its over this will happen again dont buy games with workshop support
not recommended
real cash required for mods that should be free its one thing to have a donate button for people who wish to support the mod creators but to force a paywall onto the workshop is ridiculous why have you betrayed us lord gaben

what valve are doing is creating a system where people who actually want to make stuff for free cant because other people will steal the mods and put them on steam to sell thus making an unfair profit while the modder loses out on valuable exposure for their work and development time which was based on an ethos that says if you create for free and give out for free then others will do the same now this work space is under attack by the system that valve has created because it makes their environment hostile to the modders work space the mod creators are now prey to predators who will steal their work and profit on it unfairly this isnt about valve making money on mods its about destroying the community of sharing in order to monetise everything as much as they can
not recommended
mods are something that should be free not paid for especially when modders only get 25% of the money and no way to prove a mod is yours
not recommended
if youre looking for a game where you can easily sink into an epic land of fantasy and adventure skyrim is the game youre looking for this is honestly the best game ive ever played and ive played a lot of great games skyrim gives you plenty of options which gives you a unique sense of freedom you dont see in most games another great thing about skyrim is the plot skyrims plot is one of the most epic storylines youll ever see in a game
recommended
25 % of the money goes to the modder 75% to valve and bethesda no just no
not recommended
as someone who loves to screw other people without consent ive gotta say im really loving the new direction valve has taken with screwing their costumer base despite the constant screams to stop but i still cant recommend the game wholeheartedly until gaben stops being so coy about it and shows up in person to have his way with my unwilling newbille boy booty
not recommended
paid mods will ruin steam
not recommended
somehow bethesda and valve managed to tear apart a 14 year old tightly knit community overnight with the introduction of the paid mod system whether or not this decision and feature rollout will completely annihilate the ability to freely mod elder scrolls games in the future is yet to be determined but as it stands now this new system is doing far more harm than good to what had previously been a global family of mod authors and players nice job guys ya done ed up

not recommended
i really liked playing skyrim and i liked it especially for the mods but i think valvebethesda are ruining the game right now by monetising mods there are lots of pros and cons mentioned in the last days which are pros modders earning money  the mod is property of the modder if he decides to share it for free its his choice if he decides you can only play his mod on tuesdays its his choice and if he decides to earn money with it its once again his choice getting modders to create expensive mods  developing mods costs a lot of time and time is money so why not support your local modder sometimes they even use motion capture of sound studios and those surely dont come for free lots of money for valvebethesda  hey you got someone else to do the work for you and you just get 75% of the share cons you only get 25% of the income as a modder  really how do you justify taking 75% of the profit from someone elses work imaging paying 75% taxes on your income i bet you would start looking for ways of financial fraud because 75% feels like working for someone else yeah you valve are providing the platform workshop and the servers and you bethesda are providing an editor to the modder but all those things you did years before for free no working protection against theft everyone can upload mods they dont even have to be the creator they just take a mod of nexus upload it on the workshop and put a nice price on it no working quality assurence theres no way of knowing a mod is goodbug free before playing it sure there are user ratings but someone has to be the first to buy it nobody will develop huge mods for money if im planning to earn money by creating mods i can either create 20 small mods for 2$ than a big one for 40$ the risk of failing with one big project is bigger than failing with lots of smaller ones the great expensionlike mods will still be developed for free by enthusiasts the mod may be broken after a patch usually there are three options 1 the original modder will bring an update 2 you cant use the mod any longer 3 the mod has become an ophran and someone else adopts and updates it this works with free mods because its not about the money option 1 everythings fine 2 gamers are  because they paid for something which is broken 3 the creator is  because someone else is earning money with their work youre asking money for something that has always been free this feels like dlcs 20 i listed the point for completeness i think paying respect for someones work is right and therefore support the general option for modders to ask for money but by taking 75% youre sending the wrong signal its not about supporting the modders but personally getting rich on someone elses labour how to fix it 90% of the share belongs to the modder he put a lot of time and effort in it he is keeping the game alive and therefore should get the lions share valvebethesda is earning enough by new players expiriencing new mods quality assurrence you get a full refund within the first hour and 50% refund within the first 24h

the core game is decent but the most important thing this game and its predecessors has been the great modding community they made it a much more valuable experience to me i would not have enjoyed the game nearly as much without the mods and being able to test and use them freely was a lot of fun i think the decision to place usermade fixes and patches to your game behind a pay wall especially when you take most of the profits is horribly wrong it is a terrible business decision and could have unforeseen consequences on the modding community in the future

the elder scrolls is probably the best rollplaying game series i have ever played in my opinion only the witcher series could rival with the elder scrolls skyrim plot it is absolutely brilliant history of dovahkiin will totally absorb every fan of rpg games for even on hundreds of hours i am amazed by the world of skyrim its open world with a hundreds of side quests whose number we can enlarge by three dlc and many modifications graphic and soundtrack stand on a really good level i would recommend skyrim to anyone who wanna chill with game
recommended
out of the box skyrim is a fairly mediocre game with a large and interesting world but crippled by boring gameplay massive bugs console controls and poor graphics thankfully the community has created a huge number of mods that go a long way toward rectifying these problems if youre prepared to spend a few dozen hours fiddling with mods buy skyrim and you will get many hundreds of hours of entertainment otherwise you will be severely disappointed do yourself a favor and use the skyrim nexus [wwwnexusmodscom] to download mods instead of the steam workshop it will save you many hours in the long run if you need help assembling your collection of mods step [wikistepprojectcom] is a good place to start

skyrim is known as one of the best games since it has won over 200 awards not a lot of people remember the original elder scrolls but they dont rememberknow how good the original elder scrolls are this comes to skyrim a very long game if you buy the offical prime guide there is 1134 pages no joke its real you play as a prisioner that by luck escape from a dragon who destryoed the town ur in the game is like a medival time scenery you can literally do watever you want even kill someone for no reason but youdo get a bounty from the nearest city which is not very fun considering if theres 5 guards fighting you since this game is extremelly long only like 2% from all systems actually beat this game 100% and they may have around 2000 to 6000 hours yes its that dam long so hope you enjoy this game and remember pickpocketkilland rob everyone just kidding dont do it unless you want skill points

next to morrowind is skyrim the best entry in the elder scrolls series great graphics a working combat system even though improvements were possible a beautiful landscape and lots of ways to spend your time the only thing that is really annoying is the main quest line it stands in stark contrast to many side quests which really felt like you were involved in small adventures as a normal inhabitant of the fantasy world but the main quest was just more of the chosen one saves the world and the mysterious evil threatens to destroy the world i prefer a smaller scale of magnitude personally

i think pretty much all of you would enjoy this game give it a try but i should probably offer a word or two of warning  feed your pets  draw closed the shades  say goodbye to your friends and family this game will ruin your life but in a good way

dude skyrim is the ing best its the 5th game in the elder scrolls series although they arent all connected directly based hundreds of years apart huunnndreeeeddssss of quests that are interactive and often decided by your choices you can basically create your class to your liking because there are no actual classes if you wanna duel wield swords and be a swift fighter go ahead warmage sure heavy brute @$ yea a mix of it all up to you and then besides weapons there is a ing huge set of skills that you can pick and choose from like a in goose eating crumbs tons of options man plus it has ing dragons and thats just the in vanilla if you get this  on pc you can get thousands of ing rad mods that make the make even better get this ing game play it enjoy it

skyrim the game is just as epic as its name even though it is the name of a providence of the north most of the people you will come across will be nord since it is their homeland i loved every bit of this game i played it on several different consoles it has a lot of reply value and endgame value depending on what you do until you complete the main quest line the story line is really epic there are so many quests to do so many places to explore and almost endless things to do especially with the mod community you are dragonborn you have dragons blood running through your veins which seperates you from most people in the game your shouts shake mounts and roar through valleys the best thing you could ever do in gaming is slay dragons these dragons have very specifically qualities and designs the best effort bethesda has ever done you must slay alduin who wants to burn the world burn who doesnt want to fight dragons the lore is quite something so many different books to read stories to be heard and challenges to be adventured if any of you had played oblivion then you must know umbra which umbra was also in morrowind i used to really love that soul absorbing sword that filled soul gems for the enchants in one of the lore books it was mentioned that heshe had died 500 years prior to the starting events of skyrim it was a very sad day when i read that book she was my favorite npc to slaughter now it has become the guards for those repetitive arrow in the knee lines arrow in the knee what about arrow in the face the graphics are enchanting and mesmorizing ive always been a fan of water textures in video games and this blew me away the rivers and their currents the waterfalls and their pools below the cliffs to the largest mountains the cities to the religious temples the labryinths to the hidden sanctuaries no matter how many times you play you will always admire the beauty art work and time that was put into this game one of the best rpgs of alltime 65 if you are an rpg fan this game is for you

1010 skyrim is such an epic action fantasy rpg it quickly became a much more popular addition to mainstream culture than previous elder scrolls chapters had targeting a broader audience by introducing dragons to the series bethesda did superb work with chapter v skyrim and raised the bar again with exceptional story telling voice acting original musical score and 100 hours gameplay check out the workshop to enhance the experience

skyrim is a game that i was massively excited for on its release of 111111 i originally bought the game on playstation 3 but due to lag a save bloating problems i decided to pick it up on pc instead my experience was instantly improved and its a game that over a year on im still playing regularly mods are what really make the pc version of this game special and they make it possible to play through the game several times having a different experience very time seeing as this disc activates on steam youll be able to use steams skyrim workshop to install mods at the push of a button or you can alternatively use a modding website like skyrim nexus to find mods that might not be on the workshop the game itself features hours upon hours of gameplay with loads of quests dungeons and loot available to you you can do the main quest to reveal your inner dragonborn side with the assassins of the dark brotherhood join the warriors at the companions practise magic at the college of winterhold and steal things for the thieves guild my personal favourite quests are the daedric quests which have you doing deeds for godlike people in return for powerful items the game also has two available dlc packs dawnguard and hearthfire with a new one dragonborn out soon if youre into modding you can download the skyrim creation kit for free and do just about anything you can think of or you can just find what you desire among the plethora of mods already available i think every pc gamer should own this game if you dont like something within the game theres probably a mod to fix it and you can guarantee to see some exciting content in the future

let me clear things up by assuring you that none of the quest bugs graphical issues gameplay glitches or unexplained crashes ive encountered can change the fact that i played this amazing rpg for well over 400 hours and absolutely loved every single moment of it this game is absolutely fantastic and fascinating even after years of playing this game it doesnt fail to surprise and amaze me but the thing that really brings skyrim to life is its modding community there are millions of great mods out there waiting to be explored if youre new to modding or dont even know what that means id suggest visiting a youtube channel called gophersvids you can find tons of recommendations and instructions on how to make your skyrim experience unforgettable and now to cap it up id say that you must buy and play this game if youre even slightly interested in roleplaying games

the recent actions of valve and bethesda made me give this a negative review sadly the game itself is unfinished with a heap of bugs and errors these bugs and errors have been patched for free by the modding community in addition to this the huge modding community has kept this game alive and popular these years giving bethesda a nice flow of money from people still buying their game but they wanted more the idea of modders getting paid for their quality work is fine but when bethesda and valve demand 75% of the profit for doing nothing except providing a place to host noncurated and the tools to make the mods imagine a carpenter having to pay the company that made his tools 75% of his paycheck or a taxi driver paying 75% of his paycheck to the company that made the car this sort of nonsense is accepted here but never anywhere else id understand a meager 10% cut or so because of the hosting and whatnot but they seem blinded by their greed skyrim is epic but with greedy companies like these its hard to justify buying this game

i have put many hours into bethesdas latest elder scrolls game and i can confidently say its great explore the vast wilderness of the nordic homeland or relax in one of the many populated holds the game offers complete quests in a variety of ways resulting in great value just create another character yes you have to play through the same helgen part over and over again and set forth on your quest the amount of choice in the game is spectacular for open world rpg lovers change your characters eyebrows and ears to degrees of precision that i never thought possible many of the larger questlines have a set path for you to follow with smaller choices along the way whilst side quests let you choose usually from 2 options which path to take mods are a great way to keep things interesting not only can you change the game in ways that give it a whole new feel but you can just tweak things like textures or weapon appearance for a relatively small amount you can add in solstheim or fort dawnguard to your world and enjoy the new threats and adventures the world holds or give up your dragon fighting ways hang up your daedric armour and start a family giving skyrim a new generation of dragonborn if it is genetic

a very fun game with a superb modding community however we should probably remember the paid mods and how gamers united against them

while the game is fantastic skyrim became what it is today from its extensive modding scene however after the release of paywalls and valve selling these off as dlc and taking 75% away from the creators is just disgusting modders should get paid for their mods but adding a paywall to them is just despicable most mods are not worth paying for some mods break other mods its just simply not viable to charge for mods a donation button would be more feasible but amateur modification cannot be straight up sold especially for the ludicrous sums people are charging while the game is worth a thumbs up the expanded community and modding is what brought this game to the fame it has and 3 years down the line this is all the game has got going for them now killed by valve and their new money grabbing ways

did you ever want to forget about real life and get in a whole new world yes perfect the elder scrolls v skyrim is the game with the most immersive world i have ever seen the map is enormous and the gameplay is complex to the point where it feels like you could actually live in the game there are so many quests to follow it will waste your days for weeks or even months

when you hear the word rpg what is the first thing that comes to mind elder scrolls or dungeons and dragons maybe both skyrim is an example of what happens when true elements of both rpg & action are put the ultimatum its an absolutely beautiful game with a game soundtrack to pay money for with the addition of mods this is in the top 10 list of all time greatest steam games in the beginning you start off a prisoner in the hands of cyrodills imperial legion led by the region head legatus general tullius although you start off on death throw if you will with your head about to be a seperate part of your body entirely the game quickly breaks the idea of an execution by bringing in a sudden dragon assault on the city of helgen which is at the time an imperial outpost connecting the rest of tamriel including parts of the game oblivion to the region of skyrim there are more quests to even count in this game i lost count around 60 but the addition of mods can add around another 1000 quests if not more which then we come to the crown jewel of many steam games modding communities and boy does skyrim have one well over 100 different mods for every reason what so ever there are mods which fixed the broken military system in the game there are mods which adds more travelers and adventurers on the road adding more of a lifelike feel to the game there are also mods which can hurt the games realism as well some mods are not meant for the lore of elder scrolls but the entertainment of the player instead if i were to give esv skyrim a rating in a range from 1  10 its nearly a 95 its great on so many levels but there are snibbets even with mods still arent correcting guards only want you and nobody else the npcs do the same constant moves 247 and for some reason i never understood this an npc whos 10 feet away will stop everything theyre doing to say hi to you skyrim rating syndicate rating gameplay  8 gameplay is good but could dramatically be improved with more combat actions rpg element  10 this game seemed to never have an ending to the nearly limitless number of quests you could do on ps3 i spent well over 100 hours playing the game and was just barely getting done  multiplayer  0 the game isnt meant for online play and it really doesnt take anything away from the true game itself graphics  9 graphics on vanilla are good for the game but with enhancement mods it will skyrocket to a solid 10 with every little detail imaginable replay value 10 this game is beyond the single word of addicting it will make you come back for more and more official syndicate rating 96  skyrim is a masterpiece in roleplay engineering a true marvel of bethesda the amazement is after 3 years this game still runs as strong as ever revitalized with the modding community skyrim maybe one of the legends of the rpg and maybe even steam game series which lives on

lemme explain dis game you go around the land of skyrim even though its not it the skywhat the 823712 i want mah monz bak and going around shouting at people to the point where the fall of hills and crap you can be a man or lizard depends on your level of nerdmine is 42 and then you preety much die alot if you dont know what you are doing dont forget about dlc thats always necessary ok let us be honest skyrim is an amazing game yes it has like over 9000 bugs but that really does not matter i reccomend this game alot to anyone so buy it for yourself mothers fathers sisters brothers grandma grandpa aunt and uncle cat dog dead pet goldfishrip and of course your friends have fun
recommended
skyrim starts out with a short intro that is not a video you sit back and watch but you can immediately look at people and at the environment your character creation is not before the game but during the intro implemented well in the storyline whereupon you get a choice to join either side of the war as opposed to forcing you in one direction as a lot of games do gameplay contains seemingly infinite quests and different storylines quests seem hardly repetitive for even when there are several quests of clearing out caves every cave is different and interesting you can explore an enormous world and collect countless objects and powers gameplay can be estimated on about 200 hours to complete every game and dungeon if not more even with the game so immense interesting and well thoughtthrough you can download countless mods on skyrim nexus that can increase gameplay by many more hours as well as fix the bugs this gigantic game has and increase performance as well as resolution there are mods to change appearances of characters and there are mods that add features such as homes characters followers setup even whole new lands can be added with mods to increase the gameplay even more the only downside i can think of myself is that the game has some bugs simply go to skyrim nexus and download a bugfix and its done skyrim is highly recommended for everyone who likes adventuring exploring collecting active combat interesting storylines and upgrading if you love skyrim you may want to give risen and the witcher 2 a try these games are different but felt as interesting even though skyrim is a lot bigger and has more features
recommended
i have put in exactly 392 hours into this game since i first purchased it despite some relatively simple ai somewhat outdated graphics a really irritated inventory menu and the inevitable bugs that plague the game skyrim is one of the greatest rpgs of its era though simpler than the previous titles of morrowind and oblivion it allows you much more freedom than either of the two you can build your character around your particular playstyle with no real optimal builds and if you ever decide you dislike the way your character is set up you can simply start training another skill and become good at it if you spend enough time in tamriel slaying dragons and saving damsels in distress your character can learn and master all of the different skills that are available to you the openworld environment and hundreds of places to explore and quests to complete you never really feel like youre being forced to go down one particular path and every time you play youll end up discovering something new the indepth lore surrounding the elder scrolls series heavily immerses you in the world and story making you feel like youve stepped into another world if you love rpgs this is a must have
recommended
i love the open world option in the game the way you can go and explore the world and your own leasure you can take on many different quests in so many locations that it keeps you entertained throughout your skilling up is also done at a pace that keeps the fights and battles interesting the scenery is breathtaking the detail awesome the realism fantastic i think this game ranks 1010 and to me is the top of all rpg games bethesda has done an awesome job now i would love for them to upgrade both morrowind and oblivion to the same standard as skyrim i have the whole set from arena through to skyrim and each game got better and better well done to all the modders out there that have done a fantastic job to add more spice to the game i would definitely recommend this game to every single rpg player in the world a must have cant wait to see if there are more expansions in the making
recommended
awesome game it offers lots more hours of gameplay than call of duty
recommended
mod it until it crashes if its not broken fix it till it is
recommended
if youre a person who likes to find all the loot search every nook and cranny complete all quests well id say youre probably in for a couple of hundred hours with skyrim lets make that double if youre playing with legendary difficulty option since it makes every single thing in game to have absurdly high hitpoints and cuts your damage down about 4 times the normal difficulty setting still cant decide if legendary difficulty is actually a challenge or outright torture to kill time not very much so efficiently still being able to enjoy playing it third time would definetely recommend to any open world rpg lover
recommended
the coolest of the elder scrolls series though i only mean the weather its no threat to morrowind
recommended
this is by far my favorite game you have a huge open world to explore and it just never ends quest after quest you will find yourself playing it more and more which isnt bad 1010
recommended
skyrim helped me grow 4 in 4 weeks doctors hate me

very game many graphics much violence 1010 wow

you will spend countless hours in this if you havent bought it yet do it now and even if you bought it on console you should buy it on pc because you will really see the difference

a must get for any rpg fan down with mmo the elder scrolls will always be a single player experience or nothing at all

about 1400 hours played consolesteam and im still having fun at this the game itself is huge enough to spend hundreds of hours with it but when you reached the point where you get bored by the vanilla game then the real fun begins mods the game is awesomely supported through a huge community and allows you too do almost everything you want flying jepp become a werebear no problem become a lich why not blood not realistic enough take this mod its the best actionrpggame i know so far id definitly recommend it ps its engine is so amazing that you can even run it on a low spec machine smoothly if not you can install some perfomance mods
recommended
the elder scrolls series is an easy one to lose yourself in the characters the story the quests and the exstensive lore make it one of the most enthralling series ive ever played skyrim in particular is my favourite title while the main story is amazing in its own right last boss is slightly disappointing there are hundreds of hours worth of exploring listening to dialogue and doing side quests if that isnt enough there is a thriving modding community on skyrim nexus and the steam workshop ive played skyrim a lot spanning over many different profiles and still to this day there is something new that surprises me while skyrim isnt as deep as rpgs go it is a world filled with emersive characters and storylines the voice acting is top notch they have mario as part of the cast and the artwork on the city designs such as windhelm is fantastic while sword and sorcery isnt for everyone skyrim is dumbed down to a point where its enjoyable to almost anyone im probably late on this anyway
recommended
this is one of my favorite games of all times the fact that it is open world is amazing and the character developement is so much fun i love the voice acting and the quests it keeps you busy for sooooo long and the best part honestly is all of the silly bugs skyrim has the best glitches ever xd
recommended
this is good game get it
recommended
better than real life

it all started when i was being carried over to helgen to be executed i was with three others i dont recall their names i was being taken for treason i swear it wasnt me i was in the wrong place at the wrong time anyway when we were loaded off the carriage there was a man who marked down our names on a list he didnt recognize me so i had to take thirty minutes making myself as hideous as possible switching between argonian to nord to argonian to wood elf to high elf to khajiit over and over again until i was satisfied i think the man who watched it had to go to therapy for the next five years we heard loud strange noises over and over again and nobody cared eventually when it was my turn to be executed a dragon flew in conveniently right before i was beheaded i escaped helgen and went down to riverwood i spoke to people stuff happened and i had to go to some place and speak to the yarl on the way there i found a horse i named him carl and we rode off into the sunset stealing cabbages and putting buckets over guards that was the beginning of a great friendship 1010 ok game i guess edit i havent seen carl for a long time im starting to think he decided to go on his own quest but im not sad im happy for him i screamed at a dragon and he exploded

its great until you have to deal with npcs
recommended
it is a very adventuress game full of mystrous and stuff and is easy to mod so i give it a thumbs up
recommended
one of the best rpg games ive ever played the only thing id complain about is npc ai but now adays there is quite literally a mod for everything so i also recomend enough mods to keep you entertained but overall great a game
recommended
so skyrim a game grasping the ability to do just about anything you want being an open world game skyrim has many possibilites similar to its fallout counterpart in skyirm you may feel the need to run aimlessly around the world looting anything you please whichyou have the ability to do dont forget those special weapons hidden all around the map some of them obvious some of them you may not even realise as sacred weapons along with that youll have to look out for all of the special creatures too such as giantsyupdont mess with those guys or youll be getting a closeup with the clouds in seconds on with the point skyrim is one of the best open world games to play 100100
recommended
objection this game is recommended  yes i got proof as the prosecutors that says this game is not good nor recommended does not have valid evidence to support their reasons for example the evidence i read from the not recommended page is stating that this game is boring  overrated and lonely  i tell you this skyrim is a open world game indeed where ttha player have lots of choices and abilities to do what the player in question like to do in this way the player can do what ever heshe wants to do skyrim does have among the greatest mod support  the best i know atleast as i just stated the game have significant mod support this game never gets boring although this is not a part of the game its still a thing that does have an impact on the prosecutors evidence the prosecutors calims this game is overrated yes it got very good rating indeed 94100 but on the other hand why i tell you this why would the judge of that case give this game that rating if the judge in question did not think the game deserves this rating and on the other hand you can enter for exemple most if not all houses in the game insane graphics yet from being released 2011 the last objection i have to make is about the  loneliness  what loneliness exactly the game is crowded with npcs wich your honor is  not playable characters  these npcs might be stiff indeed but as i stated before mod compatibility and support gives you choices to add user made characters with unique voice acting and different scripts now your honor its up to you to swing that gavel and deaclear a verdict this game is not guilty err i mean recommended apollo justice
recommended
skyrim is at the time of this review the latest installment of the elder scrolls series skyrim is a simplified version of the eariler elder scrolls games meant to tend to a casual crowd rather than the hardcore players that loved the elder scrolls iii morrowind the addition of the steam workshop really benefited this game with its easy way of adding in extra content created by the fanbase that is sometimes even of higher quality than the dlc packs that were release for the game overall this game has its ups and downs but it is a solid game that i have loved ever since it was released get this

so in this game you are the chosen one who has to save the world from the big evil monster using your choice of medieval fantasy weaponry or magic you also do quests and look at the scenery alot in case there is something worth checking out there lastly you can get a house to live in and spend the rest of your time crafting potions and not talking to the spouse of your choice that you decided to leave home because they kept getting in your way during combat hmm sounds like a billion other games you have played right youre sick of this right i sure am now that ive probably succeeded in making fanboys rage and amusing others ill actually write some stuff that might be worth reading at its core its not that different from all the other fantasy games you may have played and never want to see again except that its in a gigantic open world that you can spend hundreds of hours exploring that there are multiple sidequests of decent length that in most cases are quite interesting and provide unexpected twists and that if you ever wanted a game that could quite literally have an endless amount of content then this may very well be it also there are mods lots of them enough to make this game fresh and to eat even more of your time ive unlocked all of the achievements and clocked over 300 hours into this and yet i still feel as if i can still get more out of this game so yeah it is exactly what everyone tells you it is a massive open world rpg that can occupy your free time for weeks and even months before you feel like moving on to something else you have been warned now go kill a dragon marry someone or kill one of the countless city guards who have taken an arrow in the knee at some point in their lives enjoy

this is my review for this 2 year old game to start off dont be fooled by the only 5 hours logged on stewam i first played around 300 hours on a non steam version of the game and picked it up again in sale now off to the game now where to start the story the stoy is little short but still great to play trhough good voice actors enjoyable story and when your done with the main story there are plenty of thing to do around like just freakin murdering everyone or blowing lydia of high hrotgar with fus ro dah d or just do what you want write your own story the gameplay if you like to play in first or third person your choice i like the third person view myself since you can see more of the beautiful world of skyrim around you the cmbat is solid not super hard or something but still pretty good so many weapons in this game just choose what you want the graphics its okay i guess not the best ive seen but hey its a 2 year old game and oh yeah some textures are just terrible but thanks to the awesome skyrim community there are some great texturepacks out there that make the game look so much better and speaking of the community its still huge after 2 years its awesome there are so many mods for this game that add to a great gameplay experience go check out the nexus site for mods and the steam workshop ofcourse well to wrap this review up i sunk in well over 300 hours and im not even bored yet the open world is so huge and its worth exploring for me personaly pretty much one of the best games ive ever played deserves a good and deserved 1010 buy it already bye

the coolest of the elder scrolls series though i only mean the weather its no threat to morrowind
recommended
well i got to start reveiwing at some point the game may be a few years old but it is still fun to play the exploring a huge facter is the mods the modding community has really kept this game alive it makes every thing from bunny follower to just funny swords like a giant popsical it has apsects of a mmo like the role playing mounted combat the freedom you have getting married oh then getting divorced freedom right xd crafting is fun even better with mods when you can crafy stuff like spartan armour assasins creed armour even a darth vader helmet the game is endless of what you can do if you put your mind to it like i even a pregnant npc mod o_o as i said it is endless in what you can do

bum bum bum bum badadadum if there was a game that would ruin your life with the same effects as crack then this would be beat only by world of warcraft when you buy a game twice just so you can mod it you know you have a problem that can only be dealt with by years of expensive therapy dont waste your money on that however buy more video games to escape those problems this game will make you question many things things like why can horses climb up walls or why do dragons land just so you can kill them it is a very thought provoking game i plan to write all future essays that i have to write on this game and minecraft buy this game so you can be like me

a must get for any rpg fan down with mmo the elder scrolls will always be a single player experience or nothing at all

the elder scrolls v skyrim what could i say about this fantastic game as always bethesda has give us a masterpiece of a game bethesda is used to make high detailed open world rpg games following fallout 3 from 2008 with the open world high detail terain they did it again but in a much larger world with much more stuff to explore tod howard is a genious the story is great some kind of fetish for prisoners is what bethesda loves but the whole game is unbeatable even after you finish the game and start all over again you will find something new random events are great so it gives you planty of side quests apsolutly an amazing game 9510

there is never nothing to do in skyrim

if you dont have skyrim then i dont no why you have a gaming pc for lol the elder scrolls series is my all time favorite action roleplaying open world fantasy video game and fallout to bethesda make the best open world game and it worth ever penny you pay for it this game can be played for months on end alone and thats not including the mods the story and the atmosphere of the world is just amazing i cant wait to injoy the world using a 3d virtual reality headset i might not want to come back to the real world lol but i give it a 100 out of 100 must buy if you own a gaming pc

recommended
the best game i have ever played
recommended
this is my favorite rpg game ever the quests are well designed and fun to do whilst being easy to get started subtract everything you hate about past elder scrolls games add everything you love add a better engine that does not crash on you every 10 minutes and is not a steaming pile of bugs pretty up everything make the faces cooler and make just about everything better and you have skyrim this game is a masterpiece its the game that we have been waiting for in 2011 most titles this year have been bad to say the least this game would deserve a perfect 10 if not for the super lame secondary main quest which is the civil war you can kill the final boss in one hit i understand that level scaling is bad in most cases but in some cases things have to be level scaled the annoying part is the civil war is about the length of the dragon questline this game would get a 97 in my book now thanks to that one little detail but since metacritic forces me to round up my score 10 it is
recommended
the never ending game of pure fun

if you arent playing it now well i feel sorry for you

one of my favorite rpg open world fantasy games world is really big and just fantastic i love the style and gameplay of this game quests are really fun and you are never bored while playing i really like the style of playing because you can play as warrior or wizard style also there are skillslevels for character which you decide which one to upgrade world is huge fantasy level is normal because you can kill also normal warriorspeople instead only monstersdragons story line is really sick only the problem is on start of game because you need to walk a lot but later when you discover all the places and towns then you can use fast travel option game also have a lot of side quests and hiden places to complete and discover especially if you buy legendary edition of the game then you have a lot of new quests like i said its one of the best rpg games so i reccommend this game to all rpg and fantasy lovers game it totally worth of money 9510

in skyrim you may find yourself in a huge open world where you can choose which path of many youll take and if you put enough effort why not all of them you have a really good main questline that is surrounded by even better questlines like the epic thieves guild and dark brotherhood quests you will have over two hundred hours of game before youre able to say ive got no more quests to do if youve finished your main questline slayed alduin and saved the world you can still go after the dragon claws dragon shouts dragon priests masksyou probably notice theyve got all about dragons this time right becoming the leader of the mages college of winterhold thieves guild companions dark brotherhood becoming a general on a civil war collecting all the daedric artifactswhich one has its unique quest joining the bards guild and even doing tons of sidequests and do all of this with a character that most suits your style of playing it can be a mage battle mage warrior berserker paladin stealth assassin rogue summoner and im not even talking about the dlcs that come with new questlines and a whole new continent for you to explore as if this was not enough the game counts with a incredible number of totally functional mods that can add more quests more races more weapons and armors take the graphs to a whole new level make the game mor immersive give you a new user interface completely change the whole game that even make you feel like you dont know how to play skyrim anymoret3nd0 im talking to you and all kinds of mods you can think aboutdont use it too much or you may end up like a teenage mutant ninja turtle slaying trains on mario land thats it if you like action rpg with a lot of stories for you to be part of theres no way youre not liking skyrim

this game has taken so much of my time up but do not regret it for a second originally i had it on the ps3 when it first came out and sunk about 300400 hours into it then after the debacle with the dlc on the ps3 i bought the game on the 360 so that i could play the dlc when they each came out and sunk a few more hundred hours into the game now i have finally found wisdom and got myself a gaming pc i have it again this time modded for a whole new experience to sink more and more hours into if you like fantasy first person and making up your own character back story and character quirks then this is the game for you you can do anything and everything in this game but the question is what does your character want to do

i absolutely love this game i have spent many hours playing it on the xbox360 and ended up buying it again on the pc so i could start trying all the interesting mods and hd rendering this is a game that you can play over and over again and each time you play through it it is an entirely different experience only downside i can think of is there are a few questlines where you have an option to go one way or the other i wont go into details to avoid spoilers any one side is really well developed and interesting and the other falls short there are only a couple of them where this applies though

well i think we cant say enything new about skyrim this game is just awesome in alot of ways the thing i rly like is that u can change views from 3th to 1st person eny time u desire i recommend this game for enyone who is looking for exitement in an rpg game u will get pulled from one story to the other all while exploring this vast and wonderfull world nicely polished the only small thing i can find is the fact that there is no onlinemulti coop option but then i guess thats where eso will fill in the blanks 910 soundtrack 910 storyline 810 gameplaymechanics a big thumbs up
recommended
amazing game even if i get lost in the map quite often way too big 
recommended
you know these like games once in lifetime there are not many games as great as skyrim for my opinion one of the best games ever will be made the story is a bit seen though but because great skyrim is famous for its mods the story will be more interesting after a few mods installed graphics are just great actually they keep me speechless mostly and of course bugs they are the balancing thing between the bloody combat magic sthealthiness and travelling they make this game interesting i mean that players sometimes even seem to look for the bugs but as i said in the start once in lifetime great game with 0worst  10best i would give 9
recommended
an amazing game can only get bored when youre stuck in dungeons make sure you learned clairvoyance pros many factions you can join great main storyline great side quests storylines amazing graphics a lot of weapons you can choose from a lot of magic spells you can learn modfriendly just everything cons some of the voices are annoying as  when changing tabs double cursor happens fixed using onetweak mod 95100 from me
recommended
a massively epic rpg that is worthy of the elder scrolls name nails immersion and makes you feel like youre present in the beautiful and acutely detailed tamriel has tons of quests and secondary missions that will keep you busy for days and if you eventually finish everything this game has to offer you could always download new custom made missions and maps from the steam workshop if you dont have this youre missing out best rpg of 2011
recommended
this game is a gift to gamers who enjoy exploring and being a badass you will do plenty of both im 100 hours in and i feel like i havent even really scratched the surface of what there is to see and do in this game

skyrim has to be one of the most epic and i mean that in large proportions as well as completely awesome games that i have ever played there is a deep sense of immersion to be found hours upon hours of gameplay especially if you create multiple characters and a near endless supply of awesome mods to keep you going only things i dont like buggy as ill get out although not unplayably so just ask someone about the horses dragon combat is a bit lacking the sneak skill is freaking broken you can one shot bosses if you arent on the harder difficulties lets fight even more dragur also please get a dlc at least one and hearthfire doesnt count they are both good get one get both heck get legendary edition if you want and have them all but please get one of them they add so much to the game all in all id say 910 great game d
recommended
it certainly is dumbing down compared with oblivion and especially morrowind but its great if you dont want to use intelligence and just want to have fun use an xbox controller for the best experience
recommended
perhaps one of the best games of all time
recommended
it is a good game get mods like batman armor dont be a commie
recommended
in perfection right here
recommended
love definitely recommend i love just how customizeable the story is for anyone you can make the story unique to your character the great thing about the game is that you make the choices to shape the story the graphics are beautiful and the map is huge and diverse ranging from icy barren tundras to lush pine forests to the open ocean which adds to the atmosphere loads of quests and storylines ensure that youll never be bored or find yourself with nothing to do in the game it has lots of replay value the only thing to be wary of are the various bugs most of them are an easy fix but a few can cause you to have to start the entire game over which can be frustrating once youve logged in a lot of time with one character overall great game and would definitely suggest for any fantasy buff 
recommended
gahd dammit i have edited this thirce now due to restarting morrowind getting a shot of nostaliga and thinking that it was marginally better than skyrim long story short bethesda did a very good jobon skyrim and made quite a few improvments to morrowind 1010 i shall stop editing this now
recommended
excellent game for when you want your own personal game time plenty of quests for when you want to make progress on storylines but just as enjoyable if you want to just chillax and explore the latest patches go a long way but highly recommend the unofficial patches to fix some left over minor bugs the workshop and nexus have excellent mods to customise the base game into a version you enjoy if you found something annoying in the game likely someone else did too and already created a mod for it

note my experience may vary from yours since i was running 70 mods some of which altered companion ai voiced dialogue graphics etc this review is directed at players who never played the elder scrolls before and have little experience with fantasy rpgs skyrim is one of the greatest western rpgs of this generation but im convinced that its not for everyone if youre not sure if this is the right game for you then ask yourself the following questions 1 do you enjoy playing in a fantasy setting similar to lord of the rings that includes magic orcs elves demons etc  2 do you enjoy lore that includes paying attention to the dialogue considering the impact of your choices on the main story and possibly even reading many pages of text the last one is optional 3 do you enjoy exploring dungeons it involves enemies simple puzzles and loot that may include gear or ability upgrades 4 do you enjoy playing a single player experience in a vast open world with only ai to interact with mmo players often find the game too quiet and lonely 5 do you enjoy embarking on hundreds of side quests i know a number of people who were distracted by the side quests and eventually forgot what the main story was about and unfortunately quit 6 optional do you enjoy endless modding possibilities skyrim has the biggest modding community on the internet and the things you can change range from absurd to epic please note that excessive modding can make your game very unstable and even render it unplayable if youre not very careful i spent days preparing a list of cohesive mods then i installed and uninstalled them a number of times and troubleshooted multiple problems to make them work the process can very tedious but the results are completely worth it if your answer to all the above questions is yes then i would recommend that you get skyrim a number of my friends quit the game within a few days because they got distracted by side quests and forgot the goal of the main story if youre like them then i recommend that you beat the main campaign first youll have all the time in the world after that for the various quests factions and dlcs bethesdas take on the various playable races and their designs is very different from the likes of lord of the rings and warcraft do not expect to see skimpy armors or fair elves the game has a considerable number of bugs nothing that would ruin your experience but expect the occasional glitch or crash to happen i recommend saving every often fallout 3 or nv fan you will feel right at home just replace the guns with swords and magic and the post apocalyptic wasteland with a fantasy setting
recommended
fantastic game gamers who enjoy a continuous story and plenty amounts of side missions and quests filled with magic dragons and old fashioned combat will be more satisfied than having a fap on a sunday morning great graphics great gameplay great storyline not much else can be said apart from it being massively addictive

recommended
the elder scrolls v skyrim is an amazing enticing open world with vast quanities of things to do whether it be fighting off legendary dragons or delving deep into the ancient dwemer ruins it is impossible to get bored the music is exhilarating and triumphant the gameplay is stupendous the languages within the game are linguistically beautiful and you feel like the characters are one with your family after indulging for hours on end playing this game youll find your selfimpowerment increasing and you will feel like the dovakhiin or dragonborn the soul of a warrior i recomend playing at an adept or legendary game difficulty or the game will seem a bit slow enthusiastic

this game is perhaps one of the most comprehensive vast and expansive games i have ever played throughout my journey through the world of skyrim searching through nordic wastelands crawling through massive dungeons and completing wonderful questlines i felt utterly involved and absorbed into the game this is a game i very happily paid $60 for and would highly reccomend it to anyone whos played an rpg similar to this in the past or even just people who havent but would like to know what the epitome of an rpg may be this has been my favorite game to play through and i dont regret a second of gameplay

thank you bethesda thank you valve thank you gabe without you i would have never imagined that you could pay for mods so  you your platform and you ing games and skyrim is meh btw better find yourself some morrowind not on steam of course update valve decided to remove paid mods from the workshop and even though we won we should never forget that this happened and we should never forgive them for trying to do so

we should have acted it has already started the april fools told of their price the prank was merely a warning until the time after the paid mods started when the modding community would spill their own blood but no one wanted to believe believe that valve was behind it and when the truth finally dawned it dawned in fire but there is one they fear in their tongue they are nahlimaar the community 010

ehm so i have to write a report errr well done whoever made this game system and gameplay is so much in depth more when you like something and suddenly you discover it has more features if you look deeper i know its blah blah blah but that how i found this system xd storyline is one of the best 50h isnt enough to finish the story well not for me specially when you give me rpg to play lel graphics even though im running the game on ultra with very nice and smooth fps i had to downloaded the hightextures and other graphics enhancment mods so id enjoy my moment ingame  jungle xd this game is sick i couldnt drop it for a little so id finish persona q  which i just played the first 15min tt best of luck lol

paid mods not much else to say any dev this greedy who is supported by free mods and then takes a 75% cut doesnt deserve any sort of positive feedback its just wrong everything about it is wrong it takes more and more freedom away from players and gives more and more money to developers all this is is dlc something which we have way to much of already skyrim and many games specifically valve games were supported or even built off of mods there was no money involved only user collaboration they didnt do it for the money they did it for the game and steambethesda still made money by the continued selling of the game due to the mods tf2 counter strike and many other games have been built off of free mods no money was ever involved until valve bought the mod and turned it into an actual game introducing money into this system doesnt make it better better mods wont come form this its going to reduce quality of mods more and more cheap little things are going to show up that arent worth much but still charge for it as people quickly try to make a quick profit free mods will be stolen and put up its also going to reduce collaboration lots of big mods have come from the community working together but get money involved and that is going to shut down theyre not going to want to share the profits greed will take over and the modding community will be damaged dont let this spread dont give valve or bethesda any money from this skyrim is a great game just dont buy it until they fix this without free mods skyrim is nothing

in my mind the game is a masterpiece the game looks amazing and is in my mind very well made as for the storyline i adore it there are of course a few minor things in the game for example the horses they move very weird and they are quite slow compared to walking the game itself is a fantastic experience with superb gameplay beautiful graphics and majestic music the fun part is you can get mods installed easily on the game through the workshop on steam its fun to mod the game with several mods and make it after your own liking the game over all gets a 95 out of 10 as its a superb and amazing game with a fantastic storyline

while a decent game in and of itself the modding community is the reason why this game is still relevant to this day they were able to elevate the game by an absurd standard and unfortunately the current practices by valve and supported by bethesda are working to undue that standard i cannot support the current paid modding situation and it reflects poorly on the industry and on valve that the monetization of goodwill has come this far

i used to like this game like you then i took paid mods to my steam account

as the original mongers of horse armor which has brought us to the nickel and diming of dlc today i must express my utter disappointment with bethesda now they have sent us spiraling down another dark age of gaming putting mods behind paywalls many of these mods fix their game which was never truly fixed by themselves do yourself and gaming a favor do not buy this game
not recommended
while the game itself is amazing both bethesda and valve are implementing changes to the previously allfree mod environment that could lead to mods we all use and love pay to download so until this has changed i must give a negative rating
not recommended
ive always had fun with skyrim ive never been unhappy with it until recently when valve decided mods should be paid for now the games ruined mods kept it so replayable so full of life thats been destroyed now until the steam workshop will be restored into its original state avoid at all costs same goes for my review i will not recommend it anymore until they fix it

paid mods no thank you

well i think we cant say enything new about skyrim this game is just awesome in alot of ways the thing i rly like is that u can change views from 3th to 1st person eny time u desire i recommend this game for enyone who is looking for exitement in an rpg game u will get pulled from one story to the other all while exploring this vast and wonderfull world nicely polished the only small thing i can find is the fact that there is no onlinemulti coop option but then i guess thats where eso will fill in the blanks 910 soundtrack 910 storyline 810 gameplaymechanics a big thumbs up

im writing this due to the introduction of paid mods for skyrim dont get me wrong the game itself is absolutely amazing even more so when you add some free mods into the mix but what valve and bethesda did was absolutely unforgiveable i renounce gabe newell as my idol and i never had any faith in bethesda to begin with

this game is fantastic in every way sure there are plenty of bugs and the graphics are looking a little dated by now but do you know what helped alleviate all of those issues mods mods have extended this games lifetime for years and now valve wants you to pay for those mods im sorry but that just doesnt sit right with me fantastic game let down by scummy practices

there once was an openworld rpgadventure game which was great the greatness of this game was only furthered by the the open platform of modding provided by the pc gaming the modders were a generous group of community members who worked diligently to add more content and enhance not only their gaming experience but the gaming experience of the community which in turn supported them through donations according to the communities will however greedy  ers at valve and bethesda decided to monetise everything therefore the community and the game will fall until order is restored vote with your wallet players

vanilla skyrim 710 skyrim with mods 1110 skyrim after paid mods 010 seriously though valve i have spent hours upon days at times trying to get 200 or 300 mods to work at the same time and i know some people who cant seem to get 40 working properly who is going to pay for mods that do not work with each other how will they know if this and that are not going to break and they are left with nothing and wasted cash you have no idea what youre getting yourself into with paid mods and you provide no quality assurance that these mods are worth the money being charged or that they wont break with other mods being purchased its not like dota2 or tf2 where all your pretty hats are smooth sailing and easy money no valve this is hard work youre charging us money to do here the consumer and youre taking a ton from the modder which i would rather donate directly to him for his hard work if i deem so necessary on a very old game like skyrim that would have been dead if it were not for free mods by modders
not recommended
before mods 710 with mods 1110 after introduction of paid mods 010 would not play again

you can do anything you cant do anything but mods paid mods but dlc half  shit that is only half as good as mods what am i trying to say here you may ask what im trying to say is the game skyrim is no good its just a big ol mess of bad game but dont take my word for it i mean i did play it for 190 hours but if its so bad why did you play it so long because i wanted cards because yes mods were fun before the current mod workshop situation because for awhile i was able to delude myself into thinking i might enjoy the game and yes for a small time maybe early on i did and then i kept playing and it faded i stopped enjoying it and just wanted to finish it sure id toss in a new mod every now and then having to reset but that just spiced it up a little the only joy i have now from this game is telling you the other consumers to not buy this game do not support it do not support its creators its just not worth it

valve introduced paid workshop mods for skyrim as a result changing my review to negative you dont get to charge people for mods and try to sell them as dlc valve people can and should support mod creators via donations and a buy me a coffee button on the workshop page would be good but putting them behind a pay wall is god damn atrocious hoping valve and other responsible parties for this new practice will turn around
not recommended
paid mods are a pretty stupid idea i love this game and i have thoroughtly enjoyed modding it in the past and i know from first hand experience that modding is not something that should mbe charged for you are downloading an unknown and potentially gamebreaking file made by someone that you dont know you can trust there is simply so much that can potentially go wrong with paid modding let alone modding in general the most popular paid mod i think the shadowscale armor is a terrible armor mod that i would never use in my game however it is really very diffficult to see that quality and features of a mod without using it beforehand paid mods are  and while i love skyrim like so so much i am going to have to give it a negative vote because of bethesda and valves shenanigans
not recommended
ive been on steam for 10 years in all this time ive never been more upset at them than i am now keep in mind i used steam back when it was a platform that hardly worked the friends system was purely cosmetic it never worked and you needed someones account name in order to add them it was buggy crashy resourceintensive and slow i always liked it because it let me avoid having to keep track of cds and cd keys which i would end up losing eventually this is the last straw though valve ruined the very thing that allowed them to thrive mods halflife was intended to be a very moddable game and from that they have allowed games like natural selection 2 counterstrike team fortress and left 4 dead to come into existence the worst thing about the paid mods is that the creator only gets a 25% cut after the mod sells $400 usd equivalent the money goes into their steam wallet which cannot be used as regular funds for everyday life not to mention you can sell someone elses work as your own and earn money from someone elses hard work this is not only dishonest it is illegal  this activity forces people who would otherwise make free mods to monetize because if they dont then someone else will and will have control over this intellectual property valve opened a can of worms by pulling this stunt i doubt theyll ever live it down
not recommended
ive played this on xbox and pc and i might not have alot of hours on here but thats because i dont own it yet but ive played it alot on pc and it is alot better on pc i plan to buy the game for pc soon i could spend countless hours on here because of mods but if all the modmakers start making us pay for mods then im afraid this game will have lost its touch so until this paid mod conflict is resolved im going to have to give a negative review just put a donation button please
not recommended
i do not recommend this game

and this is how customers get screwed once more remember dlcs how they became so widespread in the industry and hurt the enjoyment of many titles well now companies like valve and bethesda have a great idea why spend resources doing new stuff when people will do it for them in their free time mark my words paid mods will be the future of gaming valve just opened the flood gates to a whole new era of greedy corporativism where games that previously refused to release modding tools will magically see their error and let players form the games dlc screwing gamers and modders in the process as they make money you hated day one dlc wait until you hear day one paid mods from famous modders
not recommended
turn away from this scam skyrim was famous for modability now they are putting up mods behind paywalls go buy gta4 or something that support free open modding

in and by itself skyrim is a good game however like any game it will get old and repetitive what has kept me coming back has been a main reason ive constantly returned to bethseda games a very vibrant and active modding community given a little time after a games release you could find mods that can tweak and change almost any aspect of the game to customize it to how you wanted it over time the mods grow more sophisicated and ones are out overhauling entire aspects of the game or adding quests and areas that rival or exceed even official expansions work was shared and expanded on some modders soley created resources for others while others used them to craft entire graphic overhauls areas companions perk systems ect the new update and focus on paid mods already seems to fractured that and raises many headaches i wont go into it in a review other then to say id suggest reading an article put out by forbes it summerizes it pretty well httpwwwforbescomsitesinsertcoin20150424valvespaidskyrimmodsarealegalethicalandcreativedisaster the reason i wouldnt recommend this now is that a mess is going to be swirling around this and theres no way to tell exactly how it will settle and lets admit it without the mod scene that grew up the game becomes another decent rpg  good design fun to play through once or twice and then collects dust the steam store is full of them for lesser prices as a last thought its hard to believe this is about helping modders a 25% cut on sales for the accountants out there im not sure if a dontation would be via what nexus does would be considered taxable income but since youre actively selling a product now im assuming that this paid system would be doesnt seem like a good deal we pay new associates straight out of school a higher cut of production plus a base mininium and thats with around a 5560% overhead for a medical office i doubt the workshop overhead runs that high  just a thought

valve and bethesda have joined forces to destroy what makes pc gaming the way it is they have started monetizing mods made by community members they try to pass it as modders making money but what these snakes dont tell you is that they keep 75% of the money the creator of the content only gets 25% on top of that they need to make $100 a month to get paid if they cant get that valve keeps it this is not only another step in destroying pc gaming much like dlc it has ruined what was once a great friendly modding community do not buy this game if you have any concience or desire to see pc gaming stay the way it is a purchase of this game is directly funding the death of your own hobby there are other ways to play do not give your money to valve of bethesda

i dont think there is much to be said about skyrim that hasnt already if you were ever a fan of the elder scrolls games then you already have skyrim if youre not a fan then you probably own skyrim anyways because its a fantastic rpg with the new generation of gaming and the unprecedented popularity of console gaming skyrim did suffer from the dumbing down that a lot of crossplatform releases suffer from wonky console controls scaled back texture quality etc however a couple of easy mods sort that right out
recommended
this game is simply amazing and it has soul the art style music and character models make skyrim the most spectacular experience so far in terms of a living world to explore skyrim is not so much an rpg as it is an adventure simulator
recommended
i killed a chicken and the whole village attacked me 1010
recommended
first off its a great game it would be stupid to deny it but if youve had some issues with morrowind and oblivion and even fallout 3 they havent been fixed the animations are still awkward the combat ai is stiil fight or flee without any variation or tactics needed i dont care about the main story as its a sandbox but the dialog is abysmal the balance later in the game crawls into a hole and dies making the game quite dull the farther you get and as with any bethesda title there are bugs everywhere but its still fun to play and when the community starts churning out mods its gonna be amazing as someone who hated oblivion before it was cool to hate it i say i had fun with skyrim get it when its on sale
recommended
fantastic rpgactionadventure game its got an ample amount of places to explore and things to do theres plenty of quests and sidequests to take on the game can also be pretty challenging depending on where you are how powerful you are etc you will happily lose 100 hours into this great game

i still killed many innocent people 1010

i love this game used to play all the other elder scrolls when i was younger on xbox but then i bought a pc and i realised i needed to rebuy this game this game is never ending awesomeness if your into rpg and theres hundreds of quests and things to do if you have a lot of free time i recommend
recommended
the game is fairly fun but if you go down the tank route heavy armor and 2 handed then you area basically almost invincible but still its a lot of fun altough adding a few mods to make the gameplay harder is always nice  1010
recommended
one of the best roleplaying games i have ever played following the footsteps of the previous elder scrolls and improving in most aspects of the series skyrim has everything you want on a roleplaying game from exploring the world and killing dragons to creating your own house and cooking the game rarely gets boring as you have a lot to do ridiculous amount of quests gear cities landmarks character builds make the game very enjoyable to play more than once
recommended
like a good anal fisting but with dragons 1010 ign

skyrim is one of those games that have a very poor storyline the truth is that it takes only about an hours to finish skyrim main storyline and if you play for good storyline dont buy skyrim get a different game skyrim is that kind of game where every dungeon will look the same each side quest will be generic and similar however what makes skyrim a game i will recommend to others is the ability to do what you want as a player skyrim allows you to freeroam in a huge open world as well as ability to mod the game modding this game is what it means to play skyrim download 30 mods and explore endless possibilities if you like to mess around with games and you wouldnt mind to spend few minutes to understand how to add mods to your game then pick skyrim because i could play this game for days with no sleep as long as i find a good pack of mods however without the mods this game can only keep one interested for 10hours or so
recommended
beautifull game the story is great sooo many weaponsarmour to choose and make the open world is masssive i have spent 182 hours on it stunning graphics especially when you mod it if you are a elder scrolls fan you must add this game to your library personally i give it a 1010

best character creation sim ever not only can you tweak almost every detail of your character but you can also try them out for a few hours before you create a new one ive been told there is an actual story in there and even more quest but my add kicks in and i end up just creating a new character 101o would create again

skyrim is like pringles a more serious review the elder scrolls skyrim is without a doubt one of the very few games that hooked me on for hours very few games achieved that ive played many games that as much as i loved and enjoyed playing they couldnt suck me in this black hole where i just cant stop skyrim is like pringles say you only want one chip then you want another and another in the end you finished the entire can before you know it as a game skyrims endless number of quests side stories npcs items dungeons random overworld events mean you never run out of things to do which also means you can never really stop until you tell yourself ive totally played this for way too long skyrim is a first person rpg a standard not many rpgs follow nearly every one ive played is third person or real time but the first person style makes skyrim that much more engaging with combat very skill oriented you have stats but it is simplified to only health stamina and magic meaning theres no need to fiddle around with crazy amounts of numbers to figure out what are the best equipment some may disagree and prefer having more stat variety i say the simplicity means you spend less time looking at your inventory and more time fighting which is where the fun is unlike most other rpgs if you missed its because you missed everything based on your skill of aiming similarly if you failed to block you didnt block in time all of this makes skyrim the most action oriented rpg game ive played something which i find really fun fighting is all part of your own skill whilst other rpgs are basically down to just picking the right skills and hoping the rng will make the enemies miss or for you to land more critical hits tesv skyrim is a black hole it is pringles it is the game that few games achieved to do to me suck me in and not let go for comparison the other games that did this were pokemon red the sims and metroid prime i give tesv skyrim a pringles10

i think this is a very detailed and well put together game it is worth you money and will give you enjoyment for hours it is also a good game to mod

category score notes visuals 9 skyrim is a breathtaking and consistent world that makes you want to walk around just to see what else it has to offer open fields mountains and dragons flying in the distance truly make you feel as though youve been sucked into the world of the elder scrolls unfortunately the occasional but noticeable muddy textures can get in the way of that experience story 8 some quests are mundane and some set you on the path to greatness the game presents you with many choices most of which are just different means to the same end but some of which actually have an impact and will make you think twice attentive gamers will find all sorts of hidden stories told through notes subtle dialogue cues or even just the way objects are laid out in a certain room gameplay 7 finding the right difficulty setting can be a challenge in itself and some of the skill trees are significantly more powerful than others nonetheless there is plenty of variety and room for experimentation for how you want to play and plunging a sword through a dragons head rarely gets old the world comes especially alive when you avoid fasttravel sound 10 jeremy souls fourhour soundtrack adds a layer of emotion to your journey through skyrim that i didnt think possible until i heard that choir of over thirty people singing in the dragon tongue the music adds suspense melancholy and wonder to the world towns have their own unique themes as well mods 10 skyrim is a platform for an enormous amount of mods which has allowed it to remain relevant and popular even years after its release if youre just interested in prettying up your game enhancing the vanilla experience and making the game more immersive you can do that but if youd rather drive the batmobile to your sex dungeon and battle flying locomotives you can do that too overall 93 a fun rpg set in an immersive world with epic music and seemingly endless things to do mods transform it from a good game to one of the greatest ever and significantly increases replay value
recommended
great game especially with free mods
recommended
this game is awesome for people who like rpg and dragons this is one of the must buy games the greatest part o the game is its system of leveling up and its skill tree that are smartly made by using the character actions as training and the dungeons are interesting and provide the player a choice to build his own strategic way to do it according to your characters skill and equipment the number of items that you can interact with is unbelieveable just keep in mind that it has some useless itens too the scenes are greatly made with a lot of details it worths every penny but just to be fair theres a point in the game that shouldve be improved the difficult of the puzzles you wont find any hard logical obstacle to get through so its kind an easy game but still worth playing

this was the first elder scrolls game that i played through all the wayive never been crazy into tes games that being said the base game is enjoyable for a while until the quests get very repetitive and tedious fetching a weapon from a cave or killing a animalbandit in a cave stops being fun very quickly and is used very oftenthe main story quests are decent but usually involves the actions mentioned above the combat is very repetitive and simplespells specifically are underwhelming and straightforward the game seems very simple and stripped down compared to other tes games to me its a diamond in the rough a fairly solid game that saw its potential realized by the modding scene and turned into an incredible game with almost limitless possibilities

imagine fallout new vegas cover it with snow take out the fire weapons and fill it with medieval ones sprinkle it with dragons other fantasy monsters and horses and youll get something not far from skyrim vanilla skyrim is a good game it could have been the best game made but tries to cover such an enormous terrain such an absurd amount of quests it necessarily had to end up filled to the brim with bugs unsolvable quests and various other glitches luckily for everybody bethesda decided to make this another of the moddable games resulting in a nearly flawless epic adventure that you can customize to your own tastes more dragons no dragons more quests more provinces more spells more houses to buy or build and call your home theres pretty much nothing you wont be able to find a mod for the result is an amazing experience where you can put hundreds of hours with a single character and not even counting the dlcs while collecting items exploring the bazillon dungeons all over skyrim comleting quests or generally exploring the biggest game world ive ever seen in short this is as good as a game can be to put your money in

1010 this game never gets old in my scrolls
recommended
this game is 100% pure brilliance if youre the type that likes rpgs and if youre not its a good way to start >  then this is definitely the game for you the main story itself is quite good but the way you can go before you get there side quests and so forth is just really really good you should indulge yourself into this game this is an amazing piece of art and the design is just beautiful with and intriguing story dont forget that its pc and the biggest plus from that is the mod community there are so many good mods and mods that will make the game better buy it it is just that great

skyrim the game where you can do absolute everything in every class you can think of loads and absolute loads of mods to add more stuff like replace all dragons with thomas the tank engine d or get fancy armour weapons characters from other games to improve your experiance i would recomend this game for everyone who thinks the souls games are too hard think this game is too easy or dull tired of the game holding your hand try dark souls prepare to die edition or dark souls 2

well much like previous elder scrolls games im looking at you oblivion the main quest line is very short and very easy fortunately theres plenty of other questing to be done and the modding community is amazing as it always has been so yeah great if a bit easy content great modding community great game except for the guards bringing up knee arrows but theres a mod to fix that

everyone knows this is the best game ever made and if you think otherwise then you are wrong this is an open world action rpg it is my favourite game by far and only the next sequel can ever top it you start off as a prisoner whos about to be beheaded from there you create your character from a variety of different races human or beast there is endless customization with what you can create and how realistic you character will look if you use mods you dont have to because without this will still be your favourite game experience ever but i dont see why not because its simple to download mods from the nexus with just a few clicks and if you dont want to do that then you can easily browse the workshop from your library and install mods with a click of a button thats what has kept this game so fun for so long and it will never get boring or old theres various factions throughout the game you can join and become leader of you can even become a werewolf or a vampire the characters are all unique and loveable and you can have followers and even get married to your favourite ones you can craft armor and weapons enchant them upgrade them you can create potions you can have your own home in this game you level up and gain skill points to build the type of character you want you can make a perk legendary when it gets to 100 so you level endlessely theres always a rewarding amount of loot in each cave or dungeon you clear i could go on forever even just standing in the town enjoying the view of the lake is enjoyable in this game the possibilitys with this game because of mods are endless theres no need in other games when this game has everything you could think of seriously you have to buy it if you want a game you will never get bored of be easy to go back to whenever you want never 100% complete because theres to much to do then buy skyrim

one of the rare sequels that manages to live up to its title and it goes way beyond that you have to see it in order to believe it massive open world tons of things to do magic politics bandits monsters dragons you name it on the other hand you have the creation kit and a friendly modding community there is no doubt in my mind that the elder scrolls skyrim is one of the best games ever created

first let me start off by saying that i have 750 hours on this game i started on my xbox 360 long ago bought it on steam once i joined the glorious pc master race and migrated my saves with a flash drive and then i said screw that and started all over again anyway lets get into this incredible game i wasted so many hours of my life on graphics it all depends on your specs and if you mod it low resolution no mods its essentially a large n64 game polygons everywhere med resolution no mods looks very good water and shadows are rought and large models may repeat patterns but still looks great high resolution no mods probably the most beautiful game youll ever see if you have the capabilities to run it everything looks great the water shadows trees even that angry nord hitting you in the face with a battleaxe high resolution with mods naked people  arrows and bondage slaves everywhere be careful with skyrim mods with resolution packs the game looks incredibly lifelike but theres some strange ones out there mlp friendship is murder mod pack graphics 1010 it all depends on your specs story the great thing about skyrim is that while the main quest is short and fairly easy to complete theres an insane amount of quests and alternate storylines it goes from delivering a sword literally 100 feet away from where youre standing to stopping a midget symbolic representation from getting beaten up by a normal sized symbolic representation to waking up after getting blackout drunk with a god and fondling a religious statue to so much more and with all the radiant quests and random encounters youll never finish it all storylinequests 910 a lot of them repeat ainpcs whoo boy this is where skyrim and really almost all bethesdazenimax games meet some kind of downfall updates have fixed them a lot since the release but many many times has a follower died because they walked straight into my own spellsword swing or repeated the same line over and over or got stuck recently its been much better but its still not very good the characters themselves however are all very good they all have backstories and motives and are all unique ainpcs 7510 lore theres hundreds of books and character dialogue and quests all to tell you the story of tamriel and individual characters the tiniest things have their own mention even if youve never played a single elder scrolls game before this youll pick it up easily but that being said it can be overwhelming when you first start and everything revolves around past lore lore 910 overview pros great graphics good combat system skill trees let you become whatever you want story is incredible nearly no end to the amount of quests easy to mod and a massive modding community hail sithis cons ing ai high specs needed to run at full potential mods and dlc can be wonky with existing saves no lollygaggin overview 910 what did someone steal your sweetroll

category score notes visuals 9 skyrim is a breathtaking and consistent world that makes you want to walk around just to see what else it has to offer open fields mountains and dragons flying in the distance truly make you feel as though youve been sucked into the world of the elder scrolls unfortunately the occasional but noticeable muddy textures can get in the way of that experience story 8 some quests are mundane and some set you on the path to greatness the game presents you with many choices most of which are just different means to the same end but some of which actually have an impact and will make you think twice attentive gamers will find all sorts of hidden stories told through notes subtle dialogue cues or even just the way objects are laid out in a certain room gameplay 7 finding the right difficulty setting can be a challenge in itself and some of the skill trees are significantly more powerful than others nonetheless there is plenty of variety and room for experimentation for how you want to play and plunging a sword through a dragons head rarely gets old the world comes especially alive when you avoid fasttravel sound 10 jeremy souls fourhour soundtrack adds a layer of emotion to your journey through skyrim that i didnt think possible until i heard that choir of over thirty people singing in the dragon tongue the music adds suspense melancholy and wonder to the world towns have their own unique themes as well mods 10 skyrim is a platform for an enormous amount of mods which has allowed it to remain relevant and popular even years after its release if youre just interested in prettying up your game enhancing the vanilla experience and making the game more immersive you can do that but if youd rather drive the batmobile to your sex dungeon and battle flying locomotives you can do that too overall 93 a fun rpg set in an immersive world with epic music and seemingly endless things to do mods transform it from a good game to one of the greatest ever and significantly increases replay value
recommended
great game especially with free mods
recommended
this game is awesome for people who like rpg and dragons this is one of the must buy games the greatest part o the game is its system of leveling up and its skill tree that are smartly made by using the character actions as training and the dungeons are interesting and provide the player a choice to build his own strategic way to do it according to your characters skill and equipment the number of items that you can interact with is unbelieveable just keep in mind that it has some useless itens too the scenes are greatly made with a lot of details it worths every penny but just to be fair theres a point in the game that shouldve be improved the difficult of the puzzles you wont find any hard logical obstacle to get through so its kind an easy game but still worth playing

this was the first elder scrolls game that i played through all the wayive never been crazy into tes games that being said the base game is enjoyable for a while until the quests get very repetitive and tedious fetching a weapon from a cave or killing a animalbandit in a cave stops being fun very quickly and is used very oftenthe main story quests are decent but usually involves the actions mentioned above the combat is very repetitive and simplespells specifically are underwhelming and straightforward the game seems very simple and stripped down compared to other tes games to me its a diamond in the rough a fairly solid game that saw its potential realized by the modding scene and turned into an incredible game with almost limitless possibilities

recently purchased this because i heard there was a large modding community soon after i started playing paid mods were implimented i hated it on the sims ill hate paid mods anywhere else completely misses the point of mods i want to be able to improve my game without paying for rediculous dlc that barely adds anything now i have to pay for what used to be free what about a donation button so we can make sure 100% of the money is going to the person who worked for it not giving you 75% while you sit there collecting cash doing nothing

at the moment of writing this i have over 86 hours played in this game and still im not even near 50% of completion dragons swords bows magic being the chosen one in a land full of mistery i mean what else do you need in a game the gameplay is perfect the graphics are gorgeous  except for the ocassional shadow glitch but nothing you cant fix with a mod  and it has steam workshop for easy mod installation to make it even longer and better and prettier each dlc is worth every single cent because it expands the gameplay a lot and by a lot take my word i mean several hours more for you to spend on this game even though it has the bugs you can expect in a game developed by bethesda  and yes there are lots of bugs and glitches  you dont even care because the game is so ing awesome youll not be paying attention to the bugs and the best part is there are several unofficial and official patches in the workshop that actually fix the bugs so just browsing the workshop for a few minutes is enough to get rid of them a giant map literally thousands of quests to do skills to master monsters to kill books to read dragons to slay spells to learn and places to explore from dungeons to towns a lot of replayability  believe me you wont finish this game with only one character you will be creating several to choose every single side possible in each conflict and making each choice you can to learn the whole story  a magnificent lore and the amount of mods available make this game  along with its dlcs and expansions  one of the best games ever and a must buy from casual to hardcore gamers
recommended
i personally think this is one of the best open world games ive played so far aside from oblivion and morrowind skyrim to me seems to be a watered down version of an elder scrolls game but with much better graphics of course its fit more for console gamers but this is still an awesome game i actually like playing this game with a controller to be honest if you want a more in depht complicated elder scrolls game buy oblivion or morrowind i also like the fact that this game has a steam workshop where you can download mods for your game to alter your experience whether itd be graphics new hair styles weapons quests just about anything you want to add to your game definitely a must have if youre a fan of open world fantasy games that let you do or go wherever you wish

old and buggy game now with extra monetization for the makers and distributors i`d be down for paying very small sums for really good mods but not to valve or bethesda just for sitting back and relaxing 50% to mod authors would be a start but preferably more and of course there is the issue of mod compatibility which is a killer for anything more complex than art or sound mods caveat emptor indeed and the stolen mods for sale its like some backwater flea market with people taking stuff from other peoples tables and putting it on their own

this game is fantastic and is probably the best modern rpg ever made i am not recommending this game only to draw attention to bethesdavalves decision to monetize mods in short heres why charging for mods is a bad thing 1 it exploitsdoes not fairly compensate indie developers they only get 25% of sales who are essentially doing all the work 2 the system has no measure of quality control you may buy a mod that is total garbage breaks the game or breaks other mods 3 someone can very easily steal someones now free mod and throw it up on the store to make a quick buck there is virtually nothing to safeguard against this 4 and perhaps most importantly paid mods erodes the foundations of a community based on creativity cooperation and accessibility 999% of modders got into this as a hobby it was always a labour of love about making something for other people to enjoy for free hence why many of the true sons of modding are staunchly against this change vote with your dollar dont subsidize the catastrophe that is eso or pay for gabens 15th palatial estate this is a clear cut case of greed and basically trying to turn a quick profit off of something that eats away at the heart of the community freetheworkshop

when i originally purchased this game i was under the assumption that yes i would be able to purchase dlc and that is fine thats the prerogative of the creator of the game and i understand and believe that is fine but with the addition of the recent paid for mods i honestly can say i dont believe ill be making another purchase of anything related to tes tes is at its heart in the eyes of the pc gaming community a template the game itself really is relatively lack luster go from point a to point b and kill some draugrs or bandits along the way the combat is weak and floaty and the story alongside characters and environments you deal with do not change or react differently when you defeated what is supposed to be some worldending dragon coming to destroy everything but with the addition of mods that you can download on top of dlc that the games creators have added you can give the game an entirely new perspective and how you want to play it new schools of magic new weapons characters outfits entire other games in the series being recreated morrowind recreation project specifically but the thing about those is that they are free they are from the creators to share with the community mod creators are giving lifes blood to a game that if it didnt have mods would surely fall to the side of the other games in the pc gaming communities huge repertoire of games and mods to pick from by charging for mods you are massively decreasing the available to content to a huge amount of people people that may not have the money to buy dlc people who just want to play the game from a different perspective or the infamous adult mods that im sure many of you know about paying for mods will only be a stake to the heart of the modding community on pc by paying for mods you are killing this i can only hope that valve reconsiders this because it is frankly a very bad move for both steams workshop and community mod makers themselves

 9 points for the quality of the game when modded which is really the only worthy investment of your time 20 points for the attempt to put dollar signs on the last remaining useful distinction between a computer and a console that is the ability to customize your gameplay with third party modifications shame on you valve and bethesda your customers who shell out money for both the base game and the official dlc deserve better than this if you want more income from this game release more quality dlc as you have already it would undoubtedly sell well the bottom line is that if i didnt already own skyrim i wouldnt buy it at all as with the example of thecreativeassembly and their blatant dlc cashgrabs it is a game that i refuse to play along with

this game this wonderful magnificent game i can tell you with 100% certainty is probably one of the best games ive ever played but id sooner go through the hassle of uninstalling it from steam torrenting it from  and using nexusmods which is arguably a better source for modders and where i get 80% of my mods from anyway because the good old boys at valve and bethesda decided they wanted to make a little extra money on a game that was otherwise not generating any more revenue claps for you guys i urge you skyrim community and anybody thinking of buying this game if by the off chance you havent already do not support these people until they give modders at the very least 90% of the profits instead of 25% that they rightfully earn from making such wonderful mods do not buy this game what happened to creating for the sake of creation and enjoyment for others otherwise 1010 would play this game till the end of time probably the best game that i have and will ever play

coming from someone who has never played elder scrolls games with the exception of morrowind though i didnt complete it i was expecting this to be the same and just make me lose complete interest after a short while but turns out to be the complete opposite bethesdas latest elder scrolls game skyrim has really gotten me sucked in and having an interest in the franchise the game was everything that i hoped for back in morrowind but after its poor tutorial confusing gameplay and lack of direction on what to do i gave up but ever since skyrims release bethesda has addressed and improved beyond my expectations beforehand and now things like the free save system where you can save whenever youd like an enjoyable combat system with various kill animations thirdperson mode the improved questing journal and map tracking settling and customizing your own houses or even just listening to the nordic chants of the fantastic soundtrack these all add up to the experience the story plays a fairly big part in any rpg the rebel stormcloaks who are trying to break free from the empire and be independant from the imperial legion who are in conflict and waging war to determine who will prevail and claim skyrim as their own as well as having the infamous thalmor elves have a neutral alliance with the imperial legion in which nearly destroyed the empire years ago a scapegoat in the middle of all this dragons have been coming back to life without any explaination and how you need to stop it from happening as the dragonborn or it will be the end of times with the legendary dragon alduin the main antagonist of the game while i applaud bethesda for making such interesting and enjoyable sidestorylines across the entire game without spoilers the main quests are somewhat disappointing especially near the end as i felt the conclusion didnt live up to my expectations and felt underwhelmed i didnt feel like it was a huge accomplishment which is something i really wanted at the end of this especially with alduin leading the charge as soon as the game starts youre thrown right into the storyline with a very intense introduction and will eventually meet various characters along the way who you befriend to aid you along your adventures npcs while theyre improved the guards may be just as generic while some of the other npcs are unique and different in their own way other than some shared voices learning about their backstory or an issue that we could help them with allows for many ways to approach this game and its interaction this is an rpg for a reason and because of that its very welcome to not only talk with npcs but also reading various books and history about the events before and during skyrim there are many things to do in this game such as lockpicking crafting exploring cooking or just having some fun with a quest or killing random foes you meet out in the wild many other skills such as heavy armor for example make you tougher and harder to beat down and reducing the weight of your armor less weight  holding onto more items when you wear heavy armor with various perks or sneak which allows you to be more difficult to spot for enemies you and also gaining various perks to say do 6x the damage with a onehander if you attack while sneaking this can make encounters fun and how you want to deal with enemies throughout the game did i mention this game allows you to go at your own pace meaning you can approach a quest the way you want to and when you want to theres no handholding here you do what you want making this game great for exploration which is hard to resist as youll never know what you may find be it a random encounterevent a rare itemquest or dungeon for even more loot not only that but their are no classes so you can choose to be whatever youd like whether it be someone who relies on sneak and stealth to take out your enemies the typical heavy armored warrior and fire casting wizard or why not do a mix of either you can dualwield a sword with a magic spell in your offhand rather than a shield this lets to decide and choose on how you as the player want to play their character in a way you enjoy it the most that being said while the roleplaying part is indeed fact the combat is still not as great as many claim it to be yes it has improved animations it doesnt feel as stiff like it did previously in previous games when you say swing your sword at the enemy and even has a killcam with various kill finishers which is badass i find it boring chopwork while watching the enemy health bar slowly get shorter and shorter then drink potions when my own health goes low rinse and repeat the finishing moves are awesome to look at and make you go that was brutal but eventually the same finishing moves occur back and forth and it gets old fairly quickly yes youll unlock more the further you get into the game but their isnt a huge variety something id also like to add as well while this game is great on its own the true replayability and survival of this game continuing is simply the mods the modding community has grown so much and popular with the game that many people have implemented new weapons armor mounts quests character customization and even zones into the game pure console gamers have no idea what theyre missing just seeing articles and videos doesnt do the modding community justice it adds more depth and provides a lot more fun what the modding community has achieved with skyrim is downright incredible combat overhauls visual enhancements immersion mods entirely new lands and even ui mods can add so much to the experience half second loading times are a bonus of course their are still small bugsglitches that can occur but are most of the time easily fixed with a reload i have about more than 30 mods installed and my game is running smoothly on highest settings at the end of the day i feel as though bethesda has done an outstanding job and made me an elder scrolls fan where the previous games did more or less some factors in the previous game i did not like in morrowind everything here in skyrim is so much more polished and well done its a lot easier to get into skyrim has raised the bar for all other rpgs out there and should not be ignored if you do not have this game yet despite the disappointing ending in my opinion of the main storyline i have to say that dawnguard and dragonborn are much better making the game even better since they both add quite a bit of content and storytelling to the game and fleshing out the world even more if youre looking to getting this game i recommend you wait for a sale on the legendary edition that way you get everything in one and youre set to go oh and you cant forget the mods it makes the game that much better

this game is ok without mods although it has a lot of issues and is quite light on content i had racked up less than 10 hours on the game without mods and completed the main storyline and most of the major secondary storylines in that time the best part of this game was the mods when modded this is one of the best games i have ever played and that relied on a passionate and dedicated modding community valve and bethesda have sought to harm both modders and particularly mod users by introducing paid mods the lions share at least 75% of which does not go to the mod authors and instead goes to steam or bethesda these changes will only harm the modding community which was a thriving and successful community that entirely relied on the sharing of one anothers work and cooperating with one another to fix issues on top of this neither valve nor bethesda will be providing support or quality control for this service installing mods has always been fraught with issues such as compatibility issues with your hardware and other mods getting around these issues and making mods compatible with one another again relied on a united community that worked together instead of in competition without official support or proper quality control you will have a very limited idea of whether the mod you are purchasing will interfere with another installed mod or cause corruption to your save game a common occurrence when installing mods additionally these compatibility problems often do not manifest themselves until a certain aspect or area of the game is encountered which will usually occur after steams 24 hour refund period it took me the course of a couple of weeks to find a mod setup that worked without much issue and that time was almost entirely filled with personally testing mod compatibility and seeking fixes to the issues that arrived if you intend to install more than one or two mods you will need more than 24 hours to ensure that they work properly

if you wanted to buy this game because you heard of great mods which give it second life dont do it it is now being monetized microtransactions are coming and what people have been getting for free over last 3 years is now being put behind paywall huge disappointment

can mod out bugs added paid mods content creators get a measily 25% of profit sets a terrible precedent for the future of gaming while it is fun once you mod out bugs and add features the addition of a paywall to have that fun is ludicrous valve stop trying to kill mod communities

yes i know there are about ten thousand reviews out there ranging from omg best game 1010 to this is horrible and overhyped 100000 out of 10 but i wanted to write this to cleanse my mind and soul from the hatred of the genre that i have held on to for a long while anyway youre more than welcome to skip this unless you want to hear just what i have to say firstly going to gloss over really quickly some things as i played this vanilla no mods that im sure has been said hundreds of time still necessary if you want an honest opinion somewhat glitchy menu could be reworked difficulty rating is all over the place customization could be better bugs bugs everywhere now that is over with time to share my thoughts on this game and it was fun i cannot deny personally i think the pacing was a bit slow but totally worth it for what it is the landscape is just so beautiful its actually amazing to run around in here instead of fast travelling all over the place dont care if the trek is four hours by foot i can collect some things along the way while im at it and probably find a place or two to discover some neat gear the most amazing part at least to me were the dragon fights this is exactly how i picture epic fights for supremacy when i hear that dovahkiin chanting as im shooting arrow after arrow at those flying worms i cant help but feel as if i am a hero destined to rid the world of evil the story is actually pretty nice though it kind of tends to speed over here and there which isnt too big of a deal hope you love side quests because there are many of them in here dont feel like going out to kill things no problem collect various materials to do alchemy enchanting or some basic crafting if you are hardcore fan of the game there is plenty of backstory given to you by various important and notsoimportant people you just need to ask around in addition there are hundreds of books that just ooze so much story that it could be collected in a single book itself this game isnt meant for casual players though its really more geared towards those that just love roleplaying not the leveling aspects i mean actual legitamite youareinthisworld beliefitornot kind of game that just begs you to check every square inch to find that next quest or maybe some piece of gear that will aid you in your quests to save all of skyrim to put this entire game in a few short words its just plain exhaustive simple as that

skyrim without mods was a subpar buggy lack of functionality game it really takes a good 50 mods to make it what it has been hyped to 50 paid mods would be at least the price of the game if anything bethesda should be paying modders for upkeeping and fixing their work no point in buying bethesda games anymore theyll release them with decreasing quality expecting modders to not only fix their crap but rake in the money while doing it bethesda and valve will never get another dime from me

skyrim is a brilliant game made awesome by the modding communitynoone forced the modding community to create these mods no guns to the head no coercion they did it because they love to do it its a passion for some a hobby for most my hobby is painting pictures i could sell them but i mostly give them away for free modders made mods and their payment was the awe and respect from the community the thanks and gratitude which is more than any amount of money to create something that someone loves gives you such an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment and pride and inspires you to continue  that is the payment paying for mods opens the dark gates to criminal factions and influences to corporate run mod factories that churn out mods for profit but for valve to take 75% of the profit from the sale of each mod made is shocking to profit out of someone elses hard work time energy and creativity is parasitical however corporate greed knows no bounds it is a voracious immoral beast with an endless appetite i cannot in all good conscience recommend modded skyrim and a message to valve why you do not need the money millions of sales occur globally on a daily basis pc gamers love you guysso why

i wouldnt mind paying a little to support mod developers but bethesda taking 75% is just disgusting im not going to even start on the effects to the modding community and legal issues its a bad idea and its badly implemented my review will stay negative until bethesda & valve pull their heads out of each others asses
not recommended
this game will be part of history as the game that spoiled the modding community  i dont think it will destroy modding but the longterm effects are unknown modding was an innocent thing outside of the corporate shenigans where fans changed or built up on the vanilla game for their own or everyones enjoyment without financial interests nobody even thought of charging a dollar for a custom sword and armor now valve and lets not forget bethesda have pulled this once innocent hobby into corporate space by waving some dollars before their faces of which they will keep most btw the current result is a toxicity that was formerly unknown between all involved parties modders vs players players vs modders modders vs other modders everyone foragainst valve and bethesda well done i dont think anyone is truly against modders earning money for their work there are some huge mods of dlc quality we too know that donations have never worked in the past in the sense of getting a decent income comparable to an income in the games industry that wasnt a problem modders helped one another shared knowledge and resources and provided their mods for free of course some mods get stuck and never finished but that wasnt the norm and there are other ways to cope with that eg kickstarter also i doubt this will change significantly with paid mods as the modders are still not obliged to fix bugs or finish a mod in the new system heres a compiled list of whats wrong right now maybe thats not everything and theres more in the details but these seem to be the most important issues valve gets 30% of the cake while its ok for them to get some out of it for hosting and occasionally marketing i dont know if thats enough for a third of the income 10% feels more appropriate in the end they get nothing for all the free mods traffic and mods help sell the game so they already profited bethesda gets 45% of the cake for what they should get nothing or maybe 5% for providing the modding tools but in the end mods help them already for longevity of their product its a selling point and especially mods that improve or even fix the base game should be paid for by them modders dont get money until they reached 400$ sales so if theyre stuck at 399$ they will never see money while valvebethesda already earned 300$ without contributing anything to the content creation mods depending on other mods can build up to a paychain oh you just bought the 2$ spell mod now youll need some other mods for just 799$ a heavily modded game eg to show off what the engine is able to do can cost multiple times more than the base game especially with older titles on sale theres 25000 mods in steam workshop alone just to remind you also problems arise when an always free mod heavily referenced in other mods suddenly decides to charge a plethora of copyright and distribution issues with modders helping one another and sharing resources some mods have been taken down due to this already  oh i forgot valve will not let the authors take mods down anymore btw how come some of the first mods are swords based on the design of swords from a completely different game what does the original designer get ripoffmods that are plagiated moneygrabs based off of some other available mods barely changed and used without permission some free mods have been taken down from other sources already to prevent this theres no way to get your money back when a mod brakes you can only convert to steam coin for 24h after buying theres no quality assurance that checks for incompatible mods so your newly bought mod may break anytime when you buy another one paid modders are not obliged to fix or update anything if its broken because of an engine update after a week combined with the point above your money goes poof or is at least in valves pockets forever as of now this new system has done enormously more harm than good mods have been and will be taken down here and elsewhere legal issues are just starting to unfold the community is split between the hobbyists and the ones with dollar signs in their eyes mods are being pirated there are heated debates going on and frontiers are building up between former allies for the coming cold war and inevitable skirmishes nothing of this existed as mods were free its just sad all because of a little money the game itself would get a maybe 6810 btw depending on what youre into this downvote results from the idiots in suits that forgot why there is modding in the first place and thus harming this game as well as modding in general
not recommended
valve introduced paid workshop mods for skyrim as a result changing my review to negative you shouldnt charge people for mods and try to sell them as dlc valve especially when your making large profits at the expense of the creators forcing the mods to take a 25% cut for 100% of the work they put in to make it coupled with the fact that you are unprepared unless legally obliged to take down mods once the creator says they dont want you representing them people can and should support mod creators via donations or better yet a larger cut of the profit for their work and a right to pull their own work should they choose to putting them behind a pay wall is god damn atrocious this practice is immoral and deplorable i hope valve turns this around
not recommended
this game with mods is great introducing a paywall and trying to sell previously free content giving the content creators a fraction of the money breaking the modding community shame on you valvebethesda the whole benefit of buying this game and similar games on pc is for the modding opportunities if you take that away or monetize it you breed bad feeling and remove the sole purpose of getting the game on this platform on the first place introducing this system retroactively is an even worse idea people may have hundreds of mods what happens if large numbers of them rely on a mod that has now become paid and the person doesnt want to cant afford to pay whatever they are charging congratulations you just broke their game

this game was one of the best games to try after you upgraded your computer or got a new emphasis on was you could see how many amazing mods you could install until the game couldnt handle it anymore if your computer was really up to snuff you could make the game look amazing and surpass even the most recent games unfortunately everything is slowly moving behind a paywall so even if this game goes on sale for say $5 you could easily spends many times that amount for something i was once able to do freely

if we  on this game enough theyll stop their payfor mods you dont do this for the same reason you dont sit infront of a street preformer charging every person who stops and listens an ammount of money and then take 75% 25% for yourself because you own the street and 50% to the owner of the song the street preformer is covering thats exactly what valve is doing and if we  on this game enough theyll stop it here if we dont well have to pay 5 bucks for a mod for gta v that gives us 1 extra gun

cant recommend with paid mods modding is one of the pillars of pc gaming and the best part was that it was always done in good faith until now this is nothing but a money grab im not giving valve or bethesda any more of my money for somebody elses work i would happily support modders with a donation button where all the money goes to the actual modder sadly i dont see that happening

i rated this game 9510 reason being is that the gameplay is amazing no doubt about that but the storyline is a bit dull i didnt find myself wanting to play the storyline cause really by the looks of it it just felt really dull and not as much time was put into creating a good storyline its not half bad in my opinion but the story line does need some work hopefully the elder scrolls vi has a better storyline now onto the graphics and soundtrack in my opinion the graphics were very well done the soundtrack went very well with the graphics i dont pay much attention to graphics but i think the elder scrolls v skyrim has one of the greatest graphic design now the dlcs if anyone is new and reading this youll find out skyrim comes with 3 dlcs dawnguard dragonborn and hearthfire all very well though out dlcs the first one being about vampires and vampire hunters dawnguard has an amazing storyline adding in quite a bit to the game new weapons armors etc now onto the dragonborn dlc one of my alltime favorites with an amazing yet long storyline to keep you playing for quite a bit the dragonborn dlc brings you the ability to tame and ride dragons along with a few new shouts weapons armor and somewhere new to explore off the coast of morrowind is all im saying the rest youll find out on your own after you purchese the dragonborn dlc which i highly recommend you do we know come to our final dlc hearthfire basically it isnt really that exciting the only thing it really adds is a few miscs that can be used to build your house or as gifts for your children but otherwise thats about it well those are my reasons why skyrim got a 95 outta me but however i will give bonus ratings for the dlcs which id give skyrim along with the dlcs probably a 9710 not much of a difference i know but so much could be improved and of course we cannot forget the mods along with modsdlcs and the game itself thats when the game recieves a 1010 rating thanks for reading my review of skyrim by the way i love reviewing games d
recommended
fairly decent game especially with mods has a large open world however most of the content is the same from dungeon to dungeon mods are pretty much a must in my opinion as they do a number of things from increasing the difficulty of higher levels making it look much better to fixing a number of broken or exploitable mechanics i would recommend skyui at the very least to make the ui much more usable for someone in with a mouse

ive been on steam for 10 years in all this time ive never been more upset at them than i am now keep in mind i used steam back when it was a platform that hardly worked the friends system was purely cosmetic it never worked and you needed someones account name in order to add them it was buggy crashy resourceintensive and slow i always liked it because it let me avoid having to keep track of cds and cd keys which i would end up losing eventually this is the last straw though valve ruined the very thing that allowed them to thrive mods halflife was intended to be a very moddable game and from that they have allowed games like natural selection 2 counterstrike team fortress and left 4 dead to come into existence the worst thing about the paid mods is that the creator only gets a 25% cut after the mod sells $400 usd equivalent the money goes into their steam wallet which cannot be used as regular funds for everyday life not to mention you can sell someone elses work as your own and earn money from someone elses hard work this is not only dishonest it is illegal  this activity forces people who would otherwise make free mods to monetize because if they dont then someone else will and will have control over this intellectual property valve opened a can of worms by pulling this stunt i doubt theyll ever live it down

ive played this on xbox and pc and i might not have alot of hours on here but thats because i dont own it yet but ive played it alot on pc and it is alot better on pc i plan to buy the game for pc soon i could spend countless hours on here because of mods but if all the modmakers start making us pay for mods then im afraid this game will have lost its touch so until this paid mod conflict is resolved im going to have to give a negative review just put a donation button please

and this is how customers get screwed once more remember dlcs how they became so widespread in the industry and hurt the enjoyment of many titles well now companies like valve and bethesda have a great idea why spend resources doing new stuff when people will do it for them in their free time mark my words paid mods will be the future of gaming valve just opened the flood gates to a whole new era of greedy corporativism where games that previously refused to release modding tools will magically see their error and let players form the games dlc screwing gamers and modders in the process as they make money you hated day one dlc wait until you hear day one paid mods from famous modders

in and by itself skyrim is a good game however like any game it will get old and repetitive what has kept me coming back has been a main reason ive constantly returned to bethseda games a very vibrant and active modding community given a little time after a games release you could find mods that can tweak and change almost any aspect of the game to customize it to how you wanted it over time the mods grow more sophisicated and ones are out overhauling entire aspects of the game or adding quests and areas that rival or exceed even official expansions work was shared and expanded on some modders soley created resources for others while others used them to craft entire graphic overhauls areas companions perk systems ect the new update and focus on paid mods already seems to fractured that and raises many headaches i wont go into it in a review other then to say id suggest reading an article put out by forbes it summerizes it pretty well httpwwwforbescomsitesinsertcoin20150424valvespaidskyrimmodsarealegalethicalandcreativedisaster the reason i wouldnt recommend this now is that a mess is going to be swirling around this and theres no way to tell exactly how it will settle and lets admit it without the mod scene that grew up the game becomes another decent rpg  good design fun to play through once or twice and then collects dust the steam store is full of them for lesser prices as a last thought its hard to believe this is about helping modders a 25% cut on sales for the accountants out there im not sure if a dontation would be via what nexus does would be considered taxable income but since youre actively selling a product now im assuming that this paid system would be doesnt seem like a good deal we pay new associates straight out of school a higher cut of production plus a base mininium and thats with around a 5560% overhead for a medical office i doubt the workshop overhead runs that high  just a thought

everyone knows this is the best game ever made and if you think otherwise then you are wrong this is an open world action rpg it is my favourite game by far and only the next sequel can ever top it you start off as a prisoner whos about to be beheaded from there you create your character from a variety of different races human or beast there is endless customization with what you can create and how realistic you character will look if you use mods you dont have to because without this will still be your favourite game experience ever but i dont see why not because its simple to download mods from the nexus with just a few clicks and if you dont want to do that then you can easily browse the workshop from your library and install mods with a click of a button thats what has kept this game so fun for so long and it will never get boring or old theres various factions throughout the game you can join and become leader of you can even become a werewolf or a vampire the characters are all unique and loveable and you can have followers and even get married to your favourite ones you can craft armor and weapons enchant them upgrade them you can create potions you can have your own home in this game you level up and gain skill points to build the type of character you want you can make a perk legendary when it gets to 100 so you level endlessely theres always a rewarding amount of loot in each cave or dungeon you clear i could go on forever even just standing in the town enjoying the view of the lake is enjoyable in this game the possibilitys with this game because of mods are endless theres no need in other games when this game has everything you could think of seriously you have to buy it if you want a game you will never get bored of be easy to go back to whenever you want never 100% complete because theres to much to do then buy skyrim

skyrim only shines in what it allows which is acting as a medium for custom content from peers and it does it well in itself it is weak the story is not very engaging most of the time relying on its many shinies and features radiant ai is frankly quite boring after the third time bugs are of course literred throughout the game as every tes game does but as you might guess it shines where everyone knew it was really designed for mods the range of oppertunity for what can be modified and added is even wider then its predecessors by the time the ck came out the game had more impressive mods then oblivion that is a testament to the creativity of your peers and it should be the primary reason for you to buy this game buying this game without getting involved in the modding scene is a waste of money getting involved with having it modded however is more then worth your money no skill required just pay attention
recommended
the elder scrolls v  skyrim is with no doubt one of the best games recently released an openworld rpg with an infinite amount of quests and modding support  count me in the replayability is also almost endless because you can make a totally new character with other skills and so have a new experience installing mods can also help you fighting the boredom when youve reached 300 hours ingame

whenever you watch a video on youtube about skyrim you will bump into a person claiming that skyrim has been totally dumbed down and its a  game and bethesda sucks and believe me this works for any yt video about skyrim even ost vids type skyrim into youtube and watch the magic unfold whats interesting about this though is that these comments always turn into a heated war between skyrim lovers and the op who apparently hates skyrim and guess what both are right a year ago i watched samyouls video about the elder scrolls series being dumbed down although personally i felt that skyrim was one of the best games i have ever played i spent literally an entire summer day and night playing skyrim i clicked that little like button at the bottom of his vid and although i have played oblivion quite a lot and i own morrowind though i have yet to give that a serious try i did not like that video because i was flooded with nostalgia about how good and complex and detailed the older elder scrolls games were i clicked that because i did feel that skyrim was the most stripped game of the entire series conversations no longer had pages upon pages of topics to scroll through quests were no longer memorable we would never get another guild tale reaching the depths of the arena questline in oblivion and the oblivion gates all unique in their own ways were replaced by generic miniboss fights that happened whenever a dragon decided to attack you so why am i recommending this game because although its dumbed down skyrim is fun to play oblivion was indeed more complex than skyrim in many aspects custom spells and complicated alchemy just to name a few but at the same time oblivion was annoying to play i had to carry around extra weapons at all times in case they broke which was a nice but very annoying little feature present in oblivion and not in skyrim and although even as a whole skyrims mechanics could not reach the complexity found in rpgs like neverwinter nights it manages to string together all of its little parts and create something thats not complex or deep but is fun yes morrowind and oblivion were better more complex games yes they were deep in detail and lore but skyrim doesnt remove those aspects entirely they just sacrifice some of the less pleasing parts whoever needed 4 pieces of equipment to brew a potion to make an overall nicer and more pleasing tone to the game conversations feel natural im no longer talking to mr imperial city tour guide whenever i talk to a guard im talking to a tired man whos more happy in bed than patrolling around in the cold and probably cant really stop to chitchat anyway i think this all has to do with the evolution of the elder scrolls series daggerfall was in my opinion the pinnacle of the series in terms of complexity the entire yes entire continent of tamriel was rendered in the game and you could travel the entire continent though it would take hours to get to anywhere just like in real life morrowind sacrificed that feature to make the game a bit more accessible oblivion added fast travel and removed chancebased combat focusing more on skill and skyrim removes the complexities of most activities but i dont mind that nor do i protest that games i feel should be rated based on how fun they are to play i dont want to come home on a friday night just to spend hours worrying about how im going to get more repair hammers i want to come home on that friday night and play a good game in conclusion theres a difference between a good game and a fun game i feel that the elder scrolls series is slowly transitioning from being a good game to being a fun game but the thing that makes this series great is that its vital to maintain a balance between the two so no matter how dumbed down the game no matter how stripped the content bethesda is going to keep on making good elder scrolls games the lore demands it the story demands it the content demands it there is always going to be a good in a fun elder scrolls game skyrim is proof of that that there can be a balance between the two even if it means sacrificing a bit of one to rebalance the other skyrim is not a good game skyrim is a good and fun game 1001

the game that had a really big hype before launch and also delivered lots of fun during launch first look at the game at a friends house and i was tempted to buy it lucky enough for me that someone generous decided to gift me a copy from what i experienced this game has a lot of content ranging from epic main quests to the little quests it gives the flexibility of what were gonna do and also the combat it has so many stuff to do and finish it feels like it goes on and on not even going through half the gameplay and not to mention the mod support skyrim has a lot of custom mods created by the skyrim community resulting in endless fun and laughter in the game itself conclusion openworld rpg with mod support can also be classified as sandbox preferrably one of the best games of the era

skyrim is by far my favourite game and even if your graphics card isnt that good the game still looks amazing i definitely reccomend buying the game because alongside the main quest there are a ton of dungeons and endless scenery to explore edit after reading negative reviews purely to get myself angry one comment caught my eye they mentioned that the game had a single digit amount of voice actors in comparison to oblivion skyrim has 80 actors each essential and quest related character having their own voice personality and fighting style the game involves unique characters and this is quite contrary to the previous games in the elder scrolls series my previous review sounds bland to what this game is in reality the team of bethesda has worked hard to make this game immersive yet make you feel like you are living a fantasy life i know after playing oblivion for many hours in the years before skyrim came out the fifth installment of the tes was a breakthrough for bethesda with the soundtrack recorded by an orchestra and an arrangement of vocals it is enough to send shivers down your spine after 600 hours in this game over multiple platforms and computers there is always something new with the community releasing a constant stream of mods there is an infinite amount of time to spend in this game its easy to waste time in skyrim and there is always something to distract you from your quest there are multiple ways to play this game as a mage warrior an archer an assassin the list goes on every enemy in skyrim is levelled to your character which makes the choice of weapons and magic you use critical the dragonborn dlc adds in many more hours to your gametime along with hearthfire after saying all of this i realise that each person might take skyrim differently i know that its been amazing for me and i hope many more people choose to buy this game

what else can i say about this game skyrim is expansive and with the support of user mods it encourages the way to the played in various ways

where do i start with this game first off i have to say i was highly impressed with how the game held up its so immersive i sometimes forgot about my 5 pet cats georgie nintendo jeffery hinawa and paul enough about my cats though lets talk about the game you start out as a prisoner being held by the enclave natives of the civilized cosmopolitan province of sky rom the enclave are welleducated wealthy and wellspoken imperials are also known for the discipline and training of their citizen armies because of this the imperials have dominated tamriel for more than 2000 years after spending an hour giving your character the right sized eyebrows scars facepaint mascara toupes and even writing a 5page backstory for him that goes indepth on his early childhood love life carreer and even has a little page at the end with fun facts about him that werent included in the actual story you go to the stone so a guy can chop off your head coincidentally right as youre about to meet your fate a talking dragon man comes down and kills the bad guys you escape with the man after that the world is yours fight off bad guys develop a stealing addiction mindlessly repeat the words fus ro dah out in public mod the game so theres naked ladies everywhere download the mods where you can kill the kids anything you can imagine the sky is the limit this game will be the demise of your computer with the right amount of graphical mods but who cares your computer hell no your computer cant even talk unlike any other rpg today call of duty ghosts viva piata super mario 3d world earthbound this game has something that all the others dont and that is love what does play skyrim mean to me many groupies are not experienced with play the elder scrolls v skyrim play the elder scrolls v skyrim the elder scrolls on steam was my bread and butter play the elder scrolls v skyrim the elder scrolls the elder scrolls v skyrim the elder scrolls is known to cause this ok thats one reason i have one play the elder scrolls v skyrim the elder scrolls v skyrim that i dont leave to play the elder scrolls v skyrim the elder scrolls skyrim skyrim v on steam it is a well worn feeling that is the latest installment of my online play the elder scrolls v skyrim the elder scrolls series my play the elder scrolls v skyrim university will tell you how to do this that is true for all intents and purposes i dont need to put myself in a tight spot play the elder scrolls v skyrim online is one of the most popular collectible play the elder scrolls v skyrim online types it certainly takes into account a puzzle several fellow travelers have with play the elder scrolls v skyrim when we look at it as a whole here are the essentials referring to watch play the elder scrolls v skyrim i had never laid eyes on this before that night there is however a happy medium between it and it by what means do noobs collect sterling watch the elder scrolls new online handbooks deep breath ok all you want is a bit of imagination im not searching for formulas to make up for the past currently we are offering more the elder scrolls v skyrim when i get my dress in lights how do connoisseurs capture inexpensive play the elder scrolls v skyrim the elder scrolls on steam  in any respect not many children desire to do what is good for them and i have a bit of staying power when discusssingplay the elder scrolls v skyrim you probably feel the same way they do the elder scrolls 5 the elder scrolls v skyrim the elder scrolls skyrim the elder scrolls v the elder scrolls v steam the elder scrolls v skyrim dawnguard online the elder scrolls online the elder scrolls v bethesda the elder scrolls 5 v skyrim

1010 after countless hours on journeys and quests all over skyrim id like to mirror my impression in this review i had high expectations for tesv skyrim and i wasnt let down by bethesda i bought the game at release and im still playing it today cause in my opinion its still one of the very best actionrpgs ever so lets take a closer look why i think so story the main story covers the appearance of dragons in skyrim and the role which our protagonist plays within it as tesusuall the main quest can be completed within several hours even though its predictable its not boring the presentation of the happenings in skyrim is epic and fighting the main quest is fun as usuall you do not need to follow the main quest and can start exploring the map from the very beginning without any obstruction through not following the questline sidequests a sidequest can be found around ever corner in skyrim and as expected they cover every event you can think of from loveletters and intrigues up to assasinations and theft almost everyone has a story to tell and need your help with it of course fighting the fights in tesv are very actionheavy and have nothing in common with traditional roleplaying games simple math the one with the bigger weapon wins most of the time if you dont expect strategic roundbased and profound battles you will be very happy in skyrim because after all the fights are a lot of fun and the fact that you can still chose how your character should fight  either with spells and summons or with swords and shields  makes the fights enjoyable characterdesign and gameplay the character customization in tesv is extensive as used to tesgames you can make your character fit perferctly your preffered playstyle the visual custimization is as wide as the playing one  lots of different armorsets which you gather from quests find in dungeons or craft yourself give your character a unique look the skill perks are very deeply designed to match your preffered playstyle you can create loads of perk combinations to design your unique character every playstyle you can imagine is covered by it you want stealthing destruction mage in heavy armor with alchemy skills and pickpocketing  sure an axe wielding rogue light armor and the ability to summon creatures and also handle a big twohanded mace  not a problem the elder scrolls  skyrim is a very extensive game with a huge world to explore and countless dungeons to defent elder scrolls fans arent even asking themselfs to buy it or not for rpg and action fans its definitly worth a closer look its contains hundreds and hundreds of hours of quests and exploration and at least for me never gets boring

its pretty mediocre unless you get the dlc and then mod it to just before the point where the mod bloat makes it explode like any bethesda game its not so much a game as it is an engine and a landscape for modders to do their stuff so really youd better be competent at installing mods and getting them to like each other learn how to use wrye bash and boss be smart about which mods you pick use the online gems list as a guideline and avoid workshopnmm manager like the plague

one of the best games i have played
recommended
i personally would recommend this game to everyone who lands on this page skyrim was initially the first game i played in the elder scrolls series despite not having any experience in any of the other elder scrolls games i was still able to experience the excitement that the lore has to offer i have spent countless hours on console exploring the vast and open landscape that skyrim has to offer and as i began to feel as though i have done all i could i then bought the dlcs and boy did that extend the playtime a whole lot i remember when i bought my first plot of land and built my first house with the hearthfire dlc it was heljarchen hall i made the house with a magealchemists touch i felt as though i had accomplished something againdragonborn was the most epic experience ive ever had from additional content the vast lands of solstheim added another 200 hours to my playtime xbox and i achieved countless hours of epic battle and excitement exploration on the island led to me discovering more and more quests that kept throwing more fun at menow for the dawnguard dlc well dawnguard is a good dlc the thing i enjoyed most about it though was having serana as my companion the crossbows were also a really nice addition they added a new way to play skyrim when i had completed all of the game having only the repetitive side quests left i decided to start over again and experience the game all over again it was different personally id like to say that there are so many paths you can take so many ways you can play this game and so many different adventures you can go on in this game but its your choice to keep pushing on
recommended
the only true perfect open world game i have ever come across 1 smart npcs 2 fully open world 3 complete freedom to play how you want 4 never really ending you can always find something new 5 look up mods on the steam workshop once you put 100 or so hours into the game without mods there is nothing negative about this game i would buy this game if it was $20000 i really hope they remaster some of the older elder scrolls sometime
recommended
its a bethesda game so of course even years after release it still has a few bugs hiding around in its crevices the combat is playable and the stealth system is in no way balenced the game has alot to do in plenty of places but never alot to do in one place it is an oceans worth of content but at no point in that ocean is there any depth excluding the main quest line and the dragonborn dlc the game just feels rushed the standard guilds that are in every elder scrolls game are fairly lackluster with few of them even making you feel involved in the group the entire mages guild questiline would have been 2 missions worth of mages guild in oblivion the civil war barely has an effect on the game you can beome thane of all skyrim by moving goods from point a to point b the most humerous part of the game are the guards who all apparently hail sithis the crafting system fluidity of combat and mods are what saves this game crafting is quite honestly fun if it wasnt for the new and better leveling system i would put all my skill points into it with no regard for my own life if bethesda had delivered on the econonomy system they promised us than maybe i would be able to without dying to the wolves in between riverwood and whiterun i enjoy traveling to mines slaughtering the residents and then stealing the ores to forge more weapons and armor to help me do it all over again mods fix many of the problems with the game from graphics to ai bugs to the lack of a good storyline for guilds honestly i am going to say that vannila skyrim gets a different rating than modded skyrim since modded the game is just so vastly different vannila 7610 modded 9210

short review 50 hours and more of pure fun if you enjoyed oblivion or witcher series you should definitely try this one good points  good enough main story and insteresting subquests  aswesome graphics and landscapes  skill trees and combat  huge world  best elder scroll so far  open worldness you feel quite free bad points  can easily become too easy if you abuse the game unbalanced  can lose interest if leave the main story  repetition ex killing the first dragon is cool but afterward it becomes too easy and boring chasing them

the buggy horses make this game 10% more amazing

this game is so fun with so much to do you can chose what you want to do and play way different then your friends while both enjoying the experience with this game your not limited to the main quest but other side quests some small some big not to mention you can mod this game with both the workshop and from websites adding even more to the experince even if you have played skyrim before on a console to get the true skyrim expeince along with downloading mods you must play it on pc def a must buy 1010

mankinds first step into space colonization skyrim combines elements from many other successful titles into a bland pure joy the game boldly takes inspiration from call of duty mimicking its graphical fidelity perfectly the environments one visits are truely breathtaking my favorite was cave107 you cave106 lovers 107 was superior in every way the combat was nailbiting at every turn i wasnt sure if id have to alter my tactics from an encounter to encounter basis however i was able to prevail with my old faithful strategies it reminded much of the feeling of being a warrior constantly improving his unique tecnique as his life progresses the music was truly astounding i liked the part where the choir yelled the combat mechanics were unlike any other who knew that streamlining the looking for raid mode in world of warcraft wouldve benfited a single player rpg the indepth lore behind the dragons was spiller aletawesome end of spilerthe games loot system was incredibly rewarding too i fealt like an empowered badass slaying bandits and then picking up their numerous loaf of bread on the topic of bread the cooking in the game was unlike any other ive seen chef gordon ramsey would draw inspiration from these mechanics inspiring how does one describe the dragon fights in one word extrimtensesomelybadawsom i had to make up a word just to describe these fights1 the battles were tests of everything ive learned my twelve years of life everything ive ever known culminated into these battles if you are faint of heart do not play this game each type of dragon stronger than the last bringing its own unique menchanics to the mix forcing you to adapt your life to battle them the fact that i can just be attempting to meet my wife in my home city just to be attacked by a dragon helps to build up the feeling of hopelessness this world has and in no way breaks the flow of the game in conclusion this game is my game of a lifetime this game will define me as my life continues and i master the art of making nude mods perfect for the kids bring family 129 and if you disagree  you best game every ou fuxing noob i swaert plp ike youy are rong with gem industry askig higher texutre resolitiin  you this gamew is perfect for my imac when iom game and sneak

i do believe its obvious to say that anyone that is a fan of the elder scrolls wont be too disapointed by what skyrim has to offer from discovering unmarked caves and forts to the games storyline even to the odd things weve come to expect in games by bethesda npcs walking in the air projectiles launching people thirty feet away placing npc bodies in awkward positions the game will give you the chance to kill a couple of hours and lets not forget the modding commuity those people never fail to disappoint and kudos to them all for the work they do from the unofficial skyrim patches for bug fixes to new and immersive weaponsarmors to ai adjustments and value tweeks to make the game a challenge for even the the most experienced and wellgeared player or even just to make the game even more amazing to look at the work they do easily adds countless hours of additional gameplay thatll help you milk more enjoyment out of the game than steam sales milk money out of your wallet edit not responsible for any problems that may occur with the game if you decide to try out manually installing mods to improve your gameplay experience remember google is your friend in instances like this

the main quest denotes tasks the dragonborn is compelled to complete as part of the games main story other quests can be performed for a guild or faction while others are considered side quests which skirt on the periphery of the games plotlines as with most of the elder scrolls titles there are quests for each of the daedric princes of tamriel excluding jyggalag unique to skyrim are radiant quests quests which are initiated as part of the radiant story artificial intelligence system these quests can be repeated an infinite number of times allowing for neverending gameplay

first id like to point out that the game itself is fantastic and it is through the multitude of mods that make it so damn amazing now that steam is supporting paid mods more and more content is and will be put behind pay walls welcome to the new era of dlc dlc that the company itself doesnt have to make i do not support steams idea of paid mods

i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun one of skyrims major cities when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot an orcish mace in the other they were on display for nobody but me and my computercontrolled housecarl lydia who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls dragons a civil war and job assignments that never seem to go as planned its even a sensible thing to do a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim one of the most fullyrealized easily enjoyable and utterly engrossing roleplaying games ever made part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated in skyrim theres no more moonhopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill thats gone so is athletics the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major you dont assign major and minor skills at all but instead pick one of ten races each with a specific bonus high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective closerange combat these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic sneaking and weapon combat emphasizing firsthand experience over instruction manual study letting you specialize only when youre ready it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim do a quest kill a dragon snatch torchbugs from the air munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within little feels random and useless even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities making every step you take even if its through what seems like total wilderness an exciting one as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame momentarily all on the battlefield unite directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature creating impromptu moments of camaraderie  a surprising change from what may have been yet another bythenumbers bandit camp sweep dragons show up often their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles stops to attack circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv can be completed in a few minutes and always offer a useful reward killing a dragon yields a soul which powers skyrims new shout system these are magical abilities any character can use you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time throw your voice change the weather call in allies blast out ice and fire or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force even if you favor sword shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story joined with the thieves guild fought alongside the dark brotherhood or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim not only is this land under assault by dragons long thought to be dead its also ripped in two by civil war you can choose one side or the other but so much of the allure of skyrim is how even outside of the confines of quest lines the embattled state of the world is evident and steeped in a rich fictional legacy lord of the rings this is not but with the release of every elder scrolls game the fiction becomes denser and the crossreferencing for longtime fans all the more rewarding skyrims residents are all aware of current events theyll comment on the civil war some sympathizing with the rebels others thinking the establishment sold its soul the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor many characters feel like whole distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans characters stereotype based on race they doublecross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable and they react to your evolving stature within the world it makes a ridiculous realm filled with computercontrolled cat people and humanoid reptiles demon gods and dragons feel authentic like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave

a superb game with many hours of story faction and miscellaneous quests lots of locations & landmarks to find and explore from ancient dwarven cities caves outfitted by bandits to ritual sites inhabited by necromancers or simply the local wildlife with skill trees that you can shape and an array of weapons andor spells to use you can customize your character how you like single or dual weaponmagic wielding or even a combination of both further allow you to personalize the playing experience as well as providing countless setups of hostile & allied ncp alike all providing different experiences on consecutive playthroughs the dawnguard & dragonborn dlcs are a must have addition to the game adding new armor weapons & clothes to the game [even if only to make your character look even more awesome] as well as new locations & enthralling story lines the only thing i miss from the oblivion days is the ability to create my own spells but as skyrim as a nation generally dislike magic i can see why it was left out but  with the steam workshop this and anything else you just did quite like can be added changed or removed new cities more crowded cities new quests greater detailed trees or a simple as a reskin for your favourite armor its all in there somewhere but i would urge you to play through without mods at least once a must get game that i am so glad to have played and even though i have at this point i will probably spent 100s more hours playing 1010

absolutely fantastic game  if it should even be refered to as a game a masterpiece in terms of graphic design beautiful landscapes and carefully tinkered dungeons are just around the corner no matter where you are above everything else this game will take up so much of your time not because of frustrating moments but the sheer amount of gameplay thats been put into this game apart from the main questline theres hundreds of other sidequests to take part in the imersion of natrual beauty is incredible however little can be said about npc realism npcs arent very quote smart as they tend to repeat the same lines continuously and grow to be quite annoying thats just one of the few downsides about this game however next to the glitches and awkward combat system all in all very great 3d rpg to anyone who doesnt have it get it now

again your character starts off as a prisoner however they ruined the purpose of this tradition by later explaining what you were doing to get arrested the idea of being a prisoner in the earlier games was to allow the player to come up with their own backstory rather being forcefed one for your character but in skyrim they tell you that you were illegally crossing the border into skyrim just as a stormcloak squad was apprehended skyrim had a decent story but alduin as a main antagonist was lacking the depth and characteristics that previous ones like mehrunes dagon did in a land filled with dragons their best enemy for the plot was a slightly bigger dragon who could talk not very interesting if you ask me its just the fact that dragons are everywhere and then theres one that is sort of special but not by much the story and experience would have been more compelling if the characters in skyrim had any personality sure they have opinions on things like the civil war but everyone is so bland part of the problem is that everyone sounds alike there were a few unique npcs but that voice was only used for that one character such as clavicus vile but voices arent the only thing similar about the people like i said nobody has any personality the combat is very well executed the best combat in a firstperson rpg yet it has dual wielding you can have a spell and a sword and much more the thing that makes the fighting so unique is that hardly any games that ive played can pull it off like skyrim did and dual wielding is surprisingly rare in north american games so dont bring up any japanese ones not only do they tell you why your character was a prisoner but it doesnt make much sense if you play as a nord skyrim is your homeland why wouldnt you be allowed back there graphics although pointless in terms of a games value are quite polished in skyrim though i dont like the dull environment its just dark cave after dark cave identical nordic crypts and most of the land is just barren with snow and mountains i get that it is a snow province but theres no diversity in the environment as for mountains they just get in the way if you want to add mountains to a game make sure theyre easily climbable and have goodies or caves on top it would have been nice to add in a dead guy with tons of loot on him somewhere on the mountain who froze or something or at least a journal of a climber the leveling system is much better than their last elder scrolls game that makes me happy but some skills in skyrim feel tacked on or unfinished a big issue in skyrim is the enormous amount of glitches for example the legend of the red eagle quest you read about this ancient warrior bring his sword to a pedestal unlocking his burial site and then you fight him the problem is you can keep reading the book every time you complete the quest and it will start the quest all over again theres only one red eagle sword but doing it multiple times spawns multiple swords and its asking you to kill someone youve already killed like with oblivion some characters dont stay with the continuity long after the player ends the civil war for either side half of the characters in the game still talk about it as if its still happening i like all the guilds in skyrim besides companions but it feels overwhelming and contradictory if you join them all why would the listener of the dark brotherhood also be the leader of the companions or the archmage it wouldnt make too much sense thats why i dedicate one character to one guild in my games one minor thing i would like to note is the walkspeed you walk slower than everyone yet you run way faster than everyone its hard to keep pace and i dont like that i liked skyrim and i would put it above oblivion as a better game it has many things an rpg should have i rate this game a positive 6510 it doesnt get a higher rating because of lifeless characters boring and flat environment forgetting the whole reason as to why the player is always a prisoner in elder scrolls games and tons of glitches unlike oblivion i feel as though skyrim has replayability and not only would i recommend skyrim but i have started multiple characters all with their unique stories

this game is ok but it has many issues that bethesda never bothered to fix the only way to fix these issues is to use mods unfortunately steam and bethesda have talked modders into charging for these mods theyre effectively making you pay for patches and to make it worse steam bethesda keep 75% and the modder gets 25% without the mods the game is playable but can get very frustrating so because i have to rate only the game not the third party dlcmods i have no choice but to give it a thumbs down edit steam bethesda have taken down the paywall for now so you will be able to get the mods that make this game run much smoother im leaving my down vote for two reasons 1 many of the issues that the mods fix shouldve been fixed by bethesda 2 call it a reminder to bethesda that they need to treat the people who they are profiting off of with some respect

this game starts out all well and good it looks decent the soundtrack is nice and the intro quest is exciting the first time after about 4 hours i started to really notice how shallow it was though every quest seemed to involve going into a cave to kill banditszombies and retrieve item x to give to person y you can be good at everything in the world with one character from the worlds deadliest assassin to the leader of a group of werewolf warriors to the archmage of a college of magic the combat never strays far from clicking rapidly until your health runs low downing a few potions repeat harder difficulties only make combat take longer it doesnt actually make it harderthat being said there is quite an extensive mod community and everything thats wrong with the game has been fixed and everything you could ever imagine can be added to your game tldr is it fun yes with mods

5th instalment in the elder scrolls series in which like previous instalments you will lose a lot of time playing itbecause there is so much to do and explore and with all these free mods cough you can even extend that playtime or just refresh the replay value on your secondthirdfourth playtrough ofcourse people are still sour from that fiasco with paid mods but that shouldnt be the reason to downvote the game since the game itself was unaffected but you cant stop the coal train that easy when it picks up the speed il keep this short because if you want more detailed review there is bound to be a bible lenght by somebody out there like any bethesdaobsidian open world game you will sink in so much time that for the price is not only worth it but highly recomended skyrimwithnoguns10

skyrim a land of where you can do anything i love skyrim for its ability to turn hours into minutes yes loading screens are everywhere it seems but when you are exploring the terrain with clear blue skies and lydia carrying all of your  life is good access to the console makes some things easier or much harder depending on what you are doing countless hours spent looting dungeons helping with the civil war and even stealing everything in a shop by putting a cauldron over the npcs head can be found within this game the workshop and skyrim nexus have loads of things to help or hinder the young dovahkiin in their journey but overall you can find just about anything you want the graphics even on low are amazing and each little story seems to be rich and full even though it is just as simple as delivering something i recommend this game for that its stunning beauty plus the amount of quests and such that is within it is worth it just the base game alone is amazing but getting the legendary edition is the way to go yes the occasionally silly bug of a dragon skeleton dancing or your follower getting stuck in a river for all of eternity happens but overall the game is extremely enjoyable the constant conflict or sweet escape you can find within skyrim is only a few of the things slaying dragons learning magic eating 1000 cheese wheels and killing heimskr and nazeem are always a pleasure within skyrim and it never seems to get old overall rating 910 the graphics arent potato quality zor nau dovahkiins

its a frozen nation just to the north of where the previous game oblivion took place a pleasantly brief introduction sets up the plot skyrim is in the middle of a revolt youve been sentenced to death and dragons have just shown up good luck at that point you emerge from a cave into 40 square kilometres of cold and mountainous country and thats it everything else is up to you even after spending hundreds of hours in morrowind and oblivion the sense of freedom in skyrim is dizzying the vast mountains in every direction make the landscape seem limitless and even after exploring it for 55 hours this world feels huge and unknown on a scale neither of the previous two games did not all of the landscape is subzero and even among the frosty climes theres an exciting variety ice caverns that tinkle with dripping frost crystals hulking mountains with curls of snow whipped up by the howling wind coniferous forests in rocky river valleys the mountains change everything wherever you decide to head your journey is split between scrambling up treacherous rocks and skidding down heartstopping slopes the landscape is a challenge and travel becomes a game its hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave a lonely shack some strange stones a wandering traveller a haunted fort these were sparse and quickly repetitive in oblivion but theyre neither in skyrim its teeming with fascinating places all distinct it was 40 hours before i blundered into a dungeon that looked like one id seen before and even then what i was doing there was drastically different these places are the meat of skyrim and theyre what makes it feel exciting to explore you creep through them with your heart in your mouth your only soundtrack the dull groan of the wind outside to discover old legends dead heroes weird artefacts dark gods forgotten depths underground waterfalls lost ships hideous insects and vicious traps its the best indiana jones game ever made the dragons dont show up until you do the first few steps of the games main quest so its up to you whether you want them terrorising the world as you wander around a world where you can crest a mountain to find a 40foot flying lizard spitting jets of ice at the village below is a much more interesting one to be in but fighting them never changes much you can just ignore them until they land then shoot them from a distance when they do your first dragon kill is a profound weird moment i rushed to the crashed carcass to loot it then looked up the whole town had come out to stand around and stare at the body a thing as vast and alien to them as a trex in a museum i tried shooting an ice bolt at it just to demonstrate it was dead and the force unexpectedly catapulted the whole thing violently into the distance a beggar looked at me and said oh sure just throw your trash around your character gets better at whatever you do firing a bow sneaking up on people casting healing spells mixing potions swinging an axe theres always been an element of this practicebased system in elder scrolls games but in skyrim its unrestricted  you dont have to decide what youre going to focus on when you create your character you can just let it develop organically that alone would feel a little too handsoff but you also level up when that happens you get a perk point something you can spend on a powerful improvement to a skill you particularly like every hour youre making a major decision about your characters abilities theyre dramatic the first point you put into destruction magic lets you stream jets of flame from your hands for twice as long as before as you continue to invest in one skill you can get more interesting tweaks i now have an archery perk that slows down time when i aim my bow and one for the sneak skill that lets me do a stealthy forward roll again the freedom is dizzying every one of 18 skills has a tree of around 15 perks and the range of heroes you could build is vast i focused on sneak to the point of absurdity  now im almost invisible and i get a 3000% damage bonus for backstabs with daggers its the play style ive always wanted in an rpg but ive never been able to achieve it before the enemies you encounter are in some cases generated by the game to match the level of your character in oblivion that sometimes felt like treading water progress was just a stat increase and your enemies kept pace that doesnt apply now that your character is defined more by his or her perks because the way you play is always changing levelled content is also just used less at level 30 my most common enemies are still bandits with lowlevel weapons and i still run into things too dangerous for me to tackle taking a narrow mountain path to a quest something stops me in my tracks a dragon roar i check the skies  nothing but i hear it again three more times before the peak at the top i find a camp full of bodies with a large black bear roaring over them hah hes still more than i can handle in straight combat but as he reaches me i use a dragon shout it befriends any animal instantly and he saunters casually away feeling slightly guilty i stab him in the back before it wears off which is when the dragon lands with an almighty crash six feet from my face a roar of frozen air catches me in the back but i keep going  over a ridge down a short drop and straight into a bandit i dodge the bandit straight into a flame atronarch there are five more bandits behind it the dragon is airborne i throw myself off the mountain several hundred metres into the river below i plummet to the riverbed and swim until i run out of breath when i surface the sky is alight with fireballs and flaming arrows the dragon is spewing a stream of ice down on the bandits and im laughing the stealthy character i built in skyrim would have been less fun in oblivion whether you were detected was a binary and erratic matter skyrim cleverly gives you an onscreen indication of how suspicious your enemies are and where they are as they hunt for you it makes stealth viable even against large groups if youre rumbled you can retreat and hide and theres a slow methodical pace to it  long minutes of tension broken by sudden rushes of gratification or panic magic meanwhile has been given an incredible crackle of raw power emperor palpatine would be a level one mage in skyrim  unleashing two torrents of thrashing electrical arcs is literally the first trick you learn and it doesnt even get you tossed into a reactor shaft one tweak is a huge loss though you cant design your own spells oblivions spellmaking opened up so many clever possibilities  now youre mostly restricted to what you can buy in shops while were on the negatives physical combat hasnt improved much there are cinematic kill moves when your enemy is low on health but whether they trigger seems to be either random or dependent on whether the precanned animation fits into the space youre in too much of the time you wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to the hits the exception is archery bows are now deliciously powerful

oh there once was a hero named ragnar the red who came riding to whiterun from ole rorikstead and the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade as he told of bold battles and gold he had made but then he went quiet did ragnar the red when he met the shieldmaiden matilda who said oh you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead now i think its high time that you lie down and bleed and so then came clashing and slashing of steel as the brave lass matilda charged in full of zeal and the braggart named ragnar was boastful no more when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor

this game is the reason modders live on its own straight out of the box  its a good game and worth buying play it through in its vanilla state to completion then go get some mods and start again  brand new friggin game the possibilities for replay are endless mostly in thanks to the modders but bethesda has not been shy in handing them the tools so they deserve some credit too i seriously cant wait to see what they put out next but i am just going to keep playing skyrim until they do

few games can compare in terms of content to skyrim this has been true since the first elder scrolls games which were also regarded as highly ambitious for their time dropping players into huge open worlds to explore with no shortage of quests to undertake and treasure to find the world changes around you depending on your actions npcs can die and never come back and a lot of dialog choices have drastic consequences the game is played mostly in 1stperson but can be switched to 3rdperson camera if you want depending on your preference singlehanded weapons allow you to use the rightmouse button to hold up a shield but there are also twohanded weapons as well as bows and crossbows various materials and enchantments with different effects mean a huge amount of customization can be done with your equipment the graphics are gorgeous very few locations look the same and it is a visual treat for the eyes with a massive variety of environments to explore the attention to detail is just mindblowing considering just how big the world is its matched by an equally epic soundtrack although i found that there wasnt enough diversity in the music and started to get tired of hearing some particular tracks multiple times unfortunately the game is crawling with bugs and i dont just mean giant spiders quest lines frequently get stuck assets will warp and spazz out all over the place the physics engine sometimes gives up and throws furniture everywhere some of these can actually prevent quests from being completed at all i recommend it anyway though because there just isnt anything out there quite like the elder scrolls games bugs aside it has enough unique content to keep you busy for a long time more than enough to justify the price tag of the legendary edition

you just need this game never really played an rpg before but damn this game is cool 2010

ok its time to finally review this masterpiece now that im 400 hours into my first playthrough that is skyrim has a lot of good things going for it ill list my top 3 1 the explorationexploration has always been toptier for me in elder scrolls games here skyrim like the other es games ive played does not disappoint the world is ginormous tons of places to go quite varied topography and regions graphics of course are gorgeous despite the occasional clipping error very forgivable 2 the perksskyrim is the first es game with a dedicated perk tree and if youre familiar with perks in other games skyrims tree is similarthe perks are great many to which i said oh nice they are gonna let me do that perks give a player a good reason to continually level up to get that next perk point they needjust onemore 3 the writingwhile nothing stands up to bioware writing in my book skyrim has excellent rpg writing and quests continuing the strong standards set in the previous games while im not a fan of the main story in any es game ive played so far skyrim and the others make up for that by giving a plethora of wellrounded written quests with a very respectable main questline this time better than morrowind & oblivions what i love most about skyrims writing though is the centuriesdeep backstory and history of what has happened in the host country of tamriel since oblivion it is rich and detailed and some of the ingame books you can read are not to be missed some will just crack you up there is a lot more to say about this game but in general you will enjoy it if you like exploration dungeoncrawling or racking up phat lewtz which tends to happen a lot add customizable houses if you get hearthfire or legendary edition a finally good magic system dualwielding weapons or spells a first to the series the entire mod spectrum for pc players pretty decent allied ai and nearly infinite leveling with legendary skyrim will have you playing almost foreveror till you drop dead or quit going to work either quite likely imo skyrim is a relationship breaker im sorry it just is learn to deal with it the clincher those of you looking for a nice long rpg to sink time into i spent my first 200 hours simply exploring the world doing some side quests but mainly just following riverbanks or roads clearing everything along the way didnt even down my first dragon until 225 or so and even then id only uncovered half the map add in the 2 big expansion packs and you will be set for a long while and thats just the official nonmod content wait for a sale to buy legendary edition it is so worth it

much better than elder scrolls online bestheda have screwed up with that but you can still playthrough skyrim over and over again the game is getting old but i highly recommend installing mods from the steam workshop they make the experience even more fun
recommended
if you like rpg firstthird person games and most of all free roam than skyrim is a game for you sure the story isnt as well developed as oblivion was but the number of mods and the detail in side quests makes this game get an a in my books sure the graphics arent as good as the crysis series but after all the game was made in 2007 one more thing the game tends to have many bugs
recommended
magnificent game pros  endless possibilities of creating your own unique character  enormous and addictive world to explore  great story  interesting side quests  soundtrack  nice graphics cons  bugs  might be too overwhelming at the beginning
recommended
once you played you cant stop
recommended
this game is absolutely worth whatever money you are paying for during your time here you will be sent to time where swords and bows were powerful and magic reigned the main story line is long enough yourself but once its finished there are more than 100 side quests for you to complete keeping you busy for quite a while all in all this game is worth buying it will keep you busy for a while and is just generally fun to play
recommended
love this game to bits and on pc it is even better with mods and such
recommended
this is by far the deepest rpg i have ever played no this is not the type of game eliest like cause they want just combat to be only thing that matters this game has nice combat for a rpg best i played other then dark souls dark souls are for those who just want the rpg combat this game delievers everything else and more the biggest fantysy map i have ever explored the dlc is a ton of fun then once you play all that there is a large mod community for this game you can make food and armor weapons and other items this game can be played in so many ways there is no wonder it is the most sought after game on the rpg market get this and play this game you will not regret it

best rpg game u should play it
recommended
my first impressionsbrilliant the character models are a big improvement on oblivion the environments look even more amazing and things like bump mapping add even more realism to the game ive only just started playing the game so this is just a taster i wanted to say get this game if you like rpg fantasy or open world games its probably going to be the game of the year ahead of games like sonic generations red faction armageddon crysis 2 battlefield 3 shogun 2 call of duty black ops and modern warfare 3 to name just a few releases this year i like the lock picking process compared to oblivions method they have used the coding from fallout and re skinned it im not sure about the new inventory system yet and i do miss the ability to customise the character i choose to play apparently kotaku found that for every call of duty mw3 player there was 10 skyrim players on its first day of release another innovation with this new elder scro

recommended
overall great fun if you like exploring roaming and looting this is definately the game for you skyrim is a huge place where youll find mostly scandinavianlike countryside but still a huge variety of ambience and style i did not really play this for the story it is kinda interesting but not too deep and pretty short the main part of the game at least for me is roaming sidequests and exploring there are quite some generic miscquests which will send you into a dungeon you then finish and return the quest this might get boring after a while however it is very exciting for a lot of dungeons the dwemer ruins especially are awesome but still if you find yourself stuck with boring quests there is the steamworkshop loaded with free mods andor custom made questlines potential for hundreds of hours of gameplay
recommended
this game is the very definition of sex
recommended
skyrim oh my where to start helgan would be a great place to start seeming thats the first town you see in the game and my oh my its one of many and i mean many skyrim is a fantastic open world free roam game in which you create a character to help you complete the hundred maybe even thousands of main story and side quests in skyrim you play however you want to play as be it a mage archer warrior even a human cat you can go where you want when you want with use of skyrims fast travel but if you really want how about you just get there on foot meet some people on the way maybe you meet someone who needs help maybe you meet someone who is out to kill you its all possible in skyrim skyrim is one of my all time favourite games when im bored i play skyrim because even though i have played it for 100 hours im always finding new places new people new missions and more also skyrim has the steam workshop and the nexus mod community behind its back so if you do get bored with vanilla skyrim there are thousands of downloadable quests and mods to keep you entertained for hours on end final rating of tesskyrim  9810
recommended
skyrim it seems is a game that people buy expecting it to be the best or the worst game ever when they plunge in most people think its very good with its beautiful world a story thats pretty good in my opinion and nice atmospheric music after you plug in several buttloads of hours though it starts to lose its appeal and gets repetitive the game mechanics are all very nice although the combat usually ends up just mindlessly hackingspurting magic at your enemies playing as a sneaky thief however might help make it more interesting with bows and whatnot the story might seem kind of ehhh but really i just like the lore all things considered skyrim is definitely a worthwhile game
recommended
skyrim is one of the greatest games ive ever played and with a handful of mods it is probably the single greatest game in my modest steam library for me its all about immersion the land of skyrim is richly atmospheric as many games are but it is also organic from the most mundane cellars to the windswept mountaintops and everything that lies between the land of skyrim was painstakingly crafted with equal parts skill and love to be a living and breathing place find a tavern and take a seat and the little village lives on without you youll find yourself even on second or third characters discovering new conversations and overhearing new dialogue youll stumble into new random events and forge brand new paths to the same old objectives the very landscape even takes on new angles as your characters develop into different people with different direction loyalties and perspectives i have never actually completed the main storyline of skyrim this is due not only various glitches that make missions unable to accomplish most of these caused by conflicting mods not the game in its original state but also because only very rarely are you ever pressed to follow the structured storylines or sidequests from the beginning you can choose to join the nords or the imperials and see where each path takes you you can join a number of guilds but neutrality or even hostility towards these parties is completely possible and maybe even preferable after a few playthroughs skyrim is made even better through a number of mods enbs and texture enhancements bug fixes user created quests companions armor and weapons and even entire islands to explore  there are literally thousands of mods available and in a very brief time one can accumulate hundreds and consider many of them to be absolutely must have many mods exist to cater to whatever your thing or niche might be as a history and anthropology student i thought itd be cool if the imperials didnt just emulate soldiers of the roman empire but actually looked like them i was part of the historical revival team as an artist and historical consultant  our mod which also includes some celtic and eastern equipment and weaponry received over a thousand endorsements from the nexus community before we abandoned the project during holiday sales skyrim is hitting the $10 mark or possibly even lower for the layers upon layers of entertainment this game offers it is almost criminal to not own this game
recommended
i love this game if u havent play it u are in wrong time its awesome both with mods and not with mods

probably the best openworld rpg out there definitely one of my alltime favourite games the replayability is superb and the modding community is highly active which makes it easy to play the game the way you want to play it for me the modding experience has been the greatest aspect of the game you can easily make the game graphics look like up to date games as long as you have a decent graphics card the atmosphere in the game and the way the game feels alive is something that will keep amaze you throughout the game it really feels like a living world even though you will stumble upon bad or awkward npc movements and behaviour but mods can help fix this the music and voice acting is as good as it can get if you like rpgs there are no reasons why you shouldnt own this game already 1010

in the past i would have easily recommended this game due to the games bugs and short comings being made up for by mods  however now with the introduction of paid mods i will judge the game by itself pros open world hours of quests reasonably interesting storylines fully voiced with the exception of your character cons there are a lot of quest breaking bugs in the game that can occur for several reasons repetitive combat repetitive enemies be prepared to fight about 10000 draugr limited spells spell casting system ruins immersure eg using healing magic means opening the menu equiping the spell to 1 of ur 2 hands using the spell then reopening the menu then reequiping ur old spell sword shield etc painfully obvious console port menu and interface designed for console very different from oblivion solutions to quests are more often than not to kill something or a bunch of somethings then bring something back fighting dragons is fun at first but quickly gets tedious oh look another dragon but this one shouts at you in a different colour and takes an additional 14 sword swings to kill

god this game is like a sponge for badness it took all the horrible features from a great game like call of duty black ops put it in this game  on it and boom you made the game idk what bathsalts was thinking when they made this horrible abomination but it sure is horrible the story makes no sense you play as an abroted dog that was brought back to life to go back in time and assassinate george washington in order to free the slaves with your set of toothpicks that are expensive as hell and breakatleast not until youve spent all your skill points on toothpicking when you try to open a locked bathroom door i gave it a 1010 because im a ing idiot
recommended
well to start all the elder scroll games are really just horrible to watch unless you have already played them and can understand them while watching and despite the fact that the game doesnt look very action packed once you get into you are in great battles were you need to use tactics and smarts along with some skill to beat them in the start yes all it is is run here hit him 2 times and bam he is dead but as you reach lets say lvl 10 maybe a half and hour of running around caves not even you end up having to use tactics not on your right trigger or mouse along with the amazing combat there are 1000s of quests which all have there own detailed back story and there are also 4 guilds 3 branches and 1 main line which each have there own detailed rich and emotional back story that is as i describe it like a book where every mission is like a cliff hanger and once you finally find a break point its 7 hours later and you just did like 20 quests then the treasures the goal to become rich beyond everyone sucks you in where you need to steal from everyone to increase your coin purse by only 500 gold sucks you in till the point where you end up murdering a whole city for there stuff plus there is a huge world covered in towns and mining camps and caves that you can explore when ever you would like to filled with magical treasures and plot twists and finally every player can create a character that they see them selves as training skills and grinding levelswhich is the only game i have enjoyed grinding levels on s you personalize your character to be the amazing hero you wish you could be

to begin with this one of the best if not even the very best game ive ever played graphics are gorgeous and breath taking game is based on open world system which is done perfectly thus there is option to fast travel it is actually very entertaining to travel on foot hence the landscapes are vivid and inimitable the land is actually full of believable and well made locations there is no feeling of boredness like in most of open world rpgs the whole game world is just so intense it lives on its own every npc does its daily basis and have a story to tell the main plot isnt maybe so gripping as in the plot based game however except the simple side quests the game consists few extensive and separate side story lines and those are usually better than the main quest line more over the game can take a lot of various mods which can improve or revamp any aspect of the game especially the enb mod is a must have if you are into visuals despite that game is almost the perfect in all aforementioned terms it has a few flaws firstly the leveling system although it works well up to about 30 lvl after that some enemies are just prevented from leveling thus fighting with them is becoming boring and the loot in this case is useless secondly combat styles are unbalanced for example magic is weak at the beginning then it gets overpowered and then again it becomes weaker than everything else because it cannot be improved after some point unlike the conventional combat methods which in theory can be upgraded to infinity another minor disadvantage is the ai enemies are truly dumb if it comes to sneaking they can take an arrow in the knee and after 15 seconds they say something like oh it must have been wind and of course like in every gigantic project it has to contain some bugs most of them have been fixed and there is no major bugs with completing the game like in fallout but sometimes some quest item gets stuck in inventory after finishing the quest and just clutters it but like i mentioned before game is extremely moddable so most of bugs can be prevented with mods and unbalanced combat system can be overhauled and if we consider that skyrim is so extensive game we can overlook those minor flaws and enjoy one of the greatest if not the very greatest game on this generation visuals visuals with enb believable world decent and vast dlcs incredibly moddable physics audio storyline well optimized performance in vanilla game  modding is not easy as it seems and it is time consuming however its worth it  ai  a couple of minor bugs  unbalanced combat system in vanilla game
recommended
a game that enables you to play as either gender and personalise your character to the last detail is always going to gain my interest a game where you can ride horses use magic and beat the  out of dragons is definitely going to gain my interest a game that isnt linear is packed with fantasy and lets you wear badass armour and make or find formidable weaponry is yeah you get the point skyrim is just so full of everything that you couldnt play it the same way twice right from the beginning you can choose the type of person you are going to be a sneaky thief a wizard a hero an assassin an annoying git you can follow whichever path you feel like and change it daily if you want to you can build houses and adopt children you can punch random people in the head you can start bar fights you can murder innocents you can adopt stray doggies you can marry in a same sex marriage well played for beating the uk at this you can save villages you can wreak havoc in villages you can make enemies of an entire race of people you can assassinate kings or make them kiss your butt i could go on even if you dislike the concept of magic and prefer the down and dirty physical combat like i do the game does not disappoint the storyline retains its relevance throughout and keeps you absorbed and i havent even mentioned the incredible contrasting scenery yet highly highly recommended i didnt even like rpgs before i played skyrim and now i am searching in vain for a game to live up to it

its frankly a low quality game one unsupported entirely by its publishers and entirely reliant on its community for both patching and additional content in this day and age people should expect this from bethesda who have a history of lying about the origins of their game engines failing to innovate and making grandiose promises in the style of molyneux about procedural content that ends up being lackluster while replacing handwritten things of much higher quality in previous games of course all this would normally be quite forgiveable because of how truly excellent their community is  unfortunately i must now no longer credit them for that community because bethesda has shown a callous disregard for that communitys wellbeing and has decided that instead of supporting said community theyd much rather make a profit off it so no  do not buy this game do not ever buy any bethesda game they arent worth it anymore

great game amazing game with the best quality you can get for a fantasy rpg this game has been around for a long time the dlc are a okay but i would like to see them actually added to the game the game has so much content and each character npc has a whole backstory it mustve taken a long time to make and that is why they shouldnt have added a paid workshop paid workshop  you support for the user made items what is the point of that to encourage the workshop the whole point of the workshop is to enjoy the free content that is given it is basically adding tons of dlc to the game i personally would not want 1000 dlc in a great game i know this feature is probably never going to be removed but rather than encouraging people to list workshop items it is discouraging the use of the workshop now the free items are all going to be absolute horrible and the paid items are going to be maybe $1 per workshop item these items get you aesthetic armor fancy looking weapons and improvements i feel like the only thing that would actually fit in to the base game and not stnad out like crazy is the improvements graphic changes are nice and i like the effort to make them but i dont like the corruption that will spread through buying these if people want to make a living off of making content then join a company if you want to have people enjoy the items of the workshop then do it but dont make someone have to pay for someones works on a game that isnt theirs it will be awful the content may be decent and couldve taken some time but i and most others would not want to pay $50 per one useless armor set this useless armor set on the other hand would be really cool if i browsed the free workshop and said oh look this looks pretty cool let me try it out i might like it and i might keep it most everyone uses mods for skyrim skyrim is so much based on mods and that is why everyone loves it do you really think people are going to like it for dlc no that isnt why the workshop was created the workshops purpose is diminishing yes poeple can make their own works but now it isnt open to everyone only people who are willing to act as if it is worth it games update for free with much more content than a simple workshop item the most i would do to help these people is add a donation button but please do not make what everyone loves into a worthless dlc marathon for cheap aesthetic moneywasters i love what steam is doing to show they care for these people making the listings in the workshop but this was a bad idea and needs to be approached differently  contra

game 910 mod support 110 bad review due to the current mod market implementation and subject to change if the market does good modders deserve to get paid i will not doubt that but the system in place now is terrible a full on paywall is a terrible way to do things with the nature of mods and how easily they break corrupt and sometimes do not work with other mods all this is is going to do is cause problems with the modding community before if there was a problem it was no big deal it was free just uninstall and move on now that some of these will be paid for there will be many angry people when things do not work or take to long to be updated after a gamebreaking patch aside from that the modders get nothing from this deal but pocket change as it currently is set up 75% goes to bethesda and valve while only 25% goes to the modder this is a bad deal made worse by the fact that valve only pays you after $10000 in sales earned one would have to sell 400 copys of something at $100 to even get paid at all not only is that crappy but it will inflate prices so modders can cover the loss and hopefully get paid sooner instead of a year later when that money cap is hit also why does bethesda get any of the money they deserve none of it at all now before some of you get up in arms saying it is bethesdas game they have rights to it and so on think for a moment you bought the game you own it not bethesda it is paid for in this current logic if we applied it to a car you take your car in to get some window tint and rims a car modification of sorts then the money you paid to have it done is split 25% to the mechanic who did all the work and 75% split between the place those parts were stored and the cars manufacturer the deal should only be between the mechanic storage and the customer no why does the manufacturer get a cut here they did nothing but build the car you paid for already so yes this system is stupid set up donation tabs for the modders if not cut bethesda out and give the modders the lions share of the profit they did the work here

up until today skyrim and the rest of the elder scrolls series were a shining example of how the modding community can turn a great game into the best game unfortunately both valve and bethesda have chosen to destroy this community by profiting unfairly from the work of others i do believe that those who enjoy the many mods made by passionate volunteer developers should be able to support those developers financially through donation pages or systems like patreon however what valve and bethesda are doing is taking most of this support for themselves and hiding mods behind a paywall what they are doing is destroying the modding community which has existed for many years for their own gain until the option to charge for mods is removed and i doubt it will be not only will i be boycotting all bethesda games but i will no longer be using steam for any purchases whatsoever

this once great game and community have been torn apart thanks to bethesda with the help of valve thanks to the monetization of mods members of this amazing community now look at each with hatred as they come after each other for mod stealing unethical use of mods etc etc this community was a once gigantic symbiotic web that fed off of each other in the best of ways modders would help other modders and give them resources to use including myself but now that is all gone and some of the big modders are leaving the modding scene and taking all of their tools with them modding was one of the major things that seperated us from console gaming and let us tailor the games to our own needs and now we can no longer do that i used to love this game but sadly until this changes and bethvalve put in a donate button instead i will no longer be playing or getting mods off the workshop if i do i will go else where whether it be independently hosted mods or the much better skyrim nexus the future is looking dark and i am truly afraid to see what happens with falloutmy favorite game series great job destroying the community bethesdavalve d

i constantly come back to skyrim whenever i see new mods available on the nexus or on the steam workshop i definitely would not have logged the amount of hours that i have were it not for the free availability of mods now however valvebethesda have decided to start charging for mods this is content that people have made off their own back yet valvebethesda are taking 75% of the cut there is absolutely no need for paid mods as they are what makes skyrim so replayable yet valvebethesda saw another oppertunity to grab your money and they are taking it i encourage everybody who wants the free availability of mods back to leave a review as i have to show your discontent with the situation for a mod creator to even make a feasible amount of money they have to charge at ridiculous rates which means that nobody will be downloading their content i feel that the community would be a much better off place without the charge of mods and therefore will not be playing this game until paying for mods has been removed
not recommended
giving this game a negative review because i am not willing to support valve and bethesdas new way to handle modding this is a road that only leads into the deepest pits of exploiting your customers those of us who can afford it should support mod creators it is thanks to them that a game thatd normally deliver about 100 hours of playtime can be played for 600 hours and still be something new with every new playthrough but it is not up to us to turn a modder into a millionair we should be thankful that bethesda has given them the tools to make such great mods but it is not worth 75% of what the mod creators have deserved

steam took 75% of my review only leaving 25% for you to read skyrim was released as a broken game  hardly playable  until modders released an unofficial patch due to bethesdas laziness to patch it themselves now valve got together with bethesda to charge for mods thus efficiently pitting the gaming community against one and other overnight no less this is what happens when something becomes mainstream greedy corporations come to to nickle and dime you for every cent you have theyll suck you dry and not in a good way first dlcs then ondisk dlcs then already finished content hidden behind a pay wall to finally being charged to buy a mod well ill say this ill be playing those mods but i wont be paying for them know what im saying hint hint in conclusion  valve they first tried getting rid of the game hatred because it was too controversial and now they are pitting the gaming community against each other by charging for mods by the way valve and the game developers are taking 75% of the profit from said mods and only giving 25% to the mod creators heres hoping for a gaming crash in the near future the gaming community needs it get rid of all the greedy corporate rats and bring us back to great gaming as it was in the 90s and early 00s

it saddens me that bethesda and steam try to milk one of the greatest game i have ever played i expected this move from a company like ea i hope that all the negative reviews lead to a rethinking adding a donate button to the mods would just have done it but i guess steam doesnt make any money with that which seems to be the major motivation
not recommended
payin for user created is disgusting i understand if there is a donation but putting monitary value on a mod that could be use other modders asset and putting them together and selling them for profit its basically stealing and a lie i refues to pay for mods that have a potincal of ripping the original creator of there work just like nick simmons riping of bleach and artists on deviantart mods are user created content not dlc bt i love the game but i just cant support this buisness model the fact that its too easy to steal others work and you loose your money to steam isnt good mods at times dont work with other mods and you have to remove one of them and our out of $025 to out ragest amount better off just drive down the street and throw your money out the window also this is a lazy attempt of developers not wanting to make cotent for there games
not recommended
mods should not be behind a paywall this moves stifles creativity in the community and opens up the floodgates for developers to release incomplete content with the intention of the users fixing it modding is a hobby not a profession for those mod creators who feel they are entitled to payment go find a job in gaming or move out of modding all together if you no longer have any love of the game its a shame because skyrim is quite fun

skyrim is a buggy ocean with the depth of a puddle in order to fix the bugs make the game look pretty and generally make gameplay not mediocre you must download mods its often said that bethesda has always relied on the modding community to fix and polish their game for them in short the mods are really what make this game here are some fun facts about paid mods  45% of the cost of mods goes to bethesda  30% goes to valve  25% goes to the mod creator  the mod creator will only recieve their cut after theyve made 100 dollars so if i priced a mod at $1 it would need to make 400 sales before i even saw any money  if they do not reach 100 dollars within three months of releasing the mod they will recieve no money ever  the mod becomes ip of bethesda immediately upon posting it up in the shop leaving the mod creator no rights some other food for thought  after 24 hours if for whatever reason the mod ceases to function you have no recourse  currently its very easy to cheat the system by downloading mods off of nexus and selling them as your own content im not against mod makers making money i think it could inspire some ambitious projects and actually be helpful for years the modding community has made bethesda games what they are now as recompense bethesda and valve try to stiff them seeing such underhanded parasitic behaviour disguised as a favor leaves a rather foul taste in my mouth i must say

due to the push for mods being paid for i will simply talk about vanilla skyrim the menus are poorly layed out it seems that they were designed for consoles and the pc version was an afterthought the civil war quest seems to be left unfinished due to the fact that the hero only takes over a two holds in the game as well as many other parts which should have been added in the game the same can go for the college of winterhold quest as that just seems like several different ideas smashed together essentially this game is pretty mediocre without mods to fix the problems made by not following through on something
not recommended
now that the mods have to be bought the game pretty much lost all of it appeal because without them the only thing this game is is a walking simulator

i love tes skyrim this game has truly been one of the most fun games i have ever played in my life the storyline was epic you feel ike a total badass shouting and slaying monsters all the way to the end whatever it is you want to do go do it the game doesnt care and if it does care then mod the  out of the game and go do it anyways the biggest reason to love this game as much as i do is for the ability to modify the game and keep adding hours of content to play through done with the main storyline why not add a new continent to explore spells lacking pick up this mod and you have a bajillion rough estimate more spells to use and its free   wait hold up   youre telling me its not free anymore what the hell you mean steam stepped in and tore apart an already thriving community by adding a paywall to the very mods that kept it alive with no means of regulating the crappy mods from the good mods youre saying that this is only going to get worse as time goes on what the hell steam well way to screw this game over just one more thing to charge us on right couldnt get enough from early access preorder multiple dlc and any other means of screwing over the customer base you can think of right how the hell could bethesda even condone this the game barely runs on its own its because of mods the game has been bugfixed to a stable version since bethesda cant seem to error test their own games why the hell would you charge people to get access to the content that actually incentivize gamers to buy this well in the end money talks and right now steam is hearing money say that if they charge people for these mods theyll make a  more money however as im sure everyone who reads this is aware there is a great place to get mods for tes skyrim without having to open your wallet although the skyrim nexus [ httpwwwnexusmodscomskyrim ] has nothing against those who want to sell their mods they also have a strong community more than willing to offer these mods for free stop on by and give them a look over and move on from this nightmare steam has created youll still get to enjoy hours upon hours in skyrim without having to cushion gabe newells greedy  more than it already is and if it only gets worse from here then  this  i have over 500 hours on this game i got my lulz rip skyrim

gread game ruined by the platform its sold on putting mods behind a paywall is completely unacceptable especially with the rampant theft of mods being uploaded by people other than their creators adding a donate button instead would be a much better option for verified creators of mods which would give an incentive for mod makers to work hard on making great mods and to keep them updated i would gladly donate $500 to a modder making something truly great

this game is 5 years old and they want us to pay for community created mods that have also been around for years im never playing this game again and honestly without mods this game isnt worth buying today

the modding community has been around for ages i first got into it with morrowind and the community had been great ever since the collective of us worked towards a common goal to produce better mods and to push the skyrim engine to its limits and beyond talented 3d model makers texture makers quest designers story tellers programmers and more came together to collectively share their work free of charge i even had someone compose a song for a mod of mine at one point paid mods shifts the focus to community driven to money driven now lets talk about it a little bit modders who put literally thousands of hours into their work for free probably deserve compensation for their work but they didnt start with that in mind skyui comes to mind the developer has decided to sell it on the workshop im more or less ok with that due to the sheer amount of time and work put into it however now we are seeing  sword models for sale why would i pay for a sword that i could go into cinema 4d and design myself in a half hour or so its stupid until this system is changed i cannot recommend this game damn it bethesda valvebethesda are taking 75% of the profits for the work of modders that is absurd

what really made this game great was mods after nearly 4 years and an expansive mod community skyrim was really great in the terms of value you saw added to this game and its really what kept this game relevant this long while i understand and agree that some modders may want to cash in on their work the current implementation of this is poorly done the fact that its been so poorly curated were already seeing junk mods for $9999 being added is fracturing the community modders are seeing their work ripped off and sold without their knowledge and some mods require other mods to work when mods like skyui go up behind paywalls it already is becoming premium only its breaking several other mods which rely on skyui as a backbone its turning modders against modders and modders against gamers and to top that all off the modders who are putting out paid mods are making valve and bethesda rich for their own hard work the current mess that the state of this game is in makes it not worth my recommendation if the current paid mods fiasco was implemented in a way that makes any sense i might reverse my rating

the mod community has been a thriving section of gaming which has kept not only skyrim but every elder scrolls game since morrowind alive with the introduction of paying for mods i no longer support a positive outlook towards valve bethesda the elder scrolls or skyrim hopefully the substantial amount of negative reviews gets the point across
not recommended
its no coincidence the game dropped to 75% off the same week they launched the pay4mods scheme this negative review was mostly prompted by valves new pay4mods policy and ill tell you why first the sheer number of enhancement mods available on the marketplace goes to prove that bethesda didnt put in the time or effort to make the graphics in this game as good as they could have been everything from water to landscaping is severly lacking as there are mods which drastically improve it all but none that do it all in a single mod by having to now pay for these mods were basically paying a 3rd party to make improvements to a game improvements that should have been done by the developers either before launch or through patching its quite frankly a pay4patches scheme when you think about it second youll find the world a bit sparse and lacking in quest structure again this is proven by the sheer number of mods which add locations and mission content to the game the main storyline of the game itself is fairly short if you skip the sidemissions and the sidemissions youll find usually just have to do with you being recruited into a guild of some kind imagination was really lacking here you would think some guilds would want you to devote yourself to them but nope by the end of your trip through the main story youll end up being a high ranking member of every guild imaginable asuming you do the sidequests at all this affects the games realism quality which of course can be repaired by adding a paid mod or 50 third and probably the most important thing is the lack of actual equipment content this is a huge downfall by bethesda as shown by the absolutely insane amount of armor and weapon mods available for purchase on the marketplace without mods youll find yourself wandering a world where it seems every enemy is carrying virtually the same weaponry that said everything from wooden armor to the elder scrolls famous daedric armor is available for a price in the marketplace in addition there is a plethera of nonelder scrolls related equipment also available through mods what really hurts though is how much of the equipment mods are actually content that exists in the skyrim realm equipment which bethesda didnt include in the game and is now hidden behind a pay wall all in all i have to give a big no to recommending skyrim it was a great game in its day no doubt there but today all of the mod content youll have to pay for to bring this game up to date just isnt worth the price tag youll have to pay just to give you an example to make my game very enjoyable ive had to install a total of 67 mods although from what i hear thats an extremely low number on average without those mods i might as well skip buying this game on steam and get it on a console after this many years i can probably pick up the 360 version in a pawn shop for a couple bucks there really is no reason to buy the pc version anymore expecially through steam the pay4mod scheme has ruined the pc experience of this game as much as the pay2win scheme ruined online games while the free modding community thrived the pc version was well worth the $21 price tag but in order to fix the game today using the pay4mods scheme itll cost you well over twice that price even with the game right now at 75% off its not worth owning it on pc skyrim had its day in the sun and sadly greed has now caused that sun to set its a dark day for gamers

skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time which is why i was horrified when i saw that they added paid mods to it the reason for my displeasure is that skyrim is a game whose longevity is significantly enhanced by mods and adding paid mods is completely unacceptable and frankly has the potential to cause untold destruction within the modding community in short i cannot support a game that is being crippled by such a blatant cash grab on the part of valve and bethesda

i wont rant for long about this better words have been spoken about the same thing by others but really i had to chime in on this i love this game look at my damn hours played ive sunk the equivalent of mastering a foreign language into exploring tamriel and you know why ive played that long mods mods add sooooo much to a game like this let you do just about anything  enhance your specific playstyle explore new areas new quests or just look like a badass with new armour and weapons but you know what i wont do pay for them would i be willing to donate to some of the more prolific or skilled modders absolutely i use nd enjoy their mods on a regular basis id love to support them but nothing good comes of taking away the ability to choose making an entire selection of mods inaccessible except by payment defeats the purpose of mods themselves would it have been so much work to add a simple donate button would that have killed you valve sigh you get the point

by putting mods for sale bethesda is aiming to destroy a community built in years of efforts and made of common interests shared passion and a little bit of criticism for their scarce coding skills their corporate greed has surpassed even ea by hurting one of the major points of pc gaming and thanks to them everyone who loved customizing their game will now be put in front of a huge paywall they dont care about copyright or ownership issues mods are usually built using other mods as a base they dont care about a united community of fans they just want to put their hands on something they have no right to take advantage of i will never buy another bethesda game from now on and i suggest you to do so

paid for mods negative review a very good comment was made and it shall apply here my review is staying [negative] because you tried bethesda not because you got away with it or not valve are advertising paid mods as a benefit for the creators but modders are actually losing out mods which are dependent on other mods will find themselves becoming defunct  unusable modders which use software to create custom models etc will have licensing issues & legal issues valve  bethesda claim 75% of the cited paid mod cost that leaves 25% to be divided between the people who created the mod for larger mods like falskaar which has 12 people working on it so for example if falskaar was sold for 10 only 250 would go to the falskaar team each member getting 20p for each sale then here the kick in the teeth no one on the falskaar team will see a penny until they earn 400 minimum paying for mods only promotes single man creations that are as small and effortless as possible

it once was an awesome game that you could mod to infinity but i would not recommend it to anyone as of right now where you have to pay for mods the game itself is only really fun once you have the expansions and even then you blow through the content pretty fast mods were the lifeblood of this game and now its behind a paywall do not buy this game

paid mods is a terrible idea 1 people are stealing mods from elsewhere and posting them for a price 2 mods have no quality control and often interfere with other mods they shouldnt ever be sold directly without any qa 3 if you insist on making paid mods you should select certain free mods to go through extra development and quality assurance only then should they be offered for a price the system as is will cause a lot of problems and ruin the current mod community for skyrim you are totally ripping mod makers off with the insane cut both steam and bethesda are taking the huge selection of good free mods used to be a huge part of this game now many will get taken down and put up for sale i cant reccomend this game anymore

great rpg go where you want kill who you want steal what you want the quest are great with a good story behind it i dont do alot of story lines not really a fan in any game the combat seems like an improvement from previous elder scroll games magic is fun to play around with but ill always use my trusty bow the aim is right on just hard to hit them flying dragons skills are done nicely if your an archer type using bows alot and wanna try 2 hand weapons you dont have to make a new character just start using 2 hand weapons with your archer and youll gain skill since there is level ramping enemies in the world level and scale up compared to what level you are when you switch to using 2 hand weapons you will notice a damage differance but just keep using youll get your skill where it needs to be soon enough its easy to get lost in doing side quest from the main story as they randomly generate over all if you like alot of the elder scrolls andor fallout series youll love this 910

what can i say about skyrim that hasnt already been said probably not a lot but ill try if youre one of the few who have never played skyrim then you owe it to yourself to play it skyrim truly is just as incredible as anything youve ever heard about it and is quite possibly the best fantasy setting role playing game ever created to date its a true treat to play this game and just the base game will have you playing for a long time to come and replaying it to try different things after that its one of those games that youll remember your experiences in for the rest of your life if youve never owned skyrim on the pc then you should certainly consider buying it on steam there are millions of mods out there both in steam workshop and out on the general web that can add a lifetime of content to this game didnt like the way the developers did the original skins for the races theres tons of mods to change that bought a computer that cost more than your house and feel the grapics are dated theres mods that will make this game look as near real as you can currently get in computer grapics youve seen all and done all there was to see in this game well first off go you thats quite a feat but theres mods out there that add entirely new lands quests armor weapons you name it out there so im betting you havent seen it all if you can dream it theres a mod for skyrim somewhere out there for it and with all that mod goodness out there i belive you could play this game for the rest of your life and never truly see it all

skyrim is one of those rpgs that could be classified as one in a million immediately after the brief opening scenes the game lets you go out into the enormous world and do whatever you like you can go directly to the main story or solely focus your attention of just the guilds or even spend 5 hrs picks flowers the game gives you absolute freedom to do whatever you want and thats rare in a game nowadays where even in rpgs there are hidden walls and linear questlines besides the quest the game has hundreds of locations for you to explore every dungeon is different in previous tes games most of the dungeons caves or whatever looked pretty much the same which wasnt a bad thing but each dungeon was hand crafted to be different humans beast creatures and dragons have set lvls meaning the stronger you get the easier theyll become this is a big difference compared to oblivion where everything you fought scaled with you that made the game much more difficult and annoying but skyrim allows you to go beast mode the higher you get making you feel like you really are the dragonborn then there are the mods mods mods and more mods i love them i have close to 50 mods on my game right now 34th of them are either texture or city mods when i say city mods i mean there are mods that allow you to change the way a city looks to give it a more vibrant and colorful feel bethesda did an amazing job with the cities but theyre pretty bare i have screenshots on my profile of just a few of the mods so as someone who has played skyrim on the xbox 360 the ps3 and the pc i can 100% say that this is one of the greatest rpgs that has ever been made you would have to be a fool to not try it it literally has something for everyones play style 1010

valve introduced paid workshop mods for skyrim as a result changing my review to negative you dont get to charge people for mods and try to sell them as dlc valve people can and should support mod creators via donations and a buy me a coffee button on the workshop page would be good but putting them behind a pay wall is god damn atrocious hoping valve and other responsible parties for this new practice will turn around

well to start all the elder scroll games are really just horrible to watch unless you have already played them and can understand them while watching and despite the fact that the game doesnt look very action packed once you get into you are in great battles were you need to use tactics and smarts along with some skill to beat them in the start yes all it is is run here hit him 2 times and bam he is dead but as you reach lets say lvl 10 maybe a half and hour of running around caves not even you end up having to use tactics not on your right trigger or mouse along with the amazing combat there are 1000s of quests which all have there own detailed back story and there are also 4 guilds 3 branches and 1 main line which each have there own detailed rich and emotional back story that is as i describe it like a book where every mission is like a cliff hanger and once you finally find a break point its 7 hours later and you just did like 20 quests then the treasures the goal to become rich beyond everyone sucks you in where you need to steal from everyone to increase your coin purse by only 500 gold sucks you in till the point where you end up murdering a whole city for there stuff plus there is a huge world covered in towns and mining camps and caves that you can explore when ever you would like to filled with magical treasures and plot twists and finally every player can create a character that they see them selves as training skills and grinding levelswhich is the only game i have enjoyed grinding levels on s you personalize your character to be the amazing hero you wish you could be

ahh yes the elder scrolls v was a very good game for the rpg style gameplay like fallout games with customizing your character the gameplay is amazing the storyline is that your a prisoner that you could give him or her a name is up to you how u want to make your character look like gameplay and graphics weapons and spells good voice acting soundtrack if you like a rpg game like the elder scroll this game is for you

should you buy the elder scrolls v skyrim dlcs butterfly  > for the base game once you get into the vast world of this rpg game which is one of the most impressive ones ever you wouldnt want to get out from it in weeks it has a very detailed customization system the storyline and its narration are amazing the vistas and graphics are breathtaking and the feel of the character and controls are truly great also the audio effects are always sounding good and authentic which adds to the atmosphere the game has even further also you can choose different factions various skills and choose from many dialogue options and roads to take which have different outcomes in a lot of quests you can ride a horse and get a companion which can be helpful for covering long distances and using the companion as a mule the free steamworkshop mods that you can get double if not triple the fun you get a free hd graphics mods for the entire game and 23 other ones that this masterpiece is unconditionally worth having trust me  if you like this genre this game is a must have > for the dlcs basically dragonborn lets you ride the dragons hearthfire lets you build a home from scratch and you can decorate it more than the base game dawnguard has a really interesting new questline and adds a few enthrallingly designed armours all dlcs are not worth it for their money or buying them alone  the prices never drop more than 50% if youre buying the game  buy the legendary edition because youll save much more on the dlcs and they add a good deal of quests and hours of fun and adventure into the game dragonborn and dawnguard are worth it the most because they both add new sets of armour that adds more protection than the base game sets a lot of new and exciting quests and if you find it cheaper to buy only 1 dlc  make it dragonborn most quests among all dlcs the ability to ride dragons best armour protection in the whole game content and more overall score 10 yes  you should buy  falkwreathaudio voices narration sounds 10 markarthvideo graphics quality of ingame videos vistas 10 riftenstory plot sidequests how it is all introduced  variety 10 solitudegenretypical atmosphere amazing for an rpg  10 windhelmphysics mechanics gravity general feel and control 10 whiterunlongevity time you will definitely spend in the game  100 hours 10

introduction its rare for me to give a game a perfect score but skyrim is a real gem in this chapter of the elder scrolls saga you will probably end up investing hundreds of hours of your life to experience open world storytelling at its best bethesda did a flawless job immersing the player in countless diverse adventures from fighting dragons to dabbling with gods and none of these questlines ever lose their shine being an open world roleplaying game it goes without saying that skyrim provides a huge environment that you can explore at your own leisure however like its predecessors skyrim is not completely without flaw on rare occassion you might happen accross a technical glitch or two usually easily fixed by a mod but let me tell you firsthand that this is well worth the price in spite of its shortcomings skyrim is still the best game that i have ever played and it is impossible to see it as anything outside of a uniquely enchanting experience story really there is too much story to cover so here is the primary synopsis tamriel is a land brimming with danger in this masterpiece it was once prophesied that a dragon known as alduin would return to destroy the world it is up to the player to defeat the world eater before it is too late meanwhile there is a war brewing between the stormcloaks and the imperials in which the player can choose to involve themselves or remain neutral again this is a huge open world experience where you can safely ignore the main storyline for 80% or more of your gametime there is always stuff to do and you will never be bored gameplay there are several races and classes that you can pick from and there is something for everybody in the mix you can even mix races with their nondefault roles if you wish to experiment by default you can play a breton altmer high elf argonian bosmer wood elf dunmer dark elf imperial khajiit nord orsimer orc or redguard there are other races you could mod in however i feel the default races are perfect and found no need to do this myself it should be taken into consideration that each race starts with a different set of base stats the early game customization is wonderful and bethesda gives you a lot of options to work with i think the character customization in skyrim might just be one of my favourite elements so dont be afraid to add personality to your characters appearance classes are also extremely diverse and there is no right or wrong way to play them you could mix and match them and still be able to beat the game however some of the archetypes include twohanded warrior archer battlemage thief assassin warlock paladin and nightblade there are many places to read up on the archetypes so i wont flood this section with information  it should also be mentioned that the difficulty can be determined at any point in the game by the player i felt this was an extremely nice feature as i enjoy challenging gameplay i feel that skyrim is extremely well balanced and unless youre playing legendary never strays to the realm of impossibility even legendary creatures are beatable it just takes a lot more effort and strategy controls controls can be set through the settings menu and the default controls are really not so bad if youre anything like me however you might prefer the 360 controller approach and i am pleased to announce that this is entirely supported by skyrim it was no fuss for me to set it up and so i would say that the controls of this game are very user friendly  and in the end boil down to personal preference graphics i feel as though the graphic quality of skyrim has been highly praised elsewhere so permit me a moment to beat a dead horse the graphics in this game are true to detail and very indepth in other words worthy of the hype you can take your game a step further if you so desire by installing mods  as skyrim is a host to many of these personal preference improvements and remains highly customizable the aurora borealis which spans over tamriel at night is possibly the most beautiful feature to be found in the game the visuals and sounds are highly impressive on their own but when you mix them with exploration and discovery its only icing on the cake sound the sounds of skyrim feature an original score which i have been told reminds some people of oblivion the main theme is brilliant and has been covered countless times for those of you who might be interested the lyrics of the main theme is written in dragon language which sets it apart from the little tunes that you will hear the bards sing throughout the game replay value i have already replayed this game so many times and i guarantee you will too smolders note finally a note on modding this is extremely simple for those of you who have never modded before and even easier for those of you who have however you can easily fix a lot of the game bugs and glitches by use of these wonderful implementations made by other skyrim users it is also very simple to add other mods to your game such as immersive armors immersive creatures or immersive weapons all three are mods that i cannot live without i really want to take a moment to encourage you to check out the lorefriendly mods that might enhance your skyrim experience i hope this helped

ill admit at first when i heard of the game it didnt seem as interesting thought it would be like the rest that claims to be epic when its not but over time i saw my friends play it and when i looked it up for a voicepak project i was working on i was wrong the game was something i was actually expecting in a game no ending point full customization the ability to fight in 1st person with any weapon outstanding music ability to make potions armor weapons and food like in mmo games and a great storyline with many branching quests all in single player i never got the dlc yet but i can already tell itll make the game worth every cent its worth too addicting even the mods make the game fun never gets old with a character with wings especially if killed by a giant flying in the air always cracks me up xp screw the 1010 rating and even the 2010 rating it deserves the 5010 rating best rpg game ever on steam

the elder scrolls v skyrim i have played this game for many hours now so i shall finally come to complete a review graphics the graphics unmodded arent half bad you could live with them without a probleem however if you want a real pretty game you can mod this game until it just wont even want to play anymore in fact theres around 10000 mods on nexus gems and steam workshop so if you like to mod till you drop this is an epic win to buy for you the textures are outstanding especially since this is such of an old game you could easily run this game on medhigh settings to get 60fps then add mods to still have a decent fps this game is a real gem if you choose to add the 4k mods although you might experience only around 4555fps on average so you should be slightly worried about what mods youre going to download theres plenty of ways to get yourself out of trouble if your game wont launch so its usually a quck fix to get your game back up and running again gameplay the gameplay is extremely fun to have in an already awesome game you could kill scavenge steal go to prison borrow eat fight drink and tons more skyrim is sort of realistic but only in the sense that you can eat scavenge steal ect so no this isnt an accurate representation of what medieval times looked like too much although on some parts such as the castles and forts it is quite close to how they couldve looked like so extra points there bethesda you also can get a whole new game with the legendary edition that adds all the dlc to your library with the full game granting you access to a wife vampires a house children and so so so much more you can clearly tell by the number of mods you wont get bored of skyrim easily anyime soon as you could get the entire combat system be reworked on or have some items become over powered or reskined if you do get stuck in a situation where you are just plain bored theres tons of cheats you could use such as more money but remember make a new save before you create your legit save illegitemate maps skyrims map is an absolute collossus it is around the size of just cause 3s map but just medieval they put tons of detail in this map but if you want anything else of the map you can always mod it in fact you should mod it as long as your pc can handle it theres plenty of animals  creatures to kill loot and get xp points from you could go mining you could go on an adventure you could even ride a stallion to the tip of a mountain nearly touching the clouds while staring down below to see how far you have come but dont forget if you dissaprove then just mod it summary to sum skyrim up ive created a list or else id have to make 10 pages worth of a review on this superb game pros and cons pros excellent graphics giant number of modders and mods barely ever get bored theres so much things to do you can play the game without using a single cheat theres cheats if you dont like something  you could use a mod to change it legendary edition is worth the price dlc is worth the price massive map thousands of enemies quests that erent fully boring the gameplay is fun skill tree voice acting isnt terrible some funny dialouge lines you can install a mod such as wyrmstooth for a few more hours of fun the combat is pretty good you could buybuild your own house requires dlc if you already own dlc then mod the game you will feel as if its a completely different game you can change how things look such as changing the setting to extremely hot using mods you can mod skyrim cons no multiplayer skyrim might crash because of some mods

as much as i hate jumping on bandwagons what made this game so great that i kept coming back for more than 1600 hours was the mods without it its bland and not very interesting with an awful story uninspired gameplay and tons of unfixed bugs still a decent game if you like exploration but thats really all that game has going for it and now bethesda moves to a new business model making people pay for mods with potentially future games allowing only paid mods which means well have to pay for bugfixes and additions to the games without any guarantee that it will work or any accountability from the developers for these paid features developed by amateurs therefore i cant recommand this game or any future bethesda game anymore at least until we see how the future games are handled in that aspect it was fun while it lasted farewell for now bethesda edit well looks like all that agitation had a result valve and bethesda backpedaled and paid mods are gone it will take a bit of time for trust to rebuild though so in the meantime my review stays negative no need to change it if bethesda tries another boneheaded move tomorrow or the next month edit 2 lol a bunch of idiotic fanboys went through all my reviews and downvoted them all to avenge their beloved skyrim this guy made a negative review of skyrim for reasons we dont agree with lets downvote all his positive reviews for games that have nothing to do with skyrim and by doing so they did exactly what they were blaming me of doing only for 9 games instead of 1 the irony and stupidity of that move is hilarious

a bit about the game and developers skyrim was made by one of those top known companies on earth called bethesda softworks they are the same guys behind all other the elder scrolls games as well as the upcoming hit mmorpg which i will only buy if it will not have monthly fee elder scrolls online about gameplay the elder scrolls v skyrim or skyrim for short is a role playing game which puts all those wow and any other mmorpg elements into one beautiful single player game there are hundreds probably even thousands of quests which you can complete in skyrim some give you money some give you items some give you fame they also sometimes give you all three of those there are various missions such as protect a guy while he is going from one city to the other or find the lost treasure which might or might not be in a cave kill a dragon in a nearby village slaughter bandit camp hunt down vampires or some other very fun missions great thing about skyrim is that there are no classes you can be anything that you desire you can be a mage with heavy armor or a gladiator with robes so you could move faster literally anything you want there are also a lot of professions that you can chose from like blacksmithing and alchemy blacksmithing allows you to build some weapons which can not be built in game while alchemy allows you to make various potions and enchants on your weapon allowing you to make the most powerful equipment in the whole game there is one main quest and tones of other quests you can also join a guild that will give you some benefits such as cheaper items in shops they will also allow you to buy some items which cant be bought by normal merchants and so on and on there are various guilds such as thief guild the comapnions mercenary guild mages guild the dark brotherhood assassins and so on and on there are various armors robes and leather equipment for you to use there are also various weapons such as bow and arrow with a lot of different types of bows and arrows swords warhammers maces staffs there are also combinations such as dual wielding swords or sword in one hand and an axe in the other enchants also make your equipment much stronger giving you some boosts as 15 more protection from heavy armors or upon hit you deal shock damage or something else since you can enchant your own equipment there are also various combinations you can use as well character customization is pretty amazing but nothing that would go into the depth of a character as some other f2p games such as tera or apb reloaded there are also various of different races to chose from all races give you some boosts also choosing a race is also important for some quests because some npcs might like you more if youre a nord while other would like you more if you were an imperial combat system in this game is pretty sweet you need to aim above the target with bow and arrow because arrows fall after a while some magic skills require some time to get casted others are instant melee weapons allow you to do few different attacks depending on how you do them if you move your mouse to the right or left while holding the attack button your character will do a slash attack while if you move your mouse up your character will do a slice attack which also does massive damage to all enemies right in front of you graphic and audio graphic in skyrim is amazing there are wonderful sights to see wonderful mountains flowers trees all the npcs look stunning and so do animals well wolves are kind of disappointment to me but everything else is just wonderful and the sky takes my breath away no mater if its day or night and songs are amazing but then again all elder scrolls songs are amazing once you hear them you cant stop listening and humming them all day long dovahkiin dovahkiin pros cons and final grade pros  nice customization wonderful graphic and audio  massive sandbox world full of various creatures and places  saving a village from a dragon the village people will remember your fame cons  a lot of bugs which are not important overall grade 1010 thank you for reading my reviews dont forget that im usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here httpmidnightwolfieblogspotcom thank you

are you tired of taking the same old paths feel like youre going nowhere fast fast traveld are dragons taking you on a oneway trip to high hrothsnore zzzzzzzz these convenient means of travel are so boring theres got to be a better way there is try to hop over that mountain at a 75 degree angle the most exciting way of getting where you want to go eventually getting where you want to go not guaranteed but on a serious note gameplay 1010 graphics 1010 wasted life 1010 i recommend this to anyone who loves to sit around in their room for hoursdaysweeksmonthsyears on end without human interaction
recommended
a masterpiece from the xx century great graphics and music huge map and variety of quests interesting storyline and a big amount of weapons armor potions enchantments etc almost the same game style as fallout 3 being that it was made by the same company but instead of guns we have medieval weapons swords knifes axes bows even a big amount of magic spells the level up system works not just by killing people and creatures but by performing different actions such as sneak by selling stuff archery different magic schools theft alchemy and more even though the game looks like a fps i think its a fair game when it comes to battles and it has the posibility to change camera views what it makes it unique from the other sequels is that the main enemies are dragons which you have to fight and defeat throughout the game a fully recommended game which takes quite a lot hours to be beat and another amazing game from bethesda softworks

unbelievable game cant stop playing it definately reccomended

910 i love this game and everything that goes on in it i bought it for my ps3 when i lived in an apartment i also own it on pc obviously cant say i regret ever having bought this game everything is worth checking out the dlc is amazing and brings new things that help improve the game even more i would advise checking out mods this game has replayability and definitely a chance to get your moneys worth from it i still have a hard time believing i invested 1300 some odd hours of my life into this game aside from that some negatives is probably the fact it is older and may not meet new standards of graphics for some people who are all about pretty pictures but if that is not a problem for you as it isnt for me at all you will love this game

if youve played previous elder scrolls games glitches and oddities dont come as a surprise nevertheless skyrim feature tighter combat fewer bugs improved graphics and so on if there is anything to complain about in this game it would be the user interface inventory taking up a lot of useless items some bad acting as you level up the creatures you fight take forever to kill by hitting them 3040 times and finally its replayability value creating characters is nice even though it takes a very long time to get what you want done finding and completing quests is solid i said all i disliked the game succeeds in comparison to elder scrolls iv and i am addicted to this game like a person playing games replayability value is hard to get back to though if you leave the game for a month or more anyways great work on the game this is more than i expected it to be with little to no struggle to get used to postives tons of content fun combat huge open world to explore modding tools deep character creation tools a lot of side missions and longendless gameplay a lot of ways to improve graphics negatives bugfree horrible voice acting poor character animations overall 910

this game is so excellent that i dont even feel worthy enough to review it suffice it to say that the bar in terms of role playing games is just a plaything for bethesda game studios they can put it wherever they want and it will stay there until they come back for it again nobody else will even come close
recommended
a very entertaining and addictive game
recommended
honestly this is one of the best games i have ever played its up there on my lst with the legend of zelda games like oot and lttp enough with that back to the acutal review if you ever loved medivaeavl fantasy as a kid or still do like i do you will love this game you can do whatever you want in this game the stories are not tight like many other games ive played you can turn from a mage to warrior in a blink of an eye and back agian also my 300 hours of playing this game doesnt give this review much justice as i first played on my xbox 360 when it came out but eventually bought it on the pc for mods and it is sooo much better in the end we wont see a game as good as this in awhile at least untill bethesda makes fallout 4 andor the elder scrolls vi or if valve makes half life 3 last thing i would like to say is that famitsu a highly revered review magizine gave skyrim a perfect 4040 score it was the first western game to get the perfect score grand theft auto 5 being the second

be a cat and empty everyones pockets ben a man and defeat a dragon or be whatever you want to be and kick some as done with the game maybe try some mods

ive put 150 hours into this game on xbox 360 then i saw mods i got a pc got playing and so far have put 100 more hours into it and havent even started the story its by far the best game of all time  in my head anyway  its great for role playing and even better for modding but if you do mod skyrim i reccomend the nexus theres a link here httpswwwgooglecoukurlsat&rctj&q&esrcs&sourceweb&cd1&cadrja&uact8&sqi2&ved0cceqfjaa&urlhttp%3a%2f%2fwwwnexusmodscom%2fskyrim%2f&ei8fu4vluvn4is7ab6ricwda&usgafqjcneazjtbvl2adtcrk3hz2472xisr8g&bvmbv77161500dzgu but if you havent play this game you havent gamed

skyrim is one of my favorite rpgs of all time you play as a speacial hero known as the dragonborn meaning you have the blood of dragons within you and you can use the speacial words of power as you adventure through the massive land of skyrm fighting monsters bandits and lengandary dragons you learn more about the land and its dark and instresting secrets and story this game is worth any price

oh skyrim what a glorious piece of art everything about it is right only a few flaws but really improved from its pass brothers leveling and combat system for example is fix to many players comfort graphics are beautiful and have no limits if you have it on pc to sum it all up i highly recommend this piece of art for every cent is worth it

this game is a game of massive preportions as is a game that ive invested over 1k hours into not only for its content in the landscape or terrain rather its sense of i havent done everything yet or ive done everything mabye ill do it again this game has consumed a majority of my life and i cant say im against that it truely is a game to buy play complete then mod to oblivion speaking of which buy oblivion too

killing a chicken will cause everyone to try and kill you do not hurt chickens but if you must do it stealthily

this is the best game ive ever played if you dont know about a game to buy this is the perfect choice and the right destination of your money and thanks to the mods you can play it forever you dont even have to worry about the story if you only center your attention in it your game will be a little short i guess  the beauty of this game is to explore the amazing lands of skyrim and the beautiful lore that has to offer the freedom that this game gives you its impossible to compare with any other its just unique i love it ps if you value your social life just dont buy it this game is a real lifedrainer

on a quest to receive mammoth tusk found a mammoth started punching it giants started chasing me ran few yards later a mammoth falls out the sky and dies retrieves mammoth tusk and completes quest 1110

one of the best rpgs ive played even though i owned this game on my xbox i brought it again on steam and can happily say it was a good decision i own the hearthfire and dragonborn dlc at the moment and have over 200 hours in this game after completing it on xbox as well if youre willing to mod you can add so much more to the game which is especially useful if youre looking to add more hours of gameplay in if you get bored after a while great game overall
recommended
although i have few hours on my pc i have well over 1200 hours on my ps3 playing this game and i can tell you pc is better in every aspect this game never ends as soon as you think i wonder if theres a mod for there is you can go install mods that add new followers to ones that allow you to open your own market stall to be tended by said followers you can slay dragons conquer dungeons and best of all get smashed if youre on the borderline about getting this game get the legendary edition hearthfire really allows you to immerse yourself in the game while dawnguard and dragonborn provide more challenges than the average missions 1010
recommended
one of the best games ever
recommended
200 hour game 150 hours of menu navigating

is there anything else to be said

totally blew away my initial expectations and has everything oblivion had and more the story of this game definitely lives up to the elder scrolls series throwing you into the middle of a country on the brink of war between the empire loyalists and the stormcloaks while this is going on an ancient prophecy begins to unfold as well marking the return of dragons in skyrim i have to say this storyline was incredibly engaging and satisfying to me especially since you have the ability to choose a side in the war and follow that path through to the end the soundtrack of this game is still very good although i still prefer the music from oblivion more as far as things to do there is so much to do in this game it is insane there are hundreds of hours of gameplay to be found in activities and questlines in a single playthrough alone and the game even warrents multiple playthroughs due to the heavy level of customization present in character creation and skill trees i myself had more than one playthrough of this game doing different types of characters some more satisfying than others this is easily one of the greatest rpgs of the year if not of all time to date
recommended
if you dont mind a little tinkering this game can be one of your alltime favourite purchases any elder scrolls game wouldnt be complete without a massive modding community helping you to twist the game to any of your fancies want to make the game better looking mods want to have more realistic indepth lore while you explore the land mods want to bash your enemies with a captain america shield and a squeaky toy while using a dragon shout to call forth thomas the tank engine mods no seriously there are mods for that last one
recommended
i put alot of time into this game and i have to say it is one the greatest games i have ever played skyrim takes to a snow covered kingdom torn by civil war and a new threat dragons you play as the dragonborn a mystic being capable of speaking in dragon langauge and using the power of your voice to produce a thum or a shout by now i would assume that people already know about the internet famous fus ro dah shout that pushes enemies back on the subject of enemies skyrim offers a wide variety of enemies that you can face you want dragons you got dragons you want skeletons with shrouds who can shoot magic from thier hands you got that too the game also has a leveling systen so when you level up the enemies will get slighty stronger and have better equipment not to mention the almost endless variety of mods you can use with your game but dyno what if i like call of duty dont fret they have guns medival guns with the all new dawnguard addon you can have crossbows yet again not to mention the modding community makes some pretty sick flintlock pistols the game also has longbows and shortbows but dyno what if i wanna set someone on fire well now you can with the all new skyrim the video game that has a magic system that rivials that of oblivion you can set someone on fire frezze the  out of them or turn them into a lightbulb that has to much electricity but dyno im a 13 year old boy what if i wanna be a girl  logic in the first mission of the game you hope off a carriage and a man askes who you are then a plastic surgeon who is played by you must make you character as deformed or as astheicly pleaseing as possible there is no time limit so you can spend hours and hours trying to find the find the right shade of brown to go right below your cat person left  cheek also being the plastic surgeon you are you can make your cat person a man or a woman in the click of a button but dyno what if i want to play with my friends well little timmy you cant this game has no coop of any kind except you do have followers that follow you around the whole map like a fat guy looking for his piece of pizza that slid into his fat rolls but dyno what if i want to have sex with a person in this game no you cant because those es who were working buy the whiterun stables got narked out  da police but dyno what if i hate awesome games that let you kill stuff then you go back to call of duty and dont buy this game last question what if i want to kill a chicken no you cant harm the god damed chickens because they are priceless and every guard in every hold will be gridding on your  because you accidently lit a chicken on fire 1010 goty

wander the open world of skyrim as you the dragonborn use your awesome magical gift of the ancient language to steal cabbages steal horses pick pockets pick locks and even rob shops at night still be the hero as you kill off an entire empire such as the stormcloaks or the imperials hunt through the ancient ruins of nords and fight through armies of zombies just to get bored in the end and murder everyone in windhelm just for the hell of it

skyrim offers an en epic adventure that will take you to the most memorable places around the map the world of skyrim is beautiful and has a really good atmosphere including an awesome soundtrack in skyrim you are a dragonborn and you must stop the invasion of dragons and defeat the legendary dragon alduin you can customzie your character pretty well and you can defeat your enemies in many ways ranging from seperating their heads from the rest of the body to incinerating them to nothingness
recommended
pros probably one of the most enjoyable games ive ever played graphics 1010 gameplay 1010 cons you dont have a real life after you play this game lol
recommended
as a person with attention deficit disorder i generally find that ten hours is the best that i can dedicate to a game without getting bored of it im well past that in skyrim and am still enjoying the gameplay
recommended
this game is a masterpiece want a good rpg play skyrim want a good open world game play skyrim in skyrim you can do so freaking much you can become a vampire lord werewolf dragonborn king theif assassins a freaking flower collector if you want skyrim has tons of quests you can do each of them is fun and interesting with lots of twists and turn around every corner maybe the only down side to this game is its voice acting its bland you maybe hear 10 different voice actors in the enitre game other than that skyrim is perfect any problem you might have with the game can be fixed with mods you can make skyrim look like crysis 3 graphics wise the modding community will keep this game alive for the next 10 years no doubt about it i mean for god sakes a mod was released that was the size of an official dlc speaking about the dlc the dlc adds tons of new items and quests even landscapes well worth the 10 euro price tag this is my all time favourite game hands down
recommended
warning dont buy this game when youre about to have exams i got mine about a week before i started them this was the first tes game i played and i loved it the amount of sidequests that are in it is just insane there is almost literally one under each rock i havent even completed the game yet im a slacker this game is almost perfect in each of its aspects sound lore gameplay and after getting used to the combat i really enjoyed it its a bit cluncky if youre not used to it this is a musthave for each gamer
recommended
if you are single you will find your woman here and build a family with her maybe the best game i ever played i played things like that like darksiders 2 dark souls 2 and other great titles but skyrim its a game that you wont take 7 hours to complete it but yes about 3040 hours its a hard game but your friend in that mission will always help you let him do all the stuff for you the secondary quests will help you grow up and evolve your skills also you will find the dragonite paarthurnax that will let you find your outrage fire breath cheating on this game will make lose the story itself dont cheat i tried on new save and the game is not the same thing  if you are a guy that wants all steam achievements this game is the right one but try to do it by yourself first buy the legendary pack you will get all dlcs and they are worth of their price it increases 10 hours to your gameplay no matter if you completed your game mainquest or if you still did not ended it be a dragonborn today
recommended
this game is great and the fun is endless i reccomend this game to anyone who like rpgs its not too hard and you can use cheats for fun i would give it a 1010 one of my favorite games of all time everyone who i know who has it loves it
recommended
as someone who has put in quite a number of hours into this game on my pc and almost three times that much on my 360 i can confidently say that this game was worth single cent but youre looking at it right now arent you thats how youre reading my review stop reading my review and buy this game you wont regret it

skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played in my whole entire life right behind star wars battlefront ii  this game has soooooo many things to do on it just like in oblvion or even fallout 3new vegas perfect game i always enjoy this game and it is so hard to find things that is bad about this game there are a few bugs of course what game doesnt have bugs the legendary edition contains all of the dlc that is totally worth it none of the dlc is bad at all good job bethesda 
recommended
definately one of the most fantastic games i have ever played i put off buying the pc version for over a year instead playing the xbox 360 version every once in a while i must say the pc version far surpasses that of the console what with the upped graphics and mod support this is a must have for any pc gamer the game in itself is truly amazing you could play for days and still stumble upon some old crypt that before then you had no idea existed the game is huge and the vast ammount of user created content availlable is beyond awe inspiring skyrim is a must have  the storyline world lore and everything to do with it is beyond anything seen in any other game ever

this is one of the best game i have ever played the only reason i have not played it more is beacuse of the fact it`s not 2 player or online if you love rpg games get skyrim but the possibility that you love rpgs and have not bought skyrim yet is very low recommended on the highest

fantastic game the pc allows you to push skyrim past its limits and create a game that streches far beyond gaming console capabilities exuberant and inclusive what does that mean

wif da proppa mods dis gaem can b z best gaem that is in exestence nawmsayin

i have to say i liked some things about oblivion more it just had something that skyrim lacks not really something you can discribe to someone however this is still a great game and more then worthy of the elder scrolls name looks at redguard adventure you start out as a prisoner in true es fashion right before you are killed by an axe a dragon destroys the town and you are able to make your escape from there you learn that you are dragonborn a rare skin disease where you whole body grow scales and horns making you the only one who can sneek up on a dragon and kill it while it is confused about what you are all in all a great game >
recommended
set approximately 200 years after events which transpired in oblivion skyrim invites you into a journey filled with adventure battle and destiny continuing to build upon the expansive lore and history etched by the saga and the open world sandbox premise of the previous games right away you are struck with the huge realization that you can do what you want when you want and how you want fancy being a mighty sword wielding warrior a deadly stealthy assassin a mage who has mastered the arcane arts or a combination of all skyrim makes this possible though not without flaws bugs the depth and scale of this game coupled with the interactive gameplay compelling stories and quests create an enjoyable gaming experience with beautiful graphics stunning soundtrack and immersive feel skyrim is definitely a gaming journey of epic proportions
recommended
in my opinion this is the best game of all time amazing graphics amazing story amazing sountrack amazing everything i have around 800 hours on the xbox 360 version and i still want to invest time into the pc version since there is now awesome mods that increase graphics gameplay and even the story the open world is fun to explore but after a while it does tend to feel a little tiresome when walking for a long period of time but thankfully there is a fast travel system that speeds up the process you also stumble apon unscipted avents when roaming the open world such as dragon attacks and bandits there is also ai that you meet when traveling the roads of skyrim like guard patrols and traders this is a game you must play
recommended
this game is probably one of the best ive played although my opinion is very bias with me favoring sandbox games its one of the most immersful starting out you get countless different playstyles you can be a barbaric tank rogue mage or many more the talent trees that you get choose from to enhance your experience are very diverse and straightforward the game in the very beginning itself is made to fit your personal style and then youll soon find out so are the quests you dont need to complete all of the quests in skyrim to complete the main storyline therefore skipping the ones you dont wouldnt enjoy if you prefer the theives approach you might like the dark brotherhood or theives guild or say instead you picked a mage you might like the college of winterholds quests the quests themselves are amazing there is so much lore and storytelling behind everything what makes it even more unique is that there are often conflicting factions you get to play and hear both sides of the story the only people i wouldnt recommend this game to are people who dont like straightforward combat it may get repetative over time but that all just depends on the player after all the game was meant to have a more realisitic combat style or if youre someone who doesnt like sandbox games dont play it this game has a few minor bugs and glitches like any other game but honestly it doesnt matter with how well developed this game is id highly recommend it to anyone
recommended
ive only played skyrim for about 3 hours and i can honestly say amazing i bought it for $5 on the summer sale and im glad i did skyrim is mind blowing from graphics to gameplay and will always keep you on your toes the only complaint i have is that i cant rim the skys 910
recommended
its like farcry with swords
recommended
excellent medieval style wrpg massive world to explore tons of side quests and an amazing story i was very disappointed in bethesda after fallout new vegas for all the bugs i ran into while playing it but this game was surprisingly stable in comparison and has renewed my faith in them to produce quality software
recommended
ive been playing for over a month now and the game never ceases to amaze me you can lose yourself in the world and become a part of it theres not just one story there are hundreds sure theres one driving story but all stories together make for fantastic adventures im around 90 hours in and i think ive only just grazed the surface of this epic tale there are times where i just sat back at looked at a vista and how the sun cast shadows if you have heart youll want this game if you dont dont worry the game has more than enough heart for you
recommended
only if you have male reproductive organs
recommended
i havent actually played this game just installed a bunch of mods for it
recommended
because this box wouldnt go away if ididnt recommend it
recommended
i like not as much as oblivion or morrowind but you know hey its good
recommended
still love this game after 3 years mods are amazing kuddos to the creators of those careful though when installing mods lots of conflicts can be created use nexus mod manager for that also be careful with mods that add a lot of scripts mine slowed down so much that buying a horse would take 15 minutes to complete haha still the immense freedom this game gives you fast traveling is the boring way
recommended
vanilla skyrim is an enjoyable experience one most people can only stomach once i find the the true joy comes from modding the game and using all of the community created quests and enhnacements the greatest thing you can do with any elder scrolls game
recommended
my playtime was achieved in about 5 days steals your life best rpg game ever made cant find any negatives buy it and the dlc and let you life drain away

i enjoy the open world feel while usually i am not one for single player games this one actually keeps everything rather fresh and new offering all kinds of things to work on and fight the quests though can be interesting to try and complete when you do not get detailed directions i have had to look up some of the quests now and then because the directions given in game were not in depth enough regardless though it is a fun game

skyrim just made elder scrolls gold the game is unbelieveably amazing in every aspect especially when bethesda made it the fallout series 3 new vegas were the games that made the type of gameplay that they put off handsdown my favorite combat in my eyes is very stratigized not having to rush to kill the enemy before your companion does and not having vats is great example i had to run and jump off of things so that the enemy which was way stronger than me would fall back father behind me so that i can heal and gain some more magika also on pc it blows the skyrim expericence up to the roof its beautiful skyrim is where its at if you want a new openworld game 110100

breaking news i am bringing this report from various sources stating that bethesda game studios have accidently released a product that has become so addictive that people are refusing to leave their computers persons having used this product have reported that they only played 30 mins but have awoken to a different day altogether reports of 3 4 hour warp times are common with some users experiencing what seems to be a 6 hour jump in time it seems after use players become severely disorientated greatly yearning for sleep however we have confirmed reports that this product is also quite addictive with reports from players seeking to finish one more quest but then relapsing into exploring this land that people have dubbed skyrim experts are warning against the overuse of this product however it seems there is no stopping people wanting to experience more of this product as supposedly people have been experiencing a high when they find about stronger equipment in this game indecisive people are strongly warned about its addictive nature with one expert claiming that modded with enb and other files found in the workshop and nexus the potency of this product can be extremely addictive with time jumps of 24 hours thats all from me today back to the studio

lets just say that if i were trapped on a desert island that somehow got electricity and wifi and could only have one video game to play for my entire life i would choose this one because it is not humanly possible to do all that there is to do in this game in one life time and you will probably never get tired of it just when you think youre done youll get sucked back in somehow it never ends ever
recommended
its a good open world sandbox game that goes with the rest of the elder scrolls lore
recommended
good as a game but even better as a platform for playermade content skyrim is a themepark if you go knocking on the walls of disney world and peering behind the magic curtains of course youll expose it for what it is shallow escapism but is that so terrible morrowind contains the best worldbuilding and oblivion the most charm and charisma so whats left for skyrim fun yeah the quests might not be as deep or the leveling as complex as previous titles but that doesnt make it a bad game you can sink hours into skyrim without getting bored and once you do get bored after a few months away youll be back with renewed interest rinse and repeat its the circle of the elder scrolls skyrim also represents a broad platform for fans and content creators alike when so many other companies are shying away from modding tools bethesda continues to support them wholeheartedly the same tools used to make the game are available to you at the click of a button granted they do take some time to master but the limits are sky high

could very well be the best game ive ever played the story is epic and the landscapes and characters are beautiful i dont think i could ever get tired of skyrim 1010

theres nothing more visualy enchanting and gameplay challenging than this epic elder scrolls installment roam through the endless land of skyrim  participate in quests  take sides  conquer kingdoms  betray and betrayed but most of all be the one that fullfils the prophecy be the dragonborn the lengendary edition is a must have  because it brings all the enhancements and the extra content that this title needed to be one of the most rewarding and challenging rpgs ive ever experienced

i very first started with a barbaric nord who weilded 2handers and dawned heavy armor and completely smashed everything in sight i next played a redguard conjuration mage thief who dual wielded conjured weapons and now im an orc werewolf archer who is really good at pick pocketing there is really no end to the amount of customization this game gives you the player has complete and full control of who and what they want their character to be ive played through this game so many times originally had it for 360 and i still find all new areas to explore ive never had so much fun with a game 1010 for a game after 3 years since its release and still holds my attention for long periods of time
recommended
this game can be veryveryverylong if your ocd for sidequests like i ami dont even know if i have the main story in my quests and worried about walking into the infinate looping sidequests the game has a few bugs in but its nothing game breaking its enjoyable to rpg fans and obviously to elder scrolls fans the 1st dragon kill can be very satisifiying but after like 10 of them it just feels like a normal enemy since the random spawn is so common
recommended
lets be honest best game ever made you cant go wrong here also modding this game makes it twice better 1010
recommended
i recommend this game because its an interesting game its a well known famous game everyone seems to love this game so much i played it for 2 years or more

oh what a game so many choices so many things to do follow the quest run off on sidequests or just wander aimlessly to your hearts content its all in there focus on magic be the best mage you can be favor destroying stuff become a destructionist mage and burn freeze zap everything in your way like to protect yourself specialize in the alteration school there are other schools as well something for everyone or just do a little bit of everything doesnt matter you can tailor your playthrough to the way you want to play it fancy yourself a sneaky type focus on stealth put everything in powerful daggers and level up backstabbing and nothing will stand in your way want to snipe enemies from the shadows just start putting experience into bows and enchanting and take down targets health stamina or magicka level from a distance so that one or two hits from your dagger or sword will make short work of them find or craft you a soultrapping weapon and you can gather an infinite supply of souls to recharge your magical bows or melee weapons to keep doing massive amounts of damage burly warrior or wily agile fighter you pick the skys the limit as you can basically do anything or be anything you want to be spend hours days months even just exploring make a career out of hunting wild animals and gathering their pelts to sell for money so you can afford your own place so you can even get married and adopt some kids just wander if you want as there are thousands of places towns villages lone cottages caves mines and mills to enjoy interact with take on a job just about any place i dont see how this game could get any better or do it better so that you can enjoy playing it your way oh wait there are literally thousands of mods that do just that from hundreds of new weapons armor types loot potions poisons capesits just endless and then there are all the mods for improving the lowquality objects found in the vanilla game texture enhancements gameplay enhancements crafting overhauls hundreds of new followers creature types its just incredible what you can do i dont see how anyone could not like this game its phenomenal

this game is the epicest in my gaming history well the giant spiders are scary as the  for me because i have arachnophobia but i can remove them with a mod so if you like the weapons of the medieval ages and some spells then buy it you wont be disappointed d

excellent open world rpg in my opinion not as pretty as oblivion and far easier than oblivion  thus more accessible immersive beautiful title play your own way can easily log hundreds of hours just exploring side quests dlc are fun though not as good as oblivion dlc horse armour aside played extensively and completed on xbox

its a great game i have dedicated many hours especially on xbox i pc it is a game which is to create your custom character i discovering landscapes in a colossal map enemies dungeons in my opinion the highlight are the missions there are also political comflictos and battles guilds of thieves assassins knights and a big immensity of missions i myself xbox 517 hours i could not finish what i really like about this game is the large number of objects that are i the freedom it gives you this role i found no such thing in assassins creed the atmosphere of the streets comversaciones on the market this well heco i there are beautiful landscapes impressive i pity i i consider an error of the game is that there is online but the story is very well cast another incomveniente are many physical errors for example sometimes a mammoth flying or is fallin from the sky but overall it is a high quality game i being the 2011 is very well warning can be very adictiovo the fun is to play without cheats this is my experience as a veteran i review skyrim

the closest thing we have to a fully fledged duck simulator embark on the most vivid 300x300 reseloution treasure hunt you could ever imagine perfect for gamers who never want to lose  skyrim offers a vast land of snow for you to have snowball fights with dragons and other foes and for you sneaky fellows out there skyrim sneak realism is incredible you will be able to live out all your dreams of being completley invisible boasts a gigantic cast of 3 voice actors guiding you through this incredible tale of god versus the little lizards trying to end the world skyrim also takes the cake for the most snow in a video game ever filled with rediculously fun quests and activities that make you say what a terrefic game it is not easy at all and very rewarding  also i think the sneak system is very balanced and realistic and not op oh and the winged salamanders are challenging with fun mechanics the vast arsenal of weapons and tools provided for the player is almost on par with bad rats simply incredible in conclusion ign rated this game a 9510 but i think they are wrong this game deserves a solid 1010 and should be in every household it has achevied classic status nearly instantly with its griping sneak mechanics  incredible stealth and flawless sneak mechanics making it the game of the year for every year ps the best part about the game is the fact that the blonde haired blue eyed people are incredibly racist and sneak

youll find yourself surrounded by crazy people monsters and bugs and they wont go easy on you you can do whatever you want tho enjoy yourself dont try to climb a mountain it wont work mods are free catch em all the plot is pretty good but its not the most important thing in this game you are dovahkiin nobody has any ideas how you were born but there you are now do your awkward stuff in order to kill alduin the world eater such creativity fun facts you can be a thief vampire werewolf cannibal shieldbrothercompanion blacksmith artisan archmage imperial stormcloak assassin potato dovahkiin yep you are totally amoral join multiple groups nobody actually cares 910

utterly beautiful graphics vastly more content than you can shake a hundred sticks at visceral combat awesome dragons and absolutely worth playing however its not without some significant flaws if youre familiar with the magic system from the previous elder scrolls games prepare for disappointment the range of effects is vastly reduced there are only three types of destruction for instance and theres no spellmaking although you have the awesome ability to cast two spells at once one from either hand they completely missed the opportunity to make spell combinations it all feels generic dumbeddown and consoley though theres a million and thirty sidequests theyre pretty much all identical go to x dungeon and kill a bunch of identical undead the thieves guild quest doesnt actually require you to steal things people treat you exactly the same when youre level 1 as they do when youre master of all the guilds and wearing a dead dragon on your shoulders definitely get it  but be prepared to get a little jaded faster than you might have imagined
recommended
its pretty late to write a review for skyrim but here goes anyway skyrim is a game where you are a personcreature called the dragonborn and hunt down dragons the dragonborn can absorb the souls of dragons killing them permanently and using the knowledge from that soul for your own strength you learn different shouts powers from ancient walls with dragon language on them these powers are the main element of the game as for the options you can be a powerful mage a mighty warrior a sneaky thief a skilled craftsman an alchemist or a mixture of everything you can take on huge side quests such as joining a guild of thieves or assassins a tea party with a madman visiting a museum or ending the current war going on there are several ruins to delve into bounties to collect cities to live in and trolls to kill of course you will need a decent computer for this to run smoothly there are quite a few bugs but never enough to break the immersion hours upon hours of gameplay but as far as the main quest is lacking theres just not enough but all the other things you can do make up for it the possibilities with this game are endless final score 9510
recommended
this game will damage your life socially however it is a must have for anyone who plays video games this game is like a lotr game that is actually amazing and you can do whatever you want the base game itself already has a million more and the mods add about 999999999 other things you can do i highly recommend it edit level 81 still have misc quests and other things to do
recommended
great game countless things to do and amazing character progression you have the most freedom that can be offered by a free roam game

so my original review of the majestic fifth installment of buthesduhs aaa hiking simulator series was ing combat qtes which still holds true oh well you have to deal with it i guess rite some good things have been patched into the game like the infinite dragons can now fly backwards and also the game ctds a lot but its okay if you run 3 save  an autosave files like a bro the game world is huge and there are 57612 quests yeah i counted but there is no c&c to be had you either do quest like they say or u just leave it in your log like a quitter and quitters never win tbh i have a lot of gripes about this game andf i wish it were a lot better than how it turned out and it is incredibly short sighted and frustrating at times but you know i still played it for over 100 hours final rating 1110

i can kill nazeem and heimsker which is the obvious point of this game 1010
recommended
my reaction when i first played skyrim wow not even wow i was speechless i had never played a video game so immersive complex and interesting before the motto of the series you are what you play definitely holds true with the balanced races and playstyles want to play as one of the khajiit but dont want to deal with ridiculously pointless racial boots dont worry it doesnt really affect your gameplay in the long run a legend among rpgs great for longtime fans of the genre or someone completely new to rpgs one of the best games since the n64 1010
recommended
this is a great game 710 it does have some bugs and glitches can be fixed with mods but in general its an awesome game ive spent dozens of hours on this game and i can say if you dont have the game yet youre missing out
recommended
i cant understand how people wouldnt want to play this game i suppose everyone has their own tastes but if you dont like some of the quests or the quality of graphics go to steamworkshop they have grass water snow ember fire and general foliage improvements as well as dozens of quests and new areas items and followers the game in itself is stunning and i should really play it more often edit hahahahahaha its all i play

1010 i have no social life since i play this game

one of my favourite games of all time there is so much to do in this game and the mods also add so much into it making the already amazing game even better than it already is

recommended
after helping return an item to someone you can put a kettle over their head and take the item back despite this they still thank you for returning said item as if you never took it 1010
recommended
one of my favorite games of all time the modding community is great but the game doesnt even need it it is a very immersive game that doesnt restrict you on what to do when to do it if you dont want to do a quest you can simple ignore it you are dovahkiindragonborn you find that out after you fight your first dragon the story is rather short it makes up for it in the countless hours on shenanigans and lollygagging your character seems unrealisticly special throughout the game what i mean by that is you become the top of every class and yet you are still just another adventurer the game is beautiful and just worth your time this game was release 111111 and it still is one of the best games of the decade the game is a must buy even if you dont like rpgs genre i am sure you may come out of your shell and let your inter nerd come out and become all powerful youre going to try to sell me something well i aint interested olda 1010

i yelled at a cow and it died then punched a chicken and suddenly the entire town was trying to kill me later i rode a horse off a cliff killing the horse and i thought myself too until i stood up and brushed the dirt from my pants after that i punched a moose in the balls and it died so that was a thing then i fought a dragon that tokyodrifted into the side of a cliff afterward i shouted at a goat and it fell down the mountain like something out of goat simulator all in all 1210 would dickpunch livestock again

spawned in a lot of lockpicks and gold while in the middle of the room got stuck in the room best game ever
recommended
very guud game this is yes buy u 2 vill 3
recommended
i feel the biggest problem with this game is that the primary gameplay feature is exploration except the world levels up as your character does this includes the loot that you find as you adventure so there are very few opportunities to find something interesting as you explore there are a few locations that yield neat gear like the daedric shrines but overall i find that this is one of the biggest problems with this type of rpg lately you will always be fighting something your level and they will always drop something level appropriate this mechanic dissolves the feeling of tension that should be part of exploring the unknown the story arc also ramps up to epic levels too quickly denying any feeling of having earned any prestige i prefer the slow burn of something like morrowind where your humble beginnings provide context for your climb to becoming a mythical figure i also find that there is too little diversity in the types of spells you can cast and the melee mechanics for a game that deals so much with swordplay the melee feels vague and the crash of combat lacks any sense of feedback the ragdoll physics also feel weightless bodys are merely hollow forms with no mass that sail through the air before sliding down the rugged landscape like greased sleds these issues often turn a serious high fantasy adventure into an unintentional comedy im not saying that this is a bad game by any means in fact i strongly recommend it however when i compare the story arc and game mechanics to something like fallout 3 i feel like alot of the intelligence and pacing was replaced with instant gratification so the game would better appeal to the average joe in closing comparing skyrim to morrowind feels like comparing dragon age origins to baldurs gate 2 one is visually superior but all of that visual polish can not make up for removing the features and stoytelling that provide so much richness to the experience
recommended
best rpg ever but seriously the story line is really good no mather what people say to try and make it sound typical but really its unique and immersive with so much side quests that will keep you playing forever with an amazing modding community the graphics are amazing even if you cant afford to run an enb for this huge open world game and you will never get bored with all the mods avaible an action packed rpg for anyone it is the greatest addition to the elder scrolls series

warning this game will take away months off your life and destroy your social life play at own risk this game is one of the best single player rpgs ever created along with oblivion and morrowind and will offer you 5000 hours of gameplay and community mods guarantee endless replayabilliy value 1110

skyrim is glorious yes it is my first character has logged almost 300 hours into the game on my first playthrough i have to admit that this is the first elder scrolls game i actually sat through from start to finish and attempted to explore every single cave location and gather as many books as possible i love books a lot they are great my entire playthrough was livestreamed on twitchtv and looking back there are a lot of fond memories that i have created during my time spent in skyrim the storyline is enjoyable but over too quickly so being the type of gamer i am i did as many side quests as i could before progressing further into the game that way it felt like a longer journey and it wasnt over so fast thats how i play skyrims visuals are standard at this day and age mods really do kick up the visuals and make them look beautiful with enb hd retextures and added visual features which highlight the fact that its the modding community which have made skyrim what it is today i played skyrim on a vanilla playthrough but i realised i could not do without a couple of mods to fix the game in order to make it playable combat music fix skyrim script extender skryim user interface ie skyui etc anyhow i digress the gameplay is very addictive crafting is enjoyable as is upgrading weapons enchantment is brilliant and exploration is a solid 1010 yes i loved exploring skyrim as the world offers so many new things to see please buy this game its always on sale and definitely worth it the elder scrolls v skyrim along with all of the dlc installed makes this a truly great rpg one which you will keep coming back to play all the time

oh skyrim with your wondrous landscapes and your lovely wildlife and inhabitants skyrim is an excellent game with so much to do become a thief a warrior anything you wanna be you can do all the quests you want or go around each town and slaughter everyone the possibilities are relatively endless my only qualm about the game is the menu system ingame it seems a little clunky at times and annoying having to scroll through heaps of items sometimes just to get one thing luckily there are mods out there for that and i definitely recommend them should you feel the same way

of all the games i play this is the one that always has a cozy fire and a hot cup of steaming chocolate ready to welcome me back its the game that welcomes me with a big friendly smile and open arms even when i keep playing away it says come on home and gives me a nice warm hug it must surely be the best game of all time i dont know if i will ever finish it  but then i dont really want to i have it both on ps3 and here on pc i have restarted it several times playing different characters it has not dated at all in no small part due to a large modding community many hd updates and a friendly community there must be more mods for this game than there are devious politicians if you dont already own it you need to correct the error of your ways immediately or expect to be disciplined you know who you are and you know you want it should you get the legendary edition look into my eyes what do you think just say yes miss

one of the few games you spend 200 hours on to complete only then to decide to start again whilst looking forward to it ive now completed and brought it with all the dlc on ps3 twice xbox360 and most recently pc total usage on all platforms over 1000 hours and still believe its money well spent cant wait for the next installment

this game redefines masterpiece i keep typing and backspacing because i am at a loss for words because trying to describe this game makes me think about how amazing this game is and i cant think of what to say yep its the game of my dreams the ultimate roleplay experience pretty much everything i could wish for in a game never a roleplaying game so very longlasting whether you play as a badass or a simple person existing in the world youll still feel awesome replayability value is extreeeeeeeemely high never a game so beautiful and immersive in every way possible too i always turn the volume way up i cried even on the main menu because it was so amazing and the music and the awesome there is not a more amazing game series than the elder scrolls i have played the first four tes games and this game just sent my fanboy heart and turned it into a viking

skyrim is an amazing game where you can be the dragonborn cast shouts do magic and defeat the neverending waves of evil in the land of skyrim you can do outstanding things like dying repeatedly sitting in your desk chair for hours trying to farm your smithing skill killing innocent people and if you have mods killing children and fapping to naked women what else could you want from an amazing rpg game where youre the ultimate badass to an extent 1010 it was ok

if you like questing in a fantasy world and dont own this game you might be insane say whatever you like about simplified mechanics and action combat skyrim takes you to a world like few games do and is fun from begining to end

skyrim is one of my favorite rpgs of all time you play as a speacial hero known as the dragonborn meaning you have the blood of dragons within you and you can use the speacial words of power as you adventure through the massive land of skyrm fighting monsters bandits and lengandary dragons you learn more about the land and its dark and instresting secrets and story this game is worth any price

hmm khajiit thinks obilvion was better anyhow skyrim is still a great game plus a great modding community compared to the previous 2 games skyrim is a little lacking in quest writing varienty in enemies bright vibrant colour scheeme is gone i prefer the leveling system of say fallout or oblivion more but there is nothing wrong with it works well the main quest is alright was never really that excited about any of the quests in it though and that brings me to my next point many quests are dull in this game usually go get this or go kill that same with most other rpgs but there are no variety in eneimes to go kill or items you go get and the diolauge makes me not even want to help these people the diolauge in this game is something to be desired you will find that most people are  in skyrim most conversations and quest givers other than the main quest or faction quests are just dull and leave me not wanting to help these people except for the reward in comparison to oblivion where i accually wanted to help these quest givers out because the diolauge was written like they needed the help badly in some cases the items you go get are usually just the same model of sword or weapon already in the game like iron or steel etc just with a different name the faction quests are pretty good wish they were longer and more drawn out joining the companions and being harbrindger one week later seems kind of unrealstic and breaks the immersion i tad bit a better system would be like oblvions where you had 2 quest givers in different cities and you had to wait sometime inbetween a quest for both of them and a larger quest from someone higher up in the guild the civil war questline is meh its fun for maybe the first seige but its the same thing over and over again go take this fort and after it is over does not really change anything except jarls a joinable thalmor faction could be really fun as khajiit and high elves are my two favorite races i like the thalmor but both factions play the exact same and its the same fort taking mission over and over again not that great dragons the most wanted feature in a tes game well they are cool at first they will quickly become a nusince as you progress and beat the mainquest when you beat the main quest dragon spawns are at their highest spawning people who walk everywhere will quickly start to fast travel as stopping every 5 minutes to fight the same dragon battle over and over again dragon battles provide little diversity in between dragons except how stong they are or if they breathe fire or ice but they all behave the same i eventually just downloaded passive dragons mod and only faught the dragons i wanted tohad to level design is better in most areas i did not find that the cities to be that fun to explore but thats manly because poeple are dull to talk to the cities look very good and are fine even if some are rather small in caves and other dungeons the alternate exits usually hidden but not hard to find are nice to save from backtracking the caves are sort of linear not going to aruge that its bad the ones in prvious games were also pretty linear dwemer ruins are not linear however they are massive and easy to get lost in i know i have and as the level map leaves something to be desired it is sometimes easy to get lost combat is the concept of all all modern tes games hack and slash my only issue with combat is that it is easy i hardly ever died on my first playthrough on normal its just not hard i know play on master with a more hardcore combat mod and that provides an adquit challenge in some parts on the plus side combat is a lot more balanced for the user if you want to be an all caster or mage guy you can do it if you want to be an archer you can in skyrim in oblvion do to what i think was a more difficult game it was hard to just be a mage or an archer none of my only magic classes ever worked out as they are just to weak when eneimes get close archer can work later on when stealth is up there in level in skyrim i found that magic is more excesible for most spells spells are lacking though there is not near close to amount of spells in skyrim as there was in oblivion not that you could cast many of these spells and morrowind which is sad but they were not really needed stealth is just as overpowered as oblvion haha when your stealh gets past 50 you will hardly ever have to fight again if you so choose in my opinion stealth should be more realistic with higher damage done to enimies but if you shoot someone they should always be on alert and be actvily looking for you since their buddy just got shot they are not going to say must have been hearing things and get back to their normal activites i get that this is not a stealth game it was just a suggestion to make stealth more interesting and challenging leveling leveling is streamlined in skyirm you no longer have skills like willpower strength endurance and the others from oblvion instead you have health staimnia or magickakind of dummed down but it works than you have your skills like one handed two handed archery light armour heavy armour stealth crafting enchanting and there is more every time you level you get one point to spend in any of these trees to unlock new ablities the problem with this system is that some skill trees are just useless i have never put a point in enchanting pickpocketing whatever that persuaion speechcraft one is there is just no use since i have never enchanted an item in skyrim in all my hours of playnig it enchanting could be usefull if combined with spellcrafting spellcrafting is gone from oblivion spellcrafting wasnt very usefll except for creating spells that do nothing to power level your charaters magic ablities but it was fun and a good feature to try to find the right combination of spell the problem with it in oblivion was soul gem limitation though with skyrims better magic system or more powerfull magic system that feature could have shined i am still mixed on the magic takes hands to use for mage charaters i do not have a problem with it but you have to hotkey your shield or the spell so you can go back to blocking if you say were healing yourself which is a little inconvientient on the difficulty i play on but it works amazingly for casting spells the dual wielding spells is just fun and the fact that it makes the spell even more powerfull or combining two spells is a really great feautre dlc the dlc expansions are great they both offer more weapons and armour quests and more eneimes to slay hearthfire is a little lacking but for the price it sales at its not bad its cool building your house ingame but as have used the construction set to build houses or castles before it is not needed for me otherwise good dlc in the way dlc should be released as expansions that add alot of good content not tiny little packs of say a weapon set in summery the lesser diolauge poor quest writing less varitey and other minor gripes makes in my opinion oblivion to be the better game in my opinion enviroments look better in oblivion while not high texture the bright and vibrant colours makes oblivion just more fun for me to explore while not game breaking to skyrim the dark colour scheme that many games today are adopting is just dull with a greyish tint sure mods fix this but this was a review or vanilla game skyrim is still a good game with 300 plus hours i still have not done everything the game and the dlcs have to offer and with close 170 mods installed it adds even more content for me to enjoy and for everyone to enjoy really big thanks to bethesda for continuing the excelent mod support the construction set is great and easy to use and i thank you for that 910

skyrim there thats more than what you need it grab it now really why havent purchased it do it really bro do it really do it
recommended

i cant even count how many hours i spent on just vanilla one on my xbox and then i made the greatest decision to buy it on steam like i should have in the first place and with mods it is all completely new again and the dlc adds a lot of content 1010 would ruin social life again
recommended
a modern classic if you enjoy rpgs at all you owe it to yourself to give this game a try
recommended
phenominal rpg game that takes on a whole new look at the elder scroll series out of ten this game should receive a 99

epic gameplay and highly addictive 1010 d
recommended
the best game that i have bought from the steam store the graphics are just stunning and the gameplay experience was over my expectations to the people that are thinking of buying this gameget it now d good luck
recommended
i love this game its simple beauty lies in the amount of control the player has over how they play skyrim is a different game for each person whether you like to play as a mage a warrior or a thief with seemingly neverending quests and objectives youll never grow bored of this game because even if you cant find anything more to do creating a new character creates an entirely new game and a new series of adventures trust me when i say its really hard to get tired of this game to top it off the graphics are amazing and bethesdas new engine is gentle even to some underpowered systems i cant recommend this game enough
recommended
in total i have played 181 hours on the pc and a good 250 on console and if theres one thing i learned from 300 hours of gameplayit was probably the best 300 hours of time i ever wastedthat is until elder scrolls 6 i meani didnt spoil anything notice all who have read this review are to be terminated under athority of bethesda code of conduct and are to be terminated by bethesda agents within the next 48 hours and yes they have black suits sunglasses and an earpiece and yes they will kick your door down like the bosses they are

recommended
one of the best games ever
recommended
this game is so epic i can do whatever i want to do
recommended
an introduction to rpgs thinking of getting into rpgs this is it if its on sale i strongly suggest you buy it its so addicting that it will take you a long time until you have nothing left to do and even then you can just download mods and additional content for this game the spendinghour ratio is incredibly good only criticism is the amount of bugs make sure you have bug cancelling mods before playing extensive hours of this game
recommended
probably one of my favorite games ever its open world full of magic fights dragons and its beautiful a lot of choices of who you want to be gender and free to do what you wantif you can deal with the consequences of your choices of course the soundtrack makes everything even better
recommended
this game is alot like pokemon you make your way to a city and after a series of trials you are awared lydia your first follower you can level up and get armor for your lydia and let it fight other people you can also trade your lydia for another follower with diffferent skills lydia herself has no skills except almost getting killed several times a quest making her a good distraction adopt a lydia today and she comes with a free set of gear tand ons of room to carry around the crap you want to keep but dont want to have in your inventory
recommended
skyrim does a very good job of giving you a huge world to explore unfortunately the scale might be its greatest downside as well it feels like not enough butter spread over too much bread there are little to no memorable characters besides dragons and there are very few genuinely interesting quests to partake in in my 81 hours spent wandering the lands of skyrim no particular moment truly stands out to me i find this to be rather disappointing after playing oblivion ill never forget my skooma escapades or my quests for the madgod but my memories of yelling at some wrinkly old men on top of a mountain are already fading

elder scrolls v skyrim is by far one of the best games ive ever played this game is well rounded well wrighten and the game play is the best of any elder scrolls game

skyrim may be the game with most glitches that bethesda has done but that doesnt remove its beauty and memorable enviroment my likings of this game wasnt because of the main story nor the sidequests i like it because it gives you the opportunity to choose whatever you want to be and do morrowind did the same and oblivion but they didnt have that detailed enviroment that i crave nostalgic elder scrolls gamers hate skyrim because it is light for the gamer and remains easy i find it easy aswell even on higher difficulties but lets not forget that you want to have power in a world like this and you want to rule if you reach level 20 ingame then you are all set for kings road in skyrim the game offers alot of quests which can give you up to 100 gameplay depending on how fast you are going through them of course thats just quest hours aswell when i play i like to run around and discover the world blindly i have played through the game 2 times and now i am on my third walkthrough i have tried going mage and warrior and now i am focusing archery which is extremely good and every walkthrough has been an adventure even though i have seen it all before i have approximately 190 hours on the game if you want that beauty and peace in a game then you should get skyrim it will rock your world if you are an oldschool gamer that likes challenge and hard work to get things done i recommend morrowindoblivion although i didnt find oblivion that challenging its definately more challenging than skyrim and it also has the best dlc ever created according to myself shivering isles where you get to met the prince of madness sheogorath of course i recommend all 3 games if you are a variety gamer but mostly oblivion and skyrim since i am a relaxed gamer that doesnt wanna do too much in order to get my reputation in a game  hope this review can help you on your purchase have a good day
recommended
if u want a game with great graphics intense story telling if you choose too a massive amount of side quests slay massive monsters or cause trouble among castles a character completely unique and a massive open world map for you then this is the game

the elder scrolss v skyrimoh boythis here ladies and gents is the game you buy and play if you want to lock yourself up in a room for 267 hours worth of you life dedicated to doing all the crap in this fantasticly fantasmic world of elves and orcs and intelligent walking dinosaurs skyrim is big reallybig and thats not just accounting for the world map im talking about the quests weapons skills mods very important btw once you use mods you can never go back to vanilla skyrim again and pretty much everything the game has to offer is downright amazing but i do have a few nickpicks dont get me wrong though reader of my little review here skyrim is my favorite in the series of the elder scrolls but that might be because its the only es i have ever played in my life o_o anyway the game does suffer from some things here and there the modloader is great in all but the major problem i have with it is that it doesnt tell you what mods are conflicting or not so youll be playing the game and it just closes for no reason if theres a setting that you can adjust so you can see the conflicting mods then plz send me a pm and regard my last statement as irrelevent skyrim also suffers from an extreme amount of what i like to call grey effect what does this mean it means skyrim looks very bland and washed out nothing really stands out unless you use mods like increased saturation boost or increased contrast boost and other types of shader mods another thing i have a nick pick with is that fact that at the end of the game the cool armor you once wore like nightingale shroud armor thiefs guild etc become incredibly inferior to the dragon versions imho i really dont like the look of the dragon armors they give myself of a sense of character it makes my interesting dragonborn not so interesting the last topic i have to cover is mages ihatemagespretty much one hit kills once you reach level 28 and above if you dont have like level 80 enchanting so you can have resistances they are broken and the player version of a mage is just not worth it its just not worth it but it does add a bit of challenge fun here and there thats my review hope you enjoyed it i definitley recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of open world games and rpgs peace
recommended
i have never loved a game or played a game as much as skyrim it is by far the best game that has ever been made and will give you an almost endless amount of content and fun

i believe that the elder scrolls skyrim is one of the best games ive ever played this game has an unlimited amount of detail fun and story even more counting the dlc and the steam workshop this game can easily top many games that will be made in the future that are supposedly more advanced whenever a new open world rpg is released they just do the same thing that skyrim does but with less detail i hope the next sequels of the elder scrolls franchise will maintain the fantastic feel as the one you get playin skyrim
recommended
im sure you know why im recommending this
recommended
well first of all this is a review meaning its my personal subjective opinion of this game so please keep that in mind before attempting to make a negative comment with bad language thanks second to mention this game is absolutely overrated and overhyped the good  even on my notsoleetmachine this game runs pretty good and solid only crashed twice in 50 hours of gameplay  the game itself which will serve an insane amount of play hours  the amount of details books to read and things to discover is insane  the replayability dozens if not hundreds or more combinations to build your character  for any price below 15 euro its worth every penny  the voice acting and overall presentation is superb the bad  game seems sometimes a bit unpolished and clunky but only sometimes i play with the help of the uesp wiki which states that a lot of quest can be stuck because of bugs i personally havent encountered so far any of those though the ugly and the things that kinda ruins it  your actions in skyrim dont seem to affect anything in any way no matter what fraction you choose youll end up doing all the quests more to that in the following point get mediocre equipment and thats it i hoped to be in the end an overpowered thief  assassin after completing the quests from the thieves guild and the dark brotherhood nada you dont even get great equipment or stuff you even can join fractions which are hostile to each other and nobody seems to bother killing everything or doing anything nothing seems to change rpg no more like a game with endless possibilites only that nothing matters  the quests are very repetitive and purposely serve to to prolong gameplay time you always have to for example find a item at the complete other side of the map and your actions are not connected meaning your actions in skyrim dont matter and the quests are absolutely dull for example to get a final achievement for the thieves guild you have to do 125  quests and every single one of them is the same steal a thing place a stolen thing change numbers in a book after stealing 20 times in a row the same object you kinda loose it no pun intended  the leveling system is way to prolonged i dont mind spending a lot of hours in a game especially a rpg but come on one has to spent a whole eternity to actually become a badass character in even one skill by the time youre for example a 100 level marskman youve already finished all the fractions youre interested in  the necessity of mods i dont know what stuff the developers smoked during testing but the interface of this game is probably the definitively worst i have ever encountered even after installing the mod skyui its horrible and slow as hell absolutely horrible like i mentioned in the beginning this game is completely overhyped and overrated in every aspect in conclusion this game tries to have and be anything but isnt its like jack of all trades master of none still if you have 15 bucks left buy it
recommended
theres not a game id rather play until i die than skyrim its simply glorious
recommended
its skyrim why wouldnt you get it you can make it into whatever game you want with mods the only reason not to get it is if you do not have some free time to spend in tamriel cause you will be there a while
recommended
how does one review a game that never ends gameplay wise the game is tightly designed and very effective but it is not perfect the plotlines are hit or miss there are some real gems in characters here you have the jarls each of which is well developed the guild heads are just as wellif not better however some characters are simply dull or annoying by the aforementioned information you may think this a mediocre rpg oh you could not be more wrong when you enter the game you enter a new world this game is truly an accomplishment in openworld storytelling the different reigons of the province all feel different from swampy hjallmarch to the colorful forests of the reach the game presents you with an intersting world to explore with interesting dynamics with regards to the imperialleaning western reigon and the nordicleaning eastern reigon to give you an example we can look at whiterun the center of the games action in its main questline you have a king who cant decide which side of a war to join but who wants to do right by his people you have an aspiring shopkeeper a landowner who needs an axe to the skull a shopkeeper who only wants to care for her daughter two brothers running a tavern and a shop a healer a evangelical preacher of an illegal religon a smith who wants to prove herself and others these characters have personality it is a step up from oblivions inconsequential npcs the game looks great and has its own artistic style which works well as other reviewers have said the open world is perfectly crafted down to the troll who killed your horse it is not a perfect game the civil war and dragon questlines are lackluster and the magic system is lacking a large selection of spells and any intersting flavor the combat can be clunky at times is the game good yes is it the messianic game no should you buy it yes oh and also mod the hell out of this game
recommended
skyrim is a great game for anyone who enjoys fantasy rpgs with a huge open world containing hundreds of locations skyrim offers hundreds of hours of gameplay to dedicated players who can choose how to explore the world as they develop a character to match their playstyle using any combination of the games diverse skill trees with a decent storyline good rpg gameplay and a lot of customization there isnt a lot to comlplain about in skyrim of course for those who do find something to complain about the steam workshop has plenty of usercreated mods that can change almost any aspect of the game
recommended
i love skyrim it is one of the main reasons i transitioned to pc it runs so much smoother cleaner and there is just so much more to do there is so much more detail than 360 can make my eyes were burnt by the detail my eyes are not conditioned to graphics like you can get in skyrim the storyline is awesome especially if you either know or learn about the lore i can literally play non stop for a day maybe two sleep then wanna come back to immerse again probably one of if not my favorite game ive put in more than 300 hours of gameplay on the 360 im betting between mods easter eggs and discovering new stuff or stuff i missed ill exceed that now i would highly recomend this game to anyone with similar interests the controller compatability is making the transition to pc alot easier too
recommended
if you like chivalry then you should like this skyrim takes place in the fantasy world of well skyrim you can customize you character and have specific skills like alchemy you can make potions or theft pickpocketing sneaking lockpicking there is a engrossing story with lifelike characters and many armor and weapons for you to customize although you can make one mess up that can have a big impact that will make you wanthave to make a new game but other than that this is a very good choice for something to buy i give this game a 455
recommended
its honestly hard to describe how amazing this game is from the moment you end the first mission you are given the freedom to go anywhere and do anything want to go and fight in a civil war want to fell dragons in epic possibly an overstatement battles want to spawn a thousand wheels of cheese in someones bedroom and watch as they blankly stare at you while they wade through an ocean of dairy products to their bed you can do all of this and more in skyrim combined with the epic landscape immersive gameplay and fantastic attention to detail bethesda studios pay to their games its hard to overstate how much i love this game 1010

recommended
more fun than a barrel of anything really
recommended
addictive engaging a depth that will rarely be rivaled skyrim delivers a journey unlike most found in modern rpgs an ability to go where you want when you want and more importantly how you want with modding at the forefront of the game it retains a freshness that stays long after others have fallen by the wayside spend time with skyrim and youll find out what everyone else has so far theres not enough time for both skyrim and other responsibilities but those other responsibilities can wait a few more minutes
recommended
within an hour of starting skyrim id decided this was the pinnacle of the elder scrolls series 144 hours in im not so sure anymore there are diminishing returns in the game as the quests become sparse and your character becomes an unkillable god that can strike enemies down with a single blow morrowind for all its flaws felt so much larger and more open somehow maybe im just older or maybe all the locations and journal entries and achievements arent quite the same as being forced to roam a giant world and make your way with no knowledge of what was to come or what was left regardless its still one of the greatest games of alltime and i dont think anyone will consider their time wasted after they wander the hills and mountains of skyrim
recommended
i recommend this game
recommended
one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences i have had the base game is amazing enough though the main quest is rather short and gets less exciting every time you start a new game the dlcs add quite a bit of gameplay and new content and dont forget about the tens of thousands of mods to choose from to further enhance the game it removes many of the spells that were in morrowind and oblivion but replaces them with new powers and shouts there is no acrobatics skill so jumping height is very limited but replaces it with a sprinting function many things are missing from previous titles character development but there are mods to remedy this after many hours of playing skyrim youll learn that many of the games wondrous encounters npcs and environments towns cities dungeons etc start to taste a bit sour and get repetitive and boring but with mods in tow youll never have a bad experience while playing this game skyrim is an amazing game but loses much of its robust taste with every playthrough and soon becomes saccharine but with the 30000 mods available to you and the official dlcs this game will never get old or lose any of its grizzly wonderfulness that you experience the first time around allinall skyrim with lots of mods installed is a must buy for any lover of this game style highly recommended and worth every penny
recommended
this game is hands down the best game ever
recommended
excellent game with many thing to do besides main story line there are many beautiful side stories in game you can perform quests collect weapons armors and other things and finally try mods from other players i spent many hours playing this game and all was full of quality fun

recommended
this is the best game that ive played yet it takes you back to medieval times when people fight using swords and not guns the main story is about dragons who got resurrected and they want to conquer skyrim many people asked can you beat this game you cant only the main story takes 12 weeks to complete and therere tons of side quests available this game too can be dangerously addictive the soundtrack is amazing the graphics are great and even low end pcs can play the game if youre bored try installing mods it will cure your boredom and there are plenty of awesome & crazy mods out there i would really recommend it 1010

probably one of the weaker 3d elderscrolls games though i didnt get to play oblivion enough to compare it to that its not bad just not as good as morrowind and oblivion felt a little better id give it a go if you can get it for $750 on a daily deal in one of the larger steam sales id also recommend modding it as it makes th experience better

if you need a review to tell you to get this game this is it i started on xbox then moved to pc skyrim is well too much awesome to put in words it is a masterpiece on its own and one continually in the making the reason i say it is continually is the modding community the modding community has added so much replay value to an already amazing game for example the unofficial skyrim patch is a community effort to make all of the official skyrim and dlc bugfree and it has fixed tens of thousands of things not to mention all the mod choices out there you can have ones that change gameplay add spells armour weapons houses add entirely new stories and quest lines make the game 4x the quality of the hd dlc or help you run it on an older machine there are simply too many to mention here but if you are looking for something chances are there is already a mod out there for it as for dlc they are all excellent i recommend them all but i especially have a love for dawnguard probably because it was the first i owned
recommended
fus ro da this is the best game i have ever played thousands of times better than any large scale mmorpg such as world of warcraftthe only thing this game is missing is a multiplayer system and this game is a perfect unbeatable one hopefully when the elder scrolls online comes outmy hopes will come true
recommended
a great game but you dont need vino to tell you that come on dude what are you doing reading my review of skyrim go out and do something with your life or play skyrim thats what im doing

recommended
the most finest entry in the elder scrolls series the mods are very very fun to  around with id highly reccomend this game to any elder scrolls or rpg fan but admit you bought it already
recommended
this game is so good that whilst playing it i prolapsed
recommended
you could play this game for 100s of hours and still have stuff to do game is pretty much infinite with mods definitley one of my favorite games
recommended
cant believe i still havent recommended it it is not morrowind you are not going to draw your own map write your own little guidebook get lost but you are going to have a lot of fun with it unlimited ammount of mods speak for itself skyrim still has over 50k different players a day on steam that is probably highest number of singleplayer game played at this very moment unbeaten for 2 years straight no other single player game from 2006 can compare noone will prove me wrong especially not biofinished it in 10 hours and uninstalledshock infinite which couldnt even beat skyrim on release day
recommended
theyve taken the series to a new high the only gripe is the menu system is touchy at times clearly made for consoles however that said its fantastic things that worked for them in fallout 3 have made their way over and the game we know and love is back bigger badder and full of dragons
recommended
what more needs to be said its elder scrolls
recommended
holy  my  fell off 910ign
recommended
i just have three litlle words about this game  buy this game thats really all i have to say about the game
recommended
okkkk cant believe that i didnt alredy made recomend to play for skyrim i mean it is darn elder scrolls game if you like rpg and if you like felling to have shivers down your back when you get dragon down game gives you total freedom to do what you wanna do and to approach quests way you like you can convince a fella to stop stealing from the girl or you can kill him orrr you can kill the girl and rob her of all her gold choice is yours question is which choice you will make
recommended
provides hours of fun great game alone or with workshop mods
recommended
my personal game of 2011  an absolute blissful experience now i can experience it on pc with a plethora of mods i even wrote a few words about it once upon a time just google half hearted gamer a tale about a fox
recommended
skyrim is a great game with excellent graphics and story mode despite all of its wonderful glitches it is still a very easy and smooth game to roleplay
recommended
this game is so addictive if playing with mods mod make me wanna play againagain and again many mod that will make this game perfect maybe best game forever for me
recommended
i have recommended this game because it is indeed a fun game i sank hours into it on my xbox and at least one hundred more with mods and the like on pc i do also however advise that if you are a fan of the elder scrolls past games that you consider not buying or at least relying heavily on mods after you do buy this game this game is not really for past tes fans it does what it does well enough which is to throw you into the familiar world of vikingland  i mean uh skyrim  and let you do whatever the hell you please whether that be kill hordes of bandits or search for treasure but as ive said this game is not for tes fans past it is for the new age of gamers who just want to play a game and not have a worry in the world this is not so much an rpg as it is an action game with some slight focus on rpg elements like crafting and raising and acquiring skills there are quests yes but they are repetitive there is a story but it is very basic you wouldnt think to look at it but skyrim is in its own newer category of semirpgs and therein lies the problem the elder scrolls was always about being who you wanted creating a deep character with an interesting story having awesome quests to do and plenty of unique treasures to be uncovered sadly depth is all but gone in this game its paperthin at best there are mods for that but you shouldnt have to use mods to add something so standard to rpgs to this game combat is completely reliant on your skill not your characters like in previous games the perks make a difference only much later if you have any kind of ranged damage available to you you win essentially that is how combat works if my archery skill actually mattered i would slowly begin to see an increase in how much weight i could put into my shots or maybe higher chances to cause bleeding effects with my arrows you see my point perks eliminate the purpose of your characters actual skill they do add a sense of bettering yourself but at what cost simplifying combat and removing depth in the sense of your characters skills actually making a tiny difference in terms of gameplay character development forget about it all characters in skyrim are essentially copypasted npcs and boy are they generic sexy nord females abound oh yeah and tons of guards that say the same things to you with subpar voice acting no less granted some features such as the option to marry are welcomed but they do not fill the void that most tes fans might be looking for what this game does have going for it though is exploration and discovery it feels good to explore the map and if you want the best reward dont fast travel it seriously ruins any explorative tendencies in the game but yes it does feel good to explore and discovering dungeons and caves is really fun at times if only all the dungeons didnt feel the same it would be even better while i may have many gripes with the game it is enjoyable if you want hours of mindless adventuring and hordes of mods to improve the experience overall then get the game if that isnt what you want and you want the original elder scrolls experience than you probably already have that with morrowind or oblivion tldr this is a good game but it is not a good rpg recommended to adventuring fans not recommended for elder scrolls fans that want the experience they love
recommended
why are you still reading this review and not buying this game
recommended
i killed myself with a cooking pot and a cart of cheese 1010 would do again
recommended
if there was a option to recommend to someone to buy a game straight away and say it would be a must have in their libary it would be this game just buy it
recommended
vanilla skyrim is great and all but download some mods that overhaul graphics combat ai difficulty and atmosphere along with some new quests to play through and its almost like a completely different game and youll have one hell of a time playing it
recommended
best game ever d i could play this for several hours without stop as a matter of fact i already did p 
recommended
during my first run through skyrim i played as an argonian battle mage i know this seems strange but things were going well when i played the main quest diplomatic immunity and i went to the thalmor embassy i forgot armor i was a naked argonian fighting mages who used frost spells as you can imagine i was unable to continue and i had no saves before i gave my gear to malborn i also forgot i was a werewolf lel this frustrated me to the point where i was up late one night contemplating of greater things my final decision was to delete my character forever i was crushed that this was the only way so i had a huge falling out with skyrim i started playing other games such as call of duty call of duty was filling the whole in my emotional roof that skyrim had left but there was still a leak i realized that skyrim was always there for me through thick and thin we were a team thats when i rushed to the store bought a new copy of skyrim for myself and 50 others to give out to strangers on the street now i am a happy man do yourself a favor buy this game and buy a second copy to give to your future spouse so when you inevitably divorce them to be with skyrim they too can have a copy to love and cherish happy thanksgiving everyone
recommended
played about 150 hours on ps3 before buying legendary from steam still have not grown tired or touched the dlc content a superior game also mods greatly increase the lifetime
recommended
this game is amazing even if it came out in 2011 it is one of the best games i have ever played
recommended
this game is super good if you likelove rpgs or the other elder scrolls games on its own it has hours of content with the dlc it has even more hours with mods it has an infinite amount of time
recommended
amazing game whole lot to do you will never get done with this game amazing graphics and gameplay mods are awesome too 1010
recommended
i role play as a butter with porn mods
recommended
love this game i stopped playing it though because of my pcs graphic cardits crap just get the game and slay the dragon
recommended
by far the best out of the elder scrolls series it has so much to offer and will leave you occuiped for hours on end the graphics coupled with the excellent combat system switching between physical damage and magic seamlessly brings the player to a new level of rpging on top of a main storyline the side quests and stories have a lot to offer especially to those who are veterans of the series theres a reason elder scrolls game get goty go get it
recommended
great game and if you find it getting boringsteam workshop
recommended
this game is my life
recommended
its the first bethesda game that actually a piece of the cake the game has amazing stories with good and bad missions and long gameplay the graphics is ok there are games that has way better graphics awesome and easy system huge openworld which is somewhere good somewhere boring or even be bad recommended only for rpg fans 9510 
recommended
the game by itself is good a little buggy but sets the bar for open world adventure the real draw here is the modding potiential i have close to 1000hrs in skyrim over multiple playthroughs testing and playing with different mods that enhance and augment the skyrim experience mods add so much to this game that i dont know how to accurately convey it in one small review great game hours of fun would buy again
recommended
o_o says lots of time to play if so this is the game for you
recommended
get this game really good and really cool
recommended
beast game
recommended
great game especially with mods dlc is pretty good too but sometimes boring but this game is definitely a good investment
recommended
amazing game tons of content
recommended
one of the most indepth visually stunning fantasy rpgs i have ever played if you love fantasy rpgs like i do you cant go wrong with this game
recommended
if you have a console and think about getting this game on consoledontthe game on the console is the alpha version of the gamethe game on pc is where its all at you have a ton of mods to chose from and your game will look 10 times better than it does on consoleor it will looke like a completely new gamewith changed climatelandscapes and whatever you want to do to the game
recommended
its good but most of the mods are terrible garbage too much garbage loot in these games too
recommended
just epic game gameplay music crafting building story\multithreading dialogues mods there is no duch thing that you cant do in this game 10\10
recommended
an exceptional game i love it and cannot recommend it enough
recommended
its very rare to find people that dislike this game not trying to sound hush but if you dislike a true master art piece like this then you most likely have bad taste in games what ever you dislike about this the game will most likely have 70% of mods to fix your problem in this what not to like in this freedom of exploring quest treasure hunting anything you want but this is game is not about doing what you want but living a life as a medieval style chracteri will admit this game had a tons of bugs needed to be fix and still have some but not much to be notice any more but other thne that this game is almost perfect this game is just to impossiable to hate and dislike try it out download mods and enjoy for you people that dislike it try giving it out shout to it agian with the dlc and mods you may see that its not bad as u think it is
recommended
skyrim is a very indepth rpg game that you can spend hundreds of hours on and still have content left to complete if youre looking to put a lot of time and effort if you want into a game then i would definitely suggest skyrim there are so many other things you can do which arent part of the main quest line even when you have finished the first quest line you are introduced to you are nowhere near finishing the game thats one of the main things i love about it skyrim will always offer you something new to do and when you get to the point of wanting more thats when you can choose to mod your game the modding community for skyrim is very large if you dont like something about the game chances are theres a mod to change it if you feel like things are missing from the game then theres probably a mod to add it too you can pick and choose from mods to make the game how you want it to be the steam workshop makes it easy to mod your game with minimal effort involved if you want a single player game that you can lose yourself in pick this one in my opinion you could never play this game and regret it pretty much the best rpg game out there
recommended
well what to say this is a legend already it is somewhat old now but the good story is never old you know  just like in bioshock  you will want to know the end of the tail and the world will turn your imagination on minor bugs are met but they do not spoil the point i really liked this one
recommended
this game is worth the buy i play it non stop pretty much
recommended
the best game of my life fus ro dah
recommended
very nice game
recommended
just amazing
recommended
i love this game
recommended
lots of things to do
recommended
i love this game bethesda did a nice job with hardly any bad bugs one of my faverite things to do is launch lydia off high hrothgar and find her still alive this fps rpg is great for adventureingfighting and getting sent flying by giants i much perfer to play this game on pc because the loading is much shorter than on ps3 or xbox 360
recommended
alongside with dragon ageorigins definitely the best games for meif i had to choose one game to keep on my pc and delete everything elseskyrim is my choiceno doubt
recommended
hands down the biggest baddest dungeon crawlinest elder scrolls game to date between modding and the steam workshop the game has been expanded to include a rediculous amount of updrades to the lighting textures ai npcs models weapons ui and some even add entirely new locations and quests for hours of extra gameplay a must have for anyone who enjoys rpgs
recommended
you either die a hero or you play long enough to see yourself become the villain 1010
recommended
played skyrim before on console sucked complete as and i hated it played it on pc once and i fell in love definitely pc game over everything im sure most agree
recommended
you already know this is a great game why are you looking at reviews stupid
recommended
knerw heres the thing i am not a professional reviewer ore werry good at the engrush couse after all i am speaking it as my 3 language so please just listen to what i have to say and not bash it couse of how it is told so skyrim is a awesome game that is actually allget itknerw
recommended
400 hours have gone by over the past 3 years yet this game still drags me in why over 600 quests completed many of which include the neverending radiant quests and ive been loving every second of it the latest installment to the tes legacy is not just a game it is a way of life you dont just run around killing things there is a strategy to every thrust a consequence to every cast and a reward far beyond that of your regular games a reward that you know youre actually making a difference and youre being a part of it all as this splendid world comes to life now if that alone isnt enough the modding support for the game will blow your mind away ive literally transformed the game from a crysis 2 whose graphics fidelity was splendid mind you to that of a wannabe crysis 3 with jawdropping reality shading aa and lod tweaks the possibilities are endless and if youre anything like me youll probably spend 100 hours on modding alone i really couldnt recommend any other game that is more deserving of being played than skyrim so do yourself a favour and pick it up asap

as someone who has grown up with elder scrolls from morrowind on the xbox and oblivion being my reason to buy a xbox 360 skyrim did not disappoint skyrim improves on almost everything that oblivion brought to the table even if some mehanics are dumbed down the environments are absolutely gorgeous with huge open landscapes to explore the dungeons are all unique and have their own charms to all of them there are many cities and villages to explore with different stories and adventures to discover in each one just walking between towns feels like an epic adventure skyrim is the best open world rpg to date in my opinion with the steam work shop you can add mods that makes the game even better which makes it worth it if you already have the game on the consoles like i do the difficulty can be adjusted at anytime for all types of players from hardened rpg players to people new to games in general this is a game for everyone except children of course my only real complaint is the story doesnt feel as epic and important as the last elder scrolls games the dragons seem intimidating but they are no real threat to you or the people of skyrim even though they constantly tell you how dangerous dragons are after beating the main story of oblivion you felt like a true hero and even got a staue built for you in skyrim they pretty much treat you the same way if you hadnt saved the world thats right no staue at the end sorry for spoilers p but overall its great experience 9510 a must buy
recommended
three words buy this game great plot great characters great gameplay and the game is huge
recommended
simply epic
recommended
a game that never ends
recommended
the best rpg ever made you better buy this or die
recommended
this game provides so many hours of gameplay that it is ridiculous it definitely has a great replay value you can decide what kind of character you want to be
recommended
the vanilla game is enjoyable but i cannot recommend it as it is nothing compared to the game where you employ mods for those out there that either fear or detest the lorebreaking aspect of mods im not asking you to download a school uniform or a xxxxxl bust size for your character im asking you to look at the effort put in by the community of modders who strive to make the game a more enjoyable experience for all like skyui or falskaar
recommended
this is the best game eva omggggg i luf it <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

four things dual wield weapons fight dragons shoot lasers from both hands fus ro dah ps this is pc version so mod this  or gtfo
recommended
fantastic open world rpg best in the elder scrolls series so far all gamers should play skyrim and thats a scientific fact
recommended
the elder scrolls v skyrim has given me more pleasure in playing a game than any other game has given me as soon as you hit start new game the graphics blow you away even the loading screen with alduin sitting on the word wall looks amazing the dialogue matches them mouth movements which is alway a plus and the voice acting is suberb even though you tend to hear different characters with the same voice as i said the graphics of this game are like no other you will see in a game made in 2011 however the one critique i have is the water textures as many a time i have come across patches of water that is invisible but the majority of the game is spent on land so that tends to not affect your gameplay the story is good but sometimes it lacks a certain quality that you tend to notice the one major problem i have with the game is the spoliers battle for whiterun it is suppossed to be a large scale seige but it turns out to be 20 stormcloaks charging at 30 imperials the battle at either solitude or windhelm is only slightly better despite those problems i believe that skyrim deserves the title of 20112012 game of the year it extensive lore its hours of leveling its interesting someties story lines and its massive replay value make this game one of the best role playing games made you can easily sink 200 hours into your first playthrough without even finishing the main story line
recommended
i recommend this game
recommended
i liked it you swing swords you sling spells you fire arrows you yell shouts i dunno it was a pretty good generic fantasy type sandbox thing couldnt really hold my attention i liked the water and the waterfalls and the world and the villages and some other things i thought that claw quest was pretty neat you know the one 510
recommended
there simply hasnt been a game as anticipated as tes v skyrim the latest entry in the 17 year old series skyrim brings the same free form rpg formula the series is known for and brings it into current generation hardware skyrim is more than a graphical upgrade though by removing the character stats and classes skyrim allows true freedom in play style by allowing characters to form based on what actions the player does the most any skillup contributes to level progression and a perk system allows players to excel at skills and learn new abilties without the need for stats or classes couple this with a world with so much to do and see and its easy to see why this game is so loved
recommended
i enjoyed this game untill i had to fight the unicorns cows were also overpowered and the god damn potato knights one hit me all the time i was a cabbage wizard aswell also when i used home teleport i was teleported to runescape and i got stuck there
recommended
enjoy this game very much
recommended
awesome game i really liked it
recommended
buy the game and stop reading this

you can play this game your way its like burger king but without the calories venture forth as the mighty dragonborn crushing your enemies though use of powerful magics daedric artifacts and devastating shouts or jump on peoples dinner tables and make them beat each other up while you steal their stuff though advanced gameplay mechanics you will be able to advance your numerous skills so as to perform amazing feats never before seen to the folk of skyrim advance your destruction skill and repeatedly stunlock your enemies by pressing both mouse buttons with the same spell forever advance your sneak skill and steal peoples pants as they walk down the street advance your smithing and alchemy skills and become almost literally invinvible through use of a complex process that includes potions enchanting and exploits you will encounter a wide variety of intresting characters in your travels in the newest part of tamriel including cat people lizard people racist elves drunk people racist nords bandits assassins murderers cultists drug dealers corrupt bureaucrats and more defeat powerful bosses like dead people magic dead people dead people with swords people that make dead people serve them a dragon that makes other dragons not dead more dead people dead people with shouting powers flying magic dead people with masks flying magic dead people without masks dead people without skin dead people with skin vampires that count as undead even though they never were dead in the first place to name a few this game comes with three dlcs dragonborn hearthfire and dawnguard which add the ability to fight the champion of cthul er i mean hent no oh yeah hermaeus mora the first dragonborn the ability to get more houses which are occasionally attacked by bandits who kidnap your spouse because you can only build them in the middle of nowhere and the ability to renact your favorite scenes of twilight but with more vampire huntinghuman killing and less creepy romance overall i highly recommend this game now if youll excuse me i need to go get some burger king
recommended
just get itu know u want to 
recommended
totally recommend great atmosphere advanced character buildings and also moddable some gliches thats all
recommended
just the best ing game
recommended
nice game one of the best so far but seriusly you have to buy the legendary edition you wont regret it
recommended
an excellent one player game challenging at all difficulty levels strategy requirements are impeckable and the art work invested in the environment is absolutely awesome
recommended
good for around 20 hours and then you get bored and start modding it modding becomes a better part of the game play about with mods for more hours than you actually played the quest lines screenshot everything break your game with mods play another game
recommended
this game on pc best choice i ever made love this game and love the modding community
recommended
while morrowind will always ba my favorite skyrim nearly took that place with captivating gameplay amazing graphics and a wonderful community
recommended
hundreds and hundreds of hours can be put in that game and it will still be amazingly fun to play well worth the bucks
recommended
1110 enough said  httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid257570807

a fantastic game although the previous patches have fixed a lot of bugs in this game i still recommend people use 3rd party mods to fix the bugs that havent been patched up yet
recommended
my favorite part is raising the baby dragons and using combos during the lydia sex scene
recommended
playing skyrim by the fire relaxes my soul
recommended
good game but graphics needs work
recommended
one of the best games to date elder scrolls v is fun for any gamer whether you are a fan of the elder scroll series or not
recommended
i heard someone call this a mile wide and an inch deep once and thats a perfect way to describe it bethesda is utterly amazing at building worlds but when it comes to putting quests and characters in those worlds they fail miserably take the civil war for instance skyrim is caught between the empire the good guys and the stormcloaks idiots one and all and the bad guys if they win the real big bads the aldmeri dominion who are basically magical nazi elves get one step closer to wiping out humanity altogether you can win the civil war for one side or another and nothing happens sure some guards change pants and maybe two or three npcs say a sliiiiiightly different thing now but thats it oh and you win the civil war by doing a fetch quest and then going to a city and killing waves of utterly identical faceless soldiers four or five times i guess what im saying here is theres no replay value at all theres one way to do something and thats it no choosing to do it a different way later in another playthrough because there is no other way oh and if you care about sane coherent plots do not buy dawnguard the only possible way that could make sense is if your character literally becomes temporarily  full on window licking wearing inflatable waterwings in the bath so you dont drown 
recommended
its a great game lots of bugs but when you get past that there is a fantasy world to explore
recommended
this game is good
recommended
lets see skyrim what can i say for a review about that game called skyrim well now looking on it i feel my situation explains it pretty well as i write this the time is 230 am 2 days after i got it and i already have 12 hours on this and as i explore the world and view its life in every corner i know i have only scratched the surface on the game what can i say i love the arnold schwarzenaeger voice for the guards
recommended
skyrim is good the end
recommended
one epic game must buy why fun with  without mods lores are always surprices random questions often intriguing mostly happen during daily routine on the way to a dungeon  keep  dwemer ruins  caves dragons just awesome even after world eater defeated  therere still much more to be explored definitely a worthy one for achievement hunters  like myself as one

the best game that i have bought from the steam store the graphics are just stunning and the gameplay experience was over my expectations to the people that are thinking of buying this gameget it now d good luck
recommended
i love this game its simple beauty lies in the amount of control the player has over how they play skyrim is a different game for each person whether you like to play as a mage a warrior or a thief with seemingly neverending quests and objectives youll never grow bored of this game because even if you cant find anything more to do creating a new character creates an entirely new game and a new series of adventures trust me when i say its really hard to get tired of this game to top it off the graphics are amazing and bethesdas new engine is gentle even to some underpowered systems i cant recommend this game enough
recommended
in total i have played 181 hours on the pc and a good 250 on console and if theres one thing i learned from 300 hours of gameplayit was probably the best 300 hours of time i ever wastedthat is until elder scrolls 6 i meani didnt spoil anything notice all who have read this review are to be terminated under athority of bethesda code of conduct and are to be terminated by bethesda agents within the next 48 hours and yes they have black suits sunglasses and an earpiece and yes they will kick your door down like the bosses they are

recommended
i have enjoyed this game for years on console only to be blow away by the community support and mods this game supports a purchase i wont regret
recommended
man is it atmospheric keep your eye on the clock because the hours will slip away my only qualms in an otherwise incredible game  can get repetitive as most interiors are generally the same just rearranged  little variation in voice dialogue  the difficulty settings handicap the player rather than make the ai more skillful or strategic would have loved  greater ability to change the storygameplay based on the decisions you makedont make icing on the cake  the score its become one of my all time favourite sountracks 810

enjoyed this game way too much
recommended
dont get me wrong skyrim is great an epic rpg fantasy game but i gotta say im a huge fan of the elder scroll series and this one just dont give me that elder scrolls feeling i can surely tell theres a good amount of people who played this and never even heard of oblivion go play oblivion and then go back to this and you will know what youve missed good game but nothinig compared to oblivion or morrowind still a great game 810
recommended
probably one of the greatest rpg games you will play get it because of this and also because workshop and nexus
recommended
this is a game that i always seem to be able to get back into after years of playing after making the switch from console to pc it was one of the first games i wanted to buy again it has great replay value though it is a little buggy from time to time the glitches often just make me laugh and are easily fixable if they get in the way of gameplay with the use of some commands i can waste hours just messing around or actually play the game seriously and that it the beauty of most openworld games overall a great game
recommended
no one should have to convince you to get skyrim you should already have skyrim
recommended
awesome game love it
recommended
skyrim is the one of the best games to play able to capture the attention of any that play it difficult to be fun but not difficult to be annoying plenty of quests to do as well as just explore the massive expanse that is the world of skyrim makeing the deal of buying the game sweeter working with steam workshop allows you to create a whole new world through the power of mods great game if get it on sale even better
recommended
i dont know what to say but this game is good
recommended
one of the best games i have tried
recommended
yet another great game to add to the elder scrolls series elder scrolls v skyrim is even more action packed than the previous games with many features added you can play anyway you want assassin mage warrior etc have countless hours of fun with side quests guilds dlc or the main story i would highly recommed this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs or even if its your first one
recommended
i originally played this game on a playstation 3 console right after its release due to my pc not being able to handle it after putting up with numerous bugsglitches i shelved the game completely bought it to start playing again on pc and its so much better helps that i am a fan of games of this genre need to finish this title but so far its amazing a must play for anyone
recommended
you use swords and chop bad guys 1010
recommended
so much skyrim worth it to skyrim some more
recommended
what more could i possibly add about this game great adventure great game play expansive world and a seemingly endless mod community if you see it go on sale you should probably pick it up because i guarantee at least 200 hours in game play and thats just the beginning
recommended
loads of bugs and tons of crashes 1010
recommended
this game is worth the buy i play it non stop pretty much
recommended
the best game of my life fus ro dah

amazing actionpacked game really recommend this game though i have only played 33 hrs on the pc i have played more on consoles five stars 
recommended
this is absolutely the best fantasy game ive ever played
recommended
i got to have sex with a little bunny after killing it several times and after resurrecting it and killed it again
recommended
possibly the best game ive ever played second to none the elder scrolls v skyrim is without a doubt one of if not the best openworld role playing games of this generation endless replayability an unsurpassable amount of mods a unique experience and countless hours to waste away enjoying the immersion this game has to offer bethesda truely excelled previous elder scroll games with this release the pros > openworld beautifuly designed > detailed character creation and arcehtype building > 300 hours of playable content > extremely lore based > truely immersive storyline > excellent audio > well designed game mechanics including combat leveling perks > vast array of weaponry armor spells potions and much much more > mass amounts of mods ranging from graphic gameplay item house and character mods > a substantial amount of enemies ranging from dragons bandits draugrs thieves to vampires the cons > voice acting is repetitive one several occasions you will notice npcs voiced by the same actor with the same voice > replayability is much lower without the use of mods > some areas of the large openworld seem reused there seems to be little variation to open world textures and dungeons > questing can sometimes seem repetitive go to x get y item return to z to finish this up ive put over 500 hours into skyrim across three systems xbox ps3 and now the pc ive never felt as immersed into a games storyline openworld and lore  it is truely a different experience to any other openworld rpg the character creation and arcehtype building is perfect for this type of role playing game want to play through the game from a stealth approach done want to tank more damage than a german panzer in ww2 done want to fire frost and electrify your way through every bandit camp and dungeon in the vicinity donethere is literally no limit dont want to stick to a specific arcetype done jack of all trades with 10 playable races youre able to customize your character to your own liking and fight the way you believe you should with 18 skills ranging from archery lockpicking twohanded destruction restoration smithing and many in between theres plenty of variety leveling never feels monotonous level at your own pace or powerlevel before youve even started the main quest play the game your way with over 270 quests including the main quest side quests and sub quests theres never a dull moment youll be lucky to even finish half of them before you take an arrow to the knee i could not recommend this game more highly if you even have the slighest interest in rpgs or openworld games take the plunge and pick this game up
recommended
3 words fun as hell
recommended
mod it until it breaks
recommended
hoard massive amounts of cabbage 1010 would buy again
recommended
got 10 large homes using mods and killed the jarls i feel like high king now would recommend 200000010
recommended
best rpg game ever made also has got good mods
recommended
the biggest open world single player game to date have on ps3 and pc all the dlc at a good price on pc make skyrim a no brainer
recommended
an excellent game for trying out different styles of combat and really getting involved in the world my personal favorite is archery  taking pot shots at draugr from across the catacomb and actually hitting them is the best feeling in the world the game is apt to bore you after a while but thats often only because youre not in the right mindset to play it its not for fooling around in youll get the most out of it by actually exploring the world and being your character
recommended
bethesda games are awesome i recommend the elder scrolls saga to all who get more crazy becouse of medication then they were before they took that medication believe me when i say that being hooked to bethesda games realy draws your mind away from worse addictions andor psychiatrical problems
recommended
a wonderful game and a true testament to the elder scrolls series not as big as my beloved daggerfall or arena but complete immersion into the environment is still possible an easy to use skill system though i do miss the indepth ones of old and a great character generation system make the game easy to play your way above all i love the customizability of the game itself leaving it to the enduser to shape the game as they see fit a great and immersive set of stories to go through with dlc expanding it to many hours of enjoyable fun this is by far one of the greatest games that i have ever played and continue to play
recommended
skyrim is one of those games you could play constantly for weeks or even months and its still fun then even after you get bored of it you can return months later start a new adventure and have just as much fun as last time if not more throw mods on top of it the game just gets even better the open world exploration is fantastic and there is always something new to discover its truly an adventure game and i recommend it for anyone who likes fantasy games and open world games
recommended
1010 with mods especially immersion mods however even without mods this game is excellent
recommended
simply incredible and there are tons of mods that allow you to enjoy the game again even when you were getting bored of it
recommended
an amazing game with an awesome storystories theres so much to do that you can easily put 150 hours in without touching the main plots
recommended
stop reading my recommendation and go buy the game already
recommended
ok my second review skyrim thats all i need to say bought it in england and started and i couldnt get enough of it i searched every nook and cranny for items and crafted items such as the daedric armours the diversity of the 9 holds and the annoying meme make this game really great and then enemies with a good enough battle plan you can kill without even being suspected or even just run in and slash them up or crush their skulls oooooooo the shouts holy  those shouts fus ro dah i loved the shouts my favourite is the dragon aspect or the cyclone shout and im not saying the unrelenting force because cyclone flings them further and high in the air and dragon aspect because 1 you look ing badass and 2 because when your health reaches around 13 there is a chance for an ancient dragon borns spirit to appear to help you out not only does it have great power it will shout say what you want about this game but it will always have a place in my games library plus the modding allows more fun such as the whiterun camp attached to the wall is great for a beggining player that needs a good place to store their new and inventory filling items such as foods and weapons in special specific and overall very usefull chests i rate this 100100 nord accenti used to be an adventurer like you then it ook an arrow to the mefus ro dah nord accentno lollygagging meim at the in shop leave me alone jeez nord accent stop shouting youre shouting is making people nervous mewell  this stabs the guard shouts his body well now that that has been taken care of i can finallyoh  gets tackled by commander caius caiusyoure under arrest meah crap
recommended
get it now go
recommended
one of the best role playing games i have ever played this game should be owned by if not wanted by everyone

recommended

recommended
hoard massive amounts of cabbage 1010 would buy again

recommended
my first elder scrolls game that ive played what can i say its just awesome
recommended
like oblivion with more facial hair
recommended
amazing game highly recommend to play and is fun 1010
recommended
what can i say that hasnt been said about this game nothing really well put together and a solid game well worth the buy however i can see this being a obession so that might be the only problem
recommended
keeping up the bethesda tes tradition skyrim was as much as if not more fun than morrowind and oblivion
recommended
forgot it wasnt a sequel it was so good 1110 would bang
recommended
an excellent game for trying out different styles of combat and really getting involved in the world my personal favorite is archery  taking pot shots at draugr from across the catacomb and actually hitting them is the best feeling in the world the game is apt to bore you after a while but thats often only because youre not in the right mindset to play it its not for fooling around in youll get the most out of it by actually exploring the world and being your character
recommended
reminds me of playing kings field just with lot better graphics
recommended
its like oblivion with more draugr
recommended
i have this on ps3 360 and now pc i cannot get enough of this game theres so much to do youll never truly do it all buy it love it and tell your signifigant other you still love them just that youll need a few weeks or a month or four
recommended
hundreds of hours of open world gameplay with a slew of different races armours weapons and spells to use if youre looking for deep complex story this isnt the game for you its as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle however the modding community has made this game worth spending even a hundred dollars on many mods for many different things such as quests races spells equipment new lands to explore and even entire games such as morrowind highly reccomended
recommended
this is the best throwing goats off cliffs with your voice simulator money can buy
recommended
one of the best games ever
recommended
greatest game in history ^^ i think they shouldntve stopped making dlcs for it thoit had alot more potentional and would just be neat to have several other dlcs3 are not enough for such a big game p
recommended
brilliant game recommended for everyone who enjoys rpg games or bethesda fans 810 would have been better if you had a better leveling system and more items
recommended
waldo approves    
recommended
really great game where bandits come to mug the guy who just killed a dragon and absorbed his soul whoever doesnt buy this game is a milk drinker
recommended
i keep trying to quit you but you keep pulling me back in
recommended
buy this and play it till the day you die
recommended
the elder scrolls is one of my favorite rpg series and skyrim is no disappointment an open ended world great voice acting deep character customization solid gameplay mechanics and the freedom to pursue the kind of character you want to play make this a choice game for any fans of action rpgs and there has always been a great community surrounding the series with talented modders who take the game to a completely different level creating a deeply replayable experience
recommended
feel like being an adventurer feel like killin some dragons feel like being the most bad looking negro hero ever now you can with the elder scrolls v skyrim
recommended
great game very good such wow
recommended
best game ever i purchased this on my xbox i just recently purchased this on pc hands down best game how can you dislike such a massivly beautiful game this game does have those tiny glitches but you wont know know them unless you look them up and they arent obvious glitches either if thats what youre worried about this game is worth the money ive played many games throughout my life and ive got to say when this came out i wasnt too intrested in it until i actualy took my time to play it and now that i have no regrets d took my life
recommended
after getting it i know why everyone loves it so much a really great game and i highly recommend it its a true musthave for every rpg fan
recommended
who hasnt played skyrim yet nothing but perfection in this game
recommended
this is one of the best if not the best game i have ever played
recommended
3 years old game and still fun with amazing graphics
recommended
theres a reason ive almost sunk 1000 hours into this bad boy its the best elderscrolls game yet
recommended
if you dont own skyrim please uninstall life
recommended
one of the best games i own
recommended
this game is so much fun from just running around killing things to downloading mods turning dragons into thomas the tankengine if you liked any of the other elder scrolls then you will hands down love this game just as much if not more
recommended
honestly i have to say this is one of the best games i have ever played in my whole entire life  i own it on xbox 360 and i loved it so much i had to buy it on steam if you buy this game and you have an xbox or a ps3 i would recommend buying it on steam because you can download mods and fun  like that
recommended
we all know this game and how  it was on the consoles we all agree that this game is 100 times better on pc due to mods and enhancements that can be modified and added this game is incredible in its own way yes it has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs which can be fixed using official patches from the skyrim nexus there are a lot of things you are missing from this game it has incredible mods that you will never get to experience which is a shame since it is one of the biggest workshops on steam there are mods that add more killmoves characters races weapons armours animals  beasts immersive mods enviroments gameplay aspects and more there are enbs which enhance skyrim immensely literarily a brain  there are mods that can create better characters that dont look like hobos from downtown this game is excellent for those who seek adventure great mods and roleplaying
recommended
amazing game ten out of ten 
recommended
i almost forgot to review skyrim
recommended
cool
recommended
dragons keep killing me and stealing my sweet rolls
recommended
an allaround fantastic adventure game while the elder scrolls is famous for its rpgs skyrim feels like more of a fantasy adventure with rpg elements rather than a traditional rpg the elder scrolls iii and iv both give the player more of a traditional rpg feel giving your character special skills and increasing individual attributes such as strength or dexterity whereas skyrim allows the character to only build up skills such as smithing destruction magic etc undoubtedly the quests in skyrim have been made much more simple since oblivion and morrowind but the action and basic story if there is one for that particular quest make up for the challenges of finding the location of the treasurebandit camp etc like most elder scrolls games one does not simply finish it there are mountains of quests and events for the player to find and complete and you can easily dump hundreds of hours into it with a growing mod community on steam and nexus players can immerse themselves in one of the greatest adventure rpgs in existance
recommended
love the game its long story and replayability make it very interesting as well as not being even close to linear my only problems were that its sandbox mechanic is severely lacking but im sure mod makers will make up for it as well as some seemingly unfinished questlines spoiler like the college of winterhold you should actually be able to learn about the games definition of magic and its mechanic through this college instead it may aswell be a small insignificant bunch of sidequests leading up to becoming archmage
recommended
this game is good for those who like open world games and rpgs also there are tons of mods if you want to change the game want to make that fus ro dah less boring change it to a mighty objection so yeah its good
recommended
why didnt i recommend this game when i bought it because i was too busy playing it after installing my 500th mod today i can still call skyrim one of the biggest and best games i have ever owned as stated by others the potential of this game is almost unlimited you can even convert the whole game into a tropical forest now and play like you were in elsweyr get this game now d
recommended
with the right mods this is by far one of the greatest games ever released
recommended
yes but i have found a bug where it gives you the dlc when you do not own them and if you use anything from the dlc and save you can nolonger play that save till you get the dlc so i can not play anymore till i get dawnguard
recommended
do anything u want in this game 9910
recommended
the best rpg of the last 23 years thats all      23  
recommended
skyrim is the 5th installment in the elder scrolls series ive played it on console and it is smooth and has very few bugs the pc version is basically an expansion pack you can download mods and have hilarious battle with a my little ponie avatar against thomas the tank engine buy this game
recommended
best game i have played in years
recommended
ive never invested as much time in a world as i have in tamriel the elder scroll series has set the standard for rgps going back to the beginning but most notable with morrowind obvlivion and now skyrim skyrim is not just a game to be played but to be immersed in its an experience not to be missed
recommended
let me just say best dragon knight whatever you call this game i have ever played in my life you start out with awesome graphics awesome story layout and just an awesome game experience you have ever played if you dont like this game your just a total loser im sorry but this game is currently the best dragon times game i have ever experienced on pc i suggest this game to people that like dragonsknights that kind of stuff nothing bad about this game everything is running fine no bugs or glitches i have had yet just an awesome game
recommended
why wouldnt you buy this game
recommended
do you recommend this game you bet i do
recommended
amazing gamedragonsbanditsthiefs and much moreeverything about this game is awesome 1010badass seal of approval
recommended
skyrim is probably the most beautiful elder scrolls games ever and one of the best games ever the map is fun to explore with many different characters to fall in love with its one of the only games i enjoy levelling up my miscellanious skills blacksmithing speech etc you are not a gamer if you never played a tleast one of the elder scrolls games  so if you havent skyrim is the place to start although not even a year after buying the game i found that i was heavily relying on different mods and dlc the story is basically the same no matter what and even though there are some small choices there isnt a lot for an rpg the choices all lead to the same out come just some different dialogue
recommended
skyrim is truly one of the best games i have ever played it has endless hours of fun in the base game plus a huge collection of mods and three massive expansions if you havent taken the plunge into tes 5 do it now
recommended
easily the greatest game i have ever played
recommended
my gran was pro at skyrim before she embarked on a journey to find true peace and solitude with the greybeards please honour her and buy the game

this is hands down one of the greatest rpgs of all time the elder scrolls v has proven to still be one of the finest pieces of art bethesda has published and is still proven to be a masterpeice nearly two years on whether you quest for weapons armour or just seek adventure this game has it all in terms of gameplay while the combat may be seen in some eyes as crap there are many mods available on the workshop to tweak your game to perfection the pc edition runs much quicker than ps3xbox and is greatly obtimised loading times are minimal and even old computers can run this game fine which is incredible considering the sheer magnitude of the game sadly this game is only singleplayer but dont let that get to you talking about it with your friends is just as good  you will never get bored with the simply hundereds of quests to complete perhaps you can make personal quests for finding mighty armour or slaying some annoying beasts maybe you just want to use a dragon shout to knock a giant off a cliff anything is possible this game has proven to be in my top 3 favourite games ever made which is saying something i have a lot of games the game is cheaper than ever on steam and has such an amazing community helping out by making and testing mods giving feedback ect this game certainly is playable without mods you are not obliged d however there is something in the workshop for everyone james wooddedicated nord with a big sword

an immersive adventure that once you start your journey youre likely not to stop for a very long time your path will be rife with bandits vampires and their thralls draugr and of course dragons the fifth installment of the elder scrolls series does not disappoint with its sandbox atmosphere and myriads of modding capabilities there exists a modification for almost every facet of skyrim enhancing your medieval experience skyrim is one of the crown jewels of my game collection and rightly so there is so much pure content in this game it is excusable for the tens of hours that it will take from you some may describe it as a timesink but it is well worth it because for every hour you commit to the game it takes you further along in your journey and leaves you aching for more skyrim is undoubtably one of the best games its generation setting a precedent for future games that strive to outdo what it achieves skyrim is the one to beat the score for the game is also fantastic full of astoundingly great work by jeremy soule the music that accompanies the events is very period it goes perfectly with the atmosphere of skyrim your heart will literally be left pumping as you fight dragons to the sound of one they fear or watch the skies and the music of sovngarde gives a perfect tone to the afterlife of the nords overall skyrim deserves all of the positive acclaim that it garners it is setting a standard in the gaming world and renewing the belief in myself that perhaps there is still hope for storytelling in video games pros  hours upon hours of gameplay when you think youre done youre not  customization great character customization and with mods it reinforces this tenfold  modability  skill system  no classes  dialogue between npcs there are always things going on cons  initial game physics are a little irritating in places  at first it was difficult to find where i was going on the map but this may have been an individual issue  so much to do that you dont know what to do my main gripe xd

its nip twistin
recommended
awesome game especially with cool mods everyone has to get this
recommended
this is a must have
recommended
its a really thought out and well detailed game if you like fps rpgs then youll definitely like the elder scrolls v skyrim 1010
recommended
nice and realistic game  everyone shoud try it 
recommended
this is one of the time consuming games ive ever played the lore is fantastic the scenery is awe inspiring and the amount of freedom it offers is unprecedented if youve got the cash get this game
recommended
while the actual combat animations are not suberb there is no weight to any swings nor wump to any arrows etc the world is superbly detailed and the sheer possibility for stories is insane this game is really what you make of it oh and i havent even mentioned the modding community
recommended
aahh perhaps a little too late for this games review but nevertheless the elder scrolls series a wonder of rpg games in the years ive started the series with oblivion when i saw it in a cyber cafe a few years back and see all the classic table top rpg element inside it i thoroughly enjoyed the game of course and cannnot wait for skyrim to come out which was announced a few month after my discovery of oblivion firstly i was expecting its mechanism to stay but was a little disappointed in its simplicity instead everything is too simplified and for the npcs the only good thing about them is their quests and nothing more despite their somewhat colourful personalities the roleplaying this time focuses a lot on quests instead of a more broad purpose it would seem that skyrim is made for its combat system which was never a strong part in the elder scroll series in my opinion and is not so impressive in here either swing swing occasional block and such however the finishing blow is admittingly the best thing to do in combat skyrims environment however is what really makes it beautiful to be able to explore the province of skyrim in its fullest fast travel is almost going to be unused almost all in all it is a good adventure game despite lacking in its roleplaying
recommended
i used to be an adventurer like you then i took an arrow in the knee 1010
recommended
skyrim is stupendus is a better oblivion imho
recommended
lets just say that if i were trapped on a desert island that somehow got electricity and wifi and could only have one video game to play for my entire life i would choose this one because it is not humanly possible to do all that there is to do in this game in one life time and you will probably never get tired of it just when you think youre done youll get sucked back in somehow it never ends ever
recommended
its a good open world sandbox game that goes with the rest of the elder scrolls lore
recommended
i climbed up a tree with my horse
recommended
punched a child in the face 1010
recommended
great game buy it u filthy
recommended
even after playing this game so many times it still has not lost any playablilty and this is due to the great work everyone is doing through the workshop

surely a game this massive in scale requires a review of similar proportion where do i begin the graphics the gameplay the lore ill start at the beginning first off this game is nothing like roller coaster tycoon in fact skyrim and rct are about as far away from each other on the spectrum of gaming as they can be so if youre looking for a quality theme park buildingmanagement simulator or any theme park buildingmanagement simulator do not look to the elder scrolls series you begin your quest as a lowly prisoner in the back of a wagon the offense is border hopping and the punishment is death by axe sure beats a big ol wall huh us government on the way to the execution you meet fellow prisoner roggvir a key member in a group of rebels called the stormcloaks who want to take back skyrim from the imperial legion the people who are executing you and put the nords back in command when you arrive at the executionplace in helgen a guard asks you for your name now say what you want about the imperial legion but these people have some patience i sat there for 45 minutes thinking of a name and rearranging my race face and gender to my liking and they just waited for me to finish finally i decided on jikrel a magicianjuggler inspired by my hero penn jillette properly named and pampered im ready to get my head chopped off just before the axe comes down however a conveniently timed plot device swoops down and proceeds to burn the city to the ground it is at this point that the player can decide whether to escape with roggvir the handsome rebel with a cause or someoneelseiforgothisname a dirty imperial pig while the choice doesnt make a difference at this point in the game it presents the player with the concept of choosing sides in a convoluted almost entirely pointless side quest involving the great civil war of skyrim racist rebels or idiotic imperials the choice is yours to make or not once youve escaped youre free to go anywhere in the overworld you desire do any side quests you want tackle the main storyline or just goof around and break the games ai i opted for the latter dont get me wrong there are a lot of things to do in skyrim its just that most of them arent fun or interesting i tried to give the main quest a go but around the seventeenth plot device and ninth fetch quest or so i just got sick of it and quit i had to replace the stock plot device fighthing music to a pitcheddown rendition of frank zappas no not now just to make it that far im going to be honest here the most fun ive had playing this game ive had roleplaying a psychopathic serial rapistenema banditmurderer that slits peoples throats dry humps their still warm corpses and dumps them in the nearest rivercrevicehumorous location he can find what this says about myself i dont know but i do know what it says about the games quests theyre not good in fact i found the games quests were obstructing my overall goal of blindly murdering everything in my path ever since oblivion bethesda has felt the need to make certain npcs that are essential to the games completion unkillable i had to download a mod so that i could kill them and thus continue having fun oh and dont get me started on the mods nude mods better female mods sexy armor mods what is this a sick joke how horny are you people but i digress to sum it up skyrim is worse than oblivion because it is better than oblivion bethesda dont seem to realize that their games are inherently goofy and are perfect that way the more they try to make it badass or epic or the more bad face textures and ai bugs they fix the worse it gets i dont even think the intended audience for these games takes them seriously considering the number of great dumb mods there are out there battletoad rash all in all id buy it because its still a pretty enjoyable experience and im sure everybody can find something to do in this massively dumb roleplaying actionadventure game oh and the graphics are pretty good i guess 710 plot devicedragon

this is a very fun game but eventually gets a little boring until you fight some dragons
recommended
this game is sick it is such a big and beautiful world with so many places to explore 2 years later with new dlc installed and this game is still awesome to play plus the endless mods are always fun to try
recommended
with the right mods this is by far one of the greatest games ever released

one day dragonborn was almost killed by a dragon than he ate a slice of goat cheese and slained the dragon 1010 would eat cabbage again
recommended
what can i say about skyrim such a wonderful game brought to full potential on the pc because of mods and its active community of dedicated players whenever im in the mood for a sandbox game skyrim is right there waiting for me
recommended
what can i say its a fun role playing game youre quite free to ignore whatever quests you dont want to follow and build your character as you please playing as a redguard 40hrs allowed me to finish the main quest become a werewolf learn to decapitate enemies helped random locals decapitated some bandits raided a wrecked ship for no reason removed the head from a sailor saved a stormcloak from some tribal attackers before stabbing a sword through is back and enchanting a sword there is plenty to do and well worth getting
recommended
its one of the best game iv ever playes and even if you have to fight against dragons wolves and other creatures wich i love its awesome and give to the player a really great experience everyone should at least try this game
recommended
why should i even write a review for this 1010
recommended
amazing rpg you can do basically anything and explore everywhere and mod support which means doing anything and going anywhere is literal
recommended
the elder scrolls v skyrim a game with a kickass story that you probably wont get around to finishing until youve finished fooling around with cheese wheel avalanches sweetroll robberies and a lot of random murders yesrandom murders a game where modding addiction is a real serious thing seriously i tried to pick up a spoon at home subconsciously trying to press e and i realized that i was nowhere near my damn pc and this was the real life the game alone how it was made and despite all the bugs is very enjoyable you can sink a ton of hours just looking around exploring immersing yourself in the skyrim environment and the radiant quests character customization is better than it was in oblivion but can be further enhanced by mods basically the whole vanilla experience of skyrim is superb and it is improved by the addition of mods the voice acting cast seems to have expanded as compared to oblivion the guards still assume someone stole my sweetroll there is apparently a sweetroll thief on the loose there isnt much else to say its a great game if this review isnt enough to convince you to get the game watch a few playthroughs read more reviews ask your friends ask their friends ask strangers on the internet and then decide if that is still not enough or you just dont wanna pay full price that is completely understandable by the way wait for a good sale but i tell you it is well worth full retail price 1010 i am no longer considered criminal scum now i am that which has committed crimes against skyrim and her people
recommended
i can feel tht half of my soul have been trap in this world once u start playingsay goodbye to your previous game because u might not play them anymorethis game is worth for 5999 everything in this game is almost perfact grapghicsongthemegameplayenvironmentstoryline and whatever in this game thanks for my friend out therelim dong yun because he gave me this superior awesome game xd
recommended
great game the best openworld game bethesda has made yet in my opinion now with the dlcs the game seems endless and you will spend many dozens of hours just questing alone even before exploring all of skyrim hope you have a lot of extra time on your hands 
recommended
you play as luigi and you must save the mushroom kingdom from dragons mario was turned into a dragon but he good dragon luigi shouts really loud cause he is scared of dragons luigi cant fit dragons in a vacuum so he stabs them with arrows and swords and his own fists its a pretty good game everyone calls me some dragonborn i stab them and then say im luigi

completely ruined my life and stole at least 13 days of my life away from me 1010
recommended
i played through this game on console and it was epic good story lots of side quests and levelling to do i purchased this for pc for the mod support and theres ton of mods for skyrim from some of the visual mods that leave you spending more time staring at the environment to rediculous mods that leave you laughing having mods breathed new life into a game that i already compled overall if you are a fan of previous elder scrolls games or even rpgs with a good story this is worth picking up especially with all the steam sales 910
recommended
my first elder scrolls game that ive played what can i say its just awesome
recommended
like oblivion with more facial hair
recommended
amazing game highly recommend to play and is fun 1010
recommended
what can i say that hasnt been said about this game nothing really well put together and a solid game well worth the buy however i can see this being a obession so that might be the only problem
recommended
keeping up the bethesda tes tradition skyrim was as much as if not more fun than morrowind and oblivion
recommended
forgot it wasnt a sequel it was so good 1110 would bang
recommended
an amazing game that everyone should get 
recommended
approved by the wolf
recommended
best game of 2011 d
recommended
one of the best games i ever playedthis game is amazing the texture and the graphics are bad but this is not something that should bother me this game is a whole world you can do anything in this game the dlcs are amazing too and if you like rpg magics fantasy and a huge lore this game is for you
recommended
excellent game overall as positives outweigh the negatives good points fantastic visuals breath taking views of the landscape missions in dungeons are thrilling lots of replayability well written out lore feels almost like a sim rpg bad points stale dialogue missions can get boring overtime rather glitchy
recommended
very good game enjoy it a lot best game ever i dont think ill play another game ever again 410
recommended
if you like roleplay fantasy games this is your game
recommended
unlimited quest  epic game 
recommended
best singleplayer game with mods ive ever played in my life 3
recommended
a great game so many different combat styles and things to do you can play it for days on end and never get bored shot a chicken town filled of elderly women stabbed me to death 1010
recommended
i dont know how to put it in words but this is one of the best games ive ever played and with the mods you can do just about whatever the  you want
recommended
one of the most beautiful immersive and epic games of all time in fact its the most there are no contenders it almost feels like a waste of time recommending skyrim because anyone with a machine capable of playing it is likely to have done so already some of the mods are also well worth installing if your setup can run them including retextures graphics extenders and more detailed character creation goodbye real world tamriel is much more appealing
recommended
four characters and 570 hours laterwhat am i doing with my life

all i did was punch one cow and everyone wants to kill me like come on cows are not as cool as me right right 42010

skyrim belongs to the nords

if youve played previous elder scrolls games glitches and oddities dont come as a surprise nevertheless skyrim feature tighter combat fewer bugs improved graphics and so on if there is anything to complain about in this game it would be the user interface inventory taking up a lot of useless items some bad acting as you level up the creatures you fight take forever to kill by hitting them 3040 times and finally its replayability value creating characters is nice even though it takes a very long time to get what you want done finding and completing quests is solid i said all i disliked the game succeeds in comparison to elder scrolls iv and i am addicted to this game like a person playing games replayability value is hard to get back to though if you leave the game for a month or more anyways great work on the game this is more than i expected it to be with little to no struggle to get used to postives tons of content fun combat huge open world to explore modding tools deep character creation tools a lot of side missions and longendless gameplay a lot of ways to improve graphics negatives bugfree horrible voice acting poor character animations overall 910
recommended
this game is so excellent that i dont even feel worthy enough to review it suffice it to say that the bar in terms of role playing games is just a plaything for bethesda game studios they can put it wherever they want and it will stay there until they come back for it again nobody else will even come close
recommended
a very entertaining and addictive game
recommended
personally the best actionadventure rpg game ive ever played you can play the game over and over and over again and you still wont get bored of it because there is simply too many choices too make too much quests to finish in a large variety of ways 1010
recommended
910 i love this game and everything that goes on in it i bought it for my ps3 when i lived in an apartment i also own it on pc obviously cant say i regret ever having bought this game everything is worth checking out the dlc is amazing and brings new things that help improve the game even more i would advise checking out mods this game has replayability and definitely a chance to get your moneys worth from it i still have a hard time believing i invested 1300 some odd hours of my life into this game aside from that some negatives is probably the fact it is older and may not meet new standards of graphics for some people who are all about pretty pictures but if that is not a problem for you as it isnt for me at all you will love this game
recommended
it cool
recommended
this is probably the best game i have ever played it is made by bethesda so already you know its gonna be good but the detail and depth of the game is just staggering there is so much too this game and you could spend 100s of hours on it and still find amazing hidden quests wherever you go if this isnt enough for you there are hundreds of mods to give you extra missions and the modders have put alot of time into them i find that the vanilla graphics of this game are pretty awful but there are many many mods that are simple to install and will combine to give you an amazing experience overall this game is definitely worth your money and thanks to the help of modders who can improve graphics every year i am sure that it will last for a very long time if not indefinitely and i would recommend it to anyone who has a decent pc and alot of free time 1010
recommended
i mainly played this on my xbox 360 and i loved it then and i love it even more on the pc modding skyrim is some of the most fun i have had gaming in awhile i never found myself at a al loss of what to do while playing skyrim the combat while not the high point of the game really set the tone for the game itself skyrim is about the atmosphere and what you are feeling as you play it i can count about a dozen times when i would just stare at the sky in the game at night the story is phenomenal as well and this is a great buy for anyone wanting a epic fantasy done right

skyrim the game which rocked the world the unforgettable maxvonsydownarrated jeremysoulemusicpowered trailer that radiates awe an openworld experience of leading a virtual life of high adventure in a fantasy world i admit this was the first elder scrolls game that i played somehow all of the other games eluded me and i first seriously considered skyrim watching it played by the popular starcraft ii caster day[9]  this game as i later found out continues the elder scrolls formula which was evolved through several incarnations arena daggerfall morrowind oblivion perhaps its main defining characteristic is that instead of the experience system common for most rpgs your skill levels determine your character leveling and skill levels are raised by using them if you want to be a mage you will use your spells and level up if you want to be a warrior you will pick up your favorite type of weapon and swing it pick up a shield and block if you want to be a stealth character you will sneak simple and intuitive quests are as nonlinear as possible what this means is that you are most of the time not forced to do them or follow a specific order when completing them besides several larger questlines there are many small unrelated radiant quests which help flesh out the game and provide an even greater variety to already exciting core questlines there is a small caveat though the dark side of elder scrolls games are the bugs they happen to be something of a tradition with bethesda games and are even considered a fun factor many bugs were solved through various patches and expansions though and there are unofficial patches which are available through modding sites such as skyrim nexus [wwwnexusmodscom]  speaking of which another major aspect of skyrim are mods from different armor and weapons to textures and shaders and user interface this game has inspired many people to write dozens of mods since its release browsing through a plethora of available mods on some mod site alone could take you hours not that you will mind though skyrim is without any doubt one of the greatest rpgs and one of the greatest games made pick it up on a steam sale and play it you will completely lose track of time and you will love it
recommended
this is my one my favorite games with modding you play forver woul highly recommend
recommended
a beautiful and emmersive game but crippling bugs and accidential  yes accidental exploits make it infuriating
recommended
as someone who had never played a tes game before this was a very fun experience i had never given rpgs a chance until this game it sucks you in and the modding scene just adds so much more to it
recommended
this is one of the best games ever created
recommended
best game ever unfortunately my wife thinks so too this means i get to play whenever she isnt around still worth it
recommended
great game it really lets you do whatever you want including killing dragons and stuff
recommended
i originally played this game on a playstation 3 console right after its release due to my pc not being able to handle it after putting up with numerous bugsglitches i shelved the game completely bought it to start playing again on pc and its so much better helps that i am a fan of games of this genre need to finish this title but so far its amazing a must play for anyone
recommended
best elder scrolls game in the series and the whole series is really good
recommended
tesv skyrim is the best open world rpg in gaming to date the amount of freedom and openness is stunning and the game is truly stunning if you have a graphics card capable of handling it the mod community for this game is among the most active thorughout gaming in spite of skyrims age mods are constantly being released and updated allowing for nearly endless replayability the main storyline is very good but the sheer amount of dungeons and side quest will almost always attract your attention you will likely spend hours traversing the wilds while dungeon crawling and hunting for loot v very few of the side quests feel like fetch quests each side quest has a uniqeness and fun all on its own in addition to the main story and side missions there are several unique factions that demand your services each with its own fully fleshed storyline characters and perks in conclusion the world errr skyrim is your oyster filled to the brim with hundreds of hours of story loot and fun
recommended
this game is fantastic
recommended
its like oblivion only with beliveable characters and a good story and fun gameplay and unique locations to explore and reasonable system requirements and all those other things they forgot to put into oblivion because they were too busy masturbating over shaders and poorly optimized textures so its like oblivion only good
recommended
feel like being an adventurer feel like killin some dragons feel like being the most bad looking negro hero ever now you can with the elder scrolls v skyrim
recommended
great game very good such wow

best game ever i purchased this on my xbox i just recently purchased this on pc hands down best game how can you dislike such a massivly beautiful game this game does have those tiny glitches but you wont know know them unless you look them up and they arent obvious glitches either if thats what youre worried about this game is worth the money ive played many games throughout my life and ive got to say when this came out i wasnt too intrested in it until i actualy took my time to play it and now that i have no regrets d took my life

as someone who has grown up with elder scrolls from morrowind on the xbox and oblivion being my reason to buy a xbox 360 skyrim did not disappoint skyrim improves on almost everything that oblivion brought to the table even if some mehanics are dumbed down the environments are absolutely gorgeous with huge open landscapes to explore the dungeons are all unique and have their own charms to all of them there are many cities and villages to explore with different stories and adventures to discover in each one just walking between towns feels like an epic adventure skyrim is the best open world rpg to date in my opinion with the steam work shop you can add mods that makes the game even better which makes it worth it if you already have the game on the consoles like i do the difficulty can be adjusted at anytime for all types of players from hardened rpg players to people new to games in general this is a game for everyone except children of course my only real complaint is the story doesnt feel as epic and important as the last elder scrolls games the dragons seem intimidating but they are no real threat to you or the people of skyrim even though they constantly tell you how dangerous dragons are after beating the main story of oblivion you felt like a true hero and even got a staue built for you in skyrim they pretty much treat you the same way if you hadnt saved the world thats right no staue at the end sorry for spoilers p but overall its great experience 9510 a must buy
recommended
three words buy this game great plot great characters great gameplay and the game is huge
recommended
simply epic
recommended
a game that never ends
recommended
the best rpg ever made you better buy this or die
recommended
this game provides so many hours of gameplay that it is ridiculous it definitely has a great replay value you can decide what kind of character you want to be
recommended
the vanilla game is enjoyable but i cannot recommend it as it is nothing compared to the game where you employ mods for those out there that either fear or detest the lorebreaking aspect of mods im not asking you to download a school uniform or a xxxxxl bust size for your character im asking you to look at the effort put in by the community of modders who strive to make the game a more enjoyable experience for all like skyui or falskaar
recommended
if you dont have this game you porobibly have a girlfriend or somthing yuck
recommended
its my game 
recommended
outstandddding game endless fun with steam workshop
recommended
it worth to play n good way to explore fantacy world
recommended
do you not already own this how have you been surviving sure you got food water and shelter but this this is a real neccessity it is an open world ready with secrets to discover and adventures to travel on fighting dragons is but a part of your quest to be the best warrior in skyrim but only if you want to of course being a thief or assassin is just as amazing for portraying your incredible stealth unless you plan to be the archmage of limitless magical powers casting fire and lightning on your quest to kill the high king of the land there is always combinations if you prefer spreading your bardlike knowledge so go on fulfill your quest and become a true dragonborn
recommended
this game is great but has its drawbacks it feels more like an adventure game than an rpg its more about doing than filling out level sheets which i must say i prefer i found it tedious in oblivion to allocate skills into things i ended up not using because i didnt know the plot of the game the first time it didnt feel like i was playing a game it felt like homework skyrim is simplier but its streamlined nature is what makes it so enjoyable to play i feel like im going on an adventure and getting stronger using skills that come natural to me the characters look pretty and the open world is really quite astounding i found myself simply looking at the scenery knowing that someone had to envision it it is probably one of my favorite games but i dont like to compare it to the other elder scrolls games because it breaks the mold with a new leveling system
recommended
a whole world full of beautiful friendly people with their broken knees and dragons lots of dragons
recommended
this game is very good i highly reccomend the mod s of skyrim it adds some much needed length to your playthrough
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played

this game is totaly worth the money gameplay and graphics may not be its strongest areas but besides that the game is truly one of the best i have played in a lond time huge openworld landscape with lots to do and see all three expancions are great extending the epic adventure that the game has to offer plus the games modding community is one of the richest that i have seen with thousands of great and new mods comming out daily from adding new and exiting weapons and races to making an extreme inprovement on both graphics and gameplay skyrim is gaurintieed to give you an exiting taste of the tes adventure and give you hours upon hours of an exiting and novel experience since the last game skyrim has made tremendous inprovements in skyrim the ui has been tremendously improved with smarter sorting new options and overall better looks players can now gain a veriaty of new blessings and powers and not to mention shouts shouts are the main new aspect of the game allowing players to absorb the souls of dragons and use their powers against them one other new inprovement is the dual weild option allowing for players to equip weaponsmagic in to the left right or both hands making for new and dynamic combat stragities the games graphic atmosphere is much more rugged and dirty where as oblivions was almost cartoonish although the new engine is a disapointment it still works fine giving us great graphics that can compare to many modern games the modding community also brings high resolution texturepacks and encredible hd lighting and shader mods called enbs the story as always focuses on a prisioner who becomes an emportant person in tamrielic history in this installment of the tes franchise your charater escpes exicution when the dragon god aulduin attacks later you find out that you are the dragonborn of legend and are destined to save tamriel from the wrath of the dragons by defeating aulduin and restoring the peace of skyrim the player will have a great expericnce with this exiting game
recommended
refusing to stop the elder scrolls franchises newest entry skyrim goes down kicking till the very end admist civil war the eater of worlds or a bad dragon decides to come back to add to the turmoil and why not it would seem that the time is ripe for dragons to come and gourge on the souls of our world however as luck would have it there is as in all fantasies one person who can stand in the dragons way watch out keanu reeves because a new chosen one is in town get ready to hack slash burn freeze stun scare eat stab punch shoot throw shout claw jump and fling your way to victory past racist guards foolish bards crappy elves drunken nords or legendary monsters of epic proportions hoprfully you do not have a girlfriend or 85 job because if you do you will not have the time to onehundred percent this game i mean have you seen the hit short film dragonbored some amount of stars that amounts to 5

november 11 2011 was a great day because bethesda graced us with one of the greatest games every created skyrim is the 5th installment of the elder scrolls series and oh boy does it ever take it to the next level what does skyrim have you may ask in depth character development player housing killable npcs anything that isnt nailed to the wall or ground can be stolen tons of weapons and magic spells play as a werewolf or vampire hundreds of quests an enormous world and oh yeah dragons skyrim is an rpg that has a great main story with tons of side quests that either have nothing to do with the main story arc or have everything to do with it i couldnt stop playing the game as every corner every road or just over that mountain had something new to do or experience and the experiences were increased exponentially with the environmental detail and sound that made you feel like you were in the world itself do you want to be a heavy armor wearing archer a dual wielding wizard a vampire or maybe you just want to be an assassin your choices of character combinations are extensive each aspect of your character has a skill tree and actions like merely sneaking around will improve its skill and unlock a skill point with each passing level that can be used to specialize that ability even more and after you spend time specializing your character you have to move on to customizing their gear skyrim is a must own for rpg lovers gamers who enjoy open worlds and if you love dragons how do you not already have this game  beautiful visuals  great sounds and music  detailed and engrossing stories  great combat  open world and very customizable character progression  can be overwhelming for people new to the series  some glitches during combat very minimal score 10 out of 10

recommended
if you need a review to tell you to get this game this is it i started on xbox then moved to pc skyrim is well too much awesome to put in words it is a masterpiece on its own and one continually in the making the reason i say it is continually is the modding community the modding community has added so much replay value to an already amazing game for example the unofficial skyrim patch is a community effort to make all of the official skyrim and dlc bugfree and it has fixed tens of thousands of things not to mention all the mod choices out there you can have ones that change gameplay add spells armour weapons houses add entirely new stories and quest lines make the game 4x the quality of the hd dlc or help you run it on an older machine there are simply too many to mention here but if you are looking for something chances are there is already a mod out there for it as for dlc they are all excellent i recommend them all but i especially have a love for dawnguard probably because it was the first i owned
recommended
fus ro da this is the best game i have ever played thousands of times better than any large scale mmorpg such as world of warcraftthe only thing this game is missing is a multiplayer system and this game is a perfect unbeatable one hopefully when the elder scrolls online comes outmy hopes will come true
recommended
a great game but you dont need vino to tell you that come on dude what are you doing reading my review of skyrim go out and do something with your life or play skyrim thats what im doing
recommended
it was worth all the money i love what this game offers each mission contains a mystery surprise and a perfect history from my point of viewi like how thieves get out of the bushes and try to steal your moneyyou wont see itmight scare sometimes and a lot more to love abouth this gamei write here but it would mean a lot to readyou would not find a game like this for a whileshow if you like rpgtry skyrim best of his kind
recommended
i just have three litlle words about this game  buy this game thats really all i have to say about the game
recommended
okkkk cant believe that i didnt alredy made recomend to play for skyrim i mean it is darn elder scrolls game if you like rpg and if you like felling to have shivers down your back when you get dragon down game gives you total freedom to do what you wanna do and to approach quests way you like you can convince a fella to stop stealing from the girl or you can kill him orrr you can kill the girl and rob her of all her gold choice is yours question is which choice you will make
recommended
provides hours of fun great game alone or with workshop mods
recommended
do i really have to give a review you know what it ising amazing 1010
recommended
ive dropped more time into this game than almost my entire steam library so much fun
recommended
edited as of january 2nd 2015 its not as good as morrowind or oblivion if we start talking about storytelling and immersion but skyrim is a hell of a game and it won game of the year back in 2011 for an obvious reason its great and i know it really is when after 230 hours of game i still dicovering new places and things about it even now in 2015 if you ask me if you should buy it i would say yes without thinking twice its a mustplay along with the rest of the elder scrolls series and just like any other bethesda game when you start heavilly modding it itll become another game and then another game and then another game again and in the end itll be like you have bought a pack with at least 5 games and not just one
recommended
since paid mods cancelled i change my review to positive
recommended
paid mods have been removed hail tes
recommended
skyrim need i say more well yes kinda it is the best rpg made in my opinion and set the standards for all other rpgs should you buy this game yes should you buy the dlcs not for $1999 wait until theyre on sale and then buy them in the meantime download falskaarwyrmstooth if you get bored

adventure euphoria explore where you want when you want customize your character however you want awesome environments and landscapes a must play pros open world exploration crisp 1st person medieval combat create your own fighting style and improve abilities through usage massive amount of nonlinear content to explore tremendously large modding community lots of excellent expansions fantastic soundtrack the bread looks delicious extremely dedicated mod community cons the default inventory system is kind of a mess but mods can fix this if that sort of thing bothers you on rare occasion youll run into a bug like mammoths falling from the sky and such
recommended
well needless to say that skyrim is one of the best games around statistically its the most played singleplayer game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid438761906 httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid437323008

played about 150 hours on ps3 before buying legendary from steam still have not grown tired or touched the dlc content a superior game also mods greatly increase the lifetime
recommended
this game is amazing even if it came out in 2011 it is one of the best games i have ever played

recommended
everyone should at least try one of the elder scrolls games ]
recommended
i waited to play through this game and get both dlcs prior to writing a review the graphics hold up today with mods added if not still very beautiful and emmersive a the story of multiple different quests had me enthralled from start to finish though you have to find the quests that you specifically enjoy examples i came across a walking dog that led me to its talking deity that then ended in me deciding the dogs fate i joined a legion to defeat vampires and then betrayed them by becoming a vampire helping the lord of vampires himself i became the guardian of solitude before joining a rebellion to overthrow them i walked across a ice lake in a different dimmension that then led me to have to fight two dragons i summoned a dragon to aid me fight and it led to one of the most enjoyable scene of a realtime battle mechanic i have ever seen i usually fade in fantasy style video games but the immersive possibilities allowed me to still want more over a hundred of hours of quest experience and can have more added with mods different race aspects and many different styles of combat you may play this is a must have for any form of gamer as well as something a casual should atleast give a try one of the best purchases i have made and i will be continuing to come back to this game to this day
recommended
one of the most indepth visually stunning fantasy rpgs i have ever played if you love fantasy rpgs like i do you cant go wrong with this game
recommended
if you have a console and think about getting this game on consoledontthe game on the console is the alpha version of the gamethe game on pc is where its all at you have a ton of mods to chose from and your game will look 10 times better than it does on consoleor it will looke like a completely new gamewith changed climatelandscapes and whatever you want to do to the game
recommended
its good but most of the mods are terrible garbage too much garbage loot in these games too
recommended
its good
recommended
its awesome 1010 will kill all of tamriel again
recommended
its a genuine openworld sandbox with breathtaking visuals and endless encounters its a simple yet fluid combat system that leaves fighting both balanced and challenging its a bottomless pit of lore through dialogue interaction and honesttogod ingame short stories that brings a new meaning to total immersion its a variety of options to remind you that the first two letters in rpg stand for roleplaying its using your voice to shout a dragon out of the sky then stabbing it in the face with an enchanted sword you personally crafted its the elder scrolls its skyrim and now its 5 dollars its waiting for you

due to steams practices of selling mods other than creating a button for donating i must give this a negative review in protest
not recommended
paid mods wow just wow who in the world thought that was a good idea add a donate option as apposed to selling the mod and taking all the profit the only reason i bought this game on the computer is so that i could mod the living crap out of it shame on you valve and bethesda
not recommended
avoid like the plague this is now a dlc simulator hiding behind the mask of a way to help content creators when they barely get any of the profit
not recommended
less content than either morrowind or oblivion you used to be able to increase content with mods but now theyve nickled and dimed that away
not recommended
this is the game the never ever ends i picked this game up thinking i wouldnt like it having never played a previous tes game before sat in my library untouched for about a month or two and finally took the plunge i was wrong i was so very very wrong this is probably the best purchase ive ever made on steam add in the unlimited potential of modding and its an adventure that continues forever ive probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character and still only have beaten alduin once once theres still so much more do to and explore that im still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things i still cant believe how much there is to do and im still finding more at it stands ill probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as skyrim with how much ive played and im totally ok with that

i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun one of skyrims major cities when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot an orcish mace in the other they were on display for nobody but me and my computercontrolled housecarl lydia who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls dragons a civil war and job assignments that never seem to go as planned its even a sensible thing to do a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim one of the most fullyrealized easily enjoyable and utterly engrossing roleplaying games ever made part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated in skyrim theres no more moonhopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill thats gone so is athletics the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major you dont assign major and minor skills at all but instead pick one of ten races each with a specific bonus high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective closerange combat these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic sneaking and weapon combat emphasizing firsthand experience over instruction manual study letting you specialize only when youre ready it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim do a quest kill a dragon snatch torchbugs from the air munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within little feels random and useless even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities making every step you take even if its through what seems like total wilderness an exciting one as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame momentarily all on the battlefield unite directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature creating impromptu moments of camaraderie  a surprising change from what may have been yet another bythenumbers bandit camp sweep dragons show up often their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles stops to attack circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv can be completed in a few minutes and always offer a useful reward killing a dragon yields a soul which powers skyrims new shout system these are magical abilities any character can use you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time throw your voice change the weather call in allies blast out ice and fire or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force even if you favor sword shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story joined with the thieves guild fought alongside the dark brotherhood or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim not only is this land under assault by dragons long thought to be dead its also ripped in two by civil war you can choose one side or the other but so much of the allure of skyrim is how even outside of the confines of quest lines the embattled state of the world is evident and steeped in a rich fictional legacy lord of the rings this is not but with the release of every elder scrolls game the fiction becomes denser and the crossreferencing for longtime fans all the more rewarding skyrims residents are all aware of current events theyll comment on the civil war some sympathizing with the rebels others thinking the establishment sold its soul the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor many characters feel like whole distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans characters stereotype based on race they doublecross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable and they react to your evolving stature within the world it makes a ridiculous realm filled with computercontrolled cat people and humanoid reptiles demon gods and dragons feel authentic like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave
recommended
best game i ever bought in this game youll be sent back to the times where people fought with swords and bows a brilliant setting if you ask me the game lets you do whatever you want you can customize your character to your own style own personal favorite race and youll be able to fight any style you want do you want to play the sneaky elf archer with the bow no problem do you want to play the sneaky kahjiit thief with the daggers no problem do you dislike weapons and love to use magic no problem theres even lots of different spells either destruction or illusion maybe necromancy is more your style being a healer is no problem either you can make your own weapons by smithing you can make your own potions by gathering ingredients and mixing them into a potion with alchemy you can upgrade your weapons by using enchanting theres so much to do want to settle down after some adventures get to a town and drink mead at the inn or purchase a house or a piece of land to build a house with selffound materials or maybe bought materials whatever you want there are so many different playtroughs so much quests to play heck ive played this over 275 hours and i still havent completed all the quests i completely recommend this game i bought it at the releasedate 111111 and im still not done with it did i mention the steam workshop millions of mods to download without any fee enjoy

bethesda and valve are most likely testing this new mod pay system so they can implement it into fallout 4 with little resistance ask yourself why they would do this with a game that has been out for so long because by the time fallout 4 comes out they assume the internet will have moved onto the next big thing to complain about they now have a system in place where they can continue to make money off of the modding community while not investing any extra work or money valve and bethesda share equal responsibility for this cash grab of greed if valve and bethesda wanted to make sure the modders were able to ask for money a simple donation would work but with that system valve and bethesda are unable to take a cut of the profits this also leads to support if i buy a product i expect a certain a mount of compatibilitysupport what guarantees does valve and bethesda give me is there a review process for the mods to insure compatibility what about future updatespatchesdlc that could render mods useless does bethesda or valve guaranteed those will always work in the future lastly id like to a quote and reply from gabe newells qa on reddit yesterday  originally posted by gabenewellbellevue  actually money is how the community steers work  originally posted by one_long_year  funny the community successfully steered modding work in elder scrolls for about ten fng years with nothing but goodwill and thanks before you guys got involved quick review of the game  pretty boring without mods and customization too easy and not much variety in spells and fighting

was a great game singlehandedly ruined with the introduction of legally questionable paywalls for fanmade mods many modders have pulled their works from public as others began to steal them to turn a profit on steam and most of the money made from it goes to bethesdasteam rather than the creator themselves a shameless and blatant display of greed that is beginning to tear apart the modding community and pushing away people who genuinely liked and wanted to make this game more fun

1 it is changing a system that has been working fine modders arent an oppressed class working without benefit modders choose to work on mods for many reasons fun practice boredom the joy of creating something and gamers appreciate their contributions while some gamers may feel entitled most understand that if a modder is unable to continue the mod may be abandoned donations may or may not help but they are an option this system has for years made pc gaming what it is modding in my opinion is the primary benefit of pc gaming over console changing a functional system is dangerous and could have unintended consequences 2 now that people are paying for mods they will feel entitled for these mods to continue working if a free mod breaks and isnt supported that is fine because there is no obligation for it to continue working if someone pays though they will expect the mod to be updated and continue working as the base game is updated furthermore abandoned but popular mods are often revived by other people if these mods are paid then the original creator may not want people to profit off of updated versions of their mod 3 related to the above paid mods may reduce cooperative modding many mods will borrow elements from other mods usually with permission having paid mods will complicate things someone who makes a paid mod will be unlikely to share hisher work with others what if someone freely shares hisher mod and someone incorporates it into a paid mod does the first mods owner deserve compensation does the second modder deserve the full revenue this makes modding more politically complicated and may reduce cooperation 4 this may reduce mods based off of copyrighted works there is a very good chance that any paid mod based off of a copyrighted work will be shutdown modders could still release free mods of this nature but it complicates the issue many mods based on copyrighted materials borrow usually with permission from other mods to add improvements if these other mods are paid then the original creators likely wont let them use it additional many modders may now ignore copyrighted mods in order to make mods that they may profit on 5 steamthe developer are taking an unfairly large portion of the profit steam and the developers are offering nothing new to the situation steam is already hosting the mods and the developer already made the game they now wish to take 75% of all profit from the mod if the market gets flooded by lowquality paid mods the modders will likely make very little and the quality of the game will not be increased however steam and the developers will make money off of no work on there part until all mods are free again i will no longer support either company please reconsider

a must have game for all open world rpg fans fantasy fans and even for your girlfriends they can decorate houses adopt kids n stuff warning hearthfire 33  499 and a girlfriend  is needed all the quest lines were different original and not repetitive sure you will face some minor glitches and bugs but there are no big deal at all and they shloud not affect your gameplay experience maiq is tired now you go bother somebody else ps the people of skyrim are more openminded about certain things than people in other places which means samesex marriage is possible in skyrim

the entire game is based around the idea that you are special everything is very easy to the point where you could mindlessly aim at a creature click your mouse buttons and win the game you are powerful in a world that is made for you and cant really challenge you if you change the difficulty slider you are basically making the game unplayable as creatures will take forever to kill but kill you in short order this does not make it interesting it is boring the world feels empty and does not offer much at all as a huge fan of morrowind for me this game is a huge disappointment because this game is such a disappointment i tried using over 100 mods to fix the many problems i have with it the fact that other players made mods to fix these problems proves that i am not alone in feeling that this game is inadequate i appreciate all the hard work modders put into this game but bethesda and valve do not deserve to be paid for someone elses hobby
not recommended
very exciting game once you start off but unfortuately you realise the simplicity and lack of depth as you play more and more combat is hack and slash many quests are cloned fetch or complete this dungeon quests and dungeons lack true diversity because there are so many paraphrasing totalbiscuit the game is the size of an ocean with the depth of a paddling pool it is a shame because the game has potential mods can definitely improve your experience if youre willing to experiment but it can take time to compile a list and install them for your perfect experience ive been wanting to do this for a while although my review appears negative skyrim will provide you with many hours of enjoyment before it gets repetitive even without mods so i do recommend it

looks like valve found their new cash crop by taking the hard work from the vibrant modding community that has flourished for nearly 4 years without outside intervention and then decide its their right to make money off of it putting mods behind a paywall is the worst choice this company has made and reflects poorly on bethesda for allowing it to be done to their game lets see what their grubby little hands can get a hold of next

this game was almost a masterpiece when it came out  a vast world full of quests places to see people worth talking to it was a beautiful stone a true gem which was a bit rough around the edges but people enjoyed it and then came the mods they polished all that needed polishing made a game that was so great to many as to be called a true masterpiece up to this day there are always more than 30000 people playing it almost constantly 74k when im writing this and its not just because the game is great  its because the mods made this game close to perfect change whatever you want however you want and share it with fellow gamers this is what gave the game a 93% approval rating from gamers across steam platform thats how it used to be now we see a peculiar system where mods get a pay what you want price tag and you dont really know what youre paying for since you can download those paid mods after you buy it we are already getting mods that say they are a work in progress and more content will be done when its ready one mod taken down for using content made by another modder without the approval even though the borrower of content says he was told from steam people its ok as hes using free content and this is just the start of what well get in the near future we are seeing the modding communities already being shattered because of how absurd this paid mods idea is mods are becoming nothing more than dlcs only made by external subcontractors instead of the developer and the latter taking zero responsibility of the end products the industry will surely benefit from this maybe some modders as well but we gamers will loose in the long run is skyrim a bad game because of this no  its a great game 810 for vanilla 1010 with my favorite mods and will remain such regardless of what will happen this negative review is to show my disapproval for the above mentioned practices and those were introduced by no other than bethesda series owner and valve steam owner and unlike what other people who write negative reviews because of this claim mine will remain negative regardless of what happens to the paid mods idea as a boundary marker as we have crossed one and it seems there will be no turning back to sum it up skyrim  810 skyrim modded to ones liking  1010 paid mods de facto dlc  a fat 010

okay i can tell you that if you have played oblivion you would have most likely gone for this game aswell if you liked it or if you are not sure or want to know what they changed heres what has changed the oblivion main quest was absoultely brilliant and this onewell it is not as good but there more features and some new creatures at the cost of old ones and there are some satisfying killmoves in the game that make you feel more like you just killed them  you destroyed them however some of the quests in this are quite bland and far to rewarding for the task eg spoke to a guy in a bar and started a quest for him to deliver a message or something and the person he wanted it sent to was sat right next to him  no joke  and i got 250 gold for it in oblivion you would have to slay a  entire town full of imperial guards oblivion version to get that kind of money so half of the time in oblivion i would become right criminal scum and would try pickpocketing search barrels for anything to sell and would be over the moon finding 1 gold coin because cave raiding was certain doom for low levels and people of bad equipment in skyrim finding a gold coin is like finding a free potato you may not need it but will still take it and add to the forgotten pile what they did right  made it easier to level up in skyrim you could only level up on certain skills you picked on oblivion if your alchemy went up but was only a minor skill well tough  you are staying level 12  guards are much easier to defeat in oblivion if you stole a potato and didnt have money or want to go to jail then be prepared to be hunted down relentlessly and cut down like the criminal scum they come across daily also they wont randomly dart at you from a field in the middle of nowhere and question you about it  fighting things are easier oblivion had some really tough battles in them and at least once you would have to run away from a fight and would die at least several times if not then you are a god at oblivion and i salute you  civil war choose a side and fight to the death  gotta love getting revenge on those imperial guards if you played oblivion  the graphics are really good  and better with some mods what was wrong  the main quest is just quite bad to other titles in tes in oblivion you were protecting the cities from huge gates and hellish creatures and retaking cities from the evil with the town guard which feels like an achievement on its own  there isnt as good factions or faction quests oblivion had some really good faction quests especially with the dark brotherhood not gonna spoil but things keep flipping and so much drama happens there was also the fighters guild and mages guild and there was an arcane college but you had to get recommendations from all the guild halls in all the cities to get in which made it feel so much more challenging than just casting a spell to the woman outside allinall this game is great i have fun using a bow and other inventory i would suggest getting legendary editon for more quests and armors etc at the end of the day this is my opinion of the game and i find it great to play and have so much freedom to do what i want in it but try it for yourself

skyrim is an excellent rpg capable of suck many hours from your life it tells numerous engaging stories and delivers an immersive experience in the frozen nothern lands of skyrim if youve played other elder scrolls titles you have a decent idea of what to expect if not youre likely going to be pleasantly suprised the steam workshop mod support for this game open up a contanstly growing database of new east to install content well worth the money

one of the deepest rpg experiences ever and does the elder scrolls franchise justice the story is creative and unique and excellent combat isnt as deep as games like witcher 2 however its easy combat system allows for the game to be accessible to all the modding community & scene within the game is amazing if you are looking for a way to change the dynamic of the game or just a aesthetic change there will most likely be a mod for it weapons armor quests its all there the graphics are still quite good especially with the hd texture pack and combined with a enb the game looks glorious its a must buy

great game loved it for years community holds it together with mods and then steam gets a little too greedy and wants to charge money for previously free player made mods
not recommended
i love this game and have spent more time modding the game than actually playing it but paid mods are a big no for the whole pc community due to mods being more like personal projects in which thousand of hours have been spent individually for each mod just for the sake of improving the game and adding more content where you can spend extra hours or your whole life into because the immersion is where this game excels at and traditionally mods have been released exclusively for free and of course many modders deserve to be compensated for their hard work but valve executed a really bad plan just to address this unnecessary issue where putting a donation button could have been a simpler solution the game itself is good even without mods but i do not endorse the monetization of mods by any means nor does anyone else on the whole community

it is very sad to see a good game being ruined by the greed of corporations valve and bethesda are now charging money for mods with the mod creator getting only 25% of the cut this goes against the very nature of mods and can cause alot of issues many of the modders may stop supporting the paid mods and players will be left with a paid digital paperweight there is also the issue of people stealing mods from other sources and claiming that its theirs in order to earn easy money we all know that money sours relationships and it only took valve a couple of days to destroy skyrims modding community many of the mods were removed and many modders have packed their bags and left the skyrim modding community the tightly knit modding community has been reduced by people with the lust for money and it may never recover imagine if mods are paid back when valve was still a small fry dota 2 csgo and team fortress 2 would have never taken off to what it is today valve would simply be another small fry that could be crushed easily by big companies the modding community gave life to valve and they can also take life away from valve with that i have lost all respect for valve and gaben even ea couldnt come up with this idea of paid mods first clap clap

i implore everybody not to buy this game in its current state valve and bethesda have come together in order to dime and nickel us for every mod they can squeeze by convincing modders that its a good idea to sell their games in the steam workshop all while claiming 75% of their profits leaving modders with the measily remains of 25% do not support these practices as they ultimately lead to lazy developers relying on modders to fix their game a fragmented modding community thus less mods and no guarantee of proper future support for said mods if you truly want to support modders and believe they should be paid thusly ask them what methods you can use in order to donate money to them directly support modding but for the love of all that is logical do not support this

game itself is good if you disregard the limitations of the engine with the lack of graphical options that are easily accessable from within the game i cannot however recommend this game anymore due to the recent move towards monetization of mods which are pretty much what keeps skyrim playable after so many years the fact that valve and bethesda take 75% of the cut is not acceptable so i would advice for everyone who would like to contribute towards a modder to donate via different means
not recommended
what do we say about the game with massive amounts of free mods going to paid mods not to day ers
not recommended
i dont think valve or bethesda really realized it but somehow they thought paid mods would be a good idea i dont really know why they even thought that because both companies would never be where they are now without mods the entire tes series since morrowind was so good because of mods especially with oblivion the base game got a lot worse than it was before and i never would recommended them without its modding capabilities either valve should also know it better most valve games are all based on certain user created mods and its questionable if steam would have been in this position without them as well the whole thing isnt supporting mod authors either first of all there is a 75% cut off so the guys making the mods would only see 25% of that money but the main thing why this is bad is because mods always were a thing from the community for the community people put their heart and soul into those mods just to make their beloved game better without any thoughts about profit and how to maximize that now its just a question how to get the most money out of people with as less work as possible there is literally no quality control here and a lot of the paid mods have shown to be bad already while another big portion of the uploaded paid mods are not from the original creators if valve really would have cared then they would have given us one or more options to donate to the mod authors via the workshop other mod sites already have such a feature and there is no reason why steam cant have it as well its also really sad to see that gaben himself got a very weird view on the whole topic as shown on reddit hes literally acting like hes the king of the internet and now not understanding why everyone is so angry at him now i cant really go without steam since most of my games are here but i can buy them somewhere else in the future if they dont revert this back and i dont see why i should get any more bethesda games as well if they keep going this route and this comes from a person without origin & uplay

paid mods arent mods anymore they are dlcaddons i am really ashamed of valve for implementing so many atrocious microtransactions throughout their games and games on their distribution service and even more ashamed of the people who bought them and supported this practice the thought of what kind of  microtransactions valve will try to peddle with halflife three makes me want to vomit

skyrim is a game i would recommend to all players it has amazing graphics a good story and plenty of fun and dangerous quests to play through the beggining is no different from most elder scrolls since once again the story starts with you being in prison or arrested but past that skyrim opens you to a new world full of cavesdungeonscitiescampsand houses all throughout the world but i also have problems with the game since th pc version is very glitchy i sometimes take armor off a armor stand and put new armor on it then come back to see the old armor has duplicated replacing the armor i had put on there you might think oh you now can give that armor to your followers or sell it but this happens nearly everytime you leave your house and it is very frustrating the game also glitches on quests causing me to go back to previous game files which is bad and is something that needs to be fixed but in all skyrim will always be one of the best games to ever be made i have never seen any game like it and never will 910

i just nailed two dragons at the same time in this game i hate to admit it but the feeling was better than the feeling i get at the end of coitus if you have a job youre going to get fired if you go to school youre going to get fs if you have a girlguy theyre not going to hear from you for about a week if i had to chose between doing coke or playing this game i would do coke because it seems like the less addicting choice best game of the decade by far

one of those games you will remember and perhaps play 510 years after it came out skyrim shines by very early on letting you into a vast open world where you can go anywhere you can pick a direction and go along the way you will find all sorts of interesting quests npcs treasure etc the game is an rpg where you level up based on the skills you use the more skillstalents you use the more exp you gain you gain perk points upon leveling up to increase skill trees related to almost anything you can think of in an rpg warrior thief lockpicking armor etc combat is a little simple but still fun there are vast amounts of weapons to choose from you can use magic you can use quick or heavy attacks you can block and parry to stun first and 3rd person cameras are available i could spend pages describing the different weapons and spells its got a great story good graphics and almost infinite gameplay the real magic comes from the modders there are so many amazing mods out there for this game from the quality of life changes like skyui to graphical encancement mods enb to full new areas and quests added you can find almost anything you want the game is all about the adventure you create for yourself my only negatives to note would be the combat its fun but i just wish it was a little deeper in strategy i still enjoy it but if there was one area the game is lacking a little its the combat just a little bit lacking a must own game and a must mod game just remember use skyrim nexus and not steam workshop nexus does not censor any content most big amazing mods are only on the nexus and their mod manager is very useful
recommended
definitley a breakthrough in rpgs

this isnt just a game this is life no really i do not know of what one could dislike about this game whilst it does scream like me as a game title you cant help but love it as much as it wants you too the storyline in skyrim is amazingly immersive the first time you play through it while i played through it i felt a since of urgency to stop alduin and save tamerial from him the only real downside to this game is that theres not really the ability to be an evil character per example why not rule beside alduin instead of killing him why not kill the greybeards once youve the ability to or kill all the jarls and declare yourself king of skyrim the lack of options in those specific areas are a downside to it however theres so much content here that youd be an idiot not to buy it this game is to me the definition of perfection easily the best game ive played through and then it gets even better with mods case closed this is a 10 out of 10
recommended
if you havent played this game then i feel sorry for you this game isnt for everyone but it is a great game it has a great storyline that made me feel like i never ran out of things to do you dont have to do the story because it is open world you can go any where and the map is huge there are lots of weapons and spells to fight beings and dragons oh wait i forgot to say it has freaking dragons if you wonder if this game is worth it well it is the graphics look next gen but the game was made in 2011 that is impressive
recommended
pros probably one of the most enjoyable games ive ever played graphics 1010 gameplay 1010 cons you dont have a real life after you play this game lol
recommended
as a person with attention deficit disorder i generally find that ten hours is the best that i can dedicate to a game without getting bored of it im well past that in skyrim and am still enjoying the gameplay
recommended
i cant stop playing someone please help me
recommended
amazing game lots to do if you have never played this game then you have never lived

recommended

recommended
this is an epic game its one of my favorites but not my absolluter favorite the great thing about is mostley never lag

amazing game if your computer can handle it the graphics look amazing i would not recommend playing vanilla add some mods spice it up a bit the gameplay is good controls are good has 1 to 1 headtracking hours and hours of fun if you are reading this and you have completed every quest in skyrim ever i congratulate you if you have just bought skyrim i encourage you to finish the main questline at your own pace not right away anways the game is great totally worth the money

so im not much for reviews but honestly this game needs one written by me this game was one of the games i really wanted but never laid my own eyes on for awhile then i obtained it for my xbox as well as my computer the first time playing it i felt like throwing my computer out of a window because i didnt understand the mechanics then i learned to love this game it has loading screens sure but theyre entertaining to read because they will give you a 3d model to play with and some lore related hints as well as very helpful hints the main story was interesting but scary in a good way like youre randomly called to arms as the dragonborn and you have to complete the prophecy of killing one of the strongest enemies tamriel history and if youre like me then you will shiver the first time playing this but its good that it feels so real everyone watches movies with someone called at an impossible task and youre like i wonder what it feels like to be the hero like that this is the game to find out whats its like plus them game is beautiful insanely beautiful i play alot of rpgs and i have never encountered one just like this its utterly unique this game will make you raise higher than you have ever been it will also will lower you lower than you have ever been you can go from saving tamriel and trusting the greybeards then go to sovngarde to slay the worldeater or you could betray the greybeards and help the old and powerful blades on their conquest to serve the dragonborn you will either be the hero that obeys the laws save the innocent and slay the evil or you could be the villian that slays the innocent and serves the evil dremora or you could be entirely neutral either ways it is your decision on everything its entirely your decision on who you want to be you could be a friendly orc that gives people golden rings or you could be a high elf that burns down villages you can serve any of the gods that suites you best hell you could even serve a daedric prince you could be the general of the stormcloaks or the legate of the empire then if you want to be an archer so be it find yourself a bow and some arrows or you could be a powerful mage or maybe a bit of both the customation is limitless you dont have to just be a fighter you can be a smith or a enchanter then again you could be a alchemist you can have a wife or a husband depending on who you want to be the game never ceases to amaze me the difficulty never changes the creatures will scale to your level then some will just be hard the rest of the game as well as some monsters like wolves are just there to say hi so keep in mind who youre dealing with maybe if you are about to fight something strong do some research this game will show you what its like to be the chosen one to save a planet the dlcs cost much but are certainly worth it one you will learn what it means to be dragonborn by fighting the very first dragonborn another will let you live life with your family in a house and a child then the last one will make you shiver as you fight vampires or become one thanks to this game having a workshop you can even expand the world this game will teach you that life is what you make of it you can either make lemonade with your lemons or throw them back at the world you can break the law at your own will be you will learn there will be a punishment you can help the people of skyrim and feel the greatness of helping someone out the reward will not matter to you just the smile on their face as you give them back their prized whatever it is or you can help people just get some coin in your pocket either way it doesnt matter you can be the best blackmailer or the nicest person alive you can learn the history of skyrim heck you can even learn the history of all of tamriel if you havent and or dont want to play the previous titles no problem they have hidden books all over skyrim that tell you the story of oblivion and earlier titles if you love a game that isnt too much for you to take in and love a customation at the same time being your own person then this game is for you if you love slaying dragons with just three words and terrorising villages you will love this game if you want to save people from the evils of the planet and gain some new friends this will be your standing stone of glory i heavily recommend this game for any of those people out there that want a new adventure that will change your life
recommended
its neato
recommended
its a big open world game that doesnt feel boring or just filled with randomness its a great gaming experience as a whole its especially a wonderful game if youre an rpg fan however it appeals to most audiences positive  a world filled with great places to explore  main quests and side quests that feels fun to carry out  great combat that challenges your skills  a fine story and not just a lot of filling boring chitchat  fast loading rendering and saving remembers where things are left in the world etc negative  the puzzles are adding to the whole of the game but they could have been more fun and challenging  sometimes the animations are a bit stiff the characters could have had better facial expressions  there are still bugs and glitches in the game  only singeplayer there could have been coop for missions andor pvp however not every game necessarily needs mp my verdict so far 1010
recommended
when i first entered the world of skyrim i was immersed in a fantasy setting where i was quickly thrust into a position of power and entrusted with the responsibility to save the world this is where the fantasy stops similarly to any human suddenly gifted with immesurable power i proceeded disregard the responsibilities of my newfound abilities and proceeded to instead enact horrible deeds on the citys guards and townsfolk it begins to become painfully clear that skyrim is not as much of a fantasy game as it is a digital exression of the depravity of humans when given the means to enact their deep and twisted desires an excellent existential simulator questioning the depth of vileness to which a human soul can delve into skyrim poses many deep philosophical points such as tyrrany racism and the uselessness of having a %based pickpocket system if you have quicksave and quickload and reaching the ultimate conclusion of fck it if you kill dragons you must be right
recommended
skyrim oh glorius skyrim this game could be my favorite of all time i must have made 20 characters playing this game because i was so curios as to the different options to choose from going in to it i had no idea the lore or universe of the scrolls franchise but immediatley delved in the lore is intereting and makes sense the universe of the game feels somewhat freindly as you step into the open wilds of the tundra but talk to npcs and as you complete quests you begin to notice really how many insane problems skyrim has the game invites you to be a strong nordic viking a stealthy theiving cat or an expert mage in all honesty though it encourages you to mix and match and do whatever you want for example like being an elf who wears heavy armor or a nord who slits throats with dual daggers it dosent really have many boundraies unlike some of bethesdas other games like fallout which is also one of my favorites despite bugs or flaws i dont have a counter but ive put a lot of hours into this gameif you look at steam playtime it might be realtivley small because i used to play on 360 there are a number of things you can do like finish the main quest get the best weapons and armor through smithingvery tedious complete the companions quest line and other spoilers that i will not say complete the mages guild quest line complete the theives guild quest line complete the dark brotherhood quest line or destroy it by talking to commander caius choose sides in the great war and complete the quests to restore order for your chosen faction investigate the forsworn consipacy if you have dawnguard dragonborn or hearthfire dlcs defintley do all you can in them do quests for the many daedric lords fufill side quests for the trobuled people in skyrim get as many thuum shouts as you can and kill as many dragons as you can if you can get mods get them the modding community has very talented people in it and most inportantly have fun in the world and fusrodah any guard that says he took an arrow in the knee 1010

i do recommend this game

saw an offensive pornography modification on the skyrim nexus and i had to analyse it on its level of sexiness i was required to enter the angle of penetration and divide it by the cosine of x i then weighed the apparatus used appropriately so that the shlongs used were more than apt for deep penetration i then 3d printed a model of this modification and use it to compensate for my extreme height and lack of pornography which i reject to watch  pigfilth the lot of it to conclude do not buy this game it is a pornographic game with a sick twisted community that will only purchase it for the bouncing breasts and buttocks highly recommend henry mellor 2015
recommended
skyrim without a doubt is one of the greatest games ever created it has a lush open world that is ready to explore every customization option you could crave robust and intelligent quests memorable moments and secrets hidden deep within if you are willing to look dark brotherhood for example i have clocked 25 hours and am still nowhere near completing the main story or finishing a fraction of the side quests i would be surprised if i finished this before clocking 100 hours and i wouldnt be surprised if i end up clocking 1000 worth the money worth the time every person should treat themselves to this experience

very good game really appreciate  thx
recommended
i love this game so endless the music the quests everythingcan spend hours just exploring and go and kill some draugr deathlords spiders etc so many things you can kill too xd or make friendsfor me there was little bugs so i was really happy about it i really recommend if you like to explore and just have fun doing side quests some are like fetch this fetch that but on the way you can talk to certain people and get more quests its fun overall 3 really recommend this to everyone ^_^bb <3
recommended
this game is just as great as it was 3 years ago and with the contribution of the countless mods on the workshop and nexus it is still way better than alot of recent games it has an unlimited replay vaule with loads of different play styles meaning there will be new stuff to find in every playthrough 1010 bring on elder scrolls 6
recommended
this game is by default amazing i recomend this to all and every gamer because there is no doubt that they will like it
recommended
recently started playing again and immediately i was greeted with that old beautiful engine added some mods and then it got even better with the addition of various immersion mods it really feels like i am right there in tamriel the snow feels cold and the rain wet cant wait for the next installment
recommended
excellent game worth every penny spent for the hours of entertainment value gained also happens to be one of the less buggy bethesda products
recommended
buy and feel the story of the game
recommended
how does this game keep getting to the top selling games everytime it goes on sale how is it possible that people dont have this game already
recommended
the only shortcoming of this game is that everyone every npc has a zero tolerance policy try to pickpocket ralof and you will regret if you havent saved earlier other than that this game is perfect anyway children shouldnt come here to avoid nightmares
recommended
i can mod willies flopping around everywhere nuff said
recommended
its okay
recommended
definately one of my favorite games in my collection i have little over 150ish hours in this game just on pc yes i know that this is not a long time but i have near 1000 in console if you like open world games where you are pretty much free to do anything you choose this game is for you
recommended
this game is fun with friends
recommended
this is a game that no one has ever heard about just kidding great game good follow up after oblivion and never gets old even if it does get old theres hundreds of mods
recommended
so much to do endless hours of replayability with mods
recommended
this has to be 1 of the best games created how can it be so addictive 
recommended
one of the best modern rpgs you can really lose yourself in this type of game hundreds upon hundreds of hours can be poured into this game the game is molded to how ever you want to play it your skills and weapons are your choice to reach the maximum flexibility and fun of the game i recommend to pick up the legendary edition and get modding you can add quests new lands armour weapons creatures textures and even make yourself a regular joe in skyrim 1010
recommended
hours of fun
recommended
this is just an amazing game there is just so much to discover just awesome  d

recommended
without a doubt one of the best games ive ever played its practically neverending and theres always something to do if you like to play a game for a long period of time this is definitely the game for you
recommended
i first played this game on xbox 360 and completed the entire game and dlc i then purchased it on my computer and have had an absolutely wonderful experience on my second play through i have over 200 hours of game time into modding alone and still havent finished the main quest the modding community has put the game into the beyond ps4 era if you have the hardware i have nothing but good remarks and can honestly say this may be my favorite game of all time zelda is a close second if your on the fence with this one delve into skyrim because you can make this game better than anything that will come out in the next five years if you have the patience and determination dont believe it check out my screenshots
recommended
this game is totally badass i loved oblivion and i love skyrim too i definitly recommend this game to all rpg fans stay awesome bethesda
recommended
still one of the best rpgs you can get got a total playtime of over 600h and still cant get enough of it graphic is with the hd textures and mods amazing the mod community is just great and if the normal game bores you you can always get some amazing mods and the game will be as amazing like when you played it for the first time
recommended
best game everlost my life becuse of this game999999995 stars
recommended
love it havent jumped into all the dlc yet but so far so good
recommended
i love skyrim and i will be playing teso as well if you ahve not played any of the elder scrolls games please give them a try
recommended
quite a good game in default level scaling is not as much obvious as was in oblivion for best playthrough i suggest of using some overhaul mods which makes it perfect
recommended
great game buy it u filthy
recommended
even after playing this game so many times it still has not lost any playablilty and this is due to the great work everyone is doing through the workshop
recommended
surely a game this massive in scale requires a review of similar proportion where do i begin the graphics the gameplay the lore ill start at the beginning first off this game is nothing like roller coaster tycoon in fact skyrim and rct are about as far away from each other on the spectrum of gaming as they can be so if youre looking for a quality theme park buildingmanagement simulator or any theme park buildingmanagement simulator do not look to the elder scrolls series you begin your quest as a lowly prisoner in the back of a wagon the offense is border hopping and the punishment is death by axe sure beats a big ol wall huh us government on the way to the execution you meet fellow prisoner roggvir a key member in a group of rebels called the stormcloaks who want to take back skyrim from the imperial legion the people who are executing you and put the nords back in command when you arrive at the executionplace in helgen a guard asks you for your name now say what you want about the imperial legion but these people have some patience i sat there for 45 minutes thinking of a name and rearranging my race face and gender to my liking and they just waited for me to finish finally i decided on jikrel a magicianjuggler inspired by my hero penn jillette properly named and pampered im ready to get my head chopped off just before the axe comes down however a conveniently timed plot device swoops down and proceeds to burn the city to the ground it is at this point that the player can decide whether to escape with roggvir the handsome rebel with a cause or someoneelseiforgothisname a dirty imperial pig while the choice doesnt make a difference at this point in the game it presents the player with the concept of choosing sides in a convoluted almost entirely pointless side quest involving the great civil war of skyrim racist rebels or idiotic imperials the choice is yours to make or not once youve escaped youre free to go anywhere in the overworld you desire do any side quests you want tackle the main storyline or just goof around and break the games ai i opted for the latter dont get me wrong there are a lot of things to do in skyrim its just that most of them arent fun or interesting i tried to give the main quest a go but around the seventeenth plot device and ninth fetch quest or so i just got sick of it and quit i had to replace the stock plot device fighthing music to a pitcheddown rendition of frank zappas no not now just to make it that far im going to be honest here the most fun ive had playing this game ive had roleplaying a psychopathic serial rapistenema banditmurderer that slits peoples throats dry humps their still warm corpses and dumps them in the nearest rivercrevicehumorous location he can find what this says about myself i dont know but i do know what it says about the games quests theyre not good in fact i found the games quests were obstructing my overall goal of blindly murdering everything in my path ever since oblivion bethesda has felt the need to make certain npcs that are essential to the games completion unkillable i had to download a mod so that i could kill them and thus continue having fun oh and dont get me started on the mods nude mods better female mods sexy armor mods what is this a sick joke how horny are you people but i digress to sum it up skyrim is worse than oblivion because it is better than oblivion bethesda dont seem to realize that their games are inherently goofy and are perfect that way the more they try to make it badass or epic or the more bad face textures and ai bugs they fix the worse it gets i dont even think the intended audience for these games takes them seriously considering the number of great dumb mods there are out there battletoad rash all in all id buy it because its still a pretty enjoyable experience and im sure everybody can find something to do in this massively dumb roleplaying actionadventure game oh and the graphics are pretty good i guess 710 plot devicedragon
recommended
what can i say really that as not already been said its a pretty awesome game
recommended
fun as long as you dont mind running around like a headless chicken
recommended
syrim is the perfect mix between action and adventure the creatability and choices make this game easily my favorite the endles amount of quests and story make it a non stop joy ride and the graphice they cant be beat i highly recommend
recommended
this is a great game
recommended
this is a very fun game but eventually gets a little boring until you fight some dragons
recommended
this game is sick it is such a big and beautiful world with so many places to explore 2 years later with new dlc installed and this game is still awesome to play plus the endless mods are always fun to try
recommended
its like oblivion only with beliveable characters and a good story and fun gameplay and unique locations to explore and reasonable system requirements and all those other things they forgot to put into oblivion because they were too busy masturbating over shaders and poorly optimized textures so its like oblivion only good
recommended
love it can play play play then leave it and come back again and again love the mods you can get
recommended
reallt fun game be a dark elf
recommended
look no further this game is awsome
recommended
what else do i have to say besides one of the most addicting games on the planet
recommended
one of the manliest rpg games on the planet duh you have to buy it
recommended
if you love a game full of adventure and modding along with blasting ppl with a shout this is a game for you xd
recommended
although i only recently purchased skyrim i must thank a good friend of mine to give me his copy i accumulated over 600hrs since 2012 and i had to buy the game for myself skyrim is not without its flaws suffering from a bland main plot and some bugs but this is one of those games that you will never put down like all other elder scrolls games the world and lore is giant and immersive after completed the main storyline quickly i was a little disappointed the main storyline leaves much to be desired but that is not what kept me playing skyrim there are multiple story arcs that you may complete that do not necessarily contribute to the main storyline some are great others are tetius i only put maybe 30hrs into the main storyline and after that is when skyrim really begins to shine exploring skyrim is amazing reading lore discovering dwemer ruins participating in a civil war it never gets old at this point modding is a great idea installing an enb makes it look better than some games released in late 2013 mods that add quests and expand on the world with mods the game is truly endless i will never stop playing skyrim 95 near perfect
recommended
really worth spending my cash on but only one word can describe this game and that is amazing i mean the graphics the storyline the fighting its just breathtaking definitly recommend buying this game when you have the chance
recommended
best game ever made by the legendary editoin worth it buy now 1010
recommended
in this game ye get tae stab people
recommended
ruined my non existent life but i love it lewl
recommended
the way it is with all bethseda games beautiful world great setting short main storyline interesting side story many many sidequests much to see and much to do  the other side of the coin bugs  bugs everywhere glitchin through objects and gettin stuck  npcs glitchin around quests not starting some quests become stuck and cant be completed random ctds and so on  thanks to the community there are unofficial patches for the game and the dlcs and boy they are needed  bestheda one question  what would you do without the community that loves your games let me answer that question for you  you would be out of business in 6 months and for the enhanced game experience go get yourself a lot of mods but be careful of the random ctds
recommended
now i have a girl playing skyrim with me i love her i love myself and i love skyrim well both be adventurers
recommended
had it console got bored after 300 hours got it on pc now i have an infinite time waster due to mods this games gunna ruin my life
recommended
this game is like another world the atmosphere is perfect combat flawless and graphics astonishing along with workshop addons it doesnt get much better than this
recommended
skyrim is one of the best gaming experiences of this generation if only for the amazing array of mods that have been produced for it do yourself a favor take the time to mod this game you wont regret it
recommended
while oblivion in the original game better and made with much more care than skyrim but mods are what make the game making the ropey vanilla visuals to crysislevel graphicsimprove the gameplayadd itemsadd storiesadd mapsadd questsadd charactersskinsweapons anything is possible 1010
recommended
one phrasewhile the game is already awesome i found that a mod here or there really made the game alot more enjoyablethat is until i went crazy with the mods and i had like 50 mods installed and the game still did not laganyway its an amazing gamei suggest it to anyone who likes to use a swordsneak up on people and shoot them with a bow in their  or if you like magic
recommended
a bear killed a dragon 1110
recommended
this game rocks an rpg that is totally explorable it is so big you get lost in it
recommended
this game is never ending it will take over your whole life dont even bother getting the dlc because it will just pull you in even more till one day you wake up to see a dragon hovering over you
recommended
an absolutely wonderful timesink first time ive played a game in this series so i can vouch for its accesibility and the mods available for this game allow for a truly varied experience from person to person it is a first person action medieval warfare game where you go on quests in an open world easily one of the best games of the last few years all of the dlc is a little overpriced  getting the legendary edition is the way to go but dragonborn is worth $10 or so dawnguard about $5 and hearthfire only about $250 all of them warrant a look if you enjoy the game though
recommended
great game  great history  live another life  be another hero  be a villain  you choose  the most important part of this game for me was the history  that u can modify every moment divine parts of the game that make me love it  and one of them was the end of main history that makes u feel complete with yourself  some npcs are dumb  but others are really smart that makes the game equilibrated  every choose can have different reactions  this is art in pixels  this is skyrim 
recommended
this game is truly amazing it is worth every penny this game has mod support and there are thousands of mods out there that make this game never get boring this is a must buy
recommended
this is maybe the best rpg game if not the best game of all time the map is huge and it has many side quests and random quests and you can really just do whatever from murdering citizens to riding dragons
recommended
this is one of the best rpg games ive ever played 910
recommended
bethesda has outdone themselves yet again with skyrim perfecting the open world genre and building upon their previous games skyrim is a perfect open world fantasy actionrpg there are a limitless amount of side quests and a plethora of primary quests and guild missions this game will keep you busy for at least 100s of hours maybe more depending on your play style the game supports multiple play types and character classes and is one of the few rpgs to allow you to multiclass this game is completely worth the list price and in my opinion is the best fantasy game on the market today
recommended
i played this game for almost 500 hours
recommended
good game lots of fun cant wait for elder scrolls online
recommended
top class openworld rpg in terms of content scope and general ambition its incredible worth every penny
recommended
wonderful game if you want an open world with quite a bit to do the expansions add more to the wonderful lore that is elder scrolls a great game but fairly glitchy even with mods recomend going to nexus to find mods that interest you
recommended
its never too late to buy this game buy it right now now now now
recommended
skyrim is probably the most beautiful elder scrolls games ever and one of the best games ever the map is fun to explore with many different characters to fall in love with its one of the only games i enjoy levelling up my miscellanious skills blacksmithing speech etc you are not a gamer if you never played a tleast one of the elder scrolls games  so if you havent skyrim is the place to start although not even a year after buying the game i found that i was heavily relying on different mods and dlc the story is basically the same no matter what and even though there are some small choices there isnt a lot for an rpg the choices all lead to the same out come just some different dialogue
recommended
skyrim is truly one of the best games i have ever played it has endless hours of fun in the base game plus a huge collection of mods and three massive expansions if you havent taken the plunge into tes 5 do it now
recommended
easily the greatest game i have ever played
recommended
my gran was pro at skyrim before she embarked on a journey to find true peace and solitude with the greybeards please honour her and buy the game

one of the best singleplayer open world rpgs i ve ever played

to be honest if youre reading skyrim reviews its not because youre on the fence about actually buying the game so i dont feel the need to write some form of lengthy review of the most well known rpg of the past decade edit apparently valve removed monetization of modsfor now i am keeping my editorial rant up but changing my recommendation because frankly skyrim really is just a damn fine game the language of the pr release however suggests that they are going to come out something else so becoming complacent in victory would be an extremely bad idea for a sense of context i want to point out i am all for mod makers being compensated for their work through donations i have no problem donating money to mod makers if they provide me with a worthwhile addition to my game and give this addition free of upfront charge i understand the amount of work some of these people put into their mods and i wholeheartedly think they deserve something for their passion and work turning mods into dlc is however insulting to not only me as a gamer but the mod maker as they become an exploited worker this doesnt have to be the case they can all make money and make people happy at the same time if they werent so fcking greedy to start with if steam radically changes the system to be only donations only donations taking less then 20% for themselves and bethesda then all involved would make far more money total and come out of this looking flawless from a pr point of view as an example i have bought premium currency or what have you from good free to play games i have enjoyed as you can see in my profile i have played a lot of warframe and have donated a lot of money to the company by now its probably a few hundred of dollars over the years which yes is a lot of money to most people because they are offering me an ever improving game completely free and i think they deserve something if warframe had demanded a subscription or money up front they would of made nothing off me as i never would of played it to begin with there are a lot of gamers like me gamers that have funded plenty of free to play games like dwarf fortress have given money to the humble bundles far exceeding the minimal amount and funded plenty of games on kickstarter due to nothing more then altruism and a belief in a fellow gamers passion to improve the industry a modding paywall however feels as though valve bethesda and even a few modders themselves are  on the very notion of what makes pc gaming great it is insulting to me as a gamer it is insulting to us all as a culture and it is something that should not be tolerated with the way the system exists now or rather how it existed before the rollback i will not be buying games through steam unless i have no choice and i will never pay for a mod ever i am more then happy to send a donation to a few modders who do exceptional work interesting npcs comes to mind but any modder who hides their content behind a paywall will lose my respect and any chance of ever getting money off me id also like to point out that monetizing and releasing total conversions which create an entirely new game using an existing engine such as garys mod and dayz are not the same thing as paying for skyrim mods i cant fathom why certain people involved in this side of modding the need to voice their opinion when they clearly have no idea what theyre talking about

it was pretty good ngl
recommended
words cannot describe how much content does this game have and the modding community oh the modding community
recommended
hands down the best game i have played so much to do random events on the roads and the such make it quite interesting at anytime the game also has a strong modding community so if you got absolutely everything finished in skyrim you can download custom quests and whatever if you are thinking about buying it do it 1010
recommended
this game is so much fun i love it the reason why i got this game is because of this awesome mod called legend of the toa it adds 6 races of biomechanical warriors that are heroes known as toa

ah skyrim what a wonderful game time and time again i have found myself returning to the snowy beautiful landscape that is this games portrayal of tamriel each time making a new character and finding new ways to play the game looks astounding the dark feel creates an atmosphere like none other but it somehow remains silly with all of the bugs never fixed the enemies are unique not so much in their abilities but in their style in the open landscapes youll find necromancers and wolves but in dungeons and caves youll draugr the equivalent of zombies skeletons and sometimes machines made by the ancient race called the dwemer things like this make environments special and interestingly varied the one complaint i have with the beauty is that the great mountains you can see in the distance throughout your travels arent always so spectacular when trying to traverse the countryside the mountains usually just get in the way travelling around them is the easiest option but by using the aforementioned bugs you can run up vertical slopes and clear them if not entirely easily the elder scrolls series is praised for its customization and skyrim offers the same amount as any other each type of weapon has its own skill tree and combining certain powers can make the game exceedingly fun an assassin is not limited to blades oh no there is a school of magic that can aid in sneaking and can come in handy when difficult situations present themselves or you can be a battleaxe wielding mage if you so desire using conjuration and alteration magic can grant defense and weapons without the toll on your inventory that real armor takes more examples exist and playing the game can reveal them quests are more fun in this game than most others i feel while in many rpgs quests are there just for the sake of having them skyrim was built around them bethesda got voice actors to record lines for dozens of questlines and the quests themselves consist of more than kill that thing or get that other thing they have plots and unique impacts on the world making them much more substantial feeling than those of say pillars of eternitys which are vaguely intriguing at best and soulless at worst every time i hear the iconic song that plays on the main menu i think of adventure of wonder of fun skyrim isnt a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination but whether youre looking for an rpg to get involved in or just a time waster this game has something to satisfy everyone
recommended
skyrim is somewhat of a downgrade from previous games in the series the environment is dull and lacks diversity i get that its a northern environment but it could still look so much better the ui is terrible for pc skills arent balanced at all and the combat is boring and repetitive if it wasnt for mods i wouldnt really bother with this game
not recommended
this happens to be a game that i wanted to play for a long time when i got it i was amazed at how customizable everything is if you are a fan of lord of the rings or anything midevil or middlearth this is a game for you
recommended
1010 has ruined my life completely absorbed all of my attention from my family and has genuinely turned me into a potato you can shout at people and make them fly away 1010 would play again great game buy it and mod the  out of it {need a decent pc to mod} gg

the elder scrolls games were always good base games that became great after the modding community got a hold of it with the introduction of paid dlc as opposed to some form of donation that the user can choose i would not recommend this game at the moment

the world of skyrim is huge and immersive you are a dragonborn your actions will shape the land your shouts will be heard beasts to battle dragons to slay books to read secrets to be unlocked destiny is in your hands i highly recommend this game for anyone who loves adventure 910
recommended
definitely recommend had it when it first came out on xbox and then got it for pc cos mods the skill system is done very well can create so many different types of classes and experiment away unlike on oblivion the stealth system actually works and the sneak perk tree is amazing the amount of freedom and things to do in its open world is just gawd you get me so wet skyrim bby never run out of things to do whilst free roaming once sat down for a pint with a stranger woke up in a temple of mara and had to retrace my steps long story short i married a hagraven gave someones goat to a giant and got  with a ing daedric prince smithing and enchanting are hard to level but extremely rewarding i usually dislike rpgs that dont hide the best loot in a tiny percent chance to find in a random enemy but the system is just done really well gotta be honest swordsclose weaponry combat can be dull but the rewards of smithing and enchanting make up for it also if you use close weaponry you gotta go for that palading restoration alteration buld or git gud magic skill trees make me ing wet and getting the master level spells made me  could ennchant armour to make it free to cast destruction magic but at the fourfeit of enchanting slots obviously when you get highest level enchanting you can do this to two things though but i prefer to mix it up and spread myself in resto alt destruction and conj doe <3 amazing game buy it especially while its on offer
recommended
skyrim is a single player game based in medivalish times with a massive map to explore i think this game is good for anyone wanting to take on dragons murderers and bandits on by themselvs i would rate this game 8510

you cant get a better singleplayer on steam i double dare you its seroiusly 1010
recommended
i always feel like its pointless to write a review for a bethesda game as the rule of thumb is whatever you dont like you can remove whatever is missing you can add due to the very strong mod scene presence surrounding the games but ill try to clarify that skyrim if not for mods would have been the weakest entry in the tes series to date and was largely saved by its mods skyrim tries to wow people over with flash the promo videos are very guilty of this with how they played up dragon combat it is far far less epic in game than the videos made it out to be the questlines were some of the worst of the series in my opinion though the main questlines is somewhat better than oblivions just as a guide point probably the funnest questline happens in the dlc dragonborn and that is mostly due to the realm of hermeaus mora being unique and entertaining if it wasnt for mods this game would be trash i had to get that jab out because while the mods thankfully exist it should not hold bethesda completely unaccountable and these days i feel they release games in the complete hope that the mod community will fix it for them
recommended
great gameplay countless quests lots of possible playthroughs in this rpg game skyrim is sure to make you hooked as you unveil more and more of its outstanding and carefully made story the fact that it high is in the top 10 of the most played games on steam surely has to mean something i dont even know if there are any negative reviews about this masterpiece another reason to get this game is that despite it being a 2011 game its modding community is still really active and it is one of the best modding communities if not the best so what are you waiting for get this awesome game now oh and i dont even need to mention the meems and fus roh dah
recommended
even if you dont play rpgs this game will be worth it to at least try out it has a lot of content is very addicting and will also be worth the price you dont even need to play the quests only exploring the world is still something you can have fun with the main quest can easily be completed in about 20 hours but i have over 100 because there are numerous other side and miscellaneous ones and if all the dragon slaying shouting pickpocketing sneaking time travelling bandit killing gold hoarding and number of deer you can shoot in the butt wasnt enough you can still install mods hundreds of course you should be aware that this may cause unwanted crashing so make sure you can handle them all from graphic mods to dlc sized quests theres sure something you will pick my only problem with the game is the ing mountains 910
recommended
hey valve guess what nobody wants to pay for ing mods
not recommended
i harvested a potato 6969 would buy again

awesome game that is quite addictive to play however dont burn yourself out while playing it

stand in a furnace nothing happens jump on a wooden wheelbarrow instant death 1010 would parkour again

its good but dont overload your skyrim game with mods if you do it will screw up your data if you want mods i would suggest picking no less then 4 mods i recommend inigo alot if you like talkitive companions

dont buy it you will get addicted and you will never see sunlight again

farengar secretfire thought he was a boss sending thugs after a vampire thief assassin all was well for him besides the occassional feeding on him in his sleep unbeknownst to him until came the creation of a wizard now this was no ordinary wizard it was a wizard of the undead variety known as a lich as anyone can tell you a lich is a being of pure hatred and despair doing as he pleases with anything or anyone unlucky enough to cross paths with one having heard of this wannabe wizard the lich set his sights on the jarl of whiteruns home of dragonsreach it was late that night when the lich hovered silently through the doors of the halls of dragonsreach sensing farengar nearby he found farengar asleep in his bed not knowing the terror that hovered over his slumbering form the lich raised his hand as he awoke and tried fleeing in terror but he knew there was no escape the lich banished him to the realm of nightmares that changes itself with each lightning strike making it a worse existance than before known as the realm of quagmire he wont be sending thugs after anybody else 1010 would banish annoying wizard to nightmare dimension again

vanilla skyrim is a great game worthy of all the accolades and  that it got when it released now though there are so many mods that help make it into a truly complete experience i still love this game and its crazy how i can come back after a year and spend another 40 hours in the world like it isnt anything
recommended
its the best open wolrd game bethesda has made yet actually makes play styles beyond swinging a sword not only playable but fun as always the map is made to be explored and the best experiences are off the beaten path

i remember when i got this game i went and got mods i played so many mods for so long i forgot to play the game now all i can think is how valve has fallen no paid mods no paid mods no paid mods wait for their return

the elder scrolls v skyrim is an openworld mmorpg set in the dark ages in a magicfilled universe skyrim has many features to offer and has very long gameplay to keep you engaged for hours on end featuring a variety of areas to explore many questssidequests to complete and many items to findcraft is what makes skyrim such a great game there are many cities you can visit and explore each city having different designs and looks makes it very diverse when you start playing you have the option of customizing your character you can choose from a multitude of races ranging from a nord warrior type to a khajiit sneaking type and change the looks and builds of the character the price of the game is great and even better if on sale id say this game is worth around 50 canadian dollars i have to say the game looks amazing graphicwise and considering it was released on 2011 makes this a wellmade game the game works quite smoothly even on lowertier computers one of the most if not the most good thing about this game is the modding community there are thousands of fanmade mods out there which improves your game in many different ways want the game to look vivid and realistic get a graphic mod tired of your weapon get a weapon mod bows swords axes etc mods are also free and can be easily implemented into the game quickly sounds are pretty good and the soundtrack is just pure godly did i mention its open world i did well it just got better there are a ton of guilds you can join ranging from the thieves to the dark brotherhood each with their own pro and con there are many skills and spells to learn and improve and there are many women you can marry in all of skyrim overall this game is jampacked of epic fights tense moments and tabbing
recommended
paid mods have been removed people i remember a time when skyrim had 98% positive reviews i now see that it has only 87% this is extremely saddening especially considering paid mods where optional for the mod creators nevertheless paid mods have been removed everyone can calm down now and revert their reviews

four years ago bethesda made this game and i had never been more hyped for a game ever back when i actually enjoyed the majority of the games i played was a time when life was fun these days i remember skyrim for all the times ive been screwed over by bugs and glitches that would hinder me in completing quests but those 200 hours were not completely wasted partially but not completely also dont buy the dlc unless they are on 99 % sale or something considering they cost more than the base game and add maybe 5 hours extra content and a few useless items for gear that is not even better than the crap you farmed for a hundred hours in the vanilla game 810  oblivion was better dont kill chickens

despite the attempt to cash in on the hard work of modders and the subsequent realization that they had made a horrible mistake bethesda has a solid game in skyrim i remember when it first came out i was so excited for it and instantly bought it and played for hours and hours good gameplay solid mechanics excellent storyline some bugs though most are fixed by unofficial patches released by the loving mod community i seem to quit for a few months every now and then but i always end up coming back and playing some more skyrim im pretty sure i still havent discovered everything even after several playthroughs theres always more and more and with mods you could play this game for the rest of your life without running out of content

must own for rpg fans or dragon fans or any fans or anyone with a computer xbox360 or playstation 3 update 312015 just beat the dragonborn dlc this is the second  time you go to solsteim i didnt spell it right off of morrowind as you also go there in tes 3 morrowind as dlc the characters were fleshed out while maybe not emotional but you could develop a slight bond with the new island you can visit is awesome and the new shout is bada$$ worth $2000
recommended
really nice open world rpg with gorgeous nordic landscapes the biggest downside is that quests and the charracters are a bit flat i wish i would care when i kill some random farmer in the world so i guess the immersion is lacking here but you get distracted enough by other things that you kind of forget it if youve played past elder scrolls game expect the same experience for some people its good for other it isnt most important thing  mod it mod it mod it this game is day and night with mods and it fixes a ton of issues bethesda did not care to fix
recommended
amazing game liked it so much i bought it on here after playing it on ps3 and have modded the snot out of it highly reccomended
recommended
best rpg in my opinion large range of modifications from new player homes to better graphics the original game however is still beautiful fun and huge open world with dragons thieves giants and even seals storyline is perfect and can be very cheap when on special dlc worth having a look at when on special large variety of weapons clothing enemies npcs and locations quests are plentiful and trading cards and achievments exist as well 9810
recommended
skyrim is an amazing game ive put 109 hours into this masterpiece and do not regret it the story is a bit short imo but the side missions and the open world bring you a whole lot of stuff to do run up mountains enter dungeons  caves ride a horse kill a dragon buy a house get married etc and btw 1010 for using consolecommands and changing my name into jesus and flying up to the skies edit played a bit of skyrim last night went on a horse and had the power to flyincredible 1110

played through on 360 beat regular skyrim playthrough 2 on ps3 dabbled in legendary long way to go before complete got legendary on pc testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 playthroughs especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to ive done all these fn quests before its great to be able to just go grab all the games keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your playthrough without trivial bs also thomas the truck  yeah oh one more thing it looked good on 360 it looked great on ps3 it loads a billion times faster and plays way smoother on pc got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience ive ever had
recommended
theres not much i can say about this game just that it and its soundtrack are amazing it has around 20 hours of quests with the dlcs and the enviroment is beautiful but its safe to say without this games soundtrack it wouldnt be half the game it is now
recommended
hundreds of hours of fun to be had especially with the multitude of amazing community mods
recommended
skyrim is a great game everyone should buy it i abouseloutly love it the dlcs are great i just wish bethesda would fix some of the bugs everyone should play it at least once

the elder scrolls v skyrim is the new blockbuster rpg from bethesda is it the ultimate rpg all the hype surrounded it portrayed it as no it is not but thats because no single rpg is for everyone if youre looking for dragon age or the witcher in skyrim you wont find it as theyre different kinds of rpg if youre a fan though and youre mainly looking for more elder scrolls you cant go wrong with this much like the previous game in the series oblivion it offers a mindbogglingly huge amount of content from the get go content that will take hundreds of hours to completely go through and by then you will have forgotten such a big part of it that a second playthrough doesnt seem like such a bad idea unfortunately just like oblivion at the end of the day there isnt a huge variety of dungeons and once youve seen one of a said type youve pretty much seen them all skyrim has tried to correct this somewhat adding flavor to most of the dungeons in order to make them unique but it can get tiring once youve faced the same enemy 70 times combat in this game is the best in the series third camera mode is actually viable and while you cannot pick classes in the previous games like you used to you can now level up freely by gathering enough skill levels with enough skills for you to be able to create a specific personalized character while this deep personalization remains in skyrim some aspects such as spellmaking and custom enchantment creations are completely gone while some may say this is to avoid your character being a fearsome god of destruction skyrim almost makes it too easy for you to do this anyway allowing even the strongest opponents to fall easily this includes dragons before skyrim released bethesda made it seem dragons were the most fearsome thing on nirn and while the first few times you do get to fight them they will put a decent challenge bethesdas scaling works poorly to keep it that way as you level and gain vastly better gear add that to these encounters being quite common at times they completely lose that epic feel of the fight and just become an annoyance pure and simple this wouldnt nearly annoy me as much as it does if it wasnt for the fact that other clearly looking weaker wildlife found actually put up a better fight than the dragons do a shadow of the colossus or dragons dogma approach to these encounters would do the trick as those by comparison make the dragon fights in skyrim disappointingly shallow while the main quest for this game is mostly horrid it is the sidequests that offer the most enjoyment the daedra quests are especially great as with the previous games factions such as the dark brotherhood can be joined and through their storyline you will eventually rise through their ranks a minor detail thats bugged me since oblivion is that these factions never take into account your actual skill levels suppose youd join the mages college in winterhold and the teachers may comment on your great talent but really theyre just commenting on your lack thereof you can fully complete its storyline clearly aimed for mages having no magic skills at all i know daggerfalls old by now but even there they would check your skills to see if you were a suitable character to join their organization why did they not keep this in subsequent games while these games can be extremely immersive sometimes that immersion can be broken at times either by bugs which will always be present in such a gargantuan beast of a game or by ai repeating the same lines over and over notably the guards comments when you approach them it could be worse though no longer will you find the world of tamriel only having 5 voice actors working on it so there are still improvements the graphics as well skyrim is simply a beauty to behold last and by no means least the modding community they have always been a staple in the series since morrowind adding hours of playtime to these games skyrim has not changed in regards to this and it fact made mod installation easier thanks to its addition to the steam workshop find a mod you like just hit that subscribe button and open the launcher to see the game download it automatically its ridiculously simple and youd be silly not to give some of the fantastic mods already released a go its almost a sin to want to buy the console versions due to what they miss on these are the kinds of games that 10 years down the road with their dlcs fully released will still have people modding them and that is quite special all in all i say skyrim is a musthave for anyone with a remotely passing interest in the series its just that good complete with a deep customization great setting believable world and endless potential make sure you have a lot of spare time this game will soul trap you for a long time and you will more than likely thoroughly enjoy it as i have

bethesda and valve are steering pc gaming down the wrong path by implementing monetized modding and theyre using skyrim as a spearhead as such i cannot recommend this game to newcomers despite my love for it at this stage of skyrims life modding is whats keeping it alive for the vast majority that play it including myself to put mods behind a paywall is opening up a huge can of worms that can only be detrimental to the future of the platform and must be stopped before it advances too far for further reading refer the forbes article on the most important points  httpwwwforbescomsitesinsertcoin20150424valvespaidskyrimmodsarealegalethicalandcreativedisaster

first off let me start by saying this is a fantastic game and has been potentially ruined by recent events now i do think that mod developers should be able to receive money for their work i don think it should have been handled in the way it has why not simply add a donate button and valve take a 1015% cut for doing all the hosting etc and then give the original dev around 10% which would leave the mod creator around 75% of the money for 100% of the work 2 weeks ago this review would have been positive but now well see for yourself

the quality of the tes franchise has always been iffy whether it be the poor combat of morrowind dodgey iron sights in nv or the shockingly bad ui in skyrim but at the same time free mods have always been around to fix up bethesdas bad ideas and shameful lack of quality control however now that valve and bethesda are pushing to monetise the modding community with paid mods it becomes difficult to recommend skryim to anyone knowing that at some point in the future the ability to fix bethesdas numerous gameplay misteps and bugs might become what is effectively quite expensive thirdparty dlc moreover paid modding is genuinely offensive in many ways given that bethesda and valve are taking 75% of mod revenue for essentially not only failing to make a good game but taking away one of the key selling points of the pc version of this game after the fact i would in no way recommend this game nor future games in the tes franchise

i sadly cannot give this game a good review i will not pay for mods i had hundreds of hours of enjoyment with mods that will likely soon have a pricetag and for what it hurts to know something you enjoyeed so much now has a price whats next adding content every few months to make more money oh wait

wow i dont believe it not only has zenimax figured out a way to be even more lazy and ignorant in making a videogame but also wants to ruin everyone elses fun by selling something that has always been considered free and from the heart i understand that the videogame press has decided to defend this choice simply put a paywall for mods but when have they ever been right i mean lets apply this to reality we know that modders can code better than any bethesda employee see bug fixes and skyrim script extender but what if bethesda was an automobile dealer ask yourself this question before you even consider purchasing this game or any mods should you ever have to pay to have a factory defect fixed on a car if you answered yes please consider celibacy and renounce civilization youre better off swinging from the trees

whilst the game gives a solid platform and the core story is reasonably good the real meat of the game comes from the extensive modding community whilst this has always been a huge selling point for pc gaming valve and bethesda are currently attempting to turn this wonderful aspect of pc gaming into something they can exploit the community with for $$$ the idea of paying mod makers isnt a problem and should be encouraged the fact is that the following a there is no quality assurance the mod can be utter rubbish yet until you fork out $$$ you cant know b the mod makers only get 25% of the profit yup the person who did 100% of the work gets a tiny fraction of the money c if a mod stops working tough luck d the mod must earn $400 before the creator sees a penny if it only earns $399 then valve & bethesda get the lot e this encourages both big and impressibe mods but also cash grab nonsense all in all do not support this company
not recommended
im not going to support paid mods and as long as theres paid mods i do not recommend this game
not recommended
the changes in the modding community have ruined this game along with me finding the changes unacceptable and a bad precedent

pretty bummed i supported this game right before the whole mod debackle

i now have to pay mods ive been using for years and have dontated for in the past blatant cash grab thanks for destroying the most civil and supportive community in pcgaming bethesda and valve

this game is probably my favorite game of all time the graphics arent great but if you get some graphic mods and bam it looks amazing it has over 200 hours of gameplay with mods that add 100s of more hours to the game i would recommend doing a vinalla playthough and then start watching some modding videos on youtube and getting starting with modding because thats where the game really kicks off
recommended
skyrim without a doubt is one of the greatest games ever created it has a lush open world that is ready to explore every customization option you could crave robust and intelligent quests memorable moments and secrets hidden deep within if you are willing to look dark brotherhood for example i have clocked 25 hours and am still nowhere near completing the main story or finishing a fraction of the side quests i would be surprised if i finished this before clocking 100 hours and i wouldnt be surprised if i end up clocking 1000 worth the money worth the time every person should treat themselves to this experience

i love this game so endless the music the quests everythingcan spend hours just exploring and go and kill some draugr deathlords spiders etc so many things you can kill too xd or make friendsfor me there was little bugs so i was really happy about it i really recommend if you like to explore and just have fun doing side quests some are like fetch this fetch that but on the way you can talk to certain people and get more quests its fun overall 3 really recommend this to everyone ^_^bb <3

first of all this has to be one of the most fun games of all time i think it is the only game i have ever played where it litterally does not end you will always find a new cave new enemy new quests new things to do etc if you are a fan of lord of the rings you must get this game even if you dont like lord of the rings you should get it the story is so engaging and nothing feels tacked on or out of place everything has a purpose and everything has a reason for being there with their own story its great i have no idea why you would not get this game oh side note the dlc for the game is great even though i dont own it yet i have played it on my friends computer and they add even more content to an aready content loaded game in closing if you dont buy this game you are a fool a fool it is way to good to pass up rating 1110 blows me away
recommended
oh skyrim what a great experience you start playing this game and you will never complete it you will continue returining to skyrim many times you will spend countless hours exploring hunting killing bandits and many other cool things add mods to the mix and you can customize and enhace the core game towards the perfect rpg if youre a true gamer you should never live without missing this one
recommended
skyrim is game that someone can get truly absorbed in i have played almost 500 hours on console but i love the game so much i also brought it on steam just to be able to play it when my family uses the console and i must say it was one of the best descisions of my life the community is one of the best in gaming there are so many usercreated drawings and mods that when you start playing again skyrim is a whole new world tailored to your liking and the game in itself  devoid of any mods is the single greatest gaming adventure i have ever had the honor of experiencing i will most definitely come back to this game time and time again

wander the open world of skyrim as you the dragonborn use your awesome magical gift of the ancient language to steal cabbages steal horses pick pockets pick locks and even rob shops at night still be the hero as you kill off an entire empire such as the stormcloaks or the imperials hunt through the ancient ruins of nords and fight through armies of zombies just to get bored in the end and murder everyone in windhelm just for the hell of it

pay to win on singleplayer game nice

i enjoy bethesda games especially when they open them up to the modding community but then the paid mod thing happened and we find out both valve and bethesda are profitting over this modding something that has been a free community driven activity for thirty years is being monetized not donation driven not a commission thing but a market that is going to drive modding into the ground bbut modders are also getting money 25% and thats if they make more than $400 if im reading things right and that money only goes to your steam wallet anything would have been better than this i cannot in good faith say that you should buy this game and support the developers edit well the paid mods system has been removed for the time being valve has aready said that they are going back to the drawing board to figure out how to better implement it im going to keep this negative review here as a reminder of just what transpired and a reminder so no one is surprised when it pops up again if valve implements paid mods again yet they somehow work then i will change this review
not recommended
i like skyrim for the mods i have and those that are still being made im not not going to recccomend this game out of the whole paid mods thing it has nothing to do with is the game good of course its awesome i didnt like the paid mods thing but that doesnt mean that skyrim has gone from one of the best games ever to being crap because of it
recommended
you know all the fun and such
recommended
overall this is a nice game to own

loved this game on xbox 360 and love it even more with tons of mod possibilities on pc and freerom rpg games is where its at

do i also have to pay to write this review aswell
not recommended
this game is a very interesting one i bought this game as it was on sale and got very surprised for the very cheap game i had heard a lot good about the game itself and the mods so i decided why not so i started playing the story and decided that i need to have a few mods so i downloaded some mods what make the game longer the start is pretty boring but when you get to have your free world you shall be free the world has exciting creatures and such and you can always get quests the story is interesting as well not to spoil i wont tell anything about the story but i can say the story is good some quests have a lot of hardness in them but some are just easy best rpg game i have ever seen
recommended
time to recommend what is probably the most hyped game ive ever played first of all its good thats all you need to really know it is a good game but it got some massive flaws if i am to compare it to morrowind or oblivion it is worse in pretty much every way first time playing morrowind you will notice that it got some of the best music you can come by and some cool gameplay oblivion was so good i never stopped playing it until i had made every mission this game skyrim is a bit of both only real problem with it  its extremly repetitive every mission pretty much is the other alike it got some really cool graphics finally some decent voiceacting and some good missions every now and then the dragons that were so extremly hyped are a bust tho they do not live up to their name they are repetitive and boring which kinda kills the whole dragonbornplot so wait for a sale then buy it you wont regret it its good really good just not as good as its precursors so it doesnt get full pot but almost 910
recommended
i remember when i got this game i went and got mods i played so many mods for so long i forgot to play the game now all i can think is how valve has fallen no paid mods no paid mods no paid mods wait for their return

the elder scrolls v skyrim is an openworld mmorpg set in the dark ages in a magicfilled universe skyrim has many features to offer and has very long gameplay to keep you engaged for hours on end featuring a variety of areas to explore many questssidequests to complete and many items to findcraft is what makes skyrim such a great game there are many cities you can visit and explore each city having different designs and looks makes it very diverse when you start playing you have the option of customizing your character you can choose from a multitude of races ranging from a nord warrior type to a khajiit sneaking type and change the looks and builds of the character the price of the game is great and even better if on sale id say this game is worth around 50 canadian dollars i have to say the game looks amazing graphicwise and considering it was released on 2011 makes this a wellmade game the game works quite smoothly even on lowertier computers one of the most if not the most good thing about this game is the modding community there are thousands of fanmade mods out there which improves your game in many different ways want the game to look vivid and realistic get a graphic mod tired of your weapon get a weapon mod bows swords axes etc mods are also free and can be easily implemented into the game quickly sounds are pretty good and the soundtrack is just pure godly did i mention its open world i did well it just got better there are a ton of guilds you can join ranging from the thieves to the dark brotherhood each with their own pro and con there are many skills and spells to learn and improve and there are many women you can marry in all of skyrim overall this game is jampacked of epic fights tense moments and tabbing
recommended
paid mods have been removed people i remember a time when skyrim had 98% positive reviews i now see that it has only 87% this is extremely saddening especially considering paid mods where optional for the mod creators nevertheless paid mods have been removed everyone can calm down now and revert their reviews

when i first played this i was all like ermegerd ets amatheng then i completed the amatheng main quest line and i was like oh what now then i started talking to everyone and did stuff for them and thats the best part theres hundreds of people in skyrim and they all have a story and like 75% of them have a quest ive spent over 200 hours on this and im still not bored of it and modding it is amazing too not to mention all the other quest lines like the companions and thieves guild dont forget the dark brotherhood ooh and the whole civil war thing going on you can tell the creators spent some time on this and the map is huge and theres over 20000 mods on the workshop alone even more on the nexus and all those other mod sites overall this game is pretty much legendary

great game legendary version is definitely worth it

it is a fantastic game but what makes it even better are the free mods you can get almost exact experience you desire and if you feel for a challenge you can attempt to create mods yourself skyrim is a game that will last you for years thanks to the dedicated modding community and it definately deserves a positive review despite the recent evets

despite the attempt to cash in on the hard work of modders and the subsequent realization that they had made a horrible mistake bethesda has a solid game in skyrim i remember when it first came out i was so excited for it and instantly bought it and played for hours and hours good gameplay solid mechanics excellent storyline some bugs though most are fixed by unofficial patches released by the loving mod community i seem to quit for a few months every now and then but i always end up coming back and playing some more skyrim im pretty sure i still havent discovered everything even after several playthroughs theres always more and more and with mods you could play this game for the rest of your life without running out of content

you can punch a giant metal robot to death 1010

to bad theres no teleport spell in skyrim

please make another skill for example mining woodchopping
recommended
i had the game originally on the ps3 and had a bit over 100 hours put into it the only reason i got it on the pc now is cause it was on sale for $5 glad i did cause i love modding it given that the paid mods thing are a thing of the past i will not include it on the review worth the cost for the game but if youre wanting to mod as much as you can spend the extra 20 for the ultimate edition for all of the dlc have fun
recommended
one of the most epic games ive ever playedfor that year when it was released it has amazing graphicsfp animationbut the most funny part of the game is those bugsin some cases its big  then

>a wild paid workshop appears >community starts ruthless riot downvoting skyrim with the power of thousand suns >paid workshop gets deleted >mfw them mod makers are left all alone with their updated mods >they have nothing better to do anyway so they put new mods for free on nexus >1010 would riot again
recommended
so dont let my hours tell you anything i played this game one xbox 360 and have over 1000 hours this game is probably my favorite rpg of all time its rare you encounter a game that has a single player that you want to keep going back to it has amazing quest it has hilarious jokes and it has an impact on your life that everytime you hear the word skyrim it makes you remember all those dragons that took 30 minutes to beat i cant remember how many times ive taken arrows to the knee 1010 would waste life again
recommended
i havent even finished the main quest yet

skyrim may belong to the nords  but everything in skyrim belongs to the khajit

i would definetly recumend this game worth getting because i already beat the game it is awesome and my cousin told me some cheats too if you guys want to know some send mea message or friend me and ill tell ya yet this game i pretty expensive but you should get it if youlike killing things on the electronics xd love this game

the game is just fantasticbut there are bug issues who knows why

its skyrim its good if you kill paarthurnax you are an awful person

skyrim is a transcendent experience it may not be perfect but it excels in almost every aspect of design there are games that you play and there are games that you experience and this is the latter it sucks you in and you will get lost in its incredible depths this is quite frankly one of the deepest most enjoyable and most inspiring gaming experiences you will ever have had you owe it to yourself as a gamer to play this
recommended
mod it till it crashes
recommended
overall its a pretty great game but it just didnt have the level of immersiveness that i was expecting and it didnt end up keeping me hooked for that long
recommended
skyrim is really good but for those who have played oblivion skyrim has simplified all the differant stores to just general stores forges and potion shops there were only two cons for me anyway i got stuck in the world you travel to in the dragonborn dlc quest started the quest but decieded that i wanted to go back to skyrim and it wouldnt let me the other con is i would like a two player coop while walking through skyrim the graphics have been overhauled since oblivion which makes skyrim very beautiful also there is very little cut and paste like there was in oblivion i hope the review is helpful really really fun 1010
recommended
after 117 hours i can say crap dont buy it and dont buy any mod
not recommended
if youre a fan of fantasy cats ragons american rpgs or god knows what else come to think of it do i even need to write a review its skyrim
recommended
normally i am not really a fan of rpgs and all that dungeons and dragons stuff but damn it do i like this game a lot its a fantastic game to just explore the world and run into a lot of different encounters theres so incredible many hours worth of entertainment in this game and its definitely worth your buck however when you buy this remember youre kind of just playing the console version on pc get yourself a user on nexusmods and experience skyrim in all its glory in which it shines the most on this superior platform

not my favorite tes but that doesnt mean its worse and its tes the elder scrolls will absorb you theres just so much to do and then you add the mods and then you turn them off you try all the quests and loot all the caves and then you try to roleplay the game and then you start philosophizing about it with your friends and then you discover the lore of the elder scrolls and then well then youll unfortunately be dead as youll probably end up playing skyrim and studying tes lore for the rest of your life to be honest this game has bugs it has flaws and many of them but funnily enough even after all those 800 hours i really cant remember a single one of them i do remember a lot of amazing moments i had with skyrim though never gets old

its a great game

the elder scrolls v skyrim is a great game that said charging for usercreated content on a free content hosting platform is utter bs ill be accessing my mods from more reputable sources from now on steam its hilarious that someone on your team came up with an idea like this it makes you look like one of those free mobile game vendors charging for every bit of content you possibly can while still pushing the idea that the actual content is free one of the largest draws of the elder scrolls series is the player made content and if that remains a payed for feature then you can definitely expect far less sales when the next game comes out

ive been an elder scrolls fan for the past 5 years one of the most interesting longest game i have ever played is morrowind then came oblivion i could play out the game but seriously that game is nothing without mods horribly boring conversations not like skyrims any better  an arrow to the knee when skyrim came out i was pumped for it i had a reason the game looked amazingly cool in the gameplay trailer it was an amazing adventure but if we look deeply into it skyrim is just a bit better than oblvivion insanely boring conversations oversimplified puzzles if you play out the game for the 5th time even the legendary difficulty is mouse crap in a sack of flour mods make this game even more beautiful enbs weather mods water even more harder deadly combat duel combat realism etc there are some interesting quest mods also falskaar wyrmstooth etc i kinda stopped playing never even heard of dlcs coming out dragonborn hearthfires dawnguard i was excited about them my favorite dlc was and still is dragonborn a completely new land solstheim with returning topics houses netches house redoran house telvanni and a dying silt strider  i recommend buying the legendary edition it comes with several bonuses all dlcs legendary difficulty when a skill reaches lvl 100 you can make it legendary and regain all perk points spent in that skill i overall recommend skyrim for anyone who likes rpg adventure games or just likes bethesda games

game is okay would not recommend purchasing

can we all just ignore this buying mods things please the ony reason that paying was invented was so that people would work becuse if they didnt get anything out of it they wouldnt work but modders does this for free so theres no need to pay for it so to all modders please dont make us pay for mods and to all pc gamers please dont ever buy mods becaue of you dont people wont make us pay for mods

if there is any game that proves studios do not need to release a relatively bug free massive content filled game while still being overwhelmingly successful tesv skyrim is it however bethesda owes their success and high ratings to the kind and good willed people who fixed  modified skyrim for nothing in return and what does bethesda do to reward these people they endorse a laughable cash farmpaid mods system where they are doing nothing and taking the biggest cut the only reason why this 4 year old game is still relevant and talked about today is because of the content modders created and fixed yes paid mod system on steam workshop has been removed but bethesda has left a burning scar on the attractive modding community with their actions i have no doubt they would try and take advantage of their greatest undeserved asset again which is why i cant thumbs up this product what i think of the game itself without mods good  graphicsvisuals are good for its time i like the combat talent tree is nice sprint bar bad  short quest lines especially for guilds dialoguestory writing doesnt live up to previous elder scrolls dragon combat seems corny to me not as many cavesdungeons as tesiv about the whole paid mods situation im not against someone making money for the things they create ^ive bought several early access games this isnt even necessary to say^ im not against giving my money to someone for the things they create i have donated money to modderserver owners in the past i am against steam workshop turning into a micro transaction nightmare i am against studios making money on mods that fix a game i am against studios having even less incentive than they do now to make an outstanding game because they would be able to sit on a cash farm known as paid mods

i was dissapointed by bethesdas latest elder scrolls but the community of modders made this a really fun game i recommend everyone to by the game used or from another site than steam and using httpwwwnexusmodscom for modding
not recommended
this game is ok without mods this game is amazing with mods it shows that the people will get what they want even if they have to program it themselves what steam doesnt realize is they just killed this game mods are by people for people there is nothing wrong with modders asking for compensation for their time and effort but it needs to be propotional and unofficial by steam making it official then they take on a lot of the responsibility from the modders what happens when one of my paid mods interacts negatively with another paid mod who will give me a refund steam the modder now steam has the liability of refunds and this could become a class action suit if there was a modder that took advantage of the system i am officialy boycotting steam untill this is redacted i urge everyone else to do the same thank you for your time

a key advantage of pc gaming over consoles is free modding which often outdoes paid dlc well lets fix that says valve and bethesda as they reveal that their plan for the steam workshop is really to make it into a paid service do not support this crap

never made a review before i enjoyed skyrim as much as anyone else mods were of course the biggest factor as with most bethesda games this new thing with paid mods is just ridiculous though its an unnecessary paywall that will only hurt the mod community as a whole the whole point of mods was free user created content to help expand the game what valve wants to do though is literally make user created dlc and i dont think anyone wants that

nice work steam this will not end well for you

i had not played pokemon games beforei was under the wrong impression that they were just for children and then there was a lot of media attention on fire red and leaf greeni was going on a long trip so i got fire red it takes a lot of memorization skills to play pokemon games well so adults can enjoy these games in my opinion for those who havent played before pokemon are actually very intricate and there are different types of pokemon so you have to remember their abilities and what types can easily beat other types and you switch pokemon in battle depending on their strengths and abilities of course the graphics on this game are very very good what i liked best was the ability to get ingame help and for some reason it just really tickles me to see the little hand pick up my pokemon and move them to or from the storage boxes i also like the fact that when i turn the game on it rehashes the last few things i did before stopping gameplay last time this is really good for me because i dont get to play everyday and if too much time goes by i do forget my last moves i also have pokemon crystal for gbc and i think it is a little easierso if youd like to try pokemon maybe that is a better game to learn firstboth have been very fun and entertaining for this adult gamer gotta catch em all

it pains me to do this after enjoying this game so much but paying for mods  are you freakin kidding me  mods should be free
not recommended
the base version of this game was amazing it had the looks a great story tons of items lots to do but then you start adding mods and it becomes legendary if you dont own this game idk why either you are a pleb or you hate rts games buy it now
recommended
i figure since i have enough games to tower over a 6 foot tall man i should at least give you the one i enjoy the most on my computer the main reason i love skyrim on the computer is because there is always a way to get new content without having to wait for bethesda to spoonfeed it to you i think that skyrim is one of the besy rpg style games to date and its modding community only adds to it if there is one game im not ashamed to say that i own more than 1 copy of and have dumped well over 700 hours total into its skyrim its a game that every storyloving gamer should own and is a prime example of an open world done right
recommended
probably one of the best games i have played there is so much to do and a lot of freedom add mods from the nexus and the workshop this game can last a very long time
recommended
let me guess did someone steal your sweet roll what is it dragons i used to be an adventurer like you but then i took an arrow to the knee my cousin is out fighting dragons and what do i get guard duty gotta keep my eyes open damn dragons could swoop down at any time watch the skies traveler no lollygaggin

this parody has to end now bethesda and vavle greed combined will kill the mods

one of the main reasons i bought skyrim was for the mods i considered the mods to add a lot of extra value to the game now they became horse armor dlc and i feel cheated both by bethesda and by valve its like going to a restaurant and being told that adding salt to your food is going to cost you 099$ i will never buy any product made by bethesda software ever again because i feel that they will probably try pull the same dubious measures on their future games as well it is very sad for me because i grew up playing tes games and now i will have to stop enjoying them because bethesda and steam became greedy and decided to kill the skyrim modding scene

pay for mods just no valve ur turning into a new ea just nooooo what next pay per month to play steam games rip pc gaming

honestly if you have a console just buy this game on the console there isnt a reason now to own it for pc besides slightly better graphics i suppose now as you have to pay for mods mods for pc games are really the only reason to buy the pc version of a game because pc games are modable and consoles are not well now that you have to pay for mods that were previously free just a week ago most of the fun that was to be had in skyrim on pc is pretty much moot as the must have mods that fix stuff in the game cost actual real live money now take a stand do not pay for this bs on the steam workshop if you want a mod that costs money head on over to nexus their mods are still free for now until steam works out a way to tie the pay for mods to steam alone and make sure you tell gabe that as much as you love steam and as much as you dont mind paying for stuff you like you dont agree with paying for mods that for the last 10 years have been free but now they decide they can make cash off it

skyrim its an elder scrolls game which means youre going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game the combat system if you want to call it that is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous elder scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards however what bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration so despite its flaws id strongly recommend this game there is however a lot of snow you probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow

a paywall for mods is not the way to support mod creators it is only a way to line the pockets of valve

not supporting steam or bethesda until they completely change their business models i can certainly survive without slyrim as oblivion morrowind and new vegas are better games with free mods any way i recommend that you who are reading this review do the same and shop only at gog humble bundle and dare i say it eas origin valve needs more competition now edit 4272015 1003 pm welp they finally did a 180 degree reversal with the policy for skyrim but in the official press release for this policy change the official valve employe who annouced this change implied that they would try again just not for skyrim so no im still not supporting valve anymore they are still a monopoly they are still hypocrites but what now for skyrim and bethesda should i now give skyrim a positive review no its my opinion that zenimax and bethesda softworks not beth game studio still want some form of paid modding and were the main pushers for paid modding in the first place remember horse armor also i have my beefs with skyrim itself as a game people really should play morrowind oblivion and new vegas before spending hundreds of hours into this shallow game i cant go into specifics at the moment but there are plenty of reviews and videos online addressing concerns that i agree with view valves statement here httpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracecomments3434itpaid_mods_in_the_steam_workshop 4282015 bethesda gave their own pr twitst httpwwwbethblogcom20150427whyweretryingpaidskyrimmodsonsteam look at this particular statement horse armor gave us a start into something new and it led to us giving better and better value to our players with dlc like shivering isles point lookout dragonborn and more they seriously believe that horse armor has helped not just oblivion elder scrolls and fallout but also the gaming industry as a whole horse armor did not encourage them to make epansion packs and dlc that were planned and were in development already if they could without backlash they would follow the scamlike behaviors of other developers like ea or paradox when it comes to the most inane dlcs they said to the effect well mod sales were insignificant anyway and people who use mods and make mods are very insignificant when comparing to all skyrim players well if it wasnt that significant why risk your business and lose potential customers for future games you idiots they also said that they began discussions and planning for paid mods back in 2012 they will not simply waste 3 years of planning because of this backlash no business plans something for such a long time just to do a complete 180 and waste all the wages to people who worked on introducing a new product or service and all the data and knowledge from analyzing the market this will come back one way or another my positive review for skyrim will not

what can i say halffinished game that only survived because of modability which will now be placed behind payment walls while the decision is a good one for modding in the long term the consumer is again shafted i wouldnt recommend the base game skyrim as anything close to being worth playing however if you dont mind to keep forking out money for characters weapons minor patches etc then this game might be for you was nice while it lasted though edit well now that the paid mods have been >>temporarily<< put on hold until they can put more legal bindings on them i will refrain from changing the review since its only a matter of time before its back also the damage has been done the community is in shambles modders are leaving and players are still spamming about it i feel like the modders pulling their free mods is mostly because of the players who attacked the modders more than the allure of potential profits the playerbase attacked the wrong targets here but everythings been done now we just wait and see where this develops thirdparty dlc that the company is actually getting money for and then money from publishing it is here to stay there is nothing we can do ill miss gaming

paid mods dont buy this game
not recommended
this game is being sold out what makes it so unique and awesome is the modding community and what both bethesda and valve are planning on doing here is selling the mods with a 70% margin this will not only make it way more expensive for the player to mod the game because priorly you could just download the mods from the modding forums for free but it will also kill the modding community at the nexus forums therefore my review of this game is negative as it is nothing without its mods

dont buy till paid mod issue is sorted

no doubt one of the best fantasy rpgs that has ever been made only a few problems its buggy in some places for example you often need to manually install a patch to fix the esbern quest in the main storyline the game can become very easy once you get full enchanting alchemy and smithing which is very easy to do after that you must ramp the difficulty up exponentially to feel any challenge however this is not to say you shouldnt buy this game its still an amazing game with nearly endless replayability awesome enemies and great execution buy it

was an enjoyable game but it is now involved in a moneymaking scheme that goes against the spirit of mods dont buy this game under any circumstances
not recommended
tes has always been a series that leaned heavily on externally generated content to sell copies almost all of us have used at least one mod to make the game better many of us use 50 100 or even more mods unfortunately bethesda and valve decided to take the community for a ride and allow mod uploaders to set a paywall for their mods with bethesdavalve splitting 75% of the profits this is absolutely unacceptable business practice and i cannot recommend a purchase when the game can cost upwards of $20000 for content that used to be free
not recommended
selling mods now are we well  you valve i used to like you
not recommended
one of my favorite games once a masterpiece ruined by paid mods it is just a broken game full of bugs and ctds without mods and unofficial fixes not recommended anymore helping the modders by robbing them 75% of the share nice move valve and bethesda i am impressed
not recommended
just why valve
not recommended
although i like this game mainly for the emerson and mods not for the game itself i am all for supporting modders so they can keep making great content but that money should be donated for good work or as pay what you want at least but making mods a set price is a very worrying precedent in the gaming community not only will this meat major criticism but will only help create a 2 tier community with piracy and legal issues destroying what is a tight nit community of creatives and for that reason i have given this game a bad review for what bethesda have allowed their game to become the harbinger signalling the death of community modding gg steam wp

one of the reasons we struggle with transitioning to digital media is becuase patent owners such as apple or google takes a cut when a newspaper is sold through their stores the backlash has of course been huge and slowly we are seeing big tech companies allowing the media to sell their products with tech companies taking a smaller cut now valve comes along and learned nothing they are taking a 75% cut for every mod they sell for skyrim a game only worth playing because of the fantastic mod community i agree that modders need to pay their rent but that rent is not getting paid when valve is taking 75% of the cut stay clear folks

so my previous review mentioned that i can only play this game with mods thats changed since valve added paid mods gaben is haram valve are greedy  to those complaining about the 75% valve takes to fuel gabes diabetus they also take a ing unreasonable amount from each game sold on steam 30% for each game is stupid a healthy amount is 25% seeing as valve literally do ing nothing to get their cut furthermore valve hasnt even ing said anything on the matter i cannot understand why they think this is a good idea i would forgive them if they took it down instantly they realised it was a ing autistic idea and then said sorry but hell nawww theyre all like we aint gon say  bout our  up voting valve for worst company of the year

a shallow if graphically impressive for its time game it will offer a couple hours of fun until you get tired of fighting leveled enemies and finding leveled loot in incredibly bland and uninspired dungeons which offers no incentives to explore as most said leveled loot is both random and plain bad you will then wander from places to places looking at the most bland and average notmedievalscandinavia setting there is the gameplay and engine limitations are designed to be played on lastgen consoles and do not take advantage of such simple things such as a mouse and keyboard or your hectocore 80gb ram topoftheline alienware moreover there is a pletora of bugs that bethesda simply did not care to fix most of its drawbacks can be negated by mods but now you have to pay for these mods and the first 75c of each dollars you pay directly fuel valve monopolistic business practices and bethesda legendary lazyness have fun

this is the game the never ever ends i picked this game up thinking i wouldnt like it having never played a previous tes game before sat in my library untouched for about a month or two and finally took the plunge i was wrong i was so very very wrong this is probably the best purchase ive ever made on steam add in the unlimited potential of modding and its an adventure that continues forever ive probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character and still only have beaten alduin once once theres still so much more do to and explore that im still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things i still cant believe how much there is to do and im still finding more at it stands ill probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as skyrim with how much ive played and im totally ok with that

i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun one of skyrims major cities when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot an orcish mace in the other they were on display for nobody but me and my computercontrolled housecarl lydia who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls dragons a civil war and job assignments that never seem to go as planned its even a sensible thing to do a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim one of the most fullyrealized easily enjoyable and utterly engrossing roleplaying games ever made part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated in skyrim theres no more moonhopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill thats gone so is athletics the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major you dont assign major and minor skills at all but instead pick one of ten races each with a specific bonus high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective closerange combat these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic sneaking and weapon combat emphasizing firsthand experience over instruction manual study letting you specialize only when youre ready it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim do a quest kill a dragon snatch torchbugs from the air munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within little feels random and useless even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities making every step you take even if its through what seems like total wilderness an exciting one as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame momentarily all on the battlefield unite directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature creating impromptu moments of camaraderie  a surprising change from what may have been yet another bythenumbers bandit camp sweep dragons show up often their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles stops to attack circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv can be completed in a few minutes and always offer a useful reward killing a dragon yields a soul which powers skyrims new shout system these are magical abilities any character can use you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time throw your voice change the weather call in allies blast out ice and fire or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force even if you favor sword shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story joined with the thieves guild fought alongside the dark brotherhood or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim not only is this land under assault by dragons long thought to be dead its also ripped in two by civil war you can choose one side or the other but so much of the allure of skyrim is how even outside of the confines of quest lines the embattled state of the world is evident and steeped in a rich fictional legacy lord of the rings this is not but with the release of every elder scrolls game the fiction becomes denser and the crossreferencing for longtime fans all the more rewarding skyrims residents are all aware of current events theyll comment on the civil war some sympathizing with the rebels others thinking the establishment sold its soul the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor many characters feel like whole distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans characters stereotype based on race they doublecross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable and they react to your evolving stature within the world it makes a ridiculous realm filled with computercontrolled cat people and humanoid reptiles demon gods and dragons feel authentic like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave

best game i ever bought in this game youll be sent back to the times where people fought with swords and bows a brilliant setting if you ask me the game lets you do whatever you want you can customize your character to your own style own personal favorite race and youll be able to fight any style you want do you want to play the sneaky elf archer with the bow no problem do you want to play the sneaky kahjiit thief with the daggers no problem do you dislike weapons and love to use magic no problem theres even lots of different spells either destruction or illusion maybe necromancy is more your style being a healer is no problem either you can make your own weapons by smithing you can make your own potions by gathering ingredients and mixing them into a potion with alchemy you can upgrade your weapons by using enchanting theres so much to do want to settle down after some adventures get to a town and drink mead at the inn or purchase a house or a piece of land to build a house with selffound materials or maybe bought materials whatever you want there are so many different playtroughs so much quests to play heck ive played this over 275 hours and i still havent completed all the quests i completely recommend this game i bought it at the releasedate 111111 and im still not done with it did i mention the steam workshop millions of mods to download without any fee enjoy

when this game first came out it was amazing and the whole workshop thing was a pretty nice addition after awhile in the game people made the most random mods that just ruined the game for me instead of fixing this issue they thought oh hey you know what we should do to line our pockets moremake the players the back bone of our company to have to pay for the only thing we had free on our game i feel like they didnt come up with the idea to help the artists they did it to help themselves so they can afford the payments on their solid gold house and diamond infused car so my honest opinion is that you should change it back the way it was and offer jobs to the artist to work for you so relating to the game itself is amazing and if you get it then i wouldnt touch the mods until they fix the colossal screw up they created with the workshop

paid mods are ridiculous i just redownloaded skyrim on my new computer and i cant get back any of the awesome mods i once used the community was huge and thriving even without money being involved but as always some moneygrubbing pos at the top decided they could squeeze more money from the game the same game whose popularity has continued so long because of the free mods any money they make off of this scheme will benefit them far less than a game that stands the test of time way to go

truly epic wide open play phenomenal graphical environment no path restrictions you can play any type of character you want you can mix up the styles you want as well you can be a worrier a thief a mage or any combination of them prefer to fight from a distance like a sniper you have bows with archery perks not to mention mods that can enhance that sort of play want to be a mage how about a sword mage perhaps a mystical thief or a thief that can stand toe to toe with your enemies if need be the potential of this game appears to be limitless more quests and plots than you can easily count and thats with the base game and the official dlcs if those arent enough download and install a new mod want a new house or mansion or how about a cavern hideout would you like a treehouse for a home or a is a ship as your home more to your taste not enough challenges and quests for you get mods that make the game more difficult or add new areas to explore and concur want to improve the graphics you can do that want to add new npcs you can do that want to change the way the armor or weapons look you can do that too with all the free mods out there you can build your own game giving this game nearly unlimited potential your imagination is the only limit youll find in this game

the only reason this game is still kicking is because of the modders they spent alot of time fixing bugs that bethesda refused to the modification community of the game was a strong one with a deep passion for the elder scrolls money has thoroughly corrupted it thanks to valve steam and bethesda with the implimintation of paying for mods you can expect to spend a lot of money buying mods that make the game run as it was supposed to you can also expect to purchase mods that are stolen from someone elses work you can also expect to buy mods that will break the game or not function correctly and you will not get a refund as steam will keep your money in a steam wallet for example one of the cornerstones of several mods involves a script extender a certain program many people run on their pc will cause it not to work this will in turn cause the mod you bought not to work again this game is incredibly buggy without modification and it isnt right that you should have to do several microtransactions to get it there on a side note bethesda makes a ludicrous profit off of the modders work work that bethesda should have been doing in the first place when they released the game

valve is greedy when you hear the phrase 7525 split of revenue for modders you would assume that means the modders are getting 75% nope valve is only giving these modders 25% after spending weeks making this product and pocketing the rest then theres the issue of support what if the mod breaks a week down the line after an update and the dev refuses to fix it heshe has your money so why do they care plus people are stealing free mods and rehosting them and profiting off them valve has also given unclear advice about whether mod dependencies are okay when done in the correct way this could be a great way to support modders allow modders to make the minimum price 0 so its free  donation give them at least 70% of revenue like apples app store and make clear the copyright rules clear and dont push steam towards microtransaction hell

the recent addition of paid mods has been a huge blow to skyrims enjoyability and longevity modders have kept this game alive for many many years and now its only a matter of time before the best mods are locked behind paywalls and microtransactions the worst part is that steambethesda are taking the lions share of the profits sevent five percent vote with your wallet stay away from any paid mods

the workshop is a place to share creations to increase the longevity of skyrim in essence putting price tags on user created content is killing the community there is average of about 20 hours of content that you can burn through without mods now ive got to pay i have upwards of 300 mods on my game are you gonna charge 300 for it valve has simply become an exploitive corporation whose priorities lie in the vault 1110 for the game though  thanks nexus x

i dont review that many games on steam but i will not be giving this game a thumbs up with valve and bethesda looking to make some serious dough under the guise of helping content creators we now have a bit of segregation in the modding scene modders who list their mods as paid are only seeing 25% of the money despite doing 90% of the work we also have stolen mods that are free from their original source being posted as paid mods for some quick cash worse are some modders adding nag screens to the previous free version bugging players to pay for the mod i am personally okay with modders making some money off their work much like im in favor of youtubers making money but if any youtuber were to paywall their channel theyd be shafted because it disturbs the ecosystem so much modders you should consider asking for donations instead and not let valve and bethesda rob you of those contributions its very much like how youtubers use patreon and other services to help pay for the time and effort put into their work make that the standard and im sure people will gladly toss some change your way but paywalling your content and worse nagging people about why they havent paid for the new version yet is really low and tacky this is more of an ethics review than a review of the actual game i know since i dont have much playtime on the pc version but since it is a decision that was endorsed by the developer i think it belongs here

so skyrim is a decent game not amazing in fact its my least favourite of the tes games so far considering how much of the game mechanices form the past have ben stripped form the game but thats not why im writing this im writing this because allowing the sale of mods is ludacris i have always been firmly against paying money for digital content that does nothing to improve the game and i hold that stance in this matter i feel that this is a huge mistake on valves part and a cheap delusion on the part of the authors

this is a great game with hours upon hours of almost endless fun the game is also great for mods that add loads more hours to the game and you get way more out of fun out of it with lore friendly to just plain funny mods only bad thing really i can think of is at this moment in time you may have to pay for some mods which i say although mods are great they are mods not dlc and shouldnt be paid for i do also however hate the idea of dlc as well unless it is something different and new to the game not just taken out then charged for later on to get and play but over all this is a review of skyrim and i would recommend buying the game even if its just for its normal play though no mods or dlc

bethesda has had a long tradition of working hard through their development cycle to make sure that bugs are not fixed it wouldnt even surprise me if todd himself works overtime during the last few weeks to add more bugs in with how many one can find in not only skyrim but all bethesda games not to mention bethesdas tradition of removing features from each tes game remember spears and the multiple amounts of weapon and armour types such as short blade long blade blunt unarmoured light armour medium armour heavy armour etc in morrowind remember how many of those were merged together or outright removed for oblivion do you know how many are missing from skyrim are you a grandfather that remembers that even morrwind couldnt handle everything from daggerfall fortunately bethesda leaves these games pretty wide open and tons of modding communities sprouted up to not only fix all of bethesdas lazy half  attempts to release an unfinished game but add in new content to add limitless hours of replayability its pretty bad when bethesdas official patches dont do much aside from fixing few of the game breaking bugs and leaving everything else and consumers have to rely on the unofficial morrwindoblivionskyrim patch to fix thousands literally of bugs that take only a few lines of code to fix but i digress as of april 24 2015 the dream is dead valve and bethesda have partnered to offer paid mods through the steam workshop with little to no regulation at all all while reaping a massive 75% of the profit leaving mod creators with a measly 25% while in the past massive free overhauls such as falskaar the unofficial oblivionmorrowindskyrim patchs the highly detailed armour sets impressive new weapons entirely new races could be found on many modding websites such as the nexus with bethesdas blessing it appears that is no longer the case for the low low price of your soul and dignity you can get a bunch of cheap looking weapons from dota 2 that dont even look like their dota 2 counterparts a hev suit from half life 2 that absolutely fits into the culture and lore of skyrim and a fishing animation mod thats already been removed from the workshop because the mod creator hasnt been happy about how this whole debacle has been handled but hey its not like fishing animiations should have been in the base game anyways right ^ dont let this continue dont support  devs who cant release a finished game then eat up their overpriced paid mods that were made by community members that are offered for free on the nexus bethesda has already done this once before with paid horse armour dlc for oblivion it was stupid then its even more  backwards now

skyrim is a excellent game if it was me it be awarded for the most mod friendly game yet to be released rpg freeroam customization and good by default as well it has a giant mod community with dedicated modders and endless content you can make content aswell when the game can get updated it will get pretty much timeless its what i call one of the important aspects of a game that will stay and be remembered eventually it will become a classic

i dont know why im doing a review on this as im sure pretty much anyone with a front door and an internet connection either knows about this game or owns it but im going to do it anyway the elder scrolls v skyrim  game of the year 2014 and 2015 and 2016 etc seriously awesome game especially with mods very replayable game with pretty much no ending there are different ways you can play such as sneak heavy mage etc and with variations like only one type of spell like destruction or i would finish this but i want to go and play skyrim not even joking
recommended
this game is an epic adventurer game and it is perfect for people who love adventure this game is a 1010 game and is totally awesome

the elder scrolls v skyrim is the new blockbuster rpg from bethesda is it the ultimate rpg all the hype surrounded it portrayed it as no it is not but thats because no single rpg is for everyone if youre looking for dragon age or the witcher in skyrim you wont find it as theyre different kinds of rpg if youre a fan though and youre mainly looking for more elder scrolls you cant go wrong with this much like the previous game in the series oblivion it offers a mindbogglingly huge amount of content from the get go content that will take hundreds of hours to completely go through and by then you will have forgotten such a big part of it that a second playthrough doesnt seem like such a bad idea unfortunately just like oblivion at the end of the day there isnt a huge variety of dungeons and once youve seen one of a said type youve pretty much seen them all skyrim has tried to correct this somewhat adding flavor to most of the dungeons in order to make them unique but it can get tiring once youve faced the same enemy 70 times combat in this game is the best in the series third camera mode is actually viable and while you cannot pick classes in the previous games like you used to you can now level up freely by gathering enough skill levels with enough skills for you to be able to create a specific personalized character while this deep personalization remains in skyrim some aspects such as spellmaking and custom enchantment creations are completely gone while some may say this is to avoid your character being a fearsome god of destruction skyrim almost makes it too easy for you to do this anyway allowing even the strongest opponents to fall easily this includes dragons before skyrim released bethesda made it seem dragons were the most fearsome thing on nirn and while the first few times you do get to fight them they will put a decent challenge bethesdas scaling works poorly to keep it that way as you level and gain vastly better gear add that to these encounters being quite common at times they completely lose that epic feel of the fight and just become an annoyance pure and simple this wouldnt nearly annoy me as much as it does if it wasnt for the fact that other clearly looking weaker wildlife found actually put up a better fight than the dragons do a shadow of the colossus or dragons dogma approach to these encounters would do the trick as those by comparison make the dragon fights in skyrim disappointingly shallow while the main quest for this game is mostly horrid it is the sidequests that offer the most enjoyment the daedra quests are especially great as with the previous games factions such as the dark brotherhood can be joined and through their storyline you will eventually rise through their ranks a minor detail thats bugged me since oblivion is that these factions never take into account your actual skill levels suppose youd join the mages college in winterhold and the teachers may comment on your great talent but really theyre just commenting on your lack thereof you can fully complete its storyline clearly aimed for mages having no magic skills at all i know daggerfalls old by now but even there they would check your skills to see if you were a suitable character to join their organization why did they not keep this in subsequent games while these games can be extremely immersive sometimes that immersion can be broken at times either by bugs which will always be present in such a gargantuan beast of a game or by ai repeating the same lines over and over notably the guards comments when you approach them it could be worse though no longer will you find the world of tamriel only having 5 voice actors working on it so there are still improvements the graphics as well skyrim is simply a beauty to behold last and by no means least the modding community they have always been a staple in the series since morrowind adding hours of playtime to these games skyrim has not changed in regards to this and it fact made mod installation easier thanks to its addition to the steam workshop find a mod you like just hit that subscribe button and open the launcher to see the game download it automatically its ridiculously simple and youd be silly not to give some of the fantastic mods already released a go its almost a sin to want to buy the console versions due to what they miss on these are the kinds of games that 10 years down the road with their dlcs fully released will still have people modding them and that is quite special all in all i say skyrim is a musthave for anyone with a remotely passing interest in the series its just that good complete with a deep customization great setting believable world and endless potential make sure you have a lot of spare time this game will soul trap you for a long time and you will more than likely thoroughly enjoy it as i have

so i need help i cant figure out if i have the game or not because when i try to press play it takes me to this wierd screen but doesnt load and at some times it says i have to purchase the game and even when i press that it takes me to this wierd screen idk what to do but i need help figuring this out

an excellent game although a bit buggy but easily worth it through myriad mods available through steam workshop
recommended
aside from all this paid mod buisness going on skyrim itself is a fantastic game and remains to be one of the greatest rpgs ever since it came out back in 2011
recommended
no paid mods 1010 best game
recommended
hell yeah mods
recommended
well that was a rough patch for us all valves rescinded their paidmods feature and have expressed that theyll try other directions regarding financially compensating the right mod authors for the work theyve put forth hopefully valve has taken what feedback in between the hate and the rage theyve collected and will produce what the people at large will support and agree with i for one am all for donation options to mod authors and would even suggest being able to initiate project kickstarters for those who have established a solid reputation for consistently producing highquality mods im still a tad leery i mean it just came and gone but as time passes i am hopeful that things will get back to normal that people will calm down and that valve will hit a solid compromise that nobody can find reason to argue with all that drama aside i can still recommend skyrim to prospective customers what skyrim can do that most games cannot is virtually guarantee that you  yes you mister anderson  will find exactly the kind of game youre looking for if youre willing to put time and effort into installing mods you might go 30 hours before needing mods that get you a thousand hours you might be like me and enjoy the base game for 1100 hours before playing mods either way if everything continues smoothly from here on out youll get the game you want out of skyrim for sure

simple the best game ive ever played

ive had this game for less than a week and already have 634 hours on record if that isnt a sign i love it i dont know what is between the amazing combat beautiful scenery engaging storyline and general feeling of badassery this game gives you theres nothing not to love that said if you have a girlfriend wife or other person you live with and care deeply for weigh your options carefully as this game will suck away an unhealthy chunk of your life

i was only lv 4 bow in hand i was sneaking up on valtheim towers the one bandit guard lazily gazed at a cliff face i snuck closer suddenly the bandit yells out im going to enjoy looting your corpse my heart stops have i been seen will she cut me up she runs away from me before i can react the locked doors burst open an orc sprints out sword in hand and he yells im going to enjoy counting your coin he sprints off in the same direction as the bandit guard i sneak up on the tower the doors spread wide open and peek around the corner out of curiosity the two bandits are on one side of the river shouting threats on the other side a lone rabbit busy not caring in the slightest about whats happening theres a third bandit an archer on the ridge above the rabbit he fires arrow after arrow missing every time i slowly sneak into the tower dismantling every trap and carefully checking for loot i finally arrive on the bridge from below i hear a shouted threat the rabbit is still alive but not for long after a solid ten minutes of being all talk one of the bandits is finally swimming across the river to finish off the rabbit and take its phat loot she corners the rabbit and with a quick slice its over she begins swimming back to her post i pull out my bow with the bandit in my sights i release an arrow this is for the bunny i whisper in slow motion the arrow arcs majestically through the air towards the bandit boom right in the heart in the middle of the river her body floats over a waterfall 1010 goty

skyrim is quite simply put one of the best rpgs ever made the game is absolutely massive ive put in just over 100 hours so far in the last week or so and im probably only about 2025% through the game there arent many games that give you 300 or more hours of single player gameplay in a single game and this game has to top the list the graphics are amazing and very beautiful the open outdoor world is massive and allows you to freely roam wherever you like with no artificial restrictions except perhaps the boundaries of the map which ive never reached in over 100 hours of gameplay unlike most other dungeons & dragons style rpgs that follow a more pen and paper based approach to painstakingly creating a character and assigning dozens of numerical character attributes and managing them over time skyrim is incredibly immersive by taking a different approach to character building and evolution in skyrim you choose your characters race from about 10 or so different races but you do not choose a character class or assign attribute points etc instead you start out as a newbie character with no real skills other than a few benefits attributed to the race youve chosen such as being naturally resistant to fire or whatever from that point on your character evolves based on how you choose to play the character via ingame decisions you take whatever weapons or skills you choose to start using to solve problems with you will evolve those skills and become better at using them for example if you use a bow and arrow a lot your archery skill will improve and you will essentially become an archer by way of doing it rather than via artificial preselection if you choose to cast spells and do other forms of magic such as staves etc then you will start to become a mage but nothing holds you back from specializing in as many things as you want this really makes the game incredibly flexible and tears down artificial class boundaries of the traditional rpg my character is a female high elf which has evolved via gameplay to become a thiefarchermage for example but the possibilities are endless and it allows for characters that are much more unique just as in the real world and not boxed into one well defined role the game is infinitely moddable also and has an incredibly rich modding community with mods that add new content and quests new items objects decorations new armour and weapons adult content and eyecandy humour and a multitude of other enhancementsaddons quite simply put this is one of the largest and incredibly fun to play rpgs ever made and any fan of rpgs who has not yet played skyrim should definitely get this game and prepare to set aside hundreds of hours for entertainment
recommended
i completely recommend skyrim ive played skyrim for years and with free mods lets not revisit a certain mistake the game is never ending i love skyrim and the elder scrolls series as its been apert of my life for over 10 years now even if you dont like rpgs youll more than likely like this one
recommended
honestly i just want you all to know that the mods for this game make this without a doubt the greatest modern rpg and allows it to stand up to the test of time almost 4 years after its release not to mention that it is already a high quality game prior to mods all in all i cant advise it more
recommended
the best openworld game ever
recommended
the game itself needless to say 910 in its basic rollout 1110 with the right mods as for payed mods it is a shining example on how a good thing in principle with real potential to improve things get useless and even cheeky due to a notevenhalfthoughttrough concept so far 1 for the cencelation of payed mods like it was implemented but 2 for the fact that not even the first rollout did get the necessary thoughts but also for the fact that it will be a major setback for a further goodthoughtthroughconcept rgds

still as excellent as game as it always has been this whole blip with the paid mods is but a small dark moment in the games history and with a bit of luck it will vanish into obscurity and the game will once again shine like the star it is just my positive review ive neglected to do to try and negate some of the negative two word ones that have been vomited at this due to a single bad decision
recommended
now that paid mods are no longer a thing i can recomend this game it has a vibrant free modding community which really makes the game its open and you can basically do whatever you want youre the dragonborn and you have shouts and swords and its pretty cool overall also there is loverslab for your depraved video game sex needs

tesv skyrim is the 5th installation in the elder scrolls series of games pros replayability the amount of factions you can join or oppose questlines and the like are so vast different playstyles grant both advantages and disadvantages and the random encounters in the world cause nothing to be boring or dull mod compatibility the mod community for skyrim is a myriad of different topics from fixing small bugs adding followers or even remodelling the game like skyrim redone by t3nd0 openworld adventure with many places to go and dungeons to explore there will always be something to do in skyrim cons some areas feel like theyre unfinished like windhelm the arena would have polished the grim city off rather well but bethesda didnt implement it unfortunately although this leaves resources for mod authors to create their own renditions of the content most characters have little or no unique dialogue leading to randoms with no real purpose capital cities are very empty and have 2035 citizens rather oddly again there are mods to fix this a lot of annoying bugs some of which can be fixed in the console opened with the tilde ` key above the tab button unofficial skyrim patch helps out with these overall a beautiful game with a lot of feeling although can feel desolate at times moddability is a massive plus with me allowing for a more customised game experience rating 7310
recommended
about skyrim skyrim is the game that has produced quality memes such as arrow to the knee and no lollygagging the game has a nice modding community and a large variety of mods from custom gear to replacing dragons with thomas the tank engine the vanilla skyrim without mods and such is great too it is relatively simple for people to play and doesnt require the skill level of dark souls for example in dark souls i find it hard not to die every 10 seconds thankfully valve listened to their customers and didnt make a thing out of paid mods also skyrim seems to even run on a potato rather well so you dont need a hardcore gaming pc for this game

the war is over my friends the paid mods are dead and freed from gabens hands sheath your swords and lets travel back home

thank you valve for pulling the pay for mods

longest lasting game you will ever play due to modding community however with the recent money shaped knife violently jabbed into the back of the workshop the future of this game is doubtful still an absolute necessity for all steam owners
recommended
skyrim is an excellent rpg capable of suck many hours from your life it tells numerous engaging stories and delivers an immersive experience in the frozen nothern lands of skyrim if youve played other elder scrolls titles you have a decent idea of what to expect if not youre likely going to be pleasantly suprised the steam workshop mod support for this game open up a contanstly growing database of new east to install content well worth the money
recommended
one of the deepest rpg experiences ever and does the elder scrolls franchise justice the story is creative and unique and excellent combat isnt as deep as games like witcher 2 however its easy combat system allows for the game to be accessible to all the modding community & scene within the game is amazing if you are looking for a way to change the dynamic of the game or just a aesthetic change there will most likely be a mod for it weapons armor quests its all there the graphics are still quite good especially with the hd texture pack and combined with a enb the game looks glorious its a must buy

its very nice buy it

would it break valves servers to allow unlimited space for text reviews 710 i have to be really really hard on this game  not out of hate but out of love  because while it is a masterpiece of decorative design it is also a deeply deeply flawed game to summarize my ambivalence to the world of skyrim i need only point out that i just called it the world of skyrim not the game of skyrim because what we have here are game mechanics built around a beautiful environment  not a beautiful environment developed to support a great game thats my thesis and im sticking to it  this is a world first and a game second a for that world oh that beautiful beautiful world how did they even do it it is a 15 square mile sandbox of which every single inch is carefully painstakingly handcrafted  it flows naturally from place to place its packed so dense with discoverabe locations each its own kind of little neighborhood and it feels unbelievably vast throw in some tricks of perspective and it looks even more enormous than it really is the world is magnificent aside some people dont like the sameness of the differing environments to me its called skyrim so hey there arent any deserts or jungles or tropical beaches they say that eskimos have 100 words for snow and i bet the art director knew about half of them i also bet they spent a goodly amount of time really investigating the many microclimates of the northern environment  because they faithfully replicated most of them in the game choosing a geographical limitation like norwayish and then doing everything you can to work within that context is not boring  its a bold move and i applaud it so you have a vast and pleasing world is that enough well no the world has to be populated by interesting places and interesting people so places first lets start with the cities or cities in one sense the cities are the core and the best of the world  capitals to their surrounding environment microcosms of their surrounding holds you look around and you generally arent wondering whether you are in markarth or riften because each place has its own vibe that makes it unique this is a great thing  it is immersive and beautiful but oh but walking through the city gates is where you start to be reminded that this is a fake place no tricks of perspective can make up for the fact that at most there are 20 buildings and 50 people  and often substantially fewer in this cradle of tamrielic civilization there are maybe 2000 people as a question of immersion it just takes away from the game to march across the glorious tundra and up a dang mountain and across a magical wonderbridge only to arrive at a college with four students and four teachers surrounded by six shacks and 10 more people a game of skyrim would include cities that took days to fully investigate that are so chock full of intrigue and secrets that you couldnt possibly find them all without a lot of hard work plop ten of those kinds of places into the word of skyrim and you might really have something as it is you dont it takes about a half hour to find every place of interest and to find and talk to every person worth talking to which brings us to people point the first in the broad strokes there are a wonderful variety of realized characters each with their own backstory and clearly lived life point the second its not enough consider sapphire in riften she leans against a wall and when you first meet her she tells you to screw off because you have no business with her awesome this is how many real people might react but then the immersionbreaking starts if you murder the barkeep in cold blood right in front of her she will say the same thing if you save a puppy she doesnt give a rip and again and again defeat the empire for the rebellion the stormcloak guards dont even know who you are become the apostle of a daedric prince that promotes cannibalism meh canniwhat yawn rise to the leadership of a group of known werewolves come on over and buy some tomatoes have you met my daughter this in a nutshell gets at what is wrong with skyrims population in a game where the whole point is to become a known quantity this is unforgivable what am i out there assassinating people for if i dont get no hate from the lawful goods and no love from the chaotic evils oh wait there are no moral factions the people are fake and the people are also pretty boring do i want to know what the jarl of winterhold thinks of the thieves guild tough sand and never mind the poor lumberworker down the road  he wont even tell me what he thinks of the jarl a woman who is supposed to spend her entire life selling food right in front of jorvasskr has no opinion on the companions two to four dialogue options apiece do not an immerive storyland make this is because the game was secondary but but people give you quests true and those quests are also boring go get some loot  go kill this guy come back repeat repeat repeat repeat god help you if you are much curious as to motive because mostly the quest info gives you the bare minimum to get you chasing the omnipresent quest marker which is impossible to turn off because quest journaling is incoherent eventually you may see some pretty lights or a semiinteresting character may die but in the meantime you will have spent your time crawling through five dungeon types which while admirably varied just arent interesting enough after the tenth one but its always a very very pretty walk to the dungeons what game during your crawls you will hit things with a very limited selection of melee attacks because magic is completely nerfed after about level 15 it stil takes my level 58 character a long while to fry a mudcrab  with magical fire  given the games poor balancing and much simplified magic options you might mix things up by sneaking up on a few at least as for the questlines i will be positive here i enjoyed the stories in all of them the problem is quite simply that i enjoyed the stories in all of them during the same playthrough  do the requisite dungeon crawling and you cannot fail to become the high king poobah of each and every group in the land which is great for casual players but disappointing if you care about you know role playing speaking of which calling this an rpg is an insult to all other rpgs if skyrim is an rpg then so is gears of war  you are given a role to play class buffs and a few special powers does not an rpg make there are no consequences to your choices no world reaction to your actions few alternative means to any particular end if you disagree try to play through the game without picking up a weapon try to murder all of the imperial jarls and report the good news to ulfric try to murder ulfric and report the good news to tullius good luck this is not an rpg also bugs seriously so why do i still recommend this game and very very highly at that one word mods not all of the above can be addressed but a lot has been and the game still offers a nearly endless amount of content and playable enjoyment i love the game like i love my family with a large amount of frustration
recommended
91 hours in i finished the main quest line i am absolutely astounded by how amazing games are getting this one came out nov 2011 even i kind of bounced around between doing quests and running around like a crazy man i ended up being a stealthy archer that could burst into flames at a moments notice i could one hit guys from a mile away and they never even saw what hit them even though i finished the main quest line i feel like ive barely started playing i cant imagine the amount of man hours required to polish this game i was using a few mods skyui being the most important i cant recommend this game enough i hope some day i can find time to play the expansions i only wish a 2nd player could have controlled my follower haha maybe i would have set her on fire less often
recommended
skyrim the best game man has ever created no questions asked period buy it or die
recommended
theres always something to do in this epic game just riding your horse and look around is amazing the main quest is really cool yet its just a tiny piece of the game one does not simply finish skyrim i cant write everything its seriously so much to know to make it as short as possible if you like to slay dragons and other evil creatures look like a badass help people with all sorts of tasks and travel through beautiful landscapes and scary dungeons you have to play this game

this is by far one of the best rpgs created with 273 quests this game is a must buy

probably the only game that has more mods installed then my garrys mod prepare to have your hard drives utterly molested by skyrim mods from graphics tweaks additional content patches textures sweet rolls and exploding chickens skyrim has it all and you can make women incredibly busty aswell
recommended
a game where you can kill a dragon by shouting at it a game where you can become hidden and steal stuff by placeing a bucket on the store keepers head a game where you can marry cats lizards elves and orcs a game where you can kill a demi god nickednamed the world eater easily yet children are immortal a game where you can go to the moon by taunting a giant a game where the guards of citys always seem to know everything even more than you a game where you can bring two bandits back from the dead as zombies walk around a city with them and no one seems to give a  a game where chickens count as eye witenesss to your crimes 1110 would steal a sweetroll again on a more serious note the games very big its fun but the combat is a bit dull and lacks any weight to it

a wealth of exploration combat and interaction theres always something to do plus the brilliant modding community expands the potential of this game infinitely a mustbuy

i guess i like playing this game i enjoy how the cows look real woolen almost like a wooly cow or a wooly rhino plus there are lots of goats in this game but i dont think there are any sheep which doesnt make sense where would the cows get the wool from in the first place its the small questions like that one which make the game for me i mean what other game out there right now has woolen cows in it i cant think of a single one not even farming simulator 2012 has cows made of wool in it so why does that game even get so much credit in the first place i dont get it if a game doesnt have woolen sheep and does have woolen cows then tell me where the cows get the in wool from all these unanswered questions are what make this game so great and better than its competitors such as checkers or big 2

made the way how i look at sandbox games forever its that good if you hear anyone give this game below a 710 at most they have brain problems

recommended
great game one of the first male npcs in the game was drunk and challenged my female character to a fistfight for $100 also i screamed a goat off of a mountain which was good
recommended
a brilliant rpg set in a beautifully created world dragons ogres and bandits run amok and you can easily lose yourself in the game doing the near infinite amount of quests be a stealthy assassin or powerful mage and discover the power of the dragonborn while fight for the imperial empire or stormcloak rebellion if you want to there is so much to this game that you can spend over 100 hours in it and never touch the main quests and when youre done it has an extensive modding community to offer new creatures weapons and entire quests to keep your adventure going

skyrim oh where to start i got the game for the xbox 360 christmas 2011 yes i was a console peasent back then and was instantly dragged into a fanboy state i remember the opening cutscene playing and i just sat there squeling like a little girl after powering through the tutorial i was faced with the massive worldspace and the hours of exploring questing and fighting that lied ahead as i slowly walked towards the town of riverwood i saw the amazing variety of landscapes that sprawled out across the world and stood in awe wondering where to begin on the subject of gameplay despite a few minor bugs which have mostly been patched by mods like the unofficial skyrim patch and bethesdas own patches its extremely fun and engaging the way the combat feels is amazing expecially the archery and the more tedious tasks crafting enchanting and alchemy for example are fun and rewarding in their own way the story was exciting if a little bit predictable and the characters were interesting however there are as with all games some downsides you can find yourself forced down a few paths and sometimes youll experience game breaking issues like one of the master spell quests was bugged for me but it doesnt take away from what a truely great experience skyrim is
recommended

skyrim i dont really think theres much that i can say about this game that hasnt already been said ive played hundreds of hours on this game i initially played on console and ive loved every minute skyrim is one of those games that just never gets old you can always come back to it and therell be new stuff to find and thats just vanilla without mods the modding community for this game is fantastic and if you cant find what you want on the steam workshop there are thousands of mods on the skyrim nexus from things as simple as retextures to make your game beautiful all the way up to entirely new worlds there are mods out there that will completely change your experience and thats what i lovwe about this game it never plays the same twice i highly recommend this game to anyone even if youre not a big rpg fan this game is still a masterpiece at such a low price now this game is an absolute steal
recommended
a little more action heavy than previous elder scrolls games rpg elements are a bit lighter with fallout style perks to help diversify character builds the world is huge easily hundreds of hours of gameplay after 2 years i still come back to play a night every few weeks one of my all time favorite games
recommended
one of the best crpg ever created the mods allow to extent the gameplay significantly and although i have played it quite a lot i still find new quests and uncompleted tasks
recommended
had this on the ps3 when it came out and bought it during the thanksgiving sale totally worth it it is so much better on pc then it is on console
recommended
great game 200 hours in and i have finished the theives guild questline dark brotherhood questline and the college of winterhold questline and have close to 50000 gold along with the quests the dlcs are also worth the money words of wisdom dragonborn dlc is not a good idea to purchase before level 4050 i tried at level 5 kept on dying tried again at 20 also kept on dying and once again at level 45 and let me tell you even then it is still pretty hard the hearthfire dlc is pretty cool you get to build a house adopt kids move in with your wife etc the only problem is be prepared to spend a lot of gold and collect a lot of recources because you have to build everything in your house i mean everything unless you want to spend 10000 gold to have your housecarl you can move people like lydia into your house and have them decorate for you overall the game is very time consuming fun and well put together 1010

in my time skyrim has been one of the best games ive ever playedit has all you need for an indulging play if you like medievil dragon age steel clashing things then i suggest skyrim i like skyrim for the freedom and the fact you dont need to choose a class you can make one be it ranger mage battlemage warrior swordsman theif assasin etc its your choice dlcs are a good addon but they are quiet pricey so the cheapest and the bestin my view is hearthfire the others yea killing fighting but hearthfire is one of my favourite you can build your own house which i think is pretty cool and raise a familiy so yes i suggest skyrim i think its a great game and you should play it
recommended
quite possibly the greatest game to end the xbox 360playstation 3 era there is so much to do in this game  if you had 20 dollars to spare and you could only purchase one game in the next 4 years this would be the game to buy i have about 1000 hours collectively put into this game from 2011 i bought this game when it first came out a few months after my high school graduation i used to pirate games but thanks to this game i now purchase games legitimately why because i realized that developers like this need that financial support the amount of love that the development team put into this game is legendary you can tell that they truly cared about creating a place that would forever last in your memories ive beaten the games main stories only twice but there is still a crapton of stuff you can do afterwards the game simply never ends i often crave for the games viking theme and it truly feels like a new game each time anyways if you havent purchased the game already you truly need this game in your library you cannot call yourself a gamer and not have played this game greatest game of all time so far 1010

this game has a great story a great ending and great boss battles play it this means you nicky

i feel like ive got enough hours under my belt to put together a fair review of this game so lets hope itll be a useful one at the time of leaving this review ive clocked 199 hours but ive played this game for a fair amount of time in offline mode on top of that probably about 20 hours or so so what was i doing on this game for all that time the first 30 or so were pretty much a waste though this isnt really the fault of the game i went into this game not really knowing what to expect as i knew little to nothing about the world of elder scrolls i was more eager to just play than i was to pay attention to the characteristics and powers of each race so i ended up choosing a nord and progressing down an allrounder character route investing skill points in a bunch of random skill trees while the idea of being an allrounder and being able to approach combat however you choose might sound appealing in this game it felt really boring but thats not necessarily a bad thing it encouraged me to start fresh and being partial to the magic and spells in this game i decided to play through as a high elf mage and found this route to be right for me and overall pretty enjoyable however sometimes the game crashes without warning and may crash again at the exact same point the next time you attempt it which can be extremely irritating and make gameplay feel beyond tedious also if id played this game on a console instead of pc im not really sure how id feel about it for two reasons the first is console commands which among other things allow you to perform actions which should have been features implemented in the base game available from a low level such as allowing you to remove perks youve chosen and select different ones in their place the second is mods the modding community has produced a whole variety of very useful mods which fix bugs balance combat and leveling and add in new features some of which should have been there in the first place  overall making the game a much more enjoyable experience all in all i do like this game but if i didnt have access to console commands and mods i probably wouldnt like it all that much
recommended
what a fantastic game its even better that i purchased it from amazoncom where it was delivered much quicker than i initially expected it came with no damage to the exterior of the games case and the packaging was incredibly secure great job amazon

one of my favorite rpg games of all times and mods make this game just sosexy

this game makes you want to play it and then gives you the possibility to mod your game and then you simply cant stop adding until you see that isnt running perfectly and delete all your mods to install them again and you  up on something and you go cry in the corner i had probably twice the hours i had playing in this game just from modding today is a sad day i give up from installing mods in this i cant even load my game and i honestly lost all my effort on trying to understand why it happened farewell skyrim i will cry to my bed now and maybe play you someday vanilla i just hope witcher 3 has hundreds of hours like this game although i doubt it tldr this game will make you feel miserable if you mess with make a mistake with mods but it was worth it when it worked edit made this review when i had 70 hours or something now 170 and currently growing best game ever if you get your mods working together
recommended
the elder scrolls v skyrim is personally my favorite storybased game the many classes you can be enriches the game and you can defeat the ultimate dragon in numerous ways according to your chosen warrior not only do you play the storyline but you can choose to freely roam skyrim at any point in the game and obtain the best gear in the game the huge variety of enemies and monsters to defeat in the game creates an endless fun experience getting the dlc for the game enhances the game in many ways 1110
recommended
probably one of the best buys ive ever made in my short gaming career a solid playthrough altogether the possibilities with mods are literally endless and you will find yourself sinking hundreds of hours into what i beleive to be a fantastic buy

i really liked this game it has hours of play and so many diffrient things to do from vampires to dragons to werewolfs to wizards there are so many major quest lines to do another thing about the game is that it is skill based compared to mainly level based there is still a leveling system but it relies hevily on skills that was my favorite part
recommended
if you havent played skyrim yet youre an idiot
recommended
i finished the main quest for skyrim a couple of days ago and i have to say im just a little dissapointed at the ending the first encounter with alduin was more epic then the second i may make a mod just to right that tragedy i also might make another one but as i do not trust the internet and awesome ideas i shall not speak of it other than that i am way more than satisfied with the game it has great graphics awesome gameplay i feel like a warrior blowing away my enemies and what is more fun than slaying dragons and even riding them

tldr this game is tops if for some reason you havent tried skyrim at this point the gamer inside me wants to express its greatness to you haters gonna hate though if youre among them move along a beautifully designed fully immersive world im sad to admit im in the population of elder scrolls players who started with skyrim but what an absolutely amazing game ive played roughly 10x more than my clocked hours on this account from previous accounts other consoles and watching friends play i am currently on my 10th playthrough which was mostly played on 66 difficulty  legendary other plays outside the first on 56  master every playthrough was an adventure purchasing the legendary edition was a great buy and well worth the investment 66 diff has proven itself to be a hefty challenge and it requires you to use every beneficial aspect of the game possible in order to step out the front door or prison gates with a civil war going on ancient dragonpriests maintaining themselves and their undead armies centuries after their deaths relentless elves from the aldmeri dominion troubling social class strata pesky and meddling daedra and people with problems around every corner the options of things to do are virtually endless will you choose to help and save the world or become the most powerful super villian skyrim has ever seen oh yea did i forget to mention dragons cuz we got those too an wonderful aspect of this game is the amount of workshop material developed by the community and many mods alter the gameplay from texture updates ui features building your own civilization allowing followers to mount horses having a handful of followers to be your personal army and more unstable ones that even let you turn into a dragon yourself after strolling the steam workshop along with nexus mods ive found dozens of addons that ive stuck with through multiple playthroughs 3 dlc dawnguard hearthfire dragonborn in a nutshell dawnguard further develops the plight of the vampires in skyrim and allows you to either join a faction that seeks and destroys vampires or become one yourself hearthfire adds 3 plots of land in addition to the 5 buyable houses available for purchase where you can build your own home with a creative house building interface that lets you build your house piece by piece and eventually build a large manor with 3 wings and a basement dont forget your spouse and up to 2 adoptable children can move and live there as well sadly winterhold is the only hold where a house or plot of land is unavailable to purchase dragonborn offers the new playable area of solstheim and a main quest line to go along with it involving a previous dragonborn who abused the powers of one of the daedra hermaeus mora and gained immense power the spells abilities and thuum or shouts you discover in this expansion are extremely powerful including unique buffs you yourself can siphon from the knowledge contained by hermamora all in all 1110 if youre on console good luck fully completing a playthrough you will hit a game breaking glitch pc users luckily can use console commands to fix virtually any problem glitch or mishap you may encounter familiarizing yourself with useful commands is recommended as with a game this big you have to expect hiccups but on pc there hasnt been a problem i couldnt fix recommended over and over replayability is huge if you get bored mod it up theres lots out there

my review for this game is located at httpsteamcommunitycomapp72850discussions041973820730406687 the reason that it is there and not here is due to it not fitting in this space if you are here simply to know whether or not i would recommend this game then it is with a hearty yes skyrim is a fantastic openworld fantasy western rpg that has held up extremely well since its release largely due to its vibrant modding community
recommended
having played the elder scrolls games throughout my childhood i can honestly say this is a masterpiece oblivion was great but all of the gripes i had with obvilion have been fixed and things i didnt even think of were added if bethesda was any other software company they wouldve overdone themselves but this is bethesda were talking about they performed at the highest level as usual

okay this is the greatest game ive ever played just getting that out in the uninspired craphole of call of duty and battlefield this game is a massive breathe of fresh air everthing is virtually perfect the visuals the music the combat the item system everything is immaculate this is the first fantasy game in years to feel like a fantasy game everything feels so unique and well done the npcs feel real the visuals immerse you so quickly youll be completely unaware of anything going on around you at first the story seems very cliche but it works incredibley the story mode is the perfect length its not as depressingly short as batman arkham city yet not as annoying long as portal 2 even if the story doesnt quite quench your thirst for adventure there are hundreds of side quests and side quest lines to keep you occupied the levelling system is smooth and you actually have to practice to level up in any given skill tree want to level onehanded combat grab a onehanded sword head into the wilds and start slaughtering want to level illusion spells equip some find some test subjects and see what your spells can do i have this game on xbox 360 and pc and i honestly prefer the xbox version but there is one thing the pc can do that consoles cant mods there are thousands of mods that can do anything from adding a huge arena to the vast game world to making npcs run indoors when a dragon attacks a village mods can help you iron out the few imperfections this game has the game world is vast sprawling and beautiful anything from a shack inhabited by a little old lady who turns out be an evil and powerful witch to huge and active cities full of lootable shops houses that can all be broken into and individual and interesting npcs that interact with you in different ways depending on how you act with unique and handcrafted temples and dungeons villages deep in the mountains lairs inhabited by sleeping dragons and secret crypts that all somehow link to a quest saying this game has good graphics is a massive understatement the textures look a little lowres when you get up close but the world never fails to immerse you with its beauty and realism there are 3 basic ways to go in this game the warrior the thief and the mage if you choose the path of the warrior you will be responible for levelling thing like onehanded twohanded blocking and heavy armour which eventually allows you to pulverize any enemy who dare stand in your way if you choose the path of the thief like i did you will have to level skill like lockpicking pickpocketing my personal favourite and sneak which allows you to slither through any nook and cranny silently and maybe doing some looting if you choose the path of the mage you will have to level skills such as illusion destruction conjuration and restoration which allow you to apply paralysis poisoning and enslavement on any and all npcs restoration however allows you to heal the wounds of you and your allies the dlc packs for this game include in order dawnguard hearthfire and dragonborn dawnguard is my favourite of the 3 in it you are told of a vampire hunting group called the dawnguard if you visit fort dawnguard you will be sent to castle volkhier were you will meet you guessed it vampires at this point youre given the choice to join the vampires and reek havok or get the hell out of there and return to fort dawnguard and become a vampire hunter i wont spoil anything but its definately worth what it costs hearthfire is rather simple this expansion pack allows you to purchase land build a home and start a family its nice but building a house is hard work which i enjoy but you need a lot of patience finally dragonborn i didnt like dragonborn that much but it was a fun expansion and definately worth it tip if you stand atop the highest southern mountain on a clear day you can see whitegold tower in cyrodil from oblivion how cool is that bethesda has created the perfect western rpg and one i will compare future wrpgs to in the future it may sound like im kissing bethesdas  here but they deserve nothing less after this masterpiece if you were a fan of any elder scrolls game before this you will enjoy the hell out of skyrim the elder scrolls v skyrim easily earns the score of 1010 perfect if youve bothered to read this far without running off and buying the game do it now you cant realize what a good game is until you play this game
recommended
this is probably my favorite game what is lacking in content you can just get in mods
recommended
1010 gives moist nipples very gooch

a must have for everybodys collection it provides hours and hours of gameplay

this game is the most amazing thing in the world ive owned it one ps3 and xbox 360 and now i own it for pc ive logged hundreds of hours between the two consoles and i cant reccomen this game highly enough
recommended
people tell me to enjoy life you have to stop and smell the flowers well people its kind of hard to do that when even the flowers are spurting consumerism all over your face in a strangely suggestive manner the hype surrounding the release of skyrim was the truest example of this and i dont think ive ever seen so many nerds swoon at one time the game will see you as a prisoner again these guards really have to stop arresting the worlds greatest heroes when youre freed by a reptilian anger management escapee a story for the ages for sure finally after choosing to follow your death penalty chum or the man that nearly turned you into the next eugene armstrong you are let loose upon the unsuspecting land of skyrim at this point youre left to your own devices and by all means you can follow the ever present arrow to the following plot point or you can jog off find a shop put a cooking pot on the shopkeepers head and steal all his goods assuming you play the pc version if not you can suck on my dragon bone however there are situations the game randomly drops you in i fondly look upon the time i killed a blacksmith and received money from her will even though that was the first time i met her of course then her boyfriend caught on and hired mercenaries to kill me but ended up killing an innocent bystander who i then also received money from suckers i bet youre expecting an ending statement here but im afraid the reptile had an aneurism and burned it up by the way i know youll get the nude and killable children mods
recommended
the replayability of this game is endless on pc with mods and with such graphics anyone in the family would enjoy this rpg
recommended
in all the hours ive played skyrim im still not tired of it i had for the 360 for a while and i put a ton of hours into it now that i have it on the computer i would definitley reccomend it to anyone the mods you can get for the game is ridiculous and it can add so much to your game overall even though it is an older game it is still one of my personal favorites
recommended
found a dead guy on the side of the road he had 100 gold would do again

best game in the world
recommended
probably my least favorite tes that i have played though that doesnt mean its horrible it has a lot of copy and pasted content castles crypts caves for a 3d game it still focuses more on stats then skill which is a bit of a problem but mods like duel or ace can fix combat and the ai performance to make it a little more fun and bearable there is a lot to do in this game though its a lot of the same thing over and over again it has a few stand out questsdungeons and has a fun and intriguing main storyline though the civil war campaign is garbage and most of the things in the game get very repetative the puzzles in this game are incredibly easy and the same over and over again much like the combat and stealth  ai  the ai in the game arent very good when it comes to combat or common sense for that matter a lot of the ai have cool personalities and some of them even have very unique backgrounds as i said earlier mods like duel ace can improve ai combat performance  stealth  the stealth system is almost completely stat based it requires at low levels you will be detected fairly easily but after leveling up your stealth perks or not you become almost impossible to detect  combat  as i implied earlier the combat in this game is very generic and easy fighting as a warrior all you have to do is kite attacking then running back over and over fighting as an archer stealth or not is just about draining as many arrows as you can in them before they get close to you it is hard to miss as an archer because of the crosshair which you can disable < i did but at very distant ranges it can become a bit challenging mages in this game are bad and boring to put it simply they dont do much damage until they are very high levels and even then you feel more like a glass rifle then a glass cannon  wrapup  this game feels like it is just trying to make dumb people feel like badasses rather then challenging the players in any way i feel morrowind made players think and put effort forth to figure things out a majority of the time the game is good for one vanilla playthrough since the stupid level up system they put in this game enables you to not have to choose a playstyle and stick with it the game does that a lot in different ways giving you many chances to back out of a choice after you learned the consequences the level up system makes replaying the game practically pointless if you are looking to have different playthrough experiences since there are almost no choices in the game that have any real impact on anything 610 as a standalone game 510 as a tes game 110 required intelligence level most of the things i said that were wrong with this game can be improved with mods though that should not be an excuse to say the game is good my rating is based off of the vanilla game experience
recommended
i was hooked from the moment i woke up on the cart and am still hooked i have been the quintessential wizard dashing rogue as well as the antitypical orc diplomat with so many different ways to play the vanilla game how can you not become enmeshed in the grandeur and spectacle that is tamriel and just when you think you are done someone makes a mod that you have to try and then the cycle begins anew its not real but the feelings are

the elder scrolls v skyrim is a game where you play as a soulless serial  who tries to suck the souls out of innocent dragons this game is absolutely stunning on low graphics and you have to play it on low graphics or your game will crash from entering a building the combat system has redefined the elder scrolls series as it is changed to a rightclick to block and a leftclick to hit the entire modding community of the elder scrolls v skyrim is made up of 40yearold perverts who sit in there mothers basements and try to make graphically enhancing mods for nude characters that have visible neck seams i would rate the elder scrolls v skyman a 1210

playing it through the 1st run through is great as it takes a while to finish off the campaign the missions are diverse and intense yet some show surreal serenity the one problem which i have come across is repetitiveness as when you make a new character you will find that you will drop off slowly  squinty
recommended
very expansive game with unending mods really keeps you playing it

probably my favourite game of all time this has the best modding community ever 10 years into the future and i bet people are still playing skyrim

truthfully the best game rpg game i have ever played totally worth every cent

total play time upon writing this review pc 210 hours xbox 360 about a billion years endlessly replayable game with hundreds of side quests to waste your life on plus the fantastic modding community that this game has means you will never run out of things to do and theres a mod which makes chickens explosive enough said 1010 would destroy my social life all over again

a open world game with a world that seems never ending you will face strong warriors mages armys and of course the most deadly the dragon with many dungeons to explore vanilla skyrim alone sets itself high above what i initially expected placed in a world where two factions clash against one another in wars if you choose to do them this game gives you immensive control over decisions want to be a mage ok want to be a warrior in your armor with a giant sword ok lets delve farther into this idea of freedom though something new and exciting want to be a mage wearing heavy armor wielding a sword ok but theres just so much customization you can make your own unique character and it doesnt stop there if you choose so the skyrim nexus or steam workshop has a extensive library of mods to help you make that special person in your mind want a specific looking armor want something outragous like exploding arrows want a car for whatever reason you would want one in this game you can get it with mods ending this games rating i would highly recommend ive spent countless hours playing it since it first came out and it still brings me much enjoyment its honestly worth more then any game ive ever bought so much so that i had to buy the steam version so i could use mods and experiment more with it then the consoles allow my rating for this game is 1010 and i would definitely buy again if i had too

used to play weeks worth of this masterpiece in my old ps3 and i got the pc one because mods 3 and its arguably one of the best rpg games ever made every penny worth

im writing this reveiw to tell everyone to buy this game this is one of the best games i have ever played i have played it on xbox for over 500 hours and on pc if you do not have this game then i would highly recomend buying this game in this game you can be a warrior mage theif vampire warewolf and much more the quest line is an amazing experience if you like action adventure games then you must buy it after finishing the main missions there are a wide range of things to do and i dought you could get bored playing this game modding in this game is easy and makes the game even more fun to play the only down side to this game is that it is not multiplayer if they did bring out multiplayer for this game it would be the best game ever made dont listen to the people that do not recommend the game they know nothing of what they can do in this game this game can go above the line with mods and is just amazing the graphics are pretty good its can run on almost any pc but to play this game and you have a 75hz 100hz 120hz 144hz monitor then you need to go into your settings and change it to 60hz this game can only run at 60hz which does not change the graphics warning if you do play at 60hz then your props in the game are going to go crazy such as carrages are going to fly you have been warned thank you for reading my opinion on skyrim hope you buy it and enjoy the endless fun

having already 533 hours now i thought it was time to write a review first of all im a huge fan of the elder scrolls series i played every one of them and loved them all some more than others however ill start by saying tes v is not my favorite in terms of story or characters almost none of the characters are really interesting and the story was pretty bald in rpg the story matters to me the most but skyrim had such beautiful locations and great gameplay that i couldnt possibly dislike it the graphics in skyrim are beautiful even without mods and the locations are a huge improvement morrowind and the other games are pretty outdated but they had different locations most locations in oblivion were copypasted however skyrim takes the best of both worlds a lot of different beautiful and interesting locations skyrim really encourages exploring because you might find loot or a very nice view the soundtrack is as in every tes game amazing the voice actors did a great job even though some actors seem to be reused a lot the gameplay was also a huge improvement however unlike previous games magic seems pretty useless the combat is fun but might get boring after a while its not as hard as it was in morrowind but it depends if you find this good or not even after completing this game the fun never stops skyrim has a very active modding community with lots of different mods that make this game even nicer and add tons of extra hours to the gameplay if youre still not sure if you want this buy this game you really should it is really worth the price

this review was made with 244 hours playtime on steam and much more off steam i would like to begin by giving a quick overview of the game in the elder scrolls v skyrim you presume the role of the dragonborn destined to do all sorts of things from exploring dungeons to sleeping in inns to eating sweetrolls whats wrong someone stole your sweetroll never mind because this is the fifth game in the series that is the five main games in the series arena daggerfall morrowind oblivion and of course skyrim skyrim itself takes place in the northerntundras of tamriel a wartorn land split by a civil war and infested with bandits right now thats all finished this time ill try something different with the reviewing system ill split everything up gameplay 710 a good gameplay system depending on who you are a massive change from morrowind and a partial continuation of the general feel of oblivion skyrim has some new gameplay mechanics that is the perk trees of each individual skill the way those skills work and interact with the game on a mechanical and general level and the general leveling of each statskill the reason this hasnt gotten a 1010 for all the new gameplay mechanics is mostly due to the fact that skyrim was to put it bluntly but truthfully dumbed down by which i mean made easier made simpler made more mash this and repeat that the late game classarchetypes end up being literally that  as a mage stunlocking is all you do as a rogue stealth kills with insane damage levels is all you do as a warrior potions potions potions potions potions potions oh and more potions  is all you do this can all be fixed by the community in fact it has been fixed by the community as youll find out soon enough story 510 ah quite the letdown to be honest whether or not you find the storyline of the game interesting or not is truly dependant on your preference without spoiling anything the most i can say is the storyline of skyrim was a huge downgrade from that of say morrowind oblivion even not that i much enjoyed that either there are a few plotholes here and there and in general the whole storylines is pretty repetative and unengaging it should also be noted that again cured by the community there is very little choice within the storylines which could cause them to become boring after a short while yes i understand this isnt just a problem with skyrim but im reviewing skyrim combat 410 as earlier mentioned the combat mechanics of the game are rather basic and simplistic this may not affect you but after a while when youre stuck doing the exact same thing or mashing the exact same buttons with weapons and tactics that can beat the highest game difficulties masterlegendary as if they were on the lowest things do tend to get boring and tedious the lategame of this is horrible  but then again starting the game over a couple of hundred thousand million billion trillion times never hurt anyone trust me ive been there and ive done that no really  really but to be serious the combat system in the vanilla game is very repetative and thus very tedious andor boring but some people enjoy that kind of thing the simplistic side to combat where you dont have to care about much else other than doing the same things over and over to max out your characters so good for you my completionistchums that is unless youre a completionist who doesnt like having to do that kind of thing graphics look im a person who plays a game for the game  not the graphics otherwise for all those pixelterrorists heh no ok sorry out there there are plenty of graphics mods all over and even bethesdas own high resolution texture pack the world 710 skyrims world rather coincidentally not really named skyrim is a tundra landscape with many mountains and valleys rivers and lakes frozen seas and the like a vast land with alot to discover explore and contemplate from beautiful scenes to rough areas to scary crypts and tombs  skyrim has it all pretty much barring a few exceptions if you can see it you can visit it the memes 810 no 910 no 10 wait decide for yourself i used to be a normal human like you till i took a skyrim to the knee the gods gave you two hands and you use them both for your [censored] i can respect that no lollygagging please just why call yourself a nord no im an orc a fricken orc filthy milkdrinker wow youve just insulted 869% of the worlds population that actually drink milk daily the community 4189748941610 skyrim has one of the if not the greatest communities there is even now 4 years after its launch  there are people working hard on modding the game helping those with technical difficulties and the like lets plays are still going on and the fact that im here typing this review alot later than the games actual release date should be proof enough that skyrims community has lived on for a long long time my last thoughts to buy or not to buy that is the question  william scrollspeare yes although i would recommend testing out the occassional mod or even deciding to play your game fullymodded unless you want to stick with the native skyrim game i bid you adieu
recommended
this game be cool base game only for 3 playthroughs one for every playing style like ya know mage warrior thief then you have to add variety yourself by restricting what you can and cant do and the use of mods but i got like 100 hours without mods and it was worth it
recommended
i like the game tis gud i hate dying tis bad
recommended
the storyline the sidequests the mods the freedom ah the freedom everything is perfect on this game i love it so much no words can express that

hi everyone please check out my profile for more reviews this was clearly a massive breakthrough for bethesda and the begginings for the elder scrolls series this is the rpg that finally took open world fun over the top clearly i am very happy with this game which is quite rare for me the first person gameplay again freakin dragons really make the gameplay intense the graphics are fantastic also there is a free dlc available for better graphics and textures it truly sets a great speed for the memory it takes up really that is one of the only things i have to say about this game that i dislike the memory space for it especially if you download the dlcs is kind of nasty but if you have a computer thats built for gaming like mine then im sure we can handle a couple seconds of bad ram refering to the earlier comments on the dlc they have four of them including the free bit the majority of the dlcs only affect the gameplay enemies and spells that you can use its very suprising that this game is twenty bucks i received it on a sale for five dollars my brother had been showing me the gameplay on his xbox the first xbox game i played and got me hooked onto the serious in which i played the second and fourth and obviously fifth games of the elder scrolls series i was super excited when i played it for the first time note please that i was young at the time and never really had any magnificent experiences on video games at the time the only really big systems were the gamecube wii and ds was i a big fan of nintendo yes so you couldnt imagine my excitement when i purchased it for such a low price be thankful that this game is sometimes lower than five bucks and they have sales for it quite often the workshop is quite fun you have alot of crap you can do and some overpowered deeds you can commit to of course as we all know when you play a game the last thing you want to do is die quickly in this case at the beggining you have collected some stuff that you can use to your advantage from the original elder scrolls like the destruction healing and other useful things the spawns amoung the forests and mountains are very well done
recommended
if you like openworld rpgs you gonna like skyrim with all those amazing mods produced by the community you just cant get enough of this game
recommended
best game since morrowind
recommended
probably one of the best games ive ever played
recommended
skyrim just made elder scrolls gold the game is unbelieveably amazing in every aspect especially when bethesda made it the fallout series 3 new vegas were the games that made the type of gameplay that they put off handsdown my favorite combat in my eyes is very stratigized not having to rush to kill the enemy before your companion does and not having vats is great example i had to run and jump off of things so that the enemy which was way stronger than me would fall back father behind me so that i can heal and gain some more magika also on pc it blows the skyrim expericence up to the roof its beautiful skyrim is where its at if you want a new openworld game 110100
recommended
a friend of mine got me into this game a while ago and its free roaming gameplay and general ability to craft almost anything reeled me in then the ability to mod the game came in and i was hooked even more with every dlc the game kept growing even after being out for years now this game just keeps going people love it and i know why they do with all that people contribute to making the game more than it was released as it has become a peoples game made by bethesda but shaped by the players into whatever vision each of us may have it has become a huge way for so many to express ideas and share them with countless others as a modder for this game the happiness my work and the work of so many others brings to people is pricelessand better than any amount of $
recommended
very good game while the story may not be as good as in previous elder scrolls games its still a epic game the fact that you play as a dragonborn is a nice change which brings me to the shouts they were a very good addition to the game and they can be pretty fun for example unrelenting force aka the popular fus ro dah graphics wise its not the best there is in terms of textures theres also shadow striping in some spots but graphics arent always the main priority of a game there are bugs and stuff that should have been in the game but the dlcs add extra questlines and content which are really great my favorite is dragonborn but you may have different opinions dragonborn and dawnguard add extra questlines and places and hearthfire gives you the ability to build your own home in 3 places even so if you want the game to be perfect then get the mods you want and your experience will be very great score 910 by itself 9410 with dlc 1010 with dlc and mods
recommended
just bought this game on sale for $499 gotta say it pays to have steam

anyone who likes rpgs should have skyrim a lot of people will say oblivion was better and in a lot of ways it was but with the steam workshop and the nexus at your fingertips skyrim easily becomes one of the funnest and most immersive rpgs out there vanilla skyrim is fine but the mods make it what it is definitely recommend it

recommended
safe to say this is one of the best games out there if you like adventure and magical storytelling i loaded this with mods like climates of tamriel vanilla nights real rain hd textures and purewater its stunning on ultra allthough im not a fan of medieval kind of games skyrim really sucked me in and i love to explore this game it only gets better and better  you should play this
recommended
i would not have recommended this game three years ago however the mod community lowered price and excellent expansion pack content make skyrim a mustown and not for the vanilla experience i will stand by my opinion that oblivion was better especilly in the uniqueness of the quests it offered as opposed to find x in cave full of draugr and dont get me started on the bs but the combat is better in skyrim argument since the same bad combat system is just hid behind fancy execution moves but the expansion pack content is genuinely interesting and through modding ive made my game a hardcore and fastpaced experience that feels not unlike diablo to clarify thats in pure intensity and not literally like a dungeoncrawler its disappointing to have to merely say the mods make this game but thats the harsh reality in this case the expansion content however as ive stated twice already is highquality and only emphasises how mediocre the vanilla game is edit also i would highly recommend playing this game with a controller the character feels more weighty to me that way although that could be personal preference  you will have trouble playing an archer that way

well where do i begin the elder scroll skyrim is easy the best game ive ever played although im not the most hardcore reviewer in the world its an excellent game and you should buy it if you dont have it already you get an excellent rpg experience with an open world environment and hours apon hours of content and thats without the dlc or any mods mods is what really makes this game shine the modding community on both nexus and steam workshop are both excellent and bursting with content for you to enjoy like i said before if you havent already buy this game

skyrim is an amazing game where you can be the dragonborn cast shouts do magic and defeat the neverending waves of evil in the land of skyrim you can do outstanding things like dying repeatedly sitting in your desk chair for hours trying to farm your smithing skill killing innocent people and if you have mods killing children and fapping to naked women what else could you want from an amazing rpg game where youre the ultimate badass to an extent 1010 it was ok
recommended
i dont know why id bother even making a review for skyrim at this point since everyone has blown a collective load over it this game is fantastic beautiful endearing and i can say that any bug or problem that skyrim has makes it all the more memorable and lovable mods are a great way to enhance whats already there with ones such as falskaar that can add hours of new lorefriendly content to an already timeconsuming and amazing game the community is welcoming and rich with art mods and jokes i love this game regardless of the paid mods blunder this game is one of my top five favorite games without a friggin doubt do i even have to whine at you to buy it 910 would fly into stratosphere by the hand of a giant again

i highly reccommend this game altough i can honestly say that i spend twice the time modding the game than i do playing it
recommended
id definately recommend this game this game is a few years old now 2011 but it is still an amazing game to play with all the great mods out there it is even possible to add more fun to the game or more awe with the many graphic mods that are out there

 this review is lengthy if you just want the summary scroll to the bottom if you want a breakdown of the items listed feel free to read all of it either way youll get an accurate honest review of the game if you want a simple review scroll down to the bottom after owning the game on both pc and console and after creating a myriad of characters ranging from the buffest most brutal warriors to the most timid and sly pickpocketers i can say that this game is hands down amazing its been three years since the release of the elder scrolls v skyrim 111111 and it has captured my attention ever since most of my hours were logged on console before i came to my better senses got a pc and grabbed the legendary edition on sale for 20 bucks this review will detail the following  base game  combat  types of characters and races  variety of mods  recommendations and conclusions about the game note no storyline other than nonspoiler mentions will be made in this review so dont worry about that the base game itself is very satisfying the staggering amount of side quests individuals random events and items gives the game an almost endless replayability the skill trees are straightforward and easily read and used the inventory is very simple yet as many people can understand the inventory has no search bar making searching for a quest item a little more challenging in a cluttered inventory the inventory is sorted alphabetically so the worst you have to do is scroll down a list of infinite keys letters from friends death threats and other sorts of nonsuch which isnt really bad side quests are very rewarding and fun you never know if the stranger who is stranded on the side of the road needing help with his wagon is a simple person in need of help or a runaway murderer the leveling of the skill tree can go on forever and so can the main level which used to be 81 but patch 19 allowed you to make any skill that is level 100 into a legendary perk resetting its skill to 15 and letting you earn an infinite amount of xp from your skill trees the main level can even go above level 252 so no need to worry about capping out on a level because your skill trees that made your character a thief archer warrior etc were already in other words unlimited leveling combat is very rewarding and fun it can be challenging at times but thank talos you have a million and one potions of archery alchemy health stamina magika and lockpicking to see you through it fighting one on one is simple enough but one against several is challenging and can try the patience and skill of even the most battlehardened warriors each type of character has a variety of ways of handling multiple opponents although some vary in efficiency aoe area of effect spells work or a sweeping blow from your battleaxe or just quick jabs from a knife to each opponent the choice is yours from my personal experience keep in mind this is what i like and not what is best statistically i have found that archery or a sword and shield is preferable to magic or twohanded weapons archery lets you pick off target from a distance giving them a lot of damage shields block a lot of damage and after attacks you can let out a killing blow of your own magic can summon minions of the dead ice fire etc as your own personal posse two handed weapons deal massive amounts of damage which makes up for their bulkiness armor usually is a preference of the player not bound to one fighting style or the other also fus roh dah as for races each race is specialized towards a certain type of fighter for example you typically wouldnt take a high elf as a warrior or a redguard as a magician but both are available to you if you so desire the races are listed below  nord primarily two  handed warriors  imperial primarily shield users  breton usually mages  argonian primarily thievesrestoration or alteration mages  wood elf primarily thievesarchers  high elf primarily mages  dark elf primarily mages  khajiit primarily thieves  orc primarily warriors  redguard primarily warriors classes warrior very strong very tough to kill they are usually slow but devastating to enemies use heavy armor mages cunning and powerful they cant take many hits but can conjure things up to take hits for them and can have a very diverse selection of spells to use at any time use light armor with spell enchants thieves sly and deadly use one handed weapons which are usually daggers they prefer to stay hidden and make their money off of stealing items from peoples homes or pockets wear light armor that is usually of a material like leather archers precise and meticulous stay back and engage fights first with well placed shots use one handed weapons and light armor for when they cant pick people off fast enough the moment youve all been waiting for mods the amount of mods that have been created for skyrim are astounding graphics can be improved glitches can be fixed items added people added places added actions added and much more the steam workshop has a great deal of mods that work on their own and some that just dont work at all these mods can be managed easily on the launch menu of the game some of these mods require other mods that help run them these helping mods can come from the workshop or the skyrimnexus which is a huge modding community posting mods for skyrim users to enjoy hello to everyone who just wants to know about the damn game and not all this information also hello to the people who actually read my entire review in which case thanks anyway here goes the elder scrolls v skyrim is a fantastic game the diversity of all aspects of this game is unique and hard to find in other titles should you get it yes should you get the legendary edition hell yes but get it on sale because skyrim goes on sale frequently overall great game must get any questions about the diversity of the game please consult the novel above this paragraph ps all hail todd howard and jeremy soule

to be honest i actually pirated this game years ago i just bought it recently and im already 60 hours in the main plot can be finished within two days which is a little frustrating how could a game this big be finished within hours the main reason this game stands so brightly is its side missions there are literally hundreds of them there are so many i cant stop finding them and theyre not cheap fast side quests it take at least two hours just to complete one of them its awesome to find so many quests but it can be annoying when theyre popping up everywhere there are times when you vist a city to finish a quest then be introducted to another quest your quest window will start building holding them all i kind of wish they would hold back and have certain quests be available when youve progressed ingame a certain amount i also wish npcs would be more alive after stealing something the owners will somehow know youve stolen it and set a bounty and merchants will not buy stolen items because they somehow know its stolen merchants do not lower prices if you come to their shops as a regular customer adopted children will not stop bothering you guards do not persue you when they obviously know youre a member of a bad guild i just wish the people would actually be living people perhaps the next elder scrolls and there are useless skills skills like smithing and for people like me the entire magicka section are never used maybe ill use a healing spell once or twice but thats it i can easily just use up my potions i collect which are everywhere instead of taking the time and wait for the restoration spell to work maybe ill start exploring alchemy once i exhaust the remaining slots on my main skills but until then theyre just an eye sore and a waste of time swifting by them and last complaint is that the world map does not correctly show how far things are once you set a destination that seems to be a very far distant it actually takes only a minute to run there overall 810 there are some annoying things such as useless skills robot npcs and silent arrows that alert nearby enemies but the quests really do balance my judgement scale you can tell the devs took their time to think about the game there are even books in this game books that you can sit and read if youre one of those people that only focus on the main story youre only going to have a very limited amount of fun but if you do like to explore then bottoms up the nord mead my favorite drinking buddy

when i bought the elder scrolls skyrim legendary on my 360 console and switched from console gaming to pc and i just had to play skyrim again the game never gets boring and once you try the game with mods its even more better than the vanilla game i thank the mod community for all the great mods skyrim is such a great game that youll never find yourself bored and there is always something to do skyrim is basically a 1010

this game is so good there is so much stuff you can do in this game it has good combat good quests good story good inventory and alot of levels and skill trees to go into its a little glicthy sometimes and the graphics arent the best but mods can fix that quite easily i give it 8510

play this game i mean it its massive compendium of lore in this game let alone that of the other elder scrolls games is large enough to keep you intrigued with the overarcing story alongside the side quests and dont even get me started on how huge the modding potential for this game is with which i would recommend a vanilla run completely first then a modded run and the massive and helpful modding community that comes with it tldr 1010 will play againand againetc

the elder scrolls v skyrim is by far one of my most treasured and favourite games released out there its vastopen world gives you an overabundance of freedom to do what you please skyrim provides a great element of choice as you have the freedom to be who you want to be and some of your choices may influence alternate paths to a story once foretold you can choose to be the hero or the villain you have been bestoed a gift from the gods in the dragons tounge dovakhiin you have the power of your voice and by destiny the dragonborn is the only mortal who can slay and rid the world from the awakining of the dragons as quoted  the empire of tamriel is on the edge the high king of skyrim has been murdered alliances form as claims to the throne are made in the midst of this conflict a far more dangerous ancient evil is awakened dragons long lost to the passages of the elder scrolls have returned to tamriel the future of skyrim even the empire itself hangs in the balance as they wait for the prophesized dragonborn to come a hero born with the power of the voice and the only one who can stand amongst the dragons  written by bethesda game studios ontop of all this awesome gameplay the game offers even more paths with the dragonborn hearthfire and dawnguard special quests however to further the games content the skyrim workshop offers thousands different unique quests alterations and ui script extenders and not to forget a lot of credit goes to the npcs and extensive textures  graphics overhauls enbs much immersive much wow personal meta score  95100

ive always been a fan of the elder scroll series and have to say skyrim holds its end fairly well with the nearly never ending quests and many hours of gameplay just in the plain game skyrim is possibly the greatest rpg of the 21st century the countless mods from the community riches the game even more with new armors characters quests and so on i was not a fan of the paid mods but with valve getting rid of them this game is back on track to being the best modded game on steam from playing morrowind back in the early 2000s on pc and oblivion in 2008 on the xbox 360 i only hope for the best for the rich story of tamriel and the elder scrolls series to live on for years to come

beautiful game incredibly playable something for everyone in skyrim

my somewhat short skyrim review right after the the paid mods scandal skyrim is back as it was before now trust me when i say that i have been playing and modding the  out of skyrim hell i have even been needed to reinstal the game 3 times now because of game file corruption only becasue of the awsome moddding community oh valve and bethesda are stuiped now that they added paid mods report1 stop it valve and bethesda game studios were just trying something out they saw that that the community had potential to earn money for their creations however we all know what happend and valve & bethesda apologized end of discussion not talking about the community the elder scrolls skyrim is an awsome rpg game with 3 awsomes dlcs and with a ton of user created content now skyrim is not perfect no game is however if i were to rate it i would give non modded skyrim 710 an awsome game modded skyrim 910 almost a must buy and as angryjoe says it comes with a badass seal of approval  thanks for reading this review good luck and have fun ps sorry if the english in the review is bad english is not my first language^^

killing a chicken will cause everyone to try and kill you do not hurt chickens but if you must do it stealthily
recommended
this is the best game ive ever played if you dont know about a game to buy this is the perfect choice and the right destination of your money and thanks to the mods you can play it forever you dont even have to worry about the story if you only center your attention in it your game will be a little short i guess  the beauty of this game is to explore the amazing lands of skyrim and the beautiful lore that has to offer the freedom that this game gives you its impossible to compare with any other its just unique i love it ps if you value your social life just dont buy it this game is a real lifedrainer
recommended
i love this game i wish it was a bit more like morrowind but it is still the best game ive played

do you want to play a game where you have the freedom to explore any place without level restriction to build a character however you want or to progress a quest whenever you like then skyrim is for you the open world of skyrim is massive the content that the game offers can easily be worth hundred hours even more if you get into the modding scene things like building your own home starting a family or reviving a fallen guild can make the world feel immersive the game does have some issues the combat can get dull after awhile if you play mage i suggest getting some spell mods the main questlines can be repetitive ive done one and kind of guess how the others turn out being a bethesda game skyrim has a lot of bugs and glitches however there are unofficial patches that you can download to fix them despite some issues skyrim is still a good game its worth buying at full price for the amount of content that it offers
recommended
best game for modding started modding when it was free for a day then bought it its an amzing game yoou can play for hours and the moddings great highly recommend if you do not have this game you are dead in side its the best game ever
recommended
oh skyrim skyrim how can i go 1 day without playing please tell me this game is the best game i have seen so far epic dragons loot quests and much more this game is literally perfect the game is easy to run although it looks amazing while youre playing the mods are incredible aswell the dlcs are amazing i love how you can actually choose what you want to do but still have like a back story to what youre doing vampires and werewolves dragons and spiders this is absolutely my dream game you can even choose which stats you want to upgrade and so choose your path warrior archer or mage this game is amazing in any way you can almost think of i totally recommend buying this game worth every dollar and i would even pay more to get it
recommended
no more paid mods thankfully anyway this game is fantastic i have put hundreds of hours into this game on the console version and when i finally got a good enough pc to run this it was one of the first games i bought modded it to hell and eventually broke it and had to do it all over again thank god i didnt have to pay for those mods
recommended
this game is amazing i love the story alot
recommended
cheese wheels crashed my game 1010
recommended
its ok
recommended
1010 used to play on the xbox all the time until i learned of the pc master race cant wait to mod the hell out of this
recommended
negative reviews based on the paid mods fiasco do nothing but make the game look worse now that its over well done for not taking them down everybody im going to have to try and make up for it add a donate button that is all this is one of the best games of the last generation i have over 600 hours on the onrelease xbox copy i own and now that i have it for the pc the lifespan is infinite mods are skyrims true potential realised i once ran over 200 mods at once on this now i have about 90 you have not experienced skyrim without making it a frankensteins perpetually crashingtodesktop monster of modded clusters with trains raining from the sky macho man randy savage dragons and shia surprise sneak attacks
recommended
if skyrim was a sandwich modded skyrim would have the lettuce and the mayo and all the other condiments unmodded is a sandwich with nothing but meat chees and bread
recommended
yes the paid mods are no more we have freed skyrim from evil corparation take over the community should make a special day for the retaliation of the paid mods of skyrim being removed still the best game ever
recommended
elder scrolls v skyrim brilliantly realized the motto of the series  be anyone do anything  skyrim  is a huge world in which thousands of sessions and tracks among which there is no excess  boring or unnecessary

i dont have many hours on this game and i am already in love with it the game itself is so incredible it is worthy of a single tear when you dive into the wonderful world of mods it becomes worthy of 10 single tears this game is so amazing i am literally struggling to type this review basically it is the best game of its kind this is one of the only games that i know where the graphics are fantastic and the actual gameplay is overwhelming with an entire spectrum of quests and missions to do this game is an absolute must have

this is a actionadventure game  an rpg and so much morrre its set in a high fantasy world filled with quests magic lore and much more theres so much to do in this game even without mods and the mods add lots more depth quests armor story boob and you name it into the game this game will give you an easy 1000 or more hours of fun  even more with mods  i recommend this game
recommended
skyrim is a brilliantly crafted rpg ive logged at leats 5000 hours over various saves and platforms and have completed nearly every quest if not every quest the aception of course being the quests that dont stop renewing themselves and i can honestly say that skyrim is my favourite out of tes 34 & 5 on the consoles it did become boring after completeing the quests and being left with the automatic renewing quests but thats why i now play on pc because you can add mods that can include anything from a differently coloured item all the way to imersive new lands via envyronment and character texture overhaulls the only disapointing thing for me stocknon modded game was the visual effects i expected more after tes 4  oblivion with its almost overly bright and contrasted scenery however in my opinion if you were to take the oblivion and skyrim visuals and merge them it would create near perfect rendering but only time will tell so bring on tes 6 thanks for thousands of hours enjoyment in tamriel
recommended
mod are now free again you can now appreciate skyrim even more its a little part of history in a war against dlc and this game his a victory sing the dragonborn song
recommended
one of the funnest games ive ever played after a while it can get old but the modding system is great when you play skyrim you play it like an adict for a week then you break for a month but it always come itching back to you
recommended
overly addiction for in retrospect a pretty stupid game i would recommend this game but at least half of the gametime is pointless grinding and the rest is modding i went over to a giants camp and i requested to be an astronought i applied and before i could read terms & conditions i was in space good veiw 1110 would not read terms again
recommended
one of the best games i own on pc hands down my favourite open world rpg this was also my first rpg when i built my first pc storyline  the storyline keeps you interested and does get better i never got bored of this game once and im sure you wont either side quests  decent side quests to keep you entertained if you want to stray from the main story sound  no problems at all but the characters dialogue can sometimes overlap any important dialogue not a big problem there are mods to relieve this issue but ive never looked into it i always keep my subtitles on graphics  i can run this game no problem see specs on my page i could also run this easily with my previous gtx 670 setup i suggest pouring in some enbs if your system has the horsepower itll look amazing gameplay  i love the levelling up system along with the crafting i go hunting for materials all the time to craft weapons and armour with good combat and fast switching between weaponsspells although i use a controller i cannot give my review with a keyboard because i dont use it steal buy or hunt for items sell them for dough or marry a character and get their dough lmao modding  best part of the game is the modding and its community there are thousands upon thousands of mods to choose from add new weapons materials armour jiggle physics 4k textures skin textures hair mods voice mods more races have your very own pet dragon more monsters building mods loverslab cough etc if youre not modding in this game youre doing it wrong its very easy to mod simply go to the nexus modding site download the nexus mod manager and a few other things like skyrim script extender youll know what im talking about if you decide to go on the modding route cons  i havent played the previous elder scrolls games so comparisons are moot i wish there was more world to explore but thats where mods can save the day thats all i can think of for now but if it can get a former rpg hater like me to love rpgs and pc gaming in general then maybe its worth your dough
recommended
step 1play it step 2get bored step 3mod it step 4repeat previous steps pretty much nothing more to say here
recommended
my handsdown favorite game of all time a must play for everyone 1210
recommended
in my opinion one of the best survival games there is
recommended
only one thing i can say about this game mod it till it breaks
recommended
sir frankenberry esquire visits the city of solitude for the first time its a business trip but theres much to see in this relative metropolis the matter of business is attending a wedding reception but that will go on all night let her live a bit longer sir frankenberry esquire has time to be distracted he comes across a clothing store something else the warrior has never encountered nonprotective outer chest coverings how unusual how impractical the shops owner taarie is as intrigued by the sight of an orcish customer as sir frankenberry esquire is by the mere existence of the shop the owners curiosity bubbles over she energetically requests that sir frankenberry esquire model one of her signature garments for solitudes mayor the unspoken but understood reason being that if her clothes can make this monster look appealing sir frankenberry esquire sees several steps beyond this thinly veiled insult and into the payoff he would be honored taarie passes a formal hiplength tunic to sir frankenberry esquire and wishes him a good evening once out of sight of the shop sir frankenberry esquire forces the shirt on over the top of his full plate armor it stretches but in credit to its craftsmanship does not burst refusing to smile sir frankenberry esquire heads off towards the reception solitudes mayor has already arrived of course she has predictably positioned herself adjacent to the bride where the evenings attention will be perpetually centered a fully armed and armored 7 foot high orc approaches his face is hidden by an enclosed helmet the warhammer strapped to his back runs nearly the full length of his massive frame a strained and battered wrap of cotton fabric clings about his chest the mayor maintains composure do you like my shirt im sorry hello your shirt yes do you like it oh my its positively astounding i do taarie made it for me she owns a clothing store in town taarie did thats great i should visit her later on she made it for me to wear for you tonight the mayor was on the brink of betraying an emotion of discomfort but before an eyebrow could be raised sir frankenberry esquires warhammer was lifted overhead then brought down through the body of the nearby bride the weapons weight was more than that of the target the swiftness of the action combined with the unrecognizable result meant that several seconds passed before anyone knew exactly what had occurred anyone except the orc of course who was already sprinting towards the city gates taarie made it for me she made it for me to wear for you tonight sir frankenberry esquire permitted himself a smile

edit bethesda decided to remove payed mods so id actually recommend it now keeping the old review down there however just so you know their shady past  this game was great until valve and bethesda decided to introduce paid mods the whole reason skyrim is so popular on pc is because of the easy access to mods and them being free which is what made the game so great unfortunately bethesda has decided to remove the free and accessible features of modding and replace it with paid mods just so they can make a couple pennies whats even more disgusting is that they think they can take a whole 75% of all sales as there own thats right modders only get 25% of the profit that is made from their work overall this game is fine if you want to play vanilla but if you want to mod your game and delve into the world of skyrim modding youre unfortunately a bit late i wont be buying products from bethesda until they decide to fix all of this and i hope you do the same
recommended
this game is truly remarkable there is so much to do and see and fight and eat and ride and learn and wear and read and discover there is so much to do for everyone
recommended
a phenomenal game so deep and rich meaning an immersive and longlived experience a game i will keep coming back to
recommended
this game is better than north korea
recommended
there are very few bad things to say about this game i cant even think of any right now one of the best games i have ever played dont be fooled by my hours in the game i have just recently bought the game  absolute recommendation for everyone even if its not on sale worth every penny
recommended
even if you dont play rpgs this game will be worth it to at least try out it has a lot of content is very addicting and will also be worth the price you dont even need to play the quests only exploring the world is still something you can have fun with the main quest can easily be completed in about 20 hours but i have over 100 because there are numerous other side and miscellaneous ones and if all the dragon slaying shouting pickpocketing sneaking time travelling bandit killing gold hoarding and number of deer you can shoot in the butt wasnt enough you can still install mods hundreds of course you should be aware that this may cause unwanted crashing so make sure you can handle them all from graphic mods to dlc sized quests theres sure something you will pick my only problem with the game is the ing mountains 910
recommended
one of the best singleplayer open world rpgs i ve ever played
recommended
to be honest if youre reading skyrim reviews its not because youre on the fence about actually buying the game so i dont feel the need to write some form of lengthy review of the most well known rpg of the past decade edit apparently valve removed monetization of modsfor now i am keeping my editorial rant up but changing my recommendation because frankly skyrim really is just a damn fine game the language of the pr release however suggests that they are going to come out something else so becoming complacent in victory would be an extremely bad idea for a sense of context i want to point out i am all for mod makers being compensated for their work through donations i have no problem donating money to mod makers if they provide me with a worthwhile addition to my game and give this addition free of upfront charge i understand the amount of work some of these people put into their mods and i wholeheartedly think they deserve something for their passion and work turning mods into dlc is however insulting to not only me as a gamer but the mod maker as they become an exploited worker this doesnt have to be the case they can all make money and make people happy at the same time if they werent so fcking greedy to start with if steam radically changes the system to be only donations only donations taking less then 20% for themselves and bethesda then all involved would make far more money total and come out of this looking flawless from a pr point of view as an example i have bought premium currency or what have you from good free to play games i have enjoyed as you can see in my profile i have played a lot of warframe and have donated a lot of money to the company by now its probably a few hundred of dollars over the years which yes is a lot of money to most people because they are offering me an ever improving game completely free and i think they deserve something if warframe had demanded a subscription or money up front they would of made nothing off me as i never would of played it to begin with there are a lot of gamers like me gamers that have funded plenty of free to play games like dwarf fortress have given money to the humble bundles far exceeding the minimal amount and funded plenty of games on kickstarter due to nothing more then altruism and a belief in a fellow gamers passion to improve the industry a modding paywall however feels as though valve bethesda and even a few modders themselves are  on the very notion of what makes pc gaming great it is insulting to me as a gamer it is insulting to us all as a culture and it is something that should not be tolerated with the way the system exists now or rather how it existed before the rollback i will not be buying games through steam unless i have no choice and i will never pay for a mod ever i am more then happy to send a donation to a few modders who do exceptional work interesting npcs comes to mind but any modder who hides their content behind a paywall will lose my respect and any chance of ever getting money off me id also like to point out that monetizing and releasing total conversions which create an entirely new game using an existing engine such as garys mod and dayz are not the same thing as paying for skyrim mods i cant fathom why certain people involved in this side of modding the need to voice their opinion when they clearly have no idea what theyre talking about
recommended
it was pretty good ngl
recommended
this is the really legendary game you must play it
recommended
this is by all accounts an amazing game even though its story does not match up to what its predecessor oblivion had it is still very good the limit on what you can do in the game is virtually nonexistent also there are hundreds of side quests you can do some of them you can repeat the 3 dlcs that have been released for the game hearthfire dawnguard and dragonborn also add a lot more in hearthfire you can build your own home from scratch in dawnguard you choose a side and it has a lot of cool stuff in dragonborn it adds a whole new world even if you dont want to do something in the game you are not forced to unless you count the opening quest this game is worth the price
recommended
if you like a long main quest of killing magic voices dragons slashing killing and even more killing get this game if you want this get it during a sale its really expensive but get this game
recommended
like fallout w guns without guns
recommended
this games like midevil gtabut you cant lose to copsgurads you have to kill and slauter every one

skyrim is a good rpg but not a great one i have been an avid fan of the elder scrolls series since morrowind back when i was a wee lad playing that lovely dirtcolored game on my brothers original xbox back in 20032005 anyways i was expecting this game to be a more refined version of oblivion which has a special place in this cubans heart but skyrim was different it felt targeted for a broader audience not one the typical bethsesda rpg fan like me and many others forgive the word but skyrim is the epitome of a casual rpg if my brother the same brother who bought morrowind for me and my other brother back in 2003 but hated it can sink hours into this game like it was call of duty then it definitely is a casual rpg does that make it bad god no skyrim is an extremely pretty game that i would love to indulge myself in if i had more time to i just feel like if anyone can pick swing a sword and kill  in an rpg it is casual try doing that in oblivion against some tougher creatures and your  will become mudcrab food along the shores of that bloom covered and colorful land
recommended
there are games like dragon age which do a great job of making you feel as if you are in the world but they fall short of totally getting you in the world but skyrim is something else  you can cook  hunt  explore or just kill bandits all day you have the totall freedom to do what ever you want really if you want to be a sneaky assassin who can summon daedric gods to fight along side you thats all cool with skyrim its this total freedom that sucks me in comeplety and why it is one of the best games to come out and this is coming from a person who was not a fan of oblivion if you are looking for game that take hours of your life away than this is the game for you my friend there are of cousre some bad things about the game but they are far overlooked by the fantasticly great things about i give this game a 9510 on pc  and on xbox an 810 have fun
recommended
skyrim was the first elder scrolls game that i bought and i must say that it did not disappoint the amount of depth to the quests and the world in general is unreal even after playing through the storyline once or twenty times it feels like a new experience when you start a new game i highly recommend it to just about everyone my only complaint is that the dungeons sometimes start to feel repititive but it still makes up for it by adding unique storylines to each in summary this game gets a 1110
recommended
almost as good as oblivion can be hard later on but there are tons of things to do and discover  if its on a sale get it asap
recommended
one of the most immersive games i have evrt played if you want to have fun with mods without any problems get this game becasue they are easily compatable with workshop
recommended
of all free world games skyrim may be one of my favorites it has outstanding graphics even on low quality i could make every detail out it also has an extremely big map for exploring and tons of creatures to fight one of my favorite things about it is the super bad  ninja stealth and stealth kills i could go on all day about reasons you should buy the elder scrolls v skyrim but im not going to hold the truth every game has downsides to it skyrim has a lot over a thousand of bugs and sometimes they can keep you from completing main quests and you rage meter may even fill up and heavy attack you computer but there are ways to fix the bugs there are plenty of solutions online to help so if your trying to have some fun slaying dragons and giants an getting chased by thugs because someone put a hit on the elder scrolls v skyrim is your game
recommended
this game is awesome but you will need to mod the hell out of it
recommended
things i like about skyrim keep in mind that these are my opinions your opinions might differ no torm pls  gameplay  the voice acting  the nature and enviroment  level system and perks  the huge modding community and the huge list of mods  how you can play basically any role archer berzerker all different types of magic roles  every character you create can do and learn everything in the game  many awesome quests  vampirism and werewolfism  all guilds and holds  how you can marry people of any gender  followers  the great ammount of character customization tools and options  all different shouts things i dont like about skyrim  all  glitches for example the buckets  only you can kill your follower which is really easy to do if you missclick  you can only marry once  the hairstyles are horrible  no firstperson while riding horses  i used to be an adventurer like you then i took an arrow in the knee  the combat system 910
recommended
this game is nothing but incredible and everyone already knows it its just a shame that the official dlc was very very lazy thank god the mods make up for it
recommended
best game ever i spent so much time on it and if you like skyrim try fallout new vegas
recommended
ever wanted to be a mage warrior thief or just a mix of them all well with skyrim you can skyrim is a typical bethesda game where you get to create your own character using the games many customization features youll then be able to play the game however you want in an almost limit less world filled with skeletons zombies wizards and other kinds of monsters once youve completed the main game youll be able to add more quests followers houses overhauls pets textures weapons armor and so much more via some of the many mods that the community creates skyrim is an amazing singleplayer rpg with endless possiblitys because of the amout of mods created by the awesome community
recommended
its like skyrim but with more skyrim dragon10 would shout agian

this is quite possibly my favourite game ever made
recommended
still the best game  fus ro dah10
recommended
this game never ends in most games that wouldnt be a very complimentary feature but in this game the gameplay is phenomenal the graphics are great the level system is smooth and you can do almost whatever you want it has hours upon hours of playability with the main story line the dlc story lines the playermade dlcs on the workshop and then on top of that every playthrough can be different because of the vast collection of player made mods plus it was only $750 during the christmas sale i would recommend this game to anyone
recommended
loved this game back when it first came out played it on a xbox the game never gets boring for me as you can play with an infinite number of types of class with the make your own class in effect system and you can install mods to make the new experience even better 1010
recommended
best game ever the graphics are not the best but you can tweak it later on with add ons i adore the story line it is very interesting i enjoy every second playing this game
recommended
huge sandbox game with awesome storyline and lots of side quests and small puzzles to do epic adventure awaits you in this game
recommended
saw an offensive pornography modification on the skyrim nexus and i had to analyse it on its level of sexiness i was required to enter the angle of penetration and divide it by the cosine of x i then weighed the apparatus used appropriately so that the shlongs used were more than apt for deep penetration i then 3d printed a model of this modification and use it to compensate for my extreme height and lack of pornography which i reject to watch  pigfilth the lot of it to conclude do not buy this game it is a pornographic game with a sick twisted community that will only purchase it for the bouncing breasts and buttocks highly recommend henry mellor 2015
recommended
amazing game worth the price and it gets even better withe the dlcs but the main quest is too short but it doesnt matter because u get hours of gameplay with side quests

undeniably excellent with mods without mods however its a 75

one of the greatest games in the history of mankind nasa landing a rover on mars some 200 million kilometers away is an accomplishment that pales in comparison to this game it is art it is beyond art it transcends the human imagination it belongs in a museum they should have put a copy of skyrim on voyager instead of that fruity gold disc sagan designed play this game

comparing this skyrim to new incoming openworld games is like comparing to far cry 3 to the fourth one far cry 4 might have better graphics and better controls far cry 3 still makes me feel better
recommended
pro big open world great graphics character customization creationleveling beautiful questlines soundtrack  inspirational  earcandy many mods on steam workshop and nexus alot of console commands pc via the ingame console pc only endless replayability due to character customization and mods con basic combat animations especially hitting someonething with melee is a bit of a let down voice acting is weird on moments for example you see a 70 yo woman but hear a 20 yo lady glitches though those are just minor and somethimes funny things verdict one of the best and probably the best rpg ive ever played the huge game plus its dlc and many mods though now a bit less accessible with the paid mods system keeps you going for hundreds of hours even if you only create 1 character i give it a 9510  what to buy i recommend buying the legendary edition wich includes the game plus all dlc dawnguard hearthfire dragonborn though the base game is huge and with all the mods you probably dont see a reason to get the dlc the quality of the content is really worth it
recommended
i find it hard to imagine it when a person tells me they havent played skyrim i find it even harder to imagine someone who played skyrim and didnt like it
recommended
to me this game is timeless there is a reason people play it over and over and over between the lore the immense number of side quests and the different choices that affect your gameplay this game is a new life a new experience every time very immersive and always fun
recommended
an epic rpg with a good story the choice to play as thieves and assassins is always a great character option that keeps that tired hero theme in check i found the dragons got boring after a while but the massive world to explore and good story twists make this a great game
recommended
what a sequel ey skyrim continues to add to the expanding elder scrolls timeline in a much more stylish way skyrim offers much more manageable controls compared to its predecessor oblivion as well as this it is so much more pretty the story is riveting enough to pull you through the countless fetch quests and other tedious tasks although the pace can fall at some stages during the story  through these it is simply a fact of powering through these sections until the story picks up again personally i wouldnt buy this game unless it was on sale but if you are a elder scrolls fan or an avid rpg player this game may just be worth the rrp

flat out one of the best games i have ever played endless customisation deep lore a huge breathing world to explore stunning visuals epic storylines and choices galore this game can be played anyway that you wish you can blast through every storyline creating a death dealing beast of a character be it mage archer elf orc or lizard or you can roleplay the day in the life of a poor fisherman or farmer or a hunter or soldierthe opportunities are endless you can literally do whatever you want in this world with a choice of ten playable races more with mods and a complex and detailed characeter creation screen you are free to birth any denizen that you desire and hello old school rpgers no classes thats right build whatever playstyle you so wish from a duel weilding ice mage to a pickaxe hefting orcish maid choose your own story and make choices that will be reacted to and remembered mostly and mods this game has a colossal modding communtiy from the steam workshop to the skyrim nexus you can completley change the way you play the game or the way the game looks and more seriously this game can look nextnextnext gen  honestly i cant recommend this game enough play this if you are looking for immersion quality roleplaying story lorei could go on for days but i appear to have taken an arrow to the overusedinternetmeme

for just a moment imagine yourself dressed in armor and fur your muscular frame toughened against the cold blowing wind and snow that swirls about you now let the camera in your minds eye pull back a bit to show the heavy forest youre trodding through with sword and shield in hand your senses kept ever sharp against stalking predators pull back even more and discover that your frozen woodland is on the slope of a mountain one of many in a range surrounding a sprawling city pull back one last time to a satellite view the city you see is joined by two three then dozens more spread out over a vast landmass crisscrossed by a seemingly infinite number of rivers lakes and mountains you are in skyrim

the thing about skyrim that always brings me back is because it never fails to surprise me whether it be a dungeon ive never explored or a playstyle ive never tried skyrim is so addictingly fun and extravagantly beautiful it never ceases to amaze me the modding community makes it all the better allowing you to expand the game to what it always felt like it wanted to be but bethesda couldnt manage to achieve skyrim will always be my favorite game of all time
recommended
this game is fun to play as a waiting for something to download and it has a nice storyline and great voice actors so i rate this game 810

one of my favorite games of all time skyrim is a wonderfully crafted rpg and edition in bethesdas elder scrolls series it has a very interesting storyline and has many different armor sets to defend you and weapons and spells to slay the vast array of enemies thrown before you even though some of the side quests arent as interesting as the ones in the previous game oblivion there is still many fun and entertaining quests to take part in the world is also very expansive and rewarding to explore once you pick it up you wont be putting it down for months 910

the elder scrolls v skyrim is the only quality variant of a lord of the rings video game that it isnt trying to be nor actually is one its a bit of a medieval simulator with its own cannon and lore with several plot lines taking up the majority of your time alongside the numerous expansion content and side quest lines that allow you to truly become your own character whether that be a modern robin hood or the next incarnation of merlin some of these quest lines arent the longest and some of them are quite repetitive but many of them allow you to become something of yourself high and mighty and powerful even though not that much significance is made of it in comparison to the fact youre the next dragonborn and the loot throughout the majority of these lines only getting you by with my only complaint there really being the fact that i did not have the freedom to choose where to place what quest line and where and eventually not even finishing the dragonborn dlc quest line due to boredom mechanics are plentiful in skyrim stats management is simple and only consists of health stamina and magicka which includes powers and dragon shouts too and an ability to upgrade a whole host of skills through the indepth specialised tree for them if you prefer something other than magic like me you can go and be an archer with different types of arrows and bows to fire them with upgrading and enchanting throughout or you can wave a sword around like an unbreakable stick fast travel is also a thing which kind of removes some of the immersion from the game but nonetheless getting you throughout the vast world you can trade and sell your old items as you upgrade enchant and move on through variant merchants using the same simplistic menu system that gets you lost the more items you carry using commands through the console is also a big help and on computer its rather a present from the heavens due to many of the impractical bugs causing you large annoyance are either fixable or well avoidable  but if you use the commands to cheat it really ruins the experience i got bored of the game once i did this it became less of a challenge to achieve something gain something or complete something concluding this game was a real blast for the hundred or more hours i poured into it and it really allows you to get immersed and continue playing just one more dungeon yada yada you really must avoid cheating though  curiosity will ruin it for you

really fun game the only thing that made me quit for a couple of months now was a gamebreaking bug i accepted the jagged crown quest but never gave the crown to ulfric so then at the time of the peace treaty meeting at hrothgar noone took their seats when i sat down in my assigned seat so the game pretty much didnt work beyond that point so i gave up after that but i am going to make a new character relatively soon and probably not a dual wield warrior anymore d
recommended
prize of the dlcs is just halarious  f that the game itself does not live up to the quality of oblivion or morowind but has its moments even then guild quests are not that great this time but the seting and atmosphere are just great realy enjoyed this sad they did not put work into the story and quests

ive noticed that the reviews for morrowind oblivion and skyrim tend to be about why that game is the best elder scrolls game and the others are terrible in comparison i really enjoy all three of them sorry arena and daggerfall youre just not very enjoyable by todays standards so i figured ill give reviews for each that focus on whats unique about each of them and what kind of players that will appeal to skyrim is the most mainstream of the three its a big grand production meant for a big grand reception in other words this was the first tes game specifically designed to be in the headlines a ton think of it as the difference between a film with a 30 million dollar production budget and one with a 300 million production budget meant to be one of the grandest films of the decade morrowind and oblivion are the former skyrim is the latter its easily the most professional of the three as such the game is meant to be most appealing to a wide range of players morrowind is pure chaos oblivion is pure order and skyrim is somewhere between those two extremes its safe when it wants to be and wild when it wants to be it has some of the rugged freedom of morrowind while being polished like oblivion and therefore avoiding any of the major negatives that morrowind also has for the positives of the game lets go ahead and start with the graphics and scenery morrowind had rugged scenery but the graphics werent good enough to really be stunned by it oblivion had soft graphics and scenery which left you feeling perfectly content but not awed skyrim has both the graphics and scenery to take your breath away its rugged majestic powerful and all sorts of other things its easily the most immersive of any of the three games no matter how many thousands of hours youve spent playing it there will always be views that strike awe in you whenever a game can get you to willingly just stop and stand there and take in everything its succeeded skyrim does that all the time the skill and perk systems are also the best of any tes game it allows you to really forge your own path and adapt your character however you want as the game progresses morrowind and oblivion basically make you decide at the beginning exactly what type of character you want and keeps you confined to that choice skyrim is much more fluid and each playthrough is much more customizable which also allows you to add much more depth to the story you come up with for your character want to be a high elf who is disgusted by the actions of the aldmeri dominion and decides to shun magic and adopt the rugged combat and lifestyle of the local nords want to be an orc who feels no connection to the brute stregth emphasized in your culture and instead explore the arcane and master the ways of the mage want to be a redguard who shuns the sword and shield and instead masters the bow and slips silently through the shadows well in skyrim you can be any of those things and pretty much anything else you could possibly imagine another big positive is the crafting systems found in the game the smithing skill replaces the armorer skill and is a gigantic improvement you dont have to worry about maintaining your armor and weapons but instead you will be able to smith powerful weapons and armor the more time you devote to it if you want to have daedric weapons before you even hit level 20 you can but remember that it means you spent so much time smithing that your combat skills might not be up to par the same goes for brewing powerful potions or creating powerful enchantments its determined less by getting lucky and finding good stuff and more by deciding what to pursue for the negatives we have to go back to the earlier analogy about the hollywood films the 300 million dollar budget film has a ton of things that you could possibly want but it also cant take the risks or be as quirky as the 30 million dollar budget film so everything in skyrim is polished and streamlined and sometimes you find yourself wishing that it would be less powerful and more quirky or nuanced the magic is a good example there are fewer schools of magic and fewer varieties of spells no levitation no damage weapon or damage armor spells no school of mysticism etc destruction spells basically come in three varieties frost fire and shock there is a good variety of types of those spells cloak rune constant cast etc but sometimes you want to be able to hit someone with something other than frost fire or shock damage as a mage and in skyrim you cant the dlcs do add some good variety restoration school spells that do direct damge to undead or do posion damage conjuration spells that allow you to bring forth powerful creatures made of ash etc but its still less options than oblivion or morrowind gave you and thats really what a lot of the negatives of this game boil down to things you loved about oblivion and morrowind that werent included in skyrim it has so many improvements over those two but it also gets rid of some of the things people loved about them the soundtrack for example is a powerful soundtrack but it feels like its always in adrenalinepumping mode whereas morrowind and oblivion had music that would really draw you in emotionally its not that skyrims soundtrack is bad its just that morrowinds and oblivions were better overall overall this is the crown jewel of the tes series so far but that doesnt mean it was perfect youll love it and yet you will still sometimes prefer to play oblivion or morrowind instead

with the exception of the other elder scrolls games and a few games from bioware i feel that skyrim is the definitive singleplayer rpg experience gaming has to offer this far what is most remarkable about skyrim and other elder scrolls games is that it is completely unliniar you never have to complete the main quest and will most likely never finish all the side content either you are free to do as you wish and bethesda has created an enjoyable and believable world for you do enjoy yourself in completely

skyrim is a good rpg but not a great one i have been an avid fan of the elder scrolls series since morrowind back when i was a wee lad playing that lovely dirtcolored game on my brothers original xbox back in 20032005 anyways i was expecting this game to be a more refined version of oblivion which has a special place in this cubans heart but skyrim was different it felt targeted for a broader audience not one the typical bethsesda rpg fan like me and many others forgive the word but skyrim is the epitome of a casual rpg if my brother the same brother who bought morrowind for me and my other brother back in 2003 but hated it can sink hours into this game like it was call of duty then it definitely is a casual rpg does that make it bad god no skyrim is an extremely pretty game that i would love to indulge myself in if i had more time to i just feel like if anyone can pick swing a sword and kill  in an rpg it is casual try doing that in oblivion against some tougher creatures and your  will become mudcrab food along the shores of that bloom covered and colorful land

there are games like dragon age which do a great job of making you feel as if you are in the world but they fall short of totally getting you in the world but skyrim is something else  you can cook  hunt  explore or just kill bandits all day you have the totall freedom to do what ever you want really if you want to be a sneaky assassin who can summon daedric gods to fight along side you thats all cool with skyrim its this total freedom that sucks me in comeplety and why it is one of the best games to come out and this is coming from a person who was not a fan of oblivion if you are looking for game that take hours of your life away than this is the game for you my friend there are of cousre some bad things about the game but they are far overlooked by the fantasticly great things about i give this game a 9510 on pc  and on xbox an 810 have fun

this is by all accounts an amazing game even though its story does not match up to what its predecessor oblivion had it is still very good the limit on what you can do in the game is virtually nonexistent also there are hundreds of side quests you can do some of them you can repeat the 3 dlcs that have been released for the game hearthfire dawnguard and dragonborn also add a lot more in hearthfire you can build your own home from scratch in dawnguard you choose a side and it has a lot of cool stuff in dragonborn it adds a whole new world even if you dont want to do something in the game you are not forced to unless you count the opening quest this game is worth the price

the elder scrolls v mod it until it crashes this is skyrim you already know what this is  a less glitchy oblivion with better graphics and a norse themeboy that armor is dopey its also useless and you may never actually wear it main thoughts  as far as rpgs go its ace open world lots to explore nearly infinite side quests  obviously newer than oblivion with correspondingly better graphics but the overall feel of the game was more immersive great attention was put into the environment voice acting etc  main quest is absolute  and i dont think even bethesda is willing to refute that this is why an open world with a hundred minor quests is a saving grace without an almost minecraftesque set your own personal objective freedom it wouldnt be much unfortunately the big picture is a bit more sour the game has no trees or vegetation of any kind in fact it has no color whatsoever the game is practically in black and white in general more attention to detail and improvement in the items and interface is needed frankly this nearly ruins a game that otherwise had a great deal of potential for this reason i do not recommend skyrim on the xbox however we are blessed to have the steam workshop for skyrim on the pc thanks to a furry of highly competent modders the game is playable again and the only reason i recommend this game here i therefore recommend the following mods for your convenience listed in no other order than how i have written them down just now im not responsible for your load order better embers staves of skyrim towns and villages enhanced markath towns and villages enhanced whiterun towns and villages enhanced riften towns and villages enhanced whiterun exterior towns and villages enhanced falkreath towns and villages enhanced morthal towns and villages enhanced dawnstar towns and villages enhanced inns towns and villages enhanced markarth exterior towns and villages enhanced villages redux towns and villages enhanced solitude towns and villages enhanced riverwood towns and villages enhanced winterhold midas magic evolved shadow striping fix indooroutdoor immersive fallen trees v14 horse armors whistle shooting stars beast skeletons hd plants  herbs realistic water two reduced distance npc greetings sounds of skyrim  civilization sounds of skyrim  the wilds sounds of skyrim  dungeons immersive saturation boost complete skyforge truly balanced destruction magic rainbows also grab some hairstyle and other mods from nexus

an amazing medieval adventurerpg i have never played an elder scrolls game before this one but i had played fallout so i made assumptions they were similar to an extent they are but there are some major differences other than the technology difference i loved fallout and i love this game too it involves adventure over a massive world exploring towns killing dragons stealling from people assassinating people  its got everything the game is similar to fallout in the way they are both published by bethesda and are both rpgs skyrim is pretty much your typical rpg with one extremely important difference imo the level system enemies dont have levels nor do quests so you dont have to grind for 8 hours trying to reach level 16 so you can do this quest which gives you a reward that is for level 14s and useless to you skyrim and fallout both have a system in which levels give you better perks but dont matter in terms of progression which imo is what makes these games the best rpgs i could go on for ages but if youre too lazy to read that at least read this tldr  good game great rpgadventure you can kill a dragon 910

going through my game list i just saw that i have over 400 hours on this game i dont understand how this is possible i havent even finished the main quest yet barley began the quest line of the first expansion and not even finished the starter quest of the second expansion i have yet to fully explore skyrim of the 8 holds skyrim districts i only explored 5 of them i dont know how many more hours it will take me until i finished the main quest and the two expansions how many more to see everything but thank i godi took breaks playing this game because if you play straight from start to finish having maybe over 1000 hours of play behind you you will be fluid in the ancient dragon tongue recite the theme song from your memory and likely need a guidance consular to help you take your first steps back in the real world so immersive is this game experience in the years to come it wont be possible to take people serious that havent played this game

best game i ever bought in this game youll be sent back to the times where people fought with swords and bows a brilliant setting if you ask me the game lets you do whatever you want you can customize your character to your own style own personal favorite race and youll be able to fight any style you want do you want to play the sneaky elf archer with the bow no problem do you want to play the sneaky kahjiit thief with the daggers no problem do you dislike weapons and love to use magic no problem theres even lots of different spells either destruction or illusion maybe necromancy is more your style being a healer is no problem either you can make your own weapons by smithing you can make your own potions by gathering ingredients and mixing them into a potion with alchemy you can upgrade your weapons by using enchanting theres so much to do want to settle down after some adventures get to a town and drink mead at the inn or purchase a house or a piece of land to build a house with selffound materials or maybe bought materials whatever you want there are so many different playtroughs so much quests to play heck ive played this over 275 hours and i still havent completed all the quests i completely recommend this game i bought it at the releasedate 111111 and im still not done with it did i mention the steam workshop millions of mods to download without any fee enjoy

i really love this game pros the world and story are rich many many hours of gameplay time immersive nice exploration with hundreds of locations to discover great skill tree decent character customization but kinda lacking in hair difficult choices and decisions cons kinda linear on armor progression lack voice acting variety a bit repetitive combat on melee fighter bugs and sometimes sudden crash the best thing is most of the cons can be fixed by modsso you can really make this game almost perfect 8510 but with mods i give it a 9510

for just a moment imagine yourself dressed in armor and fur your muscular frame toughened against the cold blowing wind and snow that swirls about you now let the camera in your minds eye pull back a bit to show the heavy forest youre trodding through with sword and shield in hand your senses kept ever sharp against stalking predators pull back even more and discover that your frozen woodland is on the slope of a mountain one of many in a range surrounding a sprawling city pull back one last time to a satellite view the city you see is joined by two three then dozens more spread out over a vast landmass crisscrossed by a seemingly infinite number of rivers lakes and mountains you are in skyrim

recommended
this game is horrible mods make it better for a price they also make it crash a lot
recommended
you will have to spend dozens of hours to fully explore skyrim like any other bethesda game it has its share of imperfections and broken promises but its exciting and fascinating nevertheless wait for a couple of patches to come out download the best mods tighten the screws in the skyrimprefsini file and youre good to go for a virtual christmas vacation

ive been killing a dragons for almost 600 hours it was fg amazing 1010
recommended
ive never been into rpgs but this game turned that around the expansive world of this game just seems to keep on going and with all of the mods out there you cant finish it its almost impossible to 100% this game and there are so many classes you can become and you can change your class down the line not like most games that gives you the options to become the base classes as mage warrior archer or thief the replay value in this game is absolutely amazing go pick up this game its worth it

love this game 910

well what can i say  i love the elder scrolls series and i love skyrim as one of the series i love oblivion and morrowind the elder scrolls series portrays a very realistic view on the fantasy world many years ago it does this by stunning graphics  you do not need an amazing graphics card to run this game people will recommend the gtx 670 but i have a 7770 and the game looks stunning on ultra and you can also download the hd texture mods this will show a much better graphical content but with the hd texture mod somethings have not been worked on as much as somethings else ie the rocks in caves compared to the sky i believe this is because the sky is viewed more than the rocks inside of caves good physics  i know this game has good physics i can tell because i have played all the other elder scrolls and on morrowind the physics were as good as they can be in 2001 oblivion again the physics were as good as they can be in 2009 and possibly we could think the same about skyrim in a few years time nevertheless the physics are very good and this contributes to the brilliant graphics that this game provides the story  although this game can be played after the first 5 quests i believe very different you can choose to do quests or you can explore and hunt and explore caves then once you have explored the places that the map will let you you can then do quests in different parts of skyrim ie dawnstar markarth morthalriftensolitudewhiterunwindhelmwinterhold and falkreath but withing these constituencies there are towns that the quests are allocated the whole game  with all of the brilliant physics and the stunning graphics even without the hd texture mod this game you can play for hours on end and just forget about the real world and create and play your own fantasy and take risks and use logic overall  the game is brilliant as i have explained above the graphics and the physics make the game much more enjoyable just like any other game  1010

skyrim is simply the most amazing world editor game you can play its exactly what a hard core game wants the game isnt about fantasy or slaying dragons at all forget that  its about spending hundreds of hours configuring and reconfiguring ini files and debugging why boobs dont bounce right or why physix mods cause horses to fly during the opening credits i wanted to create the most beautiful perfect real world experience before starting out my quest 155 hours in and 100 mods deep i created my perfect experience then i got all the expansions and broke the mods and look forward to going thru it all again im serious when i say i get more satisfaction tweaking a game then actually playing it skyrim is aging like a fine wine

ah yes the wonderful world of skyrim i know i am very late to the party but oh boy what an amazing afterparty this is the entire game comes near perfection the game has so much to offer and i have yet to play it much blame it on my school exams and if my grades are bad blame it on skyrim but i am more then thrilled to get lost in this amazing masterpiece the graphics are amazing for its time but thats not the essential part graphics never should be its the story its the gameplay its the feeling you get when playing it and missing it when you have to quit i am a noob to the rpg genre but ive been playing a good few of em and i must say skyrim tops them all the community adds so many amazing features to the game the community is so clean and friendly something you rarely see these days now lets get to the pros and cons and my ratings pros amazing storyline giant world with the dlcs to enlarge it even more great modding community so active gorgeous views and landscapes decent to good graphics especially with some mods a ton of great and amusing sidequests cons combat system a bit rusty easily fixed with mods some minor bugs but such a large game cant be expected to be clean i wish that i could think of more but i just simply cannot ratings story 9510 quests 910 world 1010 graphics 810 sounds 8510 creativity 9510 community 1010 this is my first real review and my main language isnt english so please bare with me d

the sense of freedom in skyrim is dizzying the vast mountains in every direction make the landscape seem limitless and even after exploring it for days this world feels huge and unknown on a scale neither of the previous two games did if you have not been fortunate enough to have experienced a title of this caliber than i feel sorry for you it has truly left its mark amongst the greatest of games iv ever played along with its blockbuster predecessors the content bethesda delivered with this game is remarkable but the potential is limitless with steam workshop if you want to truly experience a aaa masterpiece get this now 98100
