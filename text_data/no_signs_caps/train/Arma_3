oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter as it is so so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning the gameplay is excellent the mechanics are solid and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series as i was may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fpsshooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief brutal and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no minimaps no enemy ui iconsindicators no hit markers no health bars if you get shot a couple of times you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness cover teamwork suppressive fire and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles armor helicopters and planes each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts each containing 1215 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding and challenging i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete however the singleplayer campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer oh god the multiplayer wasteland king of the hill invade and annex battle royale breaking point so many coop opportunities the amazing looking upcoming epoch currently in closed alpha im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later if you do not find my review helpful please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback

i have played no i have lived this game for 2690 hours so im probably one of the top players heck im so good at it bohemia should get me to inhouse betatest their coffee machine which means i can now do the following blindfolded i can shoot a rabbit at 2 kilometers between the eyes i can land a helicopter on a dime at mach 2 in a raging blizzard i can field strip a 50 tonne tank in under thirty seconds while under small arms fire and rpg attacks i can order pizza in five different languages using a us army fm 30 command and control radio i can singlehandedly defeat an entire army using nothing more than a mre ration and a bowie knife if anyone is going to give a review on arma 3 its going to be me this game is good but the proof is in the pudding so for examples of gameplay httpswwwyoutubecomuserjester814 jester gives an in your face gameplay view that is a tank httpswwwyoutubecomuserdslyecxi dslyecxi gives the best hands down introduction to techniques weapons and movement if you want to know how it works  then go watch dslyecxi httpswwwyoutubecomuserrhinocrunch go watch rhinocrunch for shooting peeps in the back and running away screaming in fear they will come back from the dead and then pretending you fear nothing just plain stupid funny there are of course numerous flaws bugs and irritants that every multiplayer game has but the one the gets most peeps irate seems to be the lack of contempory guns after all the game is set in the near future so the guns should be differerent a bit but ive seen pashtun tribesmen up in the hindu kush who still carry martinihenry rifles left over from the 1880 angloafghan war taking potshots at their neighbours weapons never retire they simply explode the vanilla guns are quite good but i really wish there was a lot of the old guns from arma 1 and 2 actually what i really want is a combat shotgun like the saiga and the aa12 nothing says im peased to meet you mudderfker more than a atchisson assault shotgun 12 gauge to the face which brings me to mods arma 3 isnt a complete game its the basic framework upon which the modding community can builld mods weapons equipment vechicles etc for you to use so the first thing you do after buying this game is go to httpwwwarmaholiccom i think this is an excellent source httpplaywithsixcom download this and wait three days as it figures out what cyberspace is or steamsworkshop which i find problematic as it doesnt categorize items and you find weapons uniforms vechicles and pretty well everything mixed up together but at least it installs correctly while the other two routes are really annoying to figure out there are mods for glasses hats uniforms beards compasses there are no end of special forces assault rifles bazookas sniper rifles pistols the size of a shetland pony there are exotic and weird mods for star wars halo zombies and dinosaurs  yes i said dinosaurs personally i think bohemia should change its business model and simply pay the modding community for their best work as in here young fellah we like what youve done sign this paper have some money and we will stick your work into the offical game now go make a career of this all said and done is this game worth getting well do the math  almost 3000 hours gameplay for about $50 or euros then its not really a question  is it but i still want my combat shotgun and i want it called the snarkanator

if youre coming to arma 3 as an arma series veteran you already know what to expect for the most part the game hasnt changed since the last installment but then its always felt a little bit like bohemia interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by operation flashpoint in the worlds longest ever game of development buckaroo thankfully the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner its quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now arma has a reputation its known to be frighteningly obtuse bewilderingly complex and often hilariously broken i can tell you right now that arma 3 is no different and absolutely still deserves that reputation thankfully i dont think its unfair to say that this is the closest an arma game has come to being user friendly the controls have been tweaked and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes for these improvements alone i do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry coming from any other modern fps game it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls but i honestly think arma 3 will see a far lower dropout rate of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games at the time of writing the elephant in the room is the lack of content available when compared to arma 2 which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim in many cases opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best for anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in arma 2 arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing fortunately this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community it has long been the case that the best parts of the arma games are the parts not developed by bohemia interactive themselves and arma 3 is most definitely continuing this tradition nevertheless i cant help but feel that the game couldve done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release speaking of the mod community i think its criminal that almost none of the best nearindispensible mods from arma 2 have been officially integrated for a selfprofessed war simulator arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces even with a visible bipod or tow damaged vehicles for all its flaws though arma 3 is still a blast to play if you can find a decent group of likeminded gamers with access to a voiceovernet server youre in for some of the best gaming youll ever experience sure youll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety and sure sometimes the game will crash spectacularly or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall but when youre standing on a hilltop looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a cas helicopter strafes an enemy apc and spots targets for a distant sniper team when everything clicks together in the way that only arma can manage youll be glad to have been along for the ride

being an avid arma 2 wastelanddayz player back in the day about 15 years ago i relished the thought of a new arma coming out arma 2 was practically uknown until its popularity was increased by dayz i found it interesting to jump into a bi bohemia interactive title that already had a steady fanbase behind it having been about a year since i purchased this game launch and over 100 hours of solid gameplay i feel that i can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects i have experienced within this game now i know what youre thinking $5999 this isnt even considered a triple a title thats like thats like the price of cod ghosts now dont be intimidated by this price for i can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $5999 from a value perspective i found the price to be very reasonable based on the games content nowadays basically arma is a series of hardcore military simulation constantly reflecting realworld conditions into a video game in arma 2 i feel that this was its drawback for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall its a game guys relax arma 3 has found a good balance between an fps3rd person shooter game and realism making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator and a game i also found that arma 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun i imagine it is much easier to get into arma 3 than i did arma 2 i cant judge im not new to it the engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the arma 2 engine however rocks are still and i guess forever will be broken perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an uneven surface pro tip never walk on rocks unless you absolutely have to the game also has a variety of content although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are a lot less guns this is partly due to the customization of guns instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation m4a1 holo m4a1 cco m4a1 you have a base gun and you are able to add sights lasers silencers flashlights what have you however this is not a full excuse i feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall guns to shoot perhaps bohemia interactive is trying to finetune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for varietys sake whats also very surprisingly good in this game is the nvidia physx that was incorporated seeing my transport trucks wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while i drive troops through the night is ohsosatisfying as well as well realistic the physics engine has been extremely improved and i quite like it id like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound for this is after all a big part of the game once again i will compare it to arma 2 in saying clearly that arma 2 featured a more highpitched tappy sound when you shot with vertical recoil while 3 brings a much more deeper louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards the guns definitely feel better for me but in the end id like to classify this judgment as personal preference lastly the gamemodes of arma 3 are diverse and excellent my favourite being wasteland script i wont go into detail here there is also king of hill dayz of course but its meh and of course standard operations altis life is also a really sweet one check those out if you end up buying so yeah i really like this game and i think that there is so much potential for a growing community grab some buddies hop into stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad really great game id definitely recommend to any fpsmilsim fan d

arma 3 is a tricky game to review but heres me trying it anyway the reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player i take arma 3 for what it is first and foremost a platform what you get is a good looking game with a solid would be great but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance engine two amazing maps stratis and altis which is probably the most impressive map ive seen in any open worldish game and the prospect of near endless new content from the community what you dont get is an easy to get into milshooter with cod sized maps and a quick pace if youre in for uncomplicated fast paced pvp gameplay you should probably look elsewhere if youre sick of that however arma 3 might be just your thing the strength of the arma series is freedom  yeah you are free to mod the game into almost anything you want create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience you have to invest some time into the game but once you got into it the opportunities are endless want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more arma is just your thing and there are big communities in many different languages that will help you find that epic experience want to play singe player well if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on then arma 3 isnt the game youre looking for or is it right now bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign  those missions are challenging offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but dont expect a good story or interesting characters but as mentioned before  the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime personally i prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends already the steam workshop has countless missions for 25 players so should you buy arma 3 well id certainly recommend it if any of the things i mentioned above sounds fun to you it is to say though that this game is not something that everyone might like so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it i hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by arma 3 please note that im not a native english speaker so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some

i played this game about 90 hours which is more than any of my friends at the moment cant really compare it to any other game arma is just arma period xd if you havent played arma before then you migh think that this is the game about shooting or operating armored vehicles but no not really most of the time you will run around some forests trying to spot the enemy and figure out how to take them out then you probably gonna be spoted by the enemy and be dead in a seconds repeat playing this game requires strategic thinking  you cant just take gun and take enemy out no it doesnt work that way this game features two maps big and huge including towns forests mountains flat fields and graaaas grass grass yeah i love grass in this game  looks fantastic xd so where was i oh right the map is big and you can go by your feet or take armored vehicles civilian vehicles helicopters or planes you gonna waste time to get to destination point and after hour of travelling there you will be shot by some weirdo in the woods repeat anyway this is nice gameyet you need some great rig to run it with limitless editor and mod support best expirience achieved in coop missions with friends team work is necessary pros limitless warfare simulator graphics looks beatiful 80% of the time ingame editor allows you to create your own missions steam workshop support download missions created by other users or get more weapons and vehicles its not cod its not bf4 either bugs are fun cons its probably boring for players from other shooter games limitless cpu usage your cpu will cry like a ith during the 100 vs 100 battle with tanks and helis graphics doesnt look beautiful 20% of the time not so big default weapon arsenalbut there are mods hey multiplayer performance sucks sausage campaign is not open world and not coop as it was in arma 2 bugs are still bugs even if theyre fun ai has iq equal to chair or maybe table ps did you really read it all lol if you consider yourself as a hardcore fps shooter player and cod is for kids bla bla bla  try arma waste your time enjoy true hardcore pps i was really bored so i wrote all this dont blame me please

while the animations graphics lighting and vehicle handling are better in this installment into the arma series i miss the arma 2s setting units and mods arma 3s futureistic setting doesnt make sense and some of the gear used just looks flat out odd while i appreciate the new vehicles such as the mrap hunter or the newly updated ghosthawk blackhawk or any of that sort of updated feel im not saying change is a bad thing im just saying sometimes too much change isnt a great addition to the arma series was the much requested stances available to you during the game whether its leaning from standing crouching or even laying on your side in the prone position it offers a wide variety of heights and angles to tackle those pesky rocks windows and walls that youre either too short or too tall for there are 3 standing stances 3 crouching stances a sitting position and a prone position every stance except for sitting allows you to step out to the side or lean around cover from the prone you can peak a corner or lay on your side this vastly improves over arma 2s restricted movement it would be nice to see the ability to vault over short walls or help your buddy boost over a larger one as well but thats just wishful thinking another thing i noticed is the sound of the weapons a lot of the weapons have similar sounds which makes it hard to distinguish which side of the battle youre getting into while some of the sounds such as explosions vehicles and other small ambient additions are nice i feel like im often confused and lost with the sounds hopefully a good soundmod will fix this later down the road ai   ai  ai   one thing the arma series hasnt been able to nail down is the ais movement pathing communication and skills i realize that its really difficult in such a complex and vast game such as this where the player has free will on which direction to get to an objective or how but often youll either find your allies falling behind running out of formation for a second or asking where are you after you run over a hill even though other soldiers under your command are still coming of the hill themselves it would be nice to see ai being able to figure out things based on other ai and not almost strictly from you combat awareness something i noticed in arma is that no matter what situation the ai in combat are lacking whether an enemy soldier or a friendly youll notice them not finding cover running into the middle of a street or from behind cover out into the open on one of my first showcase missions i was instructed by my ai squad leader to move behind a wrecked tank as cover neat i thought he then gave me an area to suppress as i was an automatic rifleman i began laying fire down from my position my own squad leader walked next to me and as he gave an order ran right in front of me bushing me back and causing a bullet to hit him in the head resulting in a mission failed and having to restart the whole thing note the time it took for him to stand next to me and rush in front of me was almost 1 second leaving me no time to react their aim isnt that great either you could be standing across a room and they wont be able to hit you or theyll be firing from a fortified position catching you and your allies ofguard yet not hiting any of you as you sprint to cover or dash towards it now this goes both ways to combat them being too easy you could set the dificulty to expert of veteran the problem with this is that the change is too extreme setting your game to the highest difficulty results in enemy soldiers being able to spot you easily you could be concealed at night in a bush and taking you out that or youll witness getting shot in the head from across the valley my advice find some friends or a group to join disable ai teammates for the mission and only play with a team made up of human players 9 times out of 10 youll be able to accurately cover teammates move together in a more realistic and effective way and it will increase your expierence 10fold heres an example of the helo ai in this game httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid203646487 another weird problem you may notice is the problem with framerates while playing any form of multiplayer you may or many not have issues and to top it off its really sporatic and without a known cause in singleplayer however this is not the case and the game runs a lot smoother and it is quite confusing and frustrating when trying to set your settings heres an example you go to singleplayer and you set your game to just the right settings after a while of tinkering the game looks great and youre real happy with it now your friend hops on or you want to go play on a server you select one with the best playerping ratio and join it you notice right away your frames are a lot worse and you sit the tinkering with your settings again mostly lowering everything so that you can run the game not only does this make the game look worse in one of the most important features of the game but when you join back to singleplayer the game looks worse and you either have to deal with the settings again or get stuck with lower graphics now changing the settings in multiplayer may not always fix the problem either so you could be messing with them for awhile before giving up in frustration overall if youre a fan of the arma series or any realistic shooter id go for arma 3 while i still play arma 2 more arma 3 offers enough change when i get tired of the former improved graphics and lighting vehicle handling weapon handling and the use of different combat stances really improves over arma 2s static and prohibited movement while you wont be in the deserts of takistan or going through the dense city of zargabad the islands of stratis and altis are sure to give you the variety and fun youd want while the ai isnt improved much some of the futuristic units and factions dont fit well and the sounds can tend to be confusing arma 3 is definitely a step in the right direction and a giant leap towards success

gameplay  1010  this is why arma 3 is my favorite game of all times the gameplay is unique and realistic you can actually feel the realism when you play especially mixed with the awesome community ai  410  sometimes the ai is completely ed up and this is something the devs need to work on graphics  810  good graphics though watch out for fps drops details  610  no furniture in buildings and other stuff which makes the game feel empty but the outdoors which you mostly play in has alot of rocks and bushes that can actually save your life in some really hard situations though mission makers can add stuff in the scenario editor replayability  910  theres alot of things to do from diving onto land and then sneaking around a guerilla camp to using advanced hightech mortars togheter with armored vehicles assaulting a largely fortified base if you combine these things combined arms you can create some really epic missions music  910  also i love the soundtrack its just pure epicness sound  810  since the marksmen platform update got released the sound got a huge upgrade the gunfire does different echoessounds depending on environment and distance and the guns also sound more realistic glitchfree  510  the game has alot of glitches and stuff like that but sometimes its just hilarious and doesnt affect gameplay that much community  1010  amazing community even the russians stick to their own servers though there are some veerry rare occasions of hackers also a huge amount of communitymods to use developers  810  at the start of arma 3 alot of people were saying it was unfinished and they only added expensive dlc but it looks like they forgo the free platform update back in arma 2 the dlc was very worth it and rich of new stuff to play with recently the developers announced their secret project which is a whole new terrain located at an island in south america theres alot of new features such as jetskis and airplanes which im very looking forward to d story  510  very basic story just like call of duty though there are some mysteries the community must uncover length  long  i think the campaign is about 20 hours long optimization  910  there is alot of optimization you can even switch colors of the teams dlc  medium  there are 3 dlcs at the moment some people think its way to expensive 1399  for 2 helicopters but they always put alot of detail and work into them and a platform update also gets released fair price  yes  final result  97100

arma 3 is an ambitious title with a style of gameplay that will polarize players the many complexities and amount of controls to master can be a daunting task for any newcomer to the series while seasoned vets will feel right at home for better or worse there is a great deal to learn about playing arma in a way that is enjoyable the default campaign mode is passable with all the tropes youd expect to find in a military shooter with a few surprises here and there missions vary in length and scope ranging from short range patrols to full on combined operations assaults however where the real meat is in the multiplayer experience and the many mods available hopping on to a coop server with 60 players who actually want to work together as a unit is nothing short of amazing in a world of le epic trelling being able to request evac mortar medical assistance etc is wonderous on its own but having those assets being controlled by actual players gives you a sense of connection and being part of a team even if realistic military games arent your particular style there are plenty of other game modes available that you can download right from the server browser and enjoy these include standouts like altis life kind of like a more advanced cops and robbers wasteland a survival mod focused on factions and breaking point  a dayz style mod mods will breath all sorts of new life into your game adding new vehicles uniforms maps and much much more giving you almost limitless scenarios and tools to use in creating custom missions you can check out the large database of mods at  httpwwwarmaholiccom that said arma is not without its fair number of faults and missteps the game is not optimized well for multiplayer and youll encounter many bugs along the way most of which are hilarious as opposed to annoying the learning curve can be fairly steep and youll have to be patient to get the most fun out of this title that said its well worth it especially if you have some friends willing to do the same

downloaded arma and then opened it proceeded to do a horrible tutorial but after that it was just beautiful opened an rpg server and ran 2 miles to get to an atm and ran 2 miles to a shady car salesman bought a car spent the next half hour trying to figure out how to actually get into it after i finally managed to glitch into it i underestimated its ability to travel at light speed which in turn caused me to crash into a wall after that my car was a smoking mess with a top speed that a sloth could outdo 1010 would crash again

if you want to play the best military simulator experience arma 3 is your best bet it has the combat vehicles weapons it has it all i have played arma 3 for around 300 hours and it is still fun there are a variety of different game modes that you can play such as wasteland which is less serious than others life servers are for the ones who probably played a lot of darkrp in garrys mod insurgency and domination they are also good tactically played gamemodes which are sometimes taken a lot seriously lovely game 1010

the best sandbox war game of the year arma 3 is a continuation to the arma series by bohemia interactive taken to the next level with increased player controlmovement enhanced mechanics for vehicles weapon systems if you buy it flight models if you buy it _ and much more the control in tight spaces should be worked on this is no call of duty the controls are clunky but are a vast improvement over the previous installment arma 2 another of the top complaints of this game is the netcode it is terrible under load but again is much better than arma 2 this game is mostly open source meaning that players are able to change almost every aspect of the game from the amount of fog to adding dinosuars into the game the things you can do are endless and that is its selling point bohemia interactive leaves the imagining to you and the community to come up with your own story or missions this game is heavily supported by the modding community and for good reason the scripting language for arma 3 is sqf based off the c coding language but it seems like a little of everything works there is alot of things you can do to make somehting work i have based 4 years of my life modding and playing arma 2 and arma 3 making this my most played game by a long shot the best way to play this game is modded and with friends by its self arma is fun but somewhat bland but that seems like that was part of the plan bi bohemia interactive made the game as basic as possible to allow you and its users to change it the way they like it do i recommend this game yes this game has supplied my friends and i countless hours of playtime with new and exciting missions and firefights and with a few basic mods it has become 400% better than before 9210

i highly recommend this game for any wanting to see the closest thing to real life combat without actually joining the army not only does this simulate real military tactics but provides an excellent window of opportunity for clans to really feel like they are in the middle of a war friends can get together and act like the special forces team that they all wanted when they were little kids you can even have roleplaying games and custom games such as cops and robbers this is by far my favorite military game of all time sure it takes a while to learn about the dangers of not going prone when an enemy comes by or getting major fatigue in the middle of a firefight but it is a simulator and by far the best one for military standards i do not recommend this game for the call of duty & battlefield lovers because there is just no simple respawn or run and gun it situation this is not built for deathmatches it is built to be a simulator that simulates real time combat for the hardcore people there are no killstreakscod type loadouts or mlg scoreboard if anyone gets mad because this game is just a simulator i only have one thing to say this game is not for you

this is the best golf simulator out there you really can feel the swing in ur whole upper body as you go on killing people with your towed zamak beneath ur transport bird on wasteland samatra and the crowd victims goes wild in the global chat 12 times you manage to score this keeps you going for hours and hours the occasional aa missile hitting you in the side makes for an even more interesting golf course as you will need to get out of the rough and repairre fuel the heli to get back on the fairway 1210 will golf again

pros  most wide maps of any shooting game that i have played  mods really make arma  modding community is really good  powerful map editor and scripting language cons  really badly implemented multithreading resulting in horrible performance  inconsistent and buggy scripting language with many flaws  netcode is still not very stable  game and mods require approximately 100gb hard disk space  modding community is scattered so compability is a issue  arma with many mods is generally hugely instable that there is saying arma happened when you crash or die for unknown reason  game is only 32bit so it will use your pagefile as ram extension   game can only use 25% of cpu or gpu because the mainthread is full of bottlenecs crippeling the performance this game makes me feel very controversial as i love the game and the concept of the game but the game engine is based on technology from 19th century thus making the game unplayable

the good  this game is actually the 4th installment of the arma series and ive been playing since the start the developers of this game have taken a rare approach to updating their game they keep the mechanics and feel of the game pretty much the same while making the graphics shine by just updating their custom real virtuality engine rather than replacing it as well as adding new campaigns missions vehicles weapons and game modes the part where this game really shines however is the community driven mods the game was built for modding and the developers have done everything in their power to make it easy for the community to make anything they want out of this game it may look like a hardcore military simulator from the store page but ive seen games in this series turned into a civil war sims grand theft auto like games arma life hardcore zombie games dayz a stargate tribute which had working animated stargates and all your favorite characters from the show ww2 sims invasion 1944 jurassic park tributes and so much more these mods take a lot of work to create sure but there are also things you can do very easily without any knowledge of 3d editing or texturing simply open the mission editor on the map that you like best and place a few soldiers down now add some waypoints for them to attack a town add some soldiers inside the town thats it if you make yourself a civilian character in the town you can watch a fantastic battle ensue between the two groups of soldiers using proper flanking maneuvers and yelling back and forth to one another when they see an enemy this all would take at most about 2 minutes in the editor to have a full battle going on want to do more read the plethora of information out there on advanced editing and scripting in the game and before you know it youll have the ability to make suicide bombers battle busses essentially a civilian bus with artillery and machine guns on top of it nuclear bombs and really anything you can imagine if you have any issues someone will be willing to help you out either on redditcomrarmadev or on the official bohemia interactive forums i hope youll choose to join me on my favorite game and play some cool missions together that you or i just freshly made in the editor even if you dont like making your own content there are fun mods already out there such as the popular battle royale mod where youre forced to parachute out of a crashing plane with 28 or so of your fellow players and fight to the death while scavenging for the best gear just look around and youll find endless entertainment in this game the bad  i mentioned that the engine is updated with each iteration instead of replaced this does sometimes mean that glitches that were in the first couple games reappear in later games but with the increased popularity of the series lately the devs have been doing their best to squash all those nasty bugs another warning i would give wouldbe buyers is that the game is very demanding for your pc people who have rigs that they think are powerful because they can play battlefield 4 at full settings without much frame drop are in for a nasty surprise arma 3 truly stresses your hardware and the devs are still working on optimizations to take full advantage of your hardware at the moment it seems like most people are having a smooth experience but some peoples hardware even when pretty impressive just doesnt get along with the game that well at the moment

while this game is still one of the best milsims on the market it still suffers from a majority of issues from arma 2 in addition to bugs graphical issues and my all time favorite the legendary fps bugs this game has a lot of cool features that werent in arma 2 like changing clothing weapon attatchments better movement and better cqb combat however due to bis inability to fix the excrutiatingly painful fps issues you will be lucky to be getting out 30 fps now if you think you have the best pc and think im joking go check out the arma 3 community disscusions and see for yourself how unplayable the game is i myself am greatful for at least getting 40 frames however i have to deal with graphics that look worse than arma 2 and a 1200 view distance which all arma 2 veterans know is complete  multiplayer is worse for me considering im only getting 15 fps because of the crap optimization if you do happen to get this game make sure you have a powerful cpu because arma 3 will only use 40% of any gpu $60 for a game anyone can hardly run seems pointless in my books in addition you will need mods to enjoy this game im not joking thankfully the game can handle a large amount of mods you will need mods to play with a majority of the units clans on arma 3 i have about 30 mods on arma 3 and it still dosent add up to the content in arma 2

arma iii arma iii is like chess out of all the table games arma is the most sofisticated and fancy war game there is ive had over 2000 hours of battlefield and of call of duty few hours in insurgency and many other games but arma ive never heard of arma iii until one of my friends told me about it in arma the systems are extremely advanced the system is so realistic that it gets up to a point in which it turns plain annoying you break your leg you cant breath you fall you trip you die you drown everything happens in this game theres everything that a war game needs to have this is not even a war game its a war simulator which makes it even better the campaign is hours of fun and entertainment and if you dare you can even learn how to code in arma and make your own missions making missions to be rated for your own fun to screw around you can do anything you could imagine in few hours and those few hours will grant you limitless fun hours and hours of gameplay hours and hours of designing and meeting new people hours and hours of coop pvp tdm ava and everything that a war simulator needs cars tanks planes boats submarines civilian cars trucks convoys war helicopter transport ambulances huge maps huge buildings huge cities beautiful physics and beautiful enviroments the map is huge and it would probably take you hours to go across it both stratis and altis i havent played this game for a really long time but with the very few hours i played i can pretty much say that its way better than anything else ive ever tried bohemia interactive might not be the best company out there but still they made this one beautiful game that no other company have or ever will do better youll need a team youll need to cooperate and think about what cards to play while being in the front of the battle youll need to set up your equipment and gear and know know how to use it and how to react to all possible situations this game has no boundaries and i have great expectations for it i am waiting for it to grow even more and for it to be even more enjoyable this game this game is unique this is the best game ive ever played

for players who have never played arma and go into this game with no expectations its okay the game works for that but for people with expectations for this game for example arma 2 fans it is completely unacceptable the game completely dwarfs all previous arma games in many aspects the graphics and engine are much better it has a great core with great potential but that sadly is all it has the game itself has to have been rushed on the official release day it was in the state of an alpha game and still feels like a beta for most people the game had an actual alpha and beta on steam but from the players point of view not much changed between alpha and release day except for a few new assets and the main map being released it never should have left the alpha and the problem is that bohemia doesnt seem to have admitted to even themselves that their game came out unfinished from release day they have been treating it like a final product with only a few small polishes and fixes needed this is beyond the exact opposite of how it actually is on release day it was laughably broken it had the most bugs i have ever seen in a game and felt like a joke now after 15 years many obvious bugs have been ironed out i can say that the very surface game experience is acceptable the problem today is that while they fixed some of the basic gameplay issues about 40% of the features feel unfinished but that is coming from someone with 1000 hours of experience as i said the surface experience is acceptable but if you really start playing you will notice inexcusable holes in the experience along with all of this the game is set in 2035 so none of the objects in the game are real and at best partially resemble real things the nato and aaf factions are okay but the csat faction the only opfor faction available looks terrible the csat people literally look like aliens and i get depressed every time i see one of them what was bohemia thinking why would you put space aliens in a military simulator especially arma atleast put terrorists or north koreans or normal russians but space aliens this is very controversial especially for a military simulator in particular arma currently the helicopters dlc costs 15$ the game shipped with only a few helicopters so it was good to hear that they were addressing this it was sad to hear they were charging 15$ for something that should have been included with the game but i could live with that what really set me off is that for 15$ you get only two helicopters yes 2 helicopters that you should already have for 15 dollars with the arma 2 oa expansion we literally got more assets than arma 3 will probably ever have for 20 dollars now we pay 15 dollars for 2 helicopters currently from what i can see arma 3 is doomed they are going to continue charging money for each baby step towards a finished game and with that only make a few baby steps and then run off with the money the only dlc remaining will be a dlc called marksmen which adds 7 weapons all of which ive played with and most of which look like laser guns almost as bad as the csat faction bohemia also has a interesting dlc model which makes the dlc more like updates with certain assets you cant play with unless you buy the dlc this will mean marksmen comes with an upgraded weapon system and 3 vests all of which everyone gets but ingame the core dlc items are unusable without paying there may also be an expansion way after the marksmen dlc comes out but nothing has been confirmed about it tldr arma 3 is a dissapointment for real arma fans because holes in the general experience not enough stuff and weird art style not appropriate for military simulators

i want to love it so so much but the fact remains that i get over 120 fps on single player and only 2535 fps for multiplayer i know its not my fault because my computer is a sexy devil i know some of it depends on the server that is a fact yes but another fact would be unless your running your own server or playing on a server very close to your location you cant achieve 60 constant or better fps and i just cant deal with that in 2015 im sure alot of others feel the same way as i do and thats why i cannot recommend arma3 to anybody wanting to server hop around i would say this game is stricly for single player or playing a private server with a few of your friends whom live close to you ^ i will clearify that this is only my case so if the above doesnt apply to you  dont rage at me instantly be happy because you play servers that you connect to very well and for that im straight up jelious if i had one wish it would be to have this game but with as good as frame rates as arma 2 or even dayz standalone it literally hurts my feelings that this game is such a letdown thus all said if you love arma3 as much as i do play some coop with your friends or play singleplayer you still get amazing fps if you have a good computer however i do not think this game is worth $60 perhaps wait for a massive steam sale this is my reveiw and i most certainly not recommend arma3 without love for singleplayersmall private servers

arma 3 was highly anticipated by me when it was first announced and i pounced on the beta as soon as it was released now that its on general release im totally wrapped by it ive already played around 250 hours and just cant get enough of it theres 114 pages of custom made missions available for free via steam and the armaholic web site singleplayer coop and multiplayer missions httpwwwarmaholiccom most that ive played have been excellent the in game editor enables you to create missions fairly easily with little experience the whole package is well worth full price theres more big updates coming soon adding to the campaign mode the only downside ive found is the lack of an armoury all previous arma games have included an armoury where you are able to try out all weapons and vehicles plus play as any character in game including animals the game has amazing graphics an open world stretching for many kilometers in all directions and smooth gameplay all of which make arma a pleasure to play imo far better than any other shooter around incluing battlefield 4call of duty & op flashpoint  love battlefied and the op flashpoint games as well edit  april 13th 2015 the game has come a long way since i wrote my review though due to a massive back log of unplayed games that i own ive not had much opportunity to play the game recently that said the developers have added a lot more to the game since last played it such as the single player campaign plus of course there are many more missions and modifications added since i mentioned it previously in fact far more than ill ever be able to get through

heres a story just to tell you what kind of game this is lemme start by telling you this game is definitely more of a template than it is a full game solely based on its modding capability alone so i have a vietnam mod for this game adds new maps units weapons etc our platoon lands in the jungles at lz fiona a clearing in the jungle in the hills we spread out and head into the jungles a shot rings out and the lt takes one in the chest vc ambush i hit the ground and ready my m16a1 i have no clue where the rounds are coming from but theyre coming as im lying in the brush three figures run by but they dont look friendly startled i swerve quickly back into their direction and let loose a full auto barrage from my 20 round magazine i see blood flying out of the figures and then they drop i got three of them i look back ahead of me and start letting out oneround bursts trying to suppress the enemies on the opposite hillside ammos getting low and the bullets keep coming i climb through the muck and grunge of the jungle floor to a nearby friendly hes hit but no time to mourn now i pilfer through his gear and find what i needed sweet sweet ammo 30 bullets left i reload and the hell begins anew

if you are an arma fan this game will change all that when you spen 60$ and your computer cant run it it will be because your computer is crappy when you are disappointed in the complete lack of content compared to other arma games you will be called spoiled when there is nothing to do offline no point or story its because its still in the works even though its a full release when you cant eek out better than 10fps no matter what your specs its because you didnt tweak enough when you cant find a server to play on its because you dont know the right clan when you do get on a server and it lags greifs and glitches its because you play on crappy servers when you dont think its realistic its not a sim when you cant have any shootem up fun like bf its because it is a sim when all your other games run like a champ and are fun but not arma3 its not fair to compare when you voice any of the above views here or the bi forums you are a liar httpforumsbistudiocomshowthreadphp163875iamaplayerofbigamesfromofpcwchereswhatithink

arma is a series that has always had my intense fascination i cut my teeth on the early tom clancy games rainbow 6 and ghost recon so i was no stranger to the concept of a hard infantry sim ive followed arma since its inception as operation flashpoint and i have grown to love the series like no other there are portions of arma 3 that are more boring than watching grass grow as you sit in vehicles or tromp around on foot for endless minutes the real meat of the game though lies in what can turn into thirty seconds to five minutes of pure chaos firefights dont have the corridor of meat puppets that games like cod or other mainstream shooters have to offer there are no meticulously rendered setpieces instead everything outside of radio chatter might as well be freeform you draw attention from a chopper while infiltrating a base they radio out to a mechanized squad that sends an infantry fighting vehicle armed with a 40mm machinegun the ground churns around you and your own team as fire and shrapnel turn a stealth mission into a desperate fight for survival these are things that happen in this utterly unforgiving but satisfying game this isnt a series for the squeamish and this surely isnt a series where you expect instant health regeneration while you duck down out of the way from canned enemy fire you will learn to fear the sound of a faint crack in the distance or the recognizable drone of a gunship approaching enemy man 100m bearing 045 ready to fire

ive had this game since the first day of alpha and i can confidentally say that nothing comes close to arma 3 in potential except maybe arma 2 and minecraft its a fantastic sandbox military simulator where you can do anything you could imagine no matter how dumb its a game where content is developed by the community for the community there are no set game modes or official servers there aren even any official game modes you can even download on their website its a completely player created game feel like invading either the islands of altis and stratis one minute and then roleplaying as a drug dealer the next sure why not its completely possible in arma 3 pros  almost limitless potential  close to an unlimited number of gamemodes created by the community  hundreds of community made campaigns and mods both avaliable on the workshop and on armaholic the goto place for arma mods  massive maps with none of those dumb loading screens every other game with maps on these scales seem to have stratis is 1520km2 altis is 270km2  large maps load very well and are very stable  the ability to have infantry armor naval and air battles at the exact same time on a much larger scale than you could imagine in another game such as battlefield  a wide variety of weapons vehicles and clothing cons  vehicles tend to explode a bit easier than they should  possibility of desync occuring on servers if they are overloaded  hit markers and boxes can be a bit buggy and glitchy  possibility of some pretty big lag adding too many itemsvehiclesaiplayers to the games already massive maps as you can see the pros easily outweight the cons this game is fantastic even if you dont want to pay the full price for it it goes on sale often enough and i promise you wont regret it 910

much better than call of duty and battlefield this game does a very great job in immersing you into the environment your team ai can get killed leaving you the only one left in the squad the bullets snap and whiz around you there are many choices of vehicles to choose from all with different roles and abilities kinda wish there were more guns thats just my opinion but the fewer choices bring simplicity in the game the underwater subs and scuba suits are also very awesome totally wished they had sharks that would bring some thrills also the graphics over all are sexy all over pleasing your eyes with ic glee

arma iii the fourth game in the arma series if we include the original operation flashpoint as well many mainstream fps gamers complain about armas style because its unique thats exactly why i love this game you really have to find patience and a learning curve to this game but once you have control over the game youll find tons of enjoyable content youll find yourself playing around with the editor campaign with great storyline 2 beautiful islands to explore customizable gear multiplayer fun as well as serious gameplay what else do you want yeah it might have some bugs and lag but if you look back at arma 2 not many complained about it though arma 3 is highly improved from the previous title arma is a huge game that you will be playing for years to come youll always find ways to emerge into armas gameplay its ultimately up to you to be creative because of bohemia interactives hard work on unique warfare gameplay and immersive experience id give it 910

this game offers a lot and i mean a lot you can download endless missions made from the community workshop and play with strategy with your friends or run around half naked and dance around or you could roleplay and buy an atm from all the drug money you earned in altis life or have races with friends in karts this game is an army simulator but its great for modding which lets you do more things now this game isnt something like cod or battlefield it takes strategy and tactics and patience if you come from these games it will be harder to get into fast although if you play through the campaign it will help you get used to the game please dont think the warfare in this game is just pew pew pew die respawn repeat it takes skill altis is a very big map you can drive around for what seems like forever in this beautiful map there is forestry a lot of ocean desert grassland etc there is also stratis a smaller more wastelandish and deserty than altis you need a good pc to run this game i usually get around 45 fps on online servers around 60 on single player or games with small amounts of people in it overall this game has a ton of things to do and you cant get bored of it i give it a 9510

bestest game ever since battlefield2 yes i said it  if you played bf2 and you loved it but hated all its successors arma3 is the deal this game is what should`ve followed bf2 it`s pure awesome tough and unforgiving warfare it`s not made for easy or rather noobish play you can`t run for a mile and expect to be able to shoot straight the instance you stop running you can`t either fly your attackhelicopter slamming into trees and buildings along the way and expect to be alive arma does not do that you die you get hurt in any case you do stupid stuff you will pay for it it`s a milsim not an arcadeshooter like all the other triplea titles out there you want a challenge  get arma3 you want realistic movement  get arma3 you want realistic weaponshandling  get arma3 you want honest  and hard working developers  get arma3 you want a game with hundreds or more mods to chose from as you like  get arma3 you want your own skill to be the baseline on how your play has influence on the battlegame  get arma3 by all the good stuff mentioned it`s only fair to tell about badunfortunate things arma3 offers this game needs a good cpu not an ok one a good cpu and a fair amount of tweaking to get it run somewhat smoothly and for multiplayer client`s performance is dependant on server`s performance you can have a beast computer but if the server you play on sucks your fps will suck aswell you`ll have to learn this game before you can be really good at it and then when you`re good arma3 is deeply satisfying just for personal comparison i now have more hours of arma3 playtime 1500h than all hours of all battlefields i`ve played over the years combined thats the message yes  and it doesnt get boring yet

after playing many hours on arma iii  from a realistic perspective and a fun one it is a great experience for anyone who loves military simulators [enwikipediaorg]  the game is divded into several categories if you will infantry airborne waterborne artillery armoured mechanized and hq  it covers all of the basics plus advanced on the battlefield allowing for a varied approach to the game itself personally i prefer being behind a console managing uavsugvs the successor of arma ii has certainly taken on the role of nextgen and demolished competition such as americas army and dcs world the rv4 engine [arma3com] is used for dayz standalone and arma 3 thus far though dayz developers have recently announced the change of their [heavily] modified engine it really brings the ambience and full graphical effect of arma iii to life the detail of graphical texturing is one thing that appealed to me the most in the majority of games i have experienced during my past graphical texturing has always been a problem in games such as call of duty some battlefield games and even arma ii the level of immersion when experiencing the fidelity of arma iii is insanely good pros  detailed well researched factions which integrate with some fictional factors csat nato fia guerillas and even civilians  realistic sound effects for particular weapons majority of them being rifles and pistols  ability to perform one of many roles armour infantry etcetera  well established storyline for the campaign even split into acts for more development time  realistic factors such as the attention to detail on the ifv6c panther  when moving over rough terrain there are flaps on the side of the tracks that raise as it would interact with the physics in the world excellent detail  generally great game to play  many many more cons  ladders are extremely buggy climbing thin air is a thing once at the top of the ladder  artificial intelligence needs a rework their reactions are not quick enough and are heavily delayed when reacting earlier today i told my men to hold fire yet they continued even when disengaged  no builtin immersive radios external mods required task force arrowhead radio acre etcetera  although one of the factions are based on nato it is all american equipment and characters  voice acting is american for example  editing a custom mission is impossible unless you have external modifications  animations in general could do with a bit of a rework overall i would rate the game about 810 simply based on my hours within arma iii i played the alpha and the beta and it has come a long way since it was great to be a part of that development process and i am glad i bought the game early really excellent game

arma 3 is a great game but isnt as good as arma 2 in my opinon this game has lots of bugs and glitches arma 3 looks good but it needs a great pc to run smoothly samatras wasteland is amazing and id recommend it

if the game ran higher than 1015 fps i would be able to rate it properly its true arma 3 declares war on that graphics card you spent so much on

takes some practice to be good at this and a lot more practice to work tactically as a team but nothing is more rewarding than moving fluidly as a unit and getting things done without losing a single teammate once you get the tactics down you will then be able to fully enjoy this game 810

ive never played any arma before arma 3 i really didnt know what to expect i was somewhat bewildered you could say this game is a pretty difficult one to learn even as im still learning the game there is a never a moment i regret buying this title 100% worth it good quality good communitymodding community as well and excellent gameplay what are you waiting for buy this game and be amazed by its wonders

the ultimate military simulator that you can actually afford highly customizable but comes with a learning curve has a lively public community in the forms of altis life roleplay or instantaction king of the hill but for the real experience you should find a clan or community to play missions with

i picked this game up when it first came out and have spent tons of time playing it since then as with all the previous arma series it has its problems most of which i believe should have been fixed before being sold to the public but even with its faults it is still the closest thing to a real infantry simulator that a nonmilitary person can purchase with mods the game gets even better and more playable and less scifi like also ive never played any of the single player stuff that comes with the game i only do multiplayer with my group and i really enjoy it things to watch out for you need a fast processor for this game  do not buy it if your cpu isnt over 35 m all of the arma games are cpu intensive and this one is the worst for it dont expect it to be easy  this isnt call of duty or some other fps that has the ai standing around waiting for you theyll hide shoot at distance and even chase you around use realworld tactics if youre with friends and see how well they work they do think stay alert and youll survive longer theres loads of stuff i could say about this game but really i play it for about 20 hours or so a week and really enjoy it

great game but why are the dlcs so expensive for almost no content compared to arma 2 where a 20 dollar dlc was a whole new campaign and the helicopter one for a3 is what 2 helicopters 1 mission 4 training modules what is this  bohemia i thought you were better than this until you fix your  dlc prices i cant justly reccomend this game to anyone especially when you pay $60 for a game that has a $20 paywall for crappy amounts of content

good game a lot more realistic than that call of duty crap unfortunately parents still allow their 6 year old brats to own microphones and play this game just like in call of duty for the sake of gaming we need to enact laws against these kids from owning mics and ruining good games such as these be forewarned however that apparently running over cops and hijacking a police helicopter just to do a kamikaze suicide on the police hq is not tolerated on most rp servers and will get you banned they banned me from their servers i banned them from breathing

easily my favourite game right now while there is less content than arma 2 right now bis is continually adding more this game is definitely not for your typical cod kiddy as it takes patience and strategy which all adds into the experience the biggest thing for me is that this is a community game bis has simply provided a platform where the community makes limitless mods and missions for the user to enjoy speaking of mods they are awesome anything from radio mods to sound mods to vehicle and weapon additions and even entire new maps and game mods theres even a mech warrior mod the immersion in this game is great and i would highly reccomend taking the time to join a community doing this youll gain access to the real arma experience and not atlis lifewastelands community events are great and theres basically one out there that would suit any player lastly this game supports multiple control inputs which is a huge plus for me for example i have essentially 5 control inputs keyboard mouse track ir joystickhotas and steering wheelpedals they all work seemlessly together and allow for some really awesome configurations for example the pedals are tripurpose i use them for the obvious brake and gas while driving but i additionally use them for analogue leaning as infantry and rudder pedals while flying

complex but fun especially if you have friends to play with  i didnt like it in the beginning i found it rigid and complex mainly because i was comparing it to the other fps games in the market  very good gameplay  fancy graphics and physics are good  huge community contribution  you will walk a lot and you will be lost in the beginning i recommend it 
recommended
a great military sim that keeps you engaged both in its story and its warfare its a perfect slow and fast paced game and allows for multiple playable areas whether you are deploying and picking up troops running a covert mission with your nightvision traveling by sea to support ground troops or fighting on the ground in armor such as tanks or battling on foot it includes even more areas of battle such as close air support cas to diving underwater and traveling off shore to the area of opperation ao i highly recomend this game to anybody looking for a fun first or third person shooter that is very flexable with its battle

have a decent pc buy it have a pc that can only run minecraft at low settings just dont or youll have a real bad time

highly recommended this is one of the best strategy action simulators i have played since arma ii looks beautiful if you have top range pc one downside is that it is highly intensive on your cpu and i cannot recommend this for low end computerslaptops you never run out of things to do due to the steam workshop and level editor where mahy people create great game types and areas for combat i give a 910

recommending this game is a nobrainer if you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism arma 3 is inevitable the game wont let you in easily it has a steep learning curve and starting out can be quite frustrating also you are less likely to find good public servers it hardly is hopon and play like cod or battlefield the best way to experience it is in a clan or community group bottom line go get it its unique in every aspect
recommended
early into the game i noticed a few problems the graphics are a little dated but hold up overall the big problem i see is with the constant fadeout to fmv this seems to occur so frequently throughout the prologue i began wondering what the point of the game actually was i get it that this was a tutorial phase however i could do with less fadeaways and more actual gameplay with the cons out of the way i like the realistic feel to the game from the weaponry and equipment to the military jargon it has an air of authenticity which makes these types of games appealing to many arma 3 may have its flaws but overall it isnt a bad game if i were in charge i would have modernized the graphics a bit and put a greater emphasis on the smaller details such as battlefield damage to structures and the environment the movement of the weeds grass and trees in the wind and other little things to enhance the immersion experience still a recommendable game for those interested in army warfare sims

there is a notion of this game i cant figure out this game is an all around mess and an all around success in all aspects many call it a finished product and a blast to play and some call it an unplayable mess which involves complete hyper realistic fails so who is right well this game appeals to both an arcade style audience willing to get action and combat at extreme levels and also to the hardened clan fighting veteran focused on mods which improve gameplay and add features to the game to improve and keep game experiences fresh in this game however having played it for solid hours on end these moments which i had did not come naturally for a game to acheive its scale and realism to levels as in arma 3 is by no means accepted to all in this generation not trying to put my old man cap on here but to play games like dayz and arma you cant expect double kills and planes and cars to appear at the spawn the pmcs of advanced warfare didnt appear in the army for just being strong and chosen to play arma it is the same as dayz although not as boring and all running simulators and i dont mean to scare you by saying to have to run to pygros from kavala with broken legs what i mean is the same principle that you dont start as a badass and if that is your playstyle just dont play it or convince yourself that you can take the heat stories have to be made with extreme disiplinary acts in this game and how do you get those well here are the steps 1 this game takes some ing balls to get where you need to go this can always be avoided lol not really some way or another through the vast expanse of gamemodes like wasteland and joining a realsim unit is all acceptable for even the hardest mlg sniper to learn what this game is about but this part cannot be let go in parts where the game is about serious progression you cant be the one crying for someone to give you a chance because you are being a little  cat to be the general you gotta go through west point first 2 this game will bring you down to your ing knees and will always  with you so how do not let this happen well you really ing cant it all happens in a matter where if you are in the right place at the right time which perfectly demonstrates how this game is supposed to be this is why you need to be with a team of people who know what they are doing and know exactly what the hell is going on or be daring and be alone being a target and dying just like in an animal world so treat it like that hunt or be hunted kill or be killed the strong only survive because this is no fps that you have ever seen and before buying this you have to know what is coming for your soul oh but i have decided to roast your  again by saying that this game is amazing fun oh but you said it took a long time and was boring 3 shut the hell up and listen to me because if you dont you will die this game has changed my perspective on what it is well what is this game what does it offer what are you in for to be honest this game is really a test of mentality this game is really to see what you do in dire situations of disaster catastrophe military occupation and survival this can tie in to thinking of this game as an animal world like i said before to live you have to be familiar with your surroundings familiar with the weapons and all around just knowing what the  you are doing because this game is never merciful and is always working against you as said in my other steps above so how can you alter this you cant you cant change the future you cant change your actions in this game because it defeats the whole purpose

at first i was very skeptical about arma iii playing arma ii was not such a pleasant experience and i was very happy that i havent wasted my money on this when the day z mod came out so i bought arma iii expecting something as bad as the previous arma but i was surprised the graphics movement squad management driving and many other features were massively improved i`m not even talking about shooting recoil and gun damage is so realistic but the inventory system probably is the most improved thing since arma ii now you can easily see whats on the ground or in the vehicle or simply add attachments for your gun  which are awesome  there`s no more arrow clicking and usual inventory lag the only things that needs fixing are glitches and ai glitches should be fixed in future patches but the ai need some work done the ai could be both very easy to take down and extremely punishing at the same time sometimes ai just stands there for couple of seconds and then starts shooting or instantly spots you and shoots you down in a few shots i think bohemia interactive should really focus on this problem because its not so serious as it is irritating all in all if you want some new experience of shooting game that requests some planing patience and cooperation instead of being your own little rambo you definitely should check out arma iii

probably the closest thing that us the general population has towards a realistic military simulatorgame i suggest that you do not buy this if you are expecting a linear fast paced action game like cod or battlefield this is much more indepth then that this is not simply running around 360 no scoping people squad managment and effective communication is necessary there is also something that you cant experience in the said titles above which is longrange combat an example of this is preforming an assault on a basecamp with armor artillery and other assests from varying distances from your own base however this is still a game and should be taken lightly from time to time i suggest learning how to do tricks in the littlebird mh9hummingbird and exploiting the terrible physics this game has multiple different gamemodes and tasks that could be simulated so youll never have the same experience twice pros very realistic great graphics if you can run them interactive environment realisitc vehicals most of the time  cons physics you will hear arma physics referred to multiple times muliplayer optimization very steep learning curve but you will appreciate it over time more of a learn as you play occasional crashing controls will more than likely conflict your normal keyboard setup i suggest using the arma 2 setup overall 1010 even if you dont think this is for you trust me the teamwork involved in this game is beyond amazing the amount of coop ive played counts for 95% of my game time ive met tons of new people from this and theyre like family to me

got the game recently having never played an arma game and although i had heard that the controls were difficult i was willing to spend the time learning them what got me is that as soon as you enter the multiplayer you hit walls upon walls of text that the game doesnt tell you anything abouti understand most of it is usercreated content but that doesnt stop it from being incredibly confusing joining a server and being told little to nothing about what is going on you just know its either altis life or king of the hill etc it kinda makes you think they couldve done with a few tutorial servers with different game modes so new players arent extremely confused from the off well the first time i went in to a multiplayer game in a server about 23rds full the chat channels were completely dead all i heard was what presumably was a fellow noob constantly saying hello there was someone else talking occasionally but the sound quality was so grainy i couldnt make out anything he was saying  i figure everyone is on the teamspeak server as from what id heard everyone uses ts on arma but nowhere in game did it say where the nameaddress of the ts server and when i asked in the sidechat the other lobby members told me to stop using sidechat similar experiences occurred on the few other servers i tried going on as well the game shows a complete lack of effort to help anyone who has never played an arma game before how to play the online and the people playing it seem antisocial and uninterested in helping either judging from some of the reviews the campaign isnt very good either but at least its playable ill probably end up on that for a bit in the hope that one day if i ever manage to get my head around the multiplayer i wont get constantly mowed down and showed up for the complete noob i am at this game overall probably a good game for those new to the arma series if you have a spare 20 odd hours you are willing to put in to figure out the what is going on in the online game modes what addons and mods you will need for the game what ts servers you need to be in what the controls are then you will probably reach a stage where you can enjoy the game but if you dont have that amount of spare time to search the internet for help guides tutorials and server info then you will probably find the game very frustrating not at all noob friendly

i really really wanted to love arma 3 but i just cant deal with it anymore 80 hours ive spent in the game and it just feels like wasted time yes the graphics are vastly improved but that comes with a lot of sacrifices firstly you have to have about fourteen gtx titans to run this game properly i have a pretty decent pc most games at highmax settings yet arma just does not want to play smoothly i get about 30fps in arma 3 and although thats perfectly playable the framerate drops and it is a pain to play ill just ignore the framerate drops i said to myself so what if it drops its a great game but the game consistenly crashes it just happened to me in wasteland right behind someone with top gear and bam arma3exe has stopped working its not like this is an occasional thing either it happens at least once every time i play and dont even get me started on the driving its like trying to wade a kite through custard seriously also the fact theres about 3 ok maybe more guns really annoys me theres about 34 assault rifles and they all perform pretty much the same theres no quirks with each theyre all just bland that goes the same for pretty much every weapon class thats without me mentioning the fact none of them are liscensed or have official names i know its a futuristic world but i much prefered the ak47s pkms m4s etc of arma 2 have i mentioned the fact only one campaign episode has been released its not like arma fans have been waiting for this for years or anything and bohemia take months to release not the campaign but a campaign episode seriously in my opinion arma 2 is a mechanically better smoother and more fun game my advice play arma 2 for another year or so and wait for bohemia to sort their bs out arma 3 me no gusta

i can not in all honesty recommend this game to anyone and heres why  its 32bit  in the most simplest terms this means the game can only use a maximum of 2gb of ram there are other restrictions to this but this is the one that hurts performance the most  multithreading this should have been a priority during development but instead it almost seems like bohemia forgot about this it is poor and extremely bottlenecked resulting in low performance realism  a lot of people go on and on about the realism in vanilla there is only a basic and i mean basic bullet drop system no realistic ballistics whatsoever without the use of mods you could literally be in one of the biggest thunderstorms the game could throw at you with gales rain and all the other lovely things and you will still be able to drop a target at close to a mile away with a precise headshot simply by pointing up a bit there are quite literally dozens of examples of how this game is not realistic heres just a few  vehicle behaviour  is a joke choppers have been updated in the choppers dlc to be more realistic but even then that means you have 2 completely different flight models for vanilla choppers vs vanilla jets obviously they are different one is a chopper the other is a fixed wing jet but heres what i mean choppers now take into account wind speed direction variable gusts as well as reaction forces mostly to do with real world physics and all manner of other things whereas the jets simply dont they feel like they are on rails there is no real skill involded unless dogfighting in flying them ground vehicles are just as bad there was a more realistic driving model in the original grand theft auto and that is the nicest thing i could say about it  low res vs high res players  this admittedly is a multiplayer pvp issue so wont affect pve or sp gameplay but ill try to explain it in pvp if you play pvp you will notice your getting sniped even though your behind a bush or shot through a fence or something similar this is because low res players cant see these details because it is too far away and not yet drawn for them but they can see you this is because the draw distance for a character is permanent and unchangeable it does change but cant be changed by the player without mods whereas the detail draw can be changed through changing settings this is in case you wish to improve performance but this inherently means if you play pvp you have to play with everything turned down just to be on a level playing field not very realistic is it  3rd vs 1st person in pvp multiplayer 3rd person players can see around corners over walls etc whereas 1st person players cant making 1st person in pvp pointless nothing more to say  player animation  this is the thing that really bugs me to the point i have rage quit in the past in what possible universe would a person have to stand still in a firefight just to change weapons there are other animations i detest but that one gets me the most note  this can be fixed with mods  ai behaviour  the ai in this game is a joke and not a funny one they are like headless chickens running around with guns shooting at sounds for example i was playing a game with friends the other night when our pilot was one shotted at over 300m altitude from an ai enemy with a bog standard katiba which is based on a khaybar with its skill setting turned down to 45100 not only was this ridiculous it is also unrealistic i have fired assault weapons irl not a khaybar  unfortunately but i can tell you now there is no way in the entirety of the road to hell could you possibly one shot a pilot in a chopper in the sky flying over 300m at over 80mph with any kind of assault weapon only with a powerful rifle would you even have a chance and even then the shot must be spectacular and ideally head on to the chopper what have i learned from this there is no ballistic shielding simulated in vanilla choppers either in its hull which would be around the cockpit and gunner positions or in the cockpit glass and if it is it is in desperate need of an update i simply refuse to mention ai pilots because they are dead i killed them all for their incompetence ok i know by now your sick of me bashing this beloved game but thats the thing i love this game and like many others i have had hours upon hours of fun playing this but i cannot get past the fact that this game is so unpolished and so poorly optimised it really does feel like a badly made console port and i genuinely feel the same anger i had with gta iv way back when the pc version was first released the random lag or crashing in the middle of the action because the game cant cope with whats going on and just cries in the corner while all the other games just point and laugh at it the reason i portray it that way is because it feels like bohemia is dragging its heels and then when it finally has something to give us it overprices it in what is an apparent need for funds which lets be honest makes them look a bit needy  i can understand that though they need money to pay the staff but what i dont understand is why they give us so little for our money compared to the like of the arma 2 dlcs in which we got factions vehicles soldiers weapons and missions all in one dlc package i know the price was higher but for an example arma 3 helicopters dlc you pay now 08052015 is 1099 gbp or $1695 usd i think anyway what your paying for is the privileged honour of being able to pilot 2 helicopters thats it you get everything else for free in an update including the ability to travel in the helicopters well i suppose thats good right wrong basically they tried to tell us this was some kind of great thing they did for us but in actual fact it was so that it didnt split the playerbase basically covering themselves from flaming on that aspect but i suppose that means most of the people that bought it are going to be decent pilots not all but most yes well yes actually most of the pilots i have flown with flying the dlc choppers are good probably about 70% of time but that means all the really bad pilots vive had in the past all got better at flying or does this mean only the people who bought the dlc were the really good pilots with a few people with spare cash thrown in but if this is the case then bohemia managed to miss out on a massive cash injection by not putting more choppers into the pack maybe even a custom air force faction for nato and csat its only retexturing some uniforms and some code its hardly rocket science it takes time sure but still 2 choppers its an insult i just downloaded a mod which gave me 4 choppers and 7 planes with a custom faction uniforms soldiers equipment etc it took all of 40 seconds to download and hey guess what i didnt spend a penny ok this got way too long way too fast so here conclusion is this i want to recommend this game because i have had a lot of good memories with it and im sure others will like it as well but at the same time i cannot recommend this game for all its flaws if your willing to put serious time into modding this game then yes buy it but as i said i cant recommend this because of it flaws and because of the company behind it i have lost faith in it and cant recommend you buy this to settle confusion my pc  amd fx 8350 black edition 8 core socket am3 40ghz 16mb  4gb

if you want to play a heavy realistic and enyoing game then i clearly recommend you to play this the gameplay itself has its own spirit that makes the arma franchise unique the ingame controls may be a little but confusing but you get used to it clearly recommended to play this with friends and the gamemodes are awesome there is altis life wich is a roleplaying gamemode wasteland wich is like dayz with no zombies innit and ofcourse there is tons of mods in the internet so i suggest you give arma 3 a try

great game bad optimization so if you have a low spec pc this game may run slow and have low fps the gameplay is great the vehicles and aircraft are great fun and are easy to drive  handle but there is not many guns and vechicles within this game the guns handle well and realistic they also look great and the game has nice animation the new stances are amazing and really allow you to take cover not matter what the object is you are taking cover behind over all fun game lots of gamemodes online to play single player is ok but do not recommend getting this game for single player there is also some mods online which change the game quite a bit i do recommend getting this game

if youve looked at this on the steam shelf and even been slightly interested buy it apart from the gorgeous graphics and highly detailed soldiers weapons vehicles and environments it gives you an experience like no other shooter best of all it uses the steam workshop which means you can very easily download ingame scenarios that other players have made this offers an eternal level of replayability

dontevenbother not picking up this game this game has changed my life completely im now sober 6 months i know still keeping my fingers crossed because of my relapse last year and im also off heroin last year was a difficult year for me i was diagnosed with testicular cancer something about the way i rest my laptop on my left testicle that managed to cause internal bleeding ever since i picked up arma 3 6 months ago ive stopped resting my laptop on my testicles instead ive been resting my testicles on my laptop i thank the developers of this game for creating a masterpiece and creating a beacon of hope for when i needed it the most

the greatest mil sim possibly fps of all time ive been playing arma since operation flashpoint renamed armed assault [arma] cold war conflict] ive always loved the concept of a sandbox game do whatever you want your game play is literally limited to your imagination we all know bis has this aspect of the arma series in spades but the military realism and breath of immersion with a3 is unreal you step in the game and you actually feel yourself move within the environment thanks to the pysx engine when you drive a vehicle the tactile feeling of traversing the terrain is like no other game out there weapons dont just aim themselves if you miss your target down range which you will its your own fault working in squads and managing situation awareness is crucial to your survival and youll find plenty of players who want that next level realsim the lush graphics and visuals are by far the most advanced of all current fpss finally the best improvement imo is the modified stance system no longer do you have to clumsily stick to a wall to have cover or just choose between getting shot or going prone and not being able to shoot with this new mechanic you can adjust your position in very specific ways to have sights down range over any variety of cover by and large this is the greatest experience ive had in video games in a long time arma 3 is only still in beta right now and its still the most compelling and in depth video game ive ever played 10001000

the first couple days can be really painful for most of the people arma 3 is kinda hard to understand its not for everyone especially not for bfcod lovers the maps are really great graphics are awesome same as the audio this game is made really good not as arma 2 arma 2 is lagging a lot has a lot of fps drops playing arma 2 on 1920x1080 midlow and i have only 3060 fps arma 3 on 1920x1080 ultra highhigh 80 fps  half of arma 3 players cant kill a standing player so the combat is pretty easy id say the game is pretty expensive but its definitely worth the money 1010

this game is the god of all military games you can not have a better military game with as much realism as this the graphics are also amazing once your done with singleplayer you can explore the vast amount of gamemodes in multiplayer from zombies mods too sandboxes and even bonus campaigns this game truly has it all

been playing since the beginning of the alpha and this game has stayed so unique this game is a genre on its own nothing else out there like it the community surrounding this game makes it all that much better and the modding community is so big this game is heavily moddable which gives the community the tools they need to create anything there is no limits this is also one of the more hardcore fps games out there its easy to get used to but hard to get good at and you cant do anything without a good team all this game requires is patience and the ability to work with other people in order for me to fully explain how awesome this game is id be sitting here all day typing this review out 1010 will never quit playing

arma 3 makes me feel like im actually a soldier carrying out objectives and operations like a soldier too instead of this hyperactive nonsensual chaos that is call of duty and battlefield if youre a fan of arma or just hardcore games in general i seriously recommend this bohemia once again succeeds at delivering improved ai and voice acting stunning graphics and whole new arsenal of semifuturistic guns gadgets and vehicles that are sure to impress step into a world where one shot is all that is needed where teamwork truly is important

this game is so much fun dont buy if you have below a dual core though you wont be able to run it well at all i have a dual core and play it fine though no lag or anything this game is as close as it gets to real life and actually required skill planning and patience unlike any other fps on the market if you are looking for the best fpsmilitary simulator look no further youve found it its arma 3 1110 great game

a very nice game the atmosphere im not talking about mods im talking about the vanilla game is almost the same as in arma 2 at first the game feels dull almost boring youre bored as to why nothing happens and everything seems so slow but once you get fired upon or get targeted by enemy artillery fire and see several squadmates around you bite the dust as you barely survived an artillery shell that injured your legs to a point where you cant run anymore  the game becomes extremely intense your squad has been hit by artillery and you are among one of the few who kind of survived that attack but your legs are injured and the next medic is 1 kilometer away from the ao so you try to stay alive and slowly walk or crawl back to the military outpost in hopes of getting back to the evac zone in time before the transport chopper flys off or the enemy decides to run a couple of bullets through the rest of your body so you hump back towards the military outpost that you and your team used to advance from because you know youre going to survive once you get there as there are many teammates and the evac zone is also back there as you slowly make your way through the open field trying to stay as low as you can crawling behind bushes  you suddenly hear shots from the distance and know that the enemies are advancing towards the evac zone and therefore towards you you try to make your way as fast as possible when you read your teamchat talking about the evac chopper that is already on its way and almost there and youre still 650 meters away and as if that wasnt enough of an issue the enemies have spotted and are now starting to fire at you as well and as you keep crawling towards the evac zone and notice more and more shots hitting the ground very close to you you know that youre probably not going to make it and suddenly you hear a sniper firing from the evac zone down towards your position he shoots one enemy rifleman after another and suddenly the teamchat indicates that the evac area is clear and that the pilot is going to wait for you you stand up and try to not make your teammates wait too long for you while feeling happy about having survived such a counterattack without having to click on respawn this actually happened to me once 1010 would buy again

arma 3 is one of the most versatile milsim games out there the support from the developers alone puts this game at the top of any milsim list the vanilla ai are pretty overpowered for what they do they can get nonstop headshots from 600m away but a couple ai mods and they react much more realistically coming from arma2 this is game a huge improvement the addition of physx adds a lot to gameplay overall im very impressed with the game add the developer modding support and this game is the top of my list

hey guys and girls  okeylets get started 1should i buy this game > well it depends first of all let my say some positive aspects of arma 3 arma 3 is an amazing game with amazing graphics and gameplay there are 2 real maps a big one and a ultra big one dude so big you wont belive it you have to walk about 2h [real time] to get from the wn to senot joking 3 campaigns an editor mode where you can built your own mission and the fantastic multiplayer but listen up if you are a cod fan his game is not for you this game is not about hit and run or just shoot shoot and shootlike almost every cod no no no this game is about teamplay it is a war simulator it makes more fun to do some patrol than the combat itself you can play it only with 100 pleople and with vehicles like tanks jets choppers submarines and so on it is a game that never gets bored while playing with friends and always gives you the real combat feeling but now to the negative omg if you dont have a really really good computer that means a over 700 dollar pc you probably wont be able to play arma 3 please note without lagging and properlytrust me i have an i7 12 gb ram and a gtx nvidia 560 and i almost manage it to play it with no lagging at 70 fps on standart settings on high nozt joking at 40 but it feels laggy you will have a huge fps drop 30 in multiplayer and this is eats away your frames so on overallis it worth to buy this game > i can tell you yes it is good job to the developers really nice game i always fancy playing it and it is a unique game my ration 810 2 only due to the fps issues

let me start by saying that i have had fun with this game as you can see by my playtime but that playtime has been plagued by bugs glitches low fps and a constant feeling of why didnt they in the back of my mind i never got into arma 2 because of its fps problems netcode clunky and unintuitive controls and just bad game design arma 3 has fixed none of these problems  first off the performance the real virtuality engine is an engine from the ing 18th century being held together with duct tape and  server performance still affects client performance this is a joke if the server gets overloaded you are going to be looking at a framerate in the low 20s this is why performance is so inconsistent  the player controller is the same one from arma 2 this  controller cannot play more than two animations at once on the legs and the torso full body animations like switching weapons require the player to stop moving because of this again this is a joke animations are also very stiff and crappy looking  same old bugs and glitches from arma 2 that were never fixed you can lean into walls and see through them much worse if youre using 3rd person grass pops in right in front of your eyes objects like rocks are incredibly glitchy and can randomly kill you vehicle physics are almost nonexistent and you will explode from the smallest crash voip is incredibly laggy and sounds like its coming out of a 90s phone  game is supposed to use dx11 when in reality it still uses mostly dx9 one example is shadows arma 3 still uses  stencil shadows instead of soft shadows even on max settings aside from that visually the game is nothing special it has nice sunsets and a decent draw distance but up close its quite ugly low res textures are a problem  the game is billed as a military sandbox by bohemia and a military simulation by pc gamer but ing nobody plays it as one 99% of servers are gamemodes like wasteland epoch and altis life gamemodes more suited to grand theft auto than a game with as much potential as arma 3 worse still bohemia has done nothing to prevent this aside from adding that useless end game gamemode that nobody plays i was lucky enough to find a server that plays the game as the combined arms game its supposed to be and i played a lot on that server but the fps was so bad 25 that i eventually stopped playing  stemming from the issue above tactical pvp just isnt a thing there is some tactical pve which i have enjoyed playing but if you ever wanted to shoot at another player instead of those terminator bots that can snipe you between the eyes from 2km away with a 45 youre out of luck  3rd person everyone uses it or rather abuses it its impossible to get the drop on someone in cqc because hes looking at you from around the corner using 3rd person dont play it you might say thats impossible because i have never seen a public server with it disabled dont use it you might say again impossible because that guy looking over the wall at me will shoot me when i come around the corner unless i use 3rd person to look over the wall too  updates are a farce games been out for 2 years and only now were getting bipods really the dlc is another joke 30 euro for two helicopters and a couple of guns wow bohemia what a ing deal  never half two things whole one thing  ron swanson driving physics are completely broken if you go anywhere that isnt a flat surface plane mechanics are pickupandplay guns sound like crap and basic stuff like keeping a round chambered doesnt happen the only saving grace is the combined arms aspect but alone theyre terrible to play im going to stop here because i could go on all day about how  this game is and what it could have been if the devs cared at all i never write long reviews but how much i love the concept of this game and how awful the execution is made me this game is not worth 50 euro maybe 20 at best the only good things here are the insanely huge maps and moddability of the game the only reason this game is popular is because there is no other game like it

this game is a huge improvement over arma 2 in terms of the engine and its looks graphically the game works much better than the second installment of the series and is much easier to use but the games setting has completely ruined it for me i really dont appreciate what bohemia did moving the setting to 20342035 i really loved the setting of 1990early 2000s arma 2 provided and i dont feel that arma 3 provides a very immersive feel for me anyways im sure there are mods to change the game for the more cold war feel but i havnt found many that are what i want
not recommended
before i purchased arma 3 i played arma 2 and arma 2 oa and before that arma cold war assault i didnt really want to switch to arma 3 becuase i heard a lot of bad things about it but that was when it was in alpha and a little bit after it was out of alpha i finally caved in and bought it which i dont regret sure its arma so there is a few glitches and a wierd physics engine but arma is prabably the best military infantry simulator i have played now my really only problem with arma 3 is that the vanilla game only has futuristic weapons like everything thats a prototype or still in development know is in arma but just having a few mods can correct that like rhs alive and allinarma so i do highly recommend this game to anyone that likes milsims or just likes the arma series in general
recommended
to be on point before purchasing arma 3 i read about it on forums and on steam reviews indeed many said that at the moment arma 3 is just not finished and it is not worth buying and playing as it is i really liked the game idea and thought that it cant be that bad so i purchased it boy i was in for a big surprise and i am not talking only about the poor optimization of the game the whole game feels weird laggy and just plain wrong the controls are a mess for example to fly with a joystick you have to set all the actions manually at least in my case graphics wise i might get older but the whole image seems to be blurry and out of sync maybe the biggest grief is with super human ai enemies somehow they can see you even in the darkest and deepest forest while there is no way you can see them yet alone shoot them i am sory to say i regret the purchase and would not advise anyone to try the game in the current state i would say in a year or so maybe but not now in case you want to help out the developer and support the game by all means purchase the game now play it later  do not get me wrong the idea is super the complexity is there visual apeal is there but it needs a lot of polish to be playable i would like to state for the record that i couldnt get myself to play it for more than one hour maybe if i would have spent more time i guess a lot more in the game i would have liked it more just for reference i7 2600k @ 44 ghz nvidia gtx 580 15 gb ram 16 gb ram @ 1600 mhz cas 8 samsung evo ssd  4050 fps in sp this is just my personal opinion and experience of the game take it with a grain of salt over and out

the most accessible game in the series this is bohemia interactives magnus opus and my favourite instalment since the days of operation flashpoint now arma cwc and its incredible addons the technological leap is huge and the possibilities for the end user are limitless catering to any taste with a very active modding community to boot potentially taking it far beyond a milsim i have owned this game since the alpha phase and has been worth every penny its never been perfect but the development team are constantly striving to make it so one of the greatest titles ive had the pleasure of owning on the pc for many years

i cannot say enough about this game it is my current favorite shootercombine arms game graphics and scale of the maps are just insane this is one of the last games around that is built for modders and the quality and quantity of community made missions assets and features is mind blowing my only complaint are the performance issues of running the game but its ok for the most part give it a try you will love it

a wonderful game to loose yourself in it for hours it has a kinda big learning curve but its acctually worth going threw it i enjoy myself in the multiplayer a lot and love the challange of battleing other gamers while doing missions addons such as the tfr jsrs or the natospeznas weapons make it to a real nice warfare simulation it requires a good cpu and gpu but all in all its a nice game to play and i am happy i purchased it

if you like games with crappy controls bad gameplay and no incentive to do anything then this is the game for you i played for a few hours and 50% of my time was spent walking around the woods getting blown up by random mines that i could not find or avoid it seemed like any direction i walked in i would just explode and when i managed to get past that ai that were out of my guns range just took potshots at me till i died and to top it all off the game mechanics are only briefly explained and not very well i will never play this game again i play games to relax and have fun not to die 50 times just to walk to an objective bottom line is if you want to play a fun entertaining game this is not for you but if your really into playing for 5 hours to just to walk to meet up with people by all means this game will be in your top 10

terrible game developers highly ignored optimizing and fixing bugs in the game almost unplayable on multiplayer because of the lack of hit detection sky rocketing desync and minimal power usage resulting in less than 20 fps at times keep in mind i have a $1200 rig now for the good the concept and basic features of the game are wonderful if the developers worked out the kinks involved with the networkingperformance aspect of the game it would be a five star game that is the only reason i do not recommend it fix the bugs and its a wonderful game as of right now it is unplayable

went in to the game based on the reviews the only good part of it is the team capture mode which makes the game sort of like a real life war everything else is a waste of your timelife game is infested with little boys who havent even hit puberty and will bad mouth you all day half the servers are terribly laggy and the game is still very buggy ie moving next to a wall and getting ported through walking through a glass window and getting stuck etc etc personally i feel the game was a complete waste of my money as there are many other games in this genre that do it much better and are much more worth your time since more then half the game you will legit spend driving to nowhere land just to get a gunmoney only to come back and get hit once and die i do not recommend this game to anyone as it should be free because that is all it is worth

this could have been a great game the problem is the developers of the engine are stuck in the 1990s and made an engine that dont take advantage of your gpu with an i7 2600 and gtx 780 i have between 2030 fps and i have that on absolutely maxed out settings as well as the lowest possible there is only one reason to even consider this game and its for the great mod community but overall this company does not deserve any of your money

ok time for me to get around to this at first coming from arma 2 vet it was quite confusing to play seeing how control are tad bit different however i quickly learned it was for good you no longer need to scroll and select action menu for simple item you can just enter boxes open door pick up item just one click away for complicated stuff action menu is there for you but remmeber do use mousewheel select or youll shoot instead haha also gears are now inventory so thats i not g because g will drop a nade and kill you now for the game i personally disliked the future theme it had going on however thankful for armaholic and super easy new mod system i was able to mod the game back to current year not 2035 i recommend getting a faction addon such as canadian force or us infantry with nato  spetsnaz weapon pack they will make the game more better now i am making scenario like madman and playing it love how you can customize weapon love how you can select gears and helmet to use grass helmet for the win vanilla 410 with mods 2010 also you dont need to wear pant or condom to play this

if you are considering buying arma 3 for the multiplayer there are a few things you should know about the multiplayer there are several modes of multiplayer theres life which is like an role playing type scenario theres wasteland which is like dayz but without zombies theres also the several military combat oriented multiplayer modes multiplayer can be rewarding but the arma community is extremely diverse in the way people play their game there are some casual players but you will also encounter real military simulation enthusists if you like to have fun i suggest you approach the latter group with some degree of caution theyre not all bad but i have run into some that have units armas term for clans that do uniform inspections boring training and in one case would not admit women to their unit because it wasnt realistic just remember if youre not having fun then it isnt worth your time and you should immediately ditch those people that are being such a drag other then that the multiplayer can get quite laggy but you can usually find another server to play on if thats the case and bring a book because you can expect a lot of downtime in some modes of multiplayer the game itself is a bit buggy it can break your immersion at times but when it really counts in firefights it rarely glitches out on me this is a cpu intensive game if you have a soso processor but a good video card you may have to do some tweeks to make the game run in a satisfactory manner overall i enjoy it a bunch theres a lot to learn and im quite happy with the game

best game ever if you like battlefield but hate it for the things youll absolutely enjoy this game

highly recommended great graphics epic gameplay endless options for multiplayer modes though cti and tdm are my favorite i fell in love with this game it simply rocks though one should be aware this is nothing like the bf series etc you either love or hate arma as simple as that if you like games like aa3 and red orchestra etc chances are you will absolutley love arma all in all give it a try if its on a steam sale or if once of your friends already got it

the arma series has always been more of a simulator than a video game as such it is not easy to get into there are tons of keybinds the movement systems feels wonky due to being so tied to the animation system and confrontations seem more a test of patience rather than reflex engagements usually at 100 meters or more it also doesnt help that the ai can be incredibly incredibly stupid despite this the series has garnered a strong following that has created a community of serious players that is hard to find anywhere else now comes arma 3 arma 3 is not a fundamentally different game but the developers have learned from the past and they have given this iteration a sense of polish that makes it refreshing to this jaded arma fan and very enticing to those curious about the series but otherwise intimidated by arma 2 and 1 first off arma 3 looks stunning the island is modeled after a real mediterranean island and it shows there is a strong sense of authenticity as you walk run fly and fight through the landscape it is worth plopping down a unit in the editor and just walking around absorbing the sights the vastly improved lighting engine really adds to the entire experience lighthouses illuminate the world convincingly and fires cast an impressive glow what makes the game feel so much better is the improved controls no longer do you move like a drunken mudcrab as one of my friends so succinctly said indeed the past games always made movement a struggle with its reverse mouse acceleration clumsy walking and running and strange deadzonefree aim mechanic which a lot of arma fans swear by but i personally detest now with arma3 the mouse is no longer hampered by that pesky reverse acceleration movement is more fluid with some nice little touches such as tactical pace and it introduces a fantastic modifier system that lets you pop up and down left and right for each stance its a simple addition but adds so much to the combat especially in a world where no cover is a perfect chest high wall the game also comes with a powerful editor while it is extremely daunting even the most passing user can make some interesting scenarios and for those who really want to learn there are tools that will let you decompile other peoples missions to see how they do things its very much worth exploring especially if you enjoy thinking of tactical what if situations what is most impressive is that my experiences with arma 3 so far have only been in alpha despite this it runs and plays great and things can only get better from here already with the second update performance and stability has increased tremendously as an alpha i am already recommending this game highly honestly if you are tired of the constant closed quarter combat corridor shooters like call of duty and if battlefield 3 just doesnt seem real enough for you check out arma 3 it just might scratch that itch of yours

910 a fantastic game from bohemia interactive honestly the only thing lacking is some real weaponry used today it seems a tiny bit too fictional but mods can sort that 
recommended
so this is one of my favourite games of all times since arma 1 and cnc commanders was released people are complaining about the missing campaigns being impatient and just douching all over the place because its not a cod this game is just like the best milsimulator ive ever played right after arma 2 oa bohemnia interactive did a very fine job it has bullet penetration the soldiers are highly customizable and damn it is even supporting mods and encouraging people to create stuff if you want a real multiplayer and fps capable game please buy this its just amazing graphics and gameplay is outstanding arma 2 needed an additional mod called ace this game here does not even need any more realism mods because it is realism itself worth the money fun to play 9510 acekiller
recommended
overall the game is pretty good i myself can say that i am somewhat pleased with it the map is huge and very fun to explore its just with a 200 square kilometer map you would have more then just 14 air vehicles maybe more planes and helicopter they did mention they will be releasing new dlc for the game thank god i bought this when it was in alpha otherwise i wouldnt be buying all that dlc bohemia in my opinion needs to step up their game and realise there is more to please then just the general european public

if call of duty is a hollywood military porn movie and battlefield is the docudrama on military subjects arma is the trip down to the local military base spending time on the range and on the obstacle course and learning the real deal from the real people its about as close as you can get without signing up arma 3 is a sandbox infantry simulator with a focus on authenticity set in a nearfuture ficticious scenario of 2035 wherein nato is but a shadow of its former aka currentday self and a new enemy of iranian origin begins a localized takeover of a small collection of islands in the agean sea leading to a potential flashpoint of a wider war between natoallied nations near the medittereanean and the iranianled csat forces with greekbased freedom fighters and the greek army caught inbetween there is a large focus stemming from 4 games prior not including expansions on realism and not the hollywood realism that call of duty or battlefield would throw at you this game has proper modelling of terminal ballistics range ballistics drop penetration deflection windage proper modelling of the kilometers of distances youll oftentimes have to travel proper weapons vehicles and equipment modelling and mechanics and proper tactics and strategy implementation how proper well the seminal game of the series let alone this infantry simulator genre was the penultimate operation flashpoint of 2001 now named arma cold war assault which led to the development of the virtual battlespace 1 and 2 interactive training simulator aids that are currently being used by world militaries around the world alongside the next games in the series with the new name armed assault or arma whilst there is a singleplayer campaign of due note and one that is highly recommendable to newcomers to the series as the campaign since arma 1 has always been structured to deliver a solid singleplayer experience at the same time introduce and teach the fundamental mechanics of the game the real focus of the game is in its sandbox nature allowing a very fanatic and vibrant community to create missions of all kinds oftentimes with a multiplayer bent for the game many of these missions are in the steam workshop a first for the series the multiplayer aspect of this game is extensive and ranges from straightup hardcore simulation fanatics exercising proper military procedures tactics and actions to gtalike life servers wasteland read dayz in arma and everything in between insurgency and dominationinvade&annex in fact many of the aformentioned gameplay types are all communityborn with the different communities that play arma oftentimes having vastly different variants of each type with many having a lot of bleedover into each other or being a singular experience on their own ones multiplayer experiences are oftentimes directly tied to the quality of the people that share the same experience with you and armas many communities are a notch above the expected grade with all kinds from laidback to straightup oftentimes with people who are former and even current serving military you wont feel alone if you look around and the people you will find are of all kinds many for the better this game is highly recommended to those who feel that battlefield is not a solid enough experience and want to get deeper into the mindset of a soldier in a more authentic worldspace and want to see how and why military tactics of today work they way they work from closequarters battle cqb in room clearing to urban mout combat and open areas to infantry  mechanized  armor  air interplay and supports

if you love to simulate and experience large scale combat of any type then you should own this right now the ability to create literally any scenario that your mind can imagine using the mission editor which is like photoshop but for creating vile horrific wars instead of pretty pictures  dont try to compare arma to any other fps this isnt just a game it is a lesson it will teach you how to understand ballistics and engage targets at long range using scopes correctly you will learn how to read a topographical map & compass properly it will make you understand the importance of team work but most importantly you will get to experience shooting the living fu@k out of all your friends  with trackir head tracking  a good sound mod this really is the ultimate milsim ive been waiting for a game like this ever since i used to play blitz on my commodore vic20 lol just gets better and better everyone needs this

i had to add some more things to this review as i started to appreciate it even more after some time spent in the game both playing and creating content i tend to get rambly so this is going to be a tldr version for you if you dont like reading textwalls its just awesome very immersive and deep rewarding satisfying milsim experience 1st episode of campaign took me 4 hours of gameplay on its own both multiplayer and singleplayer are great along with the communitymade content available via workshop looks beautiful on graphics cranked up to ultra  i was even able to set my sampling to 150% without any performance loss after the recent updates and i have to say  the graphics are phenomenal second and third episodes of campaign were good as well added up towards a complete story which gave me some backup on games plot and situation on altis in 2035 zeus is very exciting but it takes some practice and experience to provide players with fun time fatigue & weapon inertia updates added a lot of depth to shooting now there is rotorlib to come along with shooting from vehicles and thats going to change helo flying entirely see what im doing here im proving you the devs constantly make this game better it evolves within your eyes and every day you play it you find something new about it for example  recently i found out the angular size of the moon is actually correct the night sky mapping is accurate and you can navigate using the northern star and measure the distance using your compass and mils on it like in real life enough of this rambling i have to say its breathtakingly good the possibilities it offers the dev team which continues to add deepness to it some people dont like the recent updates but for me these updates just build up more realism and add to overall greatness and the team takes feedback into account having really good policies both on dlcs and on new content put into the game things you can do modding it are pretty crazy ill give you an example for better understanding  the game itself in vanilla version features pretty complex ballistic mechanics it also features exhaust pipe particle effect of hot air what has one to do with another you might ask well a mod author took the first one added much more deepness to create accurate ballistic simulation and even used the particle effect ive mentioned earlier to simulate bullet trace effect in highpower optics yup you can do anything you want with this game

arma 3 beautifully continues the legacy of the arma franchise at no point in this game did i not stop to take in where i was altis and stratis the two maps are stunning the main map altis is very large and just that perspective alone is astounding if you are playing arma for the first time i highly recommend playing around with the editor and single player before delving in online this is not a pick up and play type of game there are aspects that take some time to get accustomed to and you will not get it your first time playing i cannot wait to see what modders have to offer in the coming months and years to make this game even better

v good this game is very good becuase i think its 100% gagster and its very good you can play many games on the game and its very good becuase of this i would add this game stands out for not being too arcade and this attributes to its very goodness and some of my friends play they say its very good i would recommend this to those looking for a very good game and a very good time especially if you have a very good group of friends to play some good organised very good games theres many good roles to play some more good than others and some are the most good thank
recommended
arma 3 like all the rest of the series will only offer what you put into it  after all its not really a game is it try the editor and learn what you are capable of doing in arma then apply that knowledge according to what you want to see  for me  personally id preffer life like realism and my reward  is what ive learned not to do in a real situation  how will you play arma  dont let my arma online xp fool you i have been scripting in arma since moby  was a minnow  i still dont know what its capable of  remember a simple quotation mark being misplaced can make you frusterated and trying for minutes or even hours to end the script you knew only a few months ago  8  ive been there  example alive nearestobject [obj1 house] < this took me 25 min to figure out that i was not putting an exclamation mark in beginning  it tells weather or not the obj is alive or not  in this case it was not and i needed to represent that  you see  simple but it can cause discreppancy with the whole scipt not understanding what you want  so read over it always  and yes i felt stupid when i finally got it right but that is how it works welcome to arma logic  i recommend arma 3 and all the rest to anyone bored with cod or battlefield or counterstrike or what ever you need a break from  peace out   rendersilent

as you can see from this review i have almost 500 hours in the game so if youre looking for someone who knows it trust me arma 3 is a military simulator which means that you arent getting the constant grinding freeforall match ups you find in fps games like call of duty or battlefield it also doesnt get much more realistic than this but in terms of the actual game there are a plethora of things to do there are altis life rpg servers which allow you to play the way you want within certain constraints of course there are wasteland servers as well which is essentially a giant battlefield for you to play in also if you get a group of people you can run some pretty awesome missions not to mention have a blast with the zeus mode which allows a player to become a game master and run a mission dynamically yes there are bugs driving full force with a truck into a tank probably wouldnt cause it to blow up for example rocks walls and even chickenwire fences can disable plenty of vehicles and sometimes the actual mechanics are pretty slow but the major bugs that you find are usually because of some faulty coding in a server you play on such as dropping a truck from a helicopter only to have it disappear the next instant or fling back up and blow you out of the sky regardless of these the actual content of arma 3 is massive and the situations you can create get to be incredibly intense the $5999 price tag on this game shouldnt stop you from buying it because it is worth every penny if you want to find some examples of people who play this game and have a great time you can find a ton of videos on youtube that may help you in your decision to buy it lastly i mentioned before that this is not a call of duty or battlefield game they are all there own and you may think that this game is too slowpaced if you are looking for that runandgun format of a game but whileplaying this game you find yourself in many different situations whether it be sneaking up to a compound while trying to avoid any contact laserdesignating a target for airsupport to pulverize or peaking around and pieing corners in a cqb scenario you will find thousands of these unique situations which make this game worthwhile to nearly every fan of fpss and milsims alike

this game has a ton of potential im a fan of the of the arma series and bohemia interactive as a compnany i bought arma 3 back when it was in early access as an alpha back then bohemia was releasing regular updates that included in game content ive become very skeptical of steam early acess titles but i trusted bohemia interactive as a company i have bought from before and have been happy with my purchases and received many hours of enjoyment from their previous titles arma 2 and carrier command to name a few arma 3 eventually hit beta and later final release after the finalized product was increased in price the in game content soon stopped flowing then the karts dlc was released i thought oh this is just some fun thing the devs made some weekend i passed on it as it had a kind of high price tag for just a minigame calibre addon now the helicopter dlc came out it costs around 16 bucks with these helicopters came new game mechanics you can now tow vehicles via one of the dlc helicopters keep in mind arma is a game that has an active community of modders scripters programmers mappers and artists creating new content every week thats not to say arma 2 didnt have its share of dlc however for comparable prices you got a new singleplayer campaign a few scenarios and an array of vehicles opposed to just two this is the direction i dont like to see arma go when i bought the pmc dlc for arma2 it felt worth it i got more hours of gameplay by myself and singleplayer and many more options for transport and weaponry in multiplayer the arma3 dlc seems unfair the two combined are offered for a reduced price with both dlcs around 25 dollars you get three vehicles a kart and two helicopters a few outfits and a starter pistol on top of that this game requires pretty fancy hardware to run above a steady 30 frames ive found that this a very processor intensive game i recently went from an i3 processor to and i7 and now make 40 frames pretty steadily on very high or ultra however when flying or otherwise moving fast i still experience some heavy frame drops these dont make the game unplayable by any means but they do happen somewhat frequently usually when flying over large villages with lots of models namely kavala for cas pilots youre almost always flying very low to the ground and very fast the added frame drops increase the challenge of flying cas in urban areas now for people who are using lower end processors youll find looking at a village even not directly through terrain or a building will drop your frames by atleast five for people controlling zeus youll find that lag increases very quickly for your players the more things you put onto the battlefield it becomes apparant a lot sooner than youd expect for a game on the scale of arma 3 speaking of scale a word often used when describing the main map altis altis has a huge perfomance difference comparatively to other maps now obviously the bigger something is the more intensive it is to render i never noticed differences in performances from chernarus to takistan to namalsk to zargabad to utes on arma 2 granted altis is a lot more urban than takistan for instance and to be honest id rather play takistan if i can go anywhere on it ive been on insurgency servers where going to kavala is against the rules because spawning ai in there increases lag to a huge degree being a finished game arma 3 feels a bit empty on the side of vehicles and weapons there are tons of outfits but im pretty sure theres less than 20 guns not counting variants for a game as large as arma youd think there would be a large array of weapons similar to arma2 aside from that being injured and out of breath really kills your aim it doesnt really feel right to me but i can live with it also using scroll wheel as an action menu is still awkward as hell but you get used to it again i can live with it thats my gripe with arma 3 right now heres what i like otherwise arma 3 has great potential the zeus gamemode is innovation ive been looking for in gaming for a long time it allows someone to take the role of a dungeon master and create the story of the mission as it proceeds with that it is tricky to befind a good zeus once you can make a challenging but not impossible mission for your friends it is a blast for everyone its even fun to mess around by yourself as zeus you can create your own missions and since the ai is good its still challenging i love zeus and hope to see similar concepts in other games in the future flying is very tight flying is as near perfect as it gets for me i am very happy with the flying system in this game i have not tried the advanced flying mode yet but i imagine bohemia put the same care and attention into it as the now standard default mode the land vehicles turning radiuses seem huge but they are military vehicles the singleplayer story is a lot more intuitive and better paced than arma 2 i have not beat it yet but there have been many moments i have enjoyed it is set up in a three part act much like a movie the middle being climaxdilema the first act is rather short other than that so far the campaign is much more engaging than arma2 the community for arma if youre not aware is terrific i love being able browse for addons other users created this allows units to personalize their gear and vehicles to better suit their playstyle navy marines airforce etc there are tons of mods that make the game so much more involving and immersive if you get this game id say its a must to download a few mods i know i said the scale is too big above but if theres some things arma does right one of them is scale when your on altis or chernarus if you want something that runs better you feel like youre in huge area and there could be fighting ten kilometers from where youre fighting because of this everything takes time getting a tank to a battlefield to tip the balance of the fight is a hard choice to make because that fight could be lost by the time the tank gets there gunplay and movement are silky smooth however balistics seems a bit off some enemies seem to just absorb bullets sometimes bohemia included modified stances so you dont have to download a mod the modified movements are very useful  some things i dont like that arent bohemias fault servers feel pretty empty at the time im gaming and takes a while to find a good operation you can no longer host a forward private server for your friends due to the gamespy closing steam took over i dont know if theyll bring it back but that was definitely part of the reason i got into arma it was very easy to pick up and do a mission with a couple of buds too many altis life servers  all in all i think arma 3s path will change the community got pretty upset over the helicopter dlc and with good reasons i like this game i still play it today is it worth fifty or sixty dollars probably not right now however this game isnt by any means bad and if you enjoy a more simulator feel when playing a first person shooter i would say that this would be a pretty good game to get bohemia i hope you gain my trust back sorry for any typos wrote this late at night

i love the arma series to death i have logged well over 1000 hours on arma 2 but it does have some drawbacks and bugs that can get very annoying pros combined operations warfare tanksairinfantry great community with lots of servers rpg lifesector controldomination amazing mods made by the community ingame mission editor huge maps great gun mechanics firing from helicopters sling loading cargo with helicopters a good amount of weapons and vehicles to choose from the developers update a lot cons vehicles randomly blow up sometimes physics can be very dodgy the engine is pretty old 13 years i think very poorly optomized i usually run at about 18 fps and i can run most games on high settings if you dont have at least a highmid range gaming computer dont bother trying to run this all in all for everything thats broken with this game it makes up for it with amazing gameplay especially if you join a group i play with a realism infantry unit that does operations every week and even though i lag i still have an amazing time never have i fealt as immersed in a game as i do when i play arma

this game offers the experience of realism in combat of modern war there are several different types of game play you can do like all miltiplayers this game escalates in fun with more people you cooperate with the community overall is very friendly and willing to help you out if you are lost or stuck in a situation the graphics can look really great if your machine can run it it is both a first person and a third person shooter helis jets to all sorts of ground vehicles are available for use each vehicle comes with their own challenges on operating them i would recommend this game to those who are seeking a real time realistic simulation of what it would be like to fight in the battlefied in modern times many variety of guns are available for use and the maps are gigantic so repetition of landscape is not an issue personally im not the biggest arma 3 fan but this game is a solid 810 in my book

great game with infinite possibilites due to a sandbox world if you plan on buying this game you should also consider getting a high end cpu if you want to play on large multiplayer server

arma 3 is the greatest game ever made i did a 500m crawl to an abandoned radio tower on the top of a hill overlooking a village once my spotter and i got there he began calling out targets as he glassed the town with his binoculars searching for our target a war criminal wearing a black beret and aviators known as the jackal once we found our mark we compared him to our notes and the descriptions matched i noted his location and then marked a right triangle on our map finding that i was 320m north and 340m west of his position the hypotenuse of the triangle was 467m our distance then accounting for a 160m height differential between the target and i our actual distance was 493m due to a slight northern wind of about 5kph i adjusted my shot slightly to the right i took the shot striking the target in the right shoulder killing him instantly i had to use geometry and trig to play a video game i approve 100%

this a great game if you liked arma 2 you will love this game

a really nice game if you want to play a realistic tactic shooter arma 3 is the way to go the best thing about arma 3 is creating your mission and almost create any sore of gamemode to be played by yourself or with someone else of maybe even a server one of the best gamemodes everyone shuold try if you get the game is atlis life which is a roleplay gamemode i played over 1000 hours plus of it and that show how much i love this game most of the time i would be playing with my mates or people i meet in game i would recommend to play this game with at least one friend

initially i bought this game because i wanted to play wasteland or something coming from arma 2 this was back in alpha it sucked  and i left the game to collect dust for a long time then one day when it finally got released a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer and due to one of the latest updates being zeus it has made gaming to a whole new level since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named stdelta its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming live long and drop the the floor and do the dinosaur hash

this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things having done both military service and picked up milsim airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality there are experiences you will have in arma 3 that can not be had in cod or bf experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release one that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower i was squad leader of 8 or so ais as we approached the comms tower and i told my men to go stealth no firing unless fired upon we moved slowly taking advantage of terrain keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and i spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower there i positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as i had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower i considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position but a firefight is always a risk and these ai had been around for a few missions and i had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly i might get hit and killed as i considered how i would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern i realised the tower is unguarded and i had an opportunity to do something i had not considered i got up and ran as fast as i could towards the tower all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head i kept scanning as i ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols after what seemed like far too long i reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention i turned around and made my way back as i closed on my men i started ordering them to fall back hope growing that i might get out of this alive falling back to about 400 meters i finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to command i had done it i had pulled off the perfect mission not a shot fired and all under my command back alive that is what this game is about

oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter as it is so so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning the gameplay is excellent the mechanics are solid and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series as i was may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fpsshooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief brutal and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no minimaps no enemy ui iconsindicators no hit markers no health bars if you get shot a couple of times you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness cover teamwork suppressive fire and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles armor helicopters and planes each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts each containing 1215 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding and challenging i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete however the singleplayer campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer oh god the multiplayer wasteland king of the hill invade and annex battle royale breaking point so many coop opportunities the amazing looking upcoming epoch currently in closed alpha im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later if you do not find my review helpful please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback

this is quite possibly the most emotional shooter ive ever played and its not because of the campaign crowd around children its story time one day not so long ago my squad had just destroyed an antiair battery our pilot landed and the rest of the squad boarded one by one i was about to get in when the rockets started flying the chopper lifted off with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes unwilling to die before then i rushed to the nearest cover a small house by a narrow road i entered to find a ten yearold player who had also been left behind he explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his clan i politely declined explaining that my own squad was inbound as i finished a ghost hawk flew over the horizon my squad had arrived this noble child soldier and i were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting the sniper screamed as a 65 mm cartridge entered his leg his shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as i climbed in the transport my new friend was dead 1010 would experience survivor guilt again

cant tell you if you should buy it or not but i can tell you this you will find annoying bugs highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have but when you really get down to it and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission its something magical you just cant find in any other game arma is not a game which you pick up at launch play the campaign and a bit of mp and then trow away you buy it love it or hate it and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly arma is a game which you can never called finished there will always be added to it be it user or official content fixes features or optimizations hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it  if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare this will be your gem ill give it a 910 simply because screw bugs ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back read i will not accept random friend requests if you have a question please post it in the comments

i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 1020 minutes in a single location sometimes longer i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible unless doing paintballing or airgunning and if you do buy the game  i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game

okay arma 3 its a good game it brings some fun content i bought the deluxe edition which was a  mistake some of the weapons exist in real life however they are sadly not named after their real life counterparts which is understandable because bohemia interactive would have too pay for license but still tank gameplay is fine ai like always can be a bit  but hey its ai jets is adequate its not a flight sim it has the basic flight characteristics so that it works but calling it a 100% flight sim would be incorrect and joystick is almost a must for the jets helos they are modelled alot better and i like em and unlike the jets they can be fine without a joystick and pedals however you would of course be better with it online play well we all know the history of arma to be horribly optimised which i agree to in some extent but its also a massive game and putting that in a multiplayer enviorment where not only you but other players and several scripts are all rendered in very very few can play this game on 100% graphics settings when on a multiplayer server most put it down to medium or low overall its a good game with mods it gets even better if you like fps that have a bit larger realism to it get this or insurgency but insurgency doesnt have tanks and helos now does it

i love this game spent many hours into various kinds of game modes from alpha to release i have played many singleplayer maps which i have gotten from the workshop some i have spent countless of hours restarting over and over again just to enjoy it a little bit more and some i have played with my friends in various fun coop missions i have played various multiplayer modes from wasteland king of the hill to altis life i have had my moments of rage and i have had my crazy ammount of laughter if you like a good fps game with a great ammount of depth and lots of replayability then this is a game for you if you like to sit on a hill far away from the combat sniping down on the unknown enemy soldiers then this is a game for you if you enjoy commandering a group of troops hell even a whole army in battle then this is a game for you or if you just want to do illegal drug business while avoiding cops in altis life then this is a game for you i feel repetive now but i really enjoy this game and hope you do so too sorry if there is any grammatic errors in the text english is not my native language

the latest installment for the military simulation franchise which has been around for eons is a very nice step in the right direction in general arma 3 features two new maps called stratis which can be compared to utes of arma 2 and altis which is a mammoth sized map that stretches roughly 27 kilometers in east to west length the arma series has been prone to a multitude of bugs and poor optimization which is still evident in the latest insatllment yet the optimization has been far improved in this version of bohemia interactives spotlight franchise the graphics in this game are very improved and look beautiful on ultra settings that is if you can run it this game is still prone to glitches bugs and sudden extreme drops of framerate without warning some of the bugs are eveident in player movent which has been vastly improved upon the last installment allowing you to take on 9 tactical positions when shooting the movement is far less clunky and works much smoother than arma 2 some of the movement bugs can mean that you accidentally can get stuck in a rock or wall and end up dying from being squashed the vehicles have been greatly improved offering far more realistic physics however the physics are not on the par of games like forza 5 with realistic vehicle speeds the vehicles on the other hand are painstakingly delicate and fragile than before making vehicle operating quite frustrating at times the weapon mechanics have been totally overhauled since the previous arma game with new damage mechanics and far more realistic recoil effects arma 3 also has added a new dimension to its already diverse playability adding a more in depth no pun intended maritime experience this allows you to dive to the depths of th eocean and use submarises as well some of the things i want to see in arma 3 are missing such as the ability to take cover behind doors of a vehicle whilst riding in it to avoid being shot easlliy for example if you are driving or in the passenger seat of a car you can hold a button to allow you character to switch into 1st person view and duck behind the dashboard and door of the car another missing feature is the ability to shoot in vehicles with you characters weapons allowing for military simmulation dirvebys my final verdict of arma 3 is a very solid 85 out of 10 arma 3 offers a very vast and expansive game that has a nearly infinite replayability yet some of its bugs and optimization hold back bohemia interactives flagship series back once more if these glitches were to be fixed arma 3 could be a very famous game that could be a serious threat to games like the call of duty franchise or battlefield franchise as well buying this game is a choice you will not regret and with a little time and patience you can have a blast on this game

good single player great coop multiplayerwhen it works the servers are rather sketchy they dont run very well and there are hackers waiting to ruin your experience just this past week one of the servers was hacked 3 times but it is fun and when you get on a server that is good it is worth all the trouble but the most annoying thing to me is this has only been out for a year or so and the coop servers are already kinda dead and this is dissapointing most people only play altis life the role playing section of the game which id rather just play gta online if this is on sale buy it wouldnt shell out the full $60 on it though if you love tactical games such as ghost recon and rainbow six this is your game all in all 810

oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter as it is so so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning the gameplay is excellent the mechanics are solid and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series as i was may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fpsshooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief brutal and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no minimaps no enemy ui iconsindicators no hit markers no health bars if you get shot a couple of times you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness cover teamwork suppressive fire and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles armor helicopters and planes each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts each containing 1215 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding and challenging i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete however the singleplayer campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer oh god the multiplayer wasteland king of the hill invade and annex battle royale breaking point so many coop opportunities the amazing looking upcoming epoch currently in closed alpha im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later if you do not find my review helpful please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback

this is quite possibly the most emotional shooter ive ever played and its not because of the campaign crowd around children its story time one day not so long ago my squad had just destroyed an antiair battery our pilot landed and the rest of the squad boarded one by one i was about to get in when the rockets started flying the chopper lifted off with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes unwilling to die before then i rushed to the nearest cover a small house by a narrow road i entered to find a ten yearold player who had also been left behind he explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his clan i politely declined explaining that my own squad was inbound as i finished a ghost hawk flew over the horizon my squad had arrived this noble child soldier and i were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting the sniper screamed as a 65 mm cartridge entered his leg his shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as i climbed in the transport my new friend was dead 1010 would experience survivor guilt again

cant tell you if you should buy it or not but i can tell you this you will find annoying bugs highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have but when you really get down to it and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission its something magical you just cant find in any other game arma is not a game which you pick up at launch play the campaign and a bit of mp and then trow away you buy it love it or hate it and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly arma is a game which you can never called finished there will always be added to it be it user or official content fixes features or optimizations hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it  if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare this will be your gem ill give it a 910 simply because screw bugs ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back read i will not accept random friend requests if you have a question please post it in the comments

i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 1020 minutes in a single location sometimes longer i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible unless doing paintballing or airgunning and if you do buy the game  i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game

it somehow has an atmosphere you really feel like youre in altis stratis and no where else when playing this game if that makes sense it is a great joy to learn the ins and outs of this game and its combined 350 square meters of terrain approximately a player that has done his homework and hasnt come straight from cod is easy to distinguish from one that has this game is one of the least action packed first person shooters in the world no doubt but it somehow manages to have the most suspension incredible game 1010

a realistic military simulator this game is worth a buy with the ability to create your own missions with the amazing editor and to play others with the inbuilt workshop support you can have endless hours of enjoyment with this game its quite realistic but still lacks many features of military warfare that could be put into the game the graphics aint so good on my computer but thats because my computer is 8 years old and i will be upgrading soon so i will be able to see this game at its full potential this was my first game in the arma series followed by arma 2 we dont speak of cold war assualt from my experience with arma 2 this game doent differ enormously bar graphics of course however it does have some features that are not present in arma 2 and i frequently notice these features missing when playing arma 2 if you are new to the arma series get this game but if you are a long time veteran then maybe wait a little untill you get bored of all the mods on arma 2 this is a perfect game for any person who enjoys military combat games or would like a realistic simulation of military combat and life worth a buy in my opinion 810 ps i havent played a lot of this game at the current time because it doesnt run so well on my computer and i can only spawn a few units without intense framerate drops

ive had this game for quite a long time but never really found what to do with ituntil i found altis life wow its so much fun roleplaying as a civ trying to find his way on altis island if you like roleplaying and are open to all sorts of avenues that appear in front of you then this is definitely the game for you top drawer

alright time for a short review had this game since alpha and well it has really just become worth it if you can overcome the terrible controls minor glitches and general baffling mechanics at times falling to your death at short heights then you may enjoy this game ive mainly played the wasteland mod battle royale some altis life and some minor coop mods i can say this game is worth it just for wasteland it is basically dayz without the  running for 4 hours no dumb zombies no crying about friendly killing and a proper group system the mods in general are just getting better and better however it does take a while for you to find a good altis life server without a power abusing admin i just gave up on that plus role play just makes things long but yeah arma 3 takes some getting used to the really terrible controls add to the tension and in many cases the extended controls is needed to give you very advanced movement but there are annoying things like dying by falling from a 5 foot drop or trying to open a door to run away but you end up healing youself in the doorwayunable to move gg very unintuitave controls but with that said most players in this game 50 year old dads with no time to play games that much and are thus awful and easy to kill if youre quite adept at games and enjoy wrecking teams of 10 or more old guys playing then this is the game for you

hey you yes you do you want to be operator as  like marsoc navy seals and sas well maybe dont buy this game unless you are prepared to heavily mod it dont take this the wrong way as arma 3 is a great game with the custimation or charcters weapons and more but my biggest problem and others it that it lacks the conventional warfare that most arma fans were looking for this was all found in arma weapons you have heard of and excist but if you want these in arma 3 you need to mod them in another problem is that the map vareity is terrible 2 mapsreally plus the pvp is worse than arma 2 somehow but this game has outstanding graphics and alot more features than the previous games pros good graphics extra customization underwater yay can be operator as  but needs mods better character movement and vehicle control better campaign if you want to play it cons some are my own opinion lacks realisic warfare needs mods to have half the weapons factions and vehicles of arma 2 again 2 maps really arma 2 had 4 on release damage models are screwed in pvp which is worse than arma 2 somehow getting shot makes you character do a ing disco dance move which makes no sense at all good graphics i expand you need a good system to even run this game on lowmedium as i found out before i upgraded even now with my new system runs gta 5 far cry4 etc on max above 60fps this game runs like a dying dog arma 2 i could max it and get 50fps all the time sometimes on arma 3 i struggle to get 30fps but remember this review is my opinion so take from it you will just buy arma 2 it better p thats all folks

do not get me wrong this game is amazing i hesitate to call it a game but it really depends on your playstyle you can go on roleplay servers or you can pvp the usual hardcore users of this product however usually use it as a base for massive coop operations including vehicle platoons artillery support manned and operated in a realistic manner by players and infantry squads you want to realistically call in a fire mission for the artillery this is your game you want to call in close air support for a strike on a snipertankbuilding this is your game you want to indulge yourself in close quarter combat with your squad this is your game you want to hunt down ieds and the insurgents who placed them this is your game ok now these massive coop operations are made possible and realistic by the modding community this is a fact the base game is to the best of my knowledge not ever used when it comes to any serious servers or communities the modding community supplies the realistic radio communications the real word weapons the medical simulation better sounds better graphics in some cases better ai  and all kinds of maps so your platoon can deploy anywhere from alaska to zimbabwe and it brought you bipods seriously bohemia how did it take you so long to implement freakin bipods in the game this modding community made the game more realistic and created the fanbase it has today arguably the most attention arma got in years came from the zombie mod not a fan btw but still and now bohemia comes along and wants to charge you for dlc alright you might say what is the dlc the dlc includes things as long range capable rifles and tools to be more accurate it also includes things like new helicopters and slingloading vehiclesobjects these are argueably some of the main features for the marksmen and helicopter dlc respectivly now these features where added by the modding community years ago in arma 2 already for absolutely free they still exist in arma 3 too i do not see the need for the publisher to charge this amount of money for features the community pretty much figured out on its own i would rather donate that money to a beatiful website called armaholics and to certain mod developers on there and arma 3 is a triple a game with a triple a price as others pointed out already people who preordered played in the alpha etc paid more money than people who waited for the steamsales to kick in i can get the whole game cheaper and including dlcs than the chaps who where loyal to bohemia and this franchise in the first place what the   seriosuly that is  even from a marketing perspective here is my advice if you are looking for the real arma experience largescale coop usually vs ai with differing amounts of military realism buy the base game then find a appropriate server or group to play with they will teach you how to mod the  out of this game and you will never need the lame dlcs

the enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish bohemia interactives flagship franchise its what makes radios topographical maps binoculars and compasses practical equipment in an fps its what allows for kilometer long headshots and coordinated convoy raids its what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies muzzle flashes tracers gunsmoke as valuable as being a crack shot the scale of arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre including arma 2  altis  a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots is a mediterranean islandnation assembled from ruins airports coastal villages solar power plants military outposts salt flats and tank friendly scrubland its a variegated backyard for you to play war in but whats more significant is that armas landscape finally has the technology it deserves arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series unbelievable dynamic lighting a volumetric cloud system genuine vehicle physics 3d weapon optics ragdoll noticeably improved weapon audio and other grainy eye level details await scrutiny inside arma 3s macro elegance the best improvement is the merciful cutting of arma 2s rigid tin man without oil combat animations which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands a half year in paid prerelease has given arma 3 time to gestate but the final build is far from being a comprehensive reinvention of the series and some longstanding blemishes that arise from its nature as a gargantuan simulation linger even on highend hardware my framerate dips under the spectacle of some multiplayer missions friendly ai units though marginally betterbehaved still depend on the player to be their brains an issue thats circumvented by playing arma the way god intended it cooperatively

[fatigue update] this has ruined the game im not even exagerating unless you only use vehicles 247 this update will have ruined the game for you making you aim like a drunkard after jogging about all of 10m and forcing you to walk at a snails pace after a whole 20m thats some ing wonderful realism isnt it guys  if i had to compare arma 3 to another game id say its the grandchild of battlefield and skyrim with massivescale combat maps that dwarf any other shooter without question and a variety of usermade game modes along with the vanilla series of zeus game modes there is no shortage of content in the recently added zeus modes you can even turn this firstperson shooter into an rts game the game mechanics are mostly solid however some minor things such as falling damage parachute mechanics and carstrucks turning to useless wrecks after a realtively minor bump into anything leave plenty of room for improvement bugs are also still a signifigant issue even to the point of causing some destroyed buildings to randomly shoot someone into the air and have them fall to their death and in general the engine feels stiff much like skyrimissues asside if you find the right game mode for you almost anyone should be able to find some enjoyment out of arma 3 whether youre some hardcoreroleplaying type want to fight for survival all over an island or simply want to vie for control over a city there is plenty to do

this game is great this game has so much content and bi are bringing more if you havent played arma 2 you will be blown away at the map sizes of altis and stratis heaps of weapons and vehicles and plenty of things to do there is also a big modding community and with arma 3 being very easy to mod it is a game expanding quite fast there are heaps of servers that bring you different game types also it has full steam workshop support this game is great to play with friends dont expect a call of duty worth the money every dollar

fantastic game the single player content showcases and training are good the real meat of the game is in its multiplayer though admittedly it can be a bit confusing at first if youre a new player as some servers require you to download mods before you can join the server there doesnt tend to be a whole lot of vanilla servers out there however the mods are fantastic and worth the effort especially if you play them with a group of people my favorite experience thus far was when we were playing the insurgency mod military vs terrorists theres a mod called task force radio which in a nut shell provides much more realistic radios to use each faction has their own encrypted radio various channels you can switch to and various ranges of radio long range and short range as the military we were attempting to locate intel that was known to exist in a village a squad was unfortunately kia and for the next two hours the military was getting picked off constantly i even deployed with a buddy deep into a mountain with full camo let my team know that where i was and i had good sights on the village and not 2 minutes later i got sniped even though i was hardly exposed and never took a shot later it turns out they stole a radio off a dead squadmate and were listening to our radio chatter and our positions for 2 hours and we all had a good laugh as the terrorists won 1010

one of the best  my current favorite game the amount of modsonline modes available is ridiculous if youre into the realism & being strategictactical then this game is definitely for you its not your average run & gun fps like cod & bf so be warned it takes a while to get the hang of the game mechanics & learn how to use everything properly because it is a simulator

what in the name of all that is holyis wrong with this game well i will tell you aside from some new weponsthis is the exact same game as arma 2 the new invantory system is just as terrible as the old oneand requires a 3 day class in order to understand how it operates the way that cars trucks and tanks function is just as horrid and unpredictable as it was in arma 2 i can still do a loopdloop in most aircraft at under 100 yards altattude the campain is luaghable with a bad storybad vice acting and filled with stupid bugs in order to play the game you have to attend basic trainingnot on combat tactics or proper map reading mind youno you need basic traning on how the heck to moveaccess invantory or piont your gun 90% of the time i spend fighting the engine and bad mechanics that make the game hard to play 10% i spend having fun shooting bad guys or working with a team compleate a great comunity created mod and that brings me to my last piont how the hell did arma get such a great comunity they release an unfinished gamethe cumminity buys itand then finishes it for them the only fun modes are the ones supplied by the comunity this game is one of the worst repersentations of the fps and tactical shooter genras the only reason this game is funis becuase the cammunity creates awesome modsand fixes all the terrible bugs i rate this game 210

in the same theme as carlsberg lager being probably the best lager in the world arma 3 probably the best mil sim in the world superb in game graphics excellent replayability user creation mode is fantastic more than enough mods are available workshop for the user created missions if you cant design your own one major drawback to it it requires highspec machinery to run satisfactory if you really want this though sort your machine out then spend a little cash on this game its the most realistic military simulator ever so damned good it makes my balls tingle

carrying on from the genredefining milsim that was arma 2 arma 3 is a rock solid sequel that lives up to the expectations in place for the arma series even managing to go a bit beyond in certain aspects as a great fan of arma 2 i love arma 3 and the improvements bi have managed to implement into the game as well as showing off nearfuture battlefield tech in the game to help accurately represent the games time period bi have also managed to develop great maps interesting gamemodes wasteland for online play and still manage to maintain and improve upon the fun level of realism that made arma 2 so popular with milsim players the modding scene is also very active with mods such as ace and acre out there for added realism and more serious milsim players which allows the game to be expanded upon a lot be warned however the game isnt shy on performance and requires a decent rig to run properly even on midrange settings my only major whine about the game itself is the developers choice to release the campaign in a series of episodes dripfeeding us content and missions but as each episode is released this negative becomes less and less of a factor im giving arma 3 a 910 and deffinitely recommend this game

absolutely worth buying i wouldnt trust the relatively low metascore since this game lives from the content the community provides at the point the reviews were done there only were very few user created missions and mods this game is very complex and deep you will either hate it or love it but you should definitely give it a try for at least a few hours before you judge

ah arma 3 many people might not enjoy this game as this game unlike most fast fpss or tactical shooters arma lets you play on a 270km squared terrain you may approach an objective how you want it if the mission scenario allows it when you want it hvt convoy passing through gotta be on time and with what you want it overall the optimization is okay as the game recieves constant updates with the biggest one is a free zeus gamemode dlc being released on dev branch fixes pour through constantly as well as new features or updates arma 3 like all the previous arma games provides a simple to use editor which can be used to create a simple firefight or an all out war with dynamic units and performance scripts the graphics are really good which helps the immersion thes a weather setting so you can be having a nice vacation in greece or be infiltrating an enemy base in the stormy seas of altis altis is the 270km squared island stratis is smaller yet enjoyable under the cover of fog as you disembark you grab your gear from the boat armed with smgs with flashlights in the night and with the help of moonlight you make your way through the forest you get to a road a csat convoy passes by not noticing you you carry on this can be the begining of a mission very easily this is what makes arma unique you can script a whole event to make it a michael bay movie or let the players make a critical decision of wether retreating or holding ground arma ofcourse features realistic bullet drop recoil and stance adjustments remember those old fashioned stand crouch prone type stances well no more you can now adjust yourself into a variety of stances such as high crouch low crouch high stand and many others you can peek round walls or shove a part of your body out and spray at the enemy this gives you a whole lot more freedom than many other games not to mention 90% buildings are enterable yet without furniture just at the moment lets speak a bit about ai they are currently undergoing changes and they can be very accurate not accurate smart or just dumb as each unit has a skill bar and the games has difficulty levels such as recruit regular or veteranhigher which can all be adjusted to multiple points such as hud waypoints friendly skill enemy skill and much more they can still provide a very authentic experience now the game is called a finished game but not all agree features pour in and so do fixes the amount of content compared to previous titles is smaller but not everything is finished csatnato jets are coming in a few weeks as an example the great thing is that the community is devoted helping and of all active mods are rolling out hot from the oven every day hell some people are making a dinosaur mod and from what i know official arma 3 mod tools are not even released if its reskins or dinosaurs or perhaps arma 2 content it is all there and more baking each day the developers are active and listen to the community and that helps them make a quality game even better yet i do understand alot of people dont like it if they have come from older series such as arma 2 for lack of content or glitches then they ofcourse dont remember what was arma 2s launch like  the game is gradually getting better and yes i agree arma 2 has more content and is more modern combined with the operation arrowhead expansion but arma 3 is a great game too or great modules lacking such as the medic module a revive like module for wounded people or great mods such as advanced combat environment or invasion 1944 most mods are coming over to arma 3 yet there is a waiting barrier of course but if you are still confused if you want to buy the game arma 3 cars have working mirrors i would rate the game at the current state 7510

arma 3 beta a beautiful place on the island of stratis filled with wild life and plants oh yeah and did i tell you the place is a  battlefield filled with the monstrosities of war the full release wont offer much unless bohemia has something up their sleeve the game is going to lack jets which is one of the main parts of an arma game bohemia needs to step up and make more stuff or get embarresed by mod makers that doesnt mean the game will be horrible the game will be very good beautiful and dangerous at the same time the ai was horrible but was then made more battle effecient in the beta if you didnt buy it during alpha then you will be spending some stacks on the beta or full release its going to be about 50 to 60 dollars but from what i can tell its worth it

the main reason why i bought arma3 was for the wasteland mod i played arma 2 pretty heavily and i can say for sure that arma3wasteland is far superior than dayz in every respect except for survivalforaging i played quite a bit of arma2 dayz and i feel that the mod is extremely overrated compared to the other mp experiences arma has to offer this review may be more helpful to those who are thinking about the decision to move to arma3 from arma2 arma 3 improves upon arma 2 in many ways first it reduces the amount of clutter on the keyboard now there isnt what feels like fifty keys dedicated to commandradio and now there is more of a streamlined feel to the game that being said its extremely necessary to play with voice as calling out targetsorders is something that is required in this game unless you are a lone wolf or you are in a rather large group where the need for such things is lessened also a major update in graphics which i must say are stunning compared to a2 this doesnt make arma but it helps you stay immersed needless to say arma will always be unoptimized so please learn simple optimization tricks before giving up after seeing you have <30 frames its worth it the amount of customizations in this game is extremely helpfuluseful be warned though it may take some time before you get the hang of it as arma being buggy has a tendency to make things hard plus theres the fact that sometimes a player can get their hands on a fantastic sniper rifle minus the scope im pointing at you wasteland so be warned of these situations before you find yourself in one that isnt to your liking after all of this i would suggest that people with lower end computers dont buy this game or be prepared to run it on low settings but the low settings are nothing to be mad about as they are still pretty damn good and graphics are not something that you come to arma for in the first place now for those who havent experienced the military sim feels you know what im talking about arma delivers when played right it delivers a deep comradery that cannot be gotten from most other games on the market when you achieve something with your friends who you sometimes have to place 100% trust in it can be awe inspiring and can lead to many ecstatic shouts over the radio for doing something seemingly insignificant if seen through eyes of a standard fps player now about gameplay arma requires an extreme amount of patience normally you have one or two rounds of fire to get things right or you will be sent to the death screen bullets hurt really bad normally getting hit with one is life threatening if its normal caliber but any more than that and you could be facing a bit of a journey back this normally means 1020 minutes to regroup and find another battle worth fighting but dont worry many of my fondest memories of arma are from moments that are just random and unexpected and they dont even require the slightest trace of enemy presence  httpiimgurcomggaptfxjpg  < from arma2 tldr arma 3 is a much improved upon arma 2 nothing extremely new here but theres still quite a bit more which makes it worth getting if your computer can handle the game and you can handle the buggynessplaystyle of arma it is one of my favorite games and is the leader of its genre and rightfully so for those wondering approximately 300 hours of game time logged on arma2

my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game ever were on our way to the objective a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces im leading a team of 4 men we come to a crossroad and i sprint across telling my men to hold back i cross a few more times trying to get a response from any snipers nothing i run my lmg gunner runs my medic runs but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through remember the sniper scene the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down he then takes two more in the chest the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills he played it up to 11 here he screams as hes being shot crawling drenched in his own blood sarge you aint leaving me out here like this right ii wanna go with you guys cmon sarge hhelp me cmon please dont leave me he died after that i cried and he respawned 1110 would recommend getting

this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things having done both military service and picked up milsim airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality there are experiences you will have in arma 3 that can not be had in cod or bf experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release one that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower i was squad leader of 8 or so ais as we approached the comms tower and i told my men to go stealth no firing unless fired upon we moved slowly taking advantage of terrain keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and i spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower there i positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as i had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower i considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position but a firefight is always a risk and these ai had been around for a few missions and i had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly i might get hit and killed as i considered how i would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern i realised the tower is unguarded and i had an opportunity to do something i had not considered i got up and ran as fast as i could towards the tower all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head i kept scanning as i ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols after what seemed like far too long i reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention i turned around and made my way back as i closed on my men i started ordering them to fall back hope growing that i might get out of this alive falling back to about 400 meters i finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to command i had done it i had pulled off the perfect mission not a shot fired and all under my command back alive that is what this game is about

oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter as it is so so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning the gameplay is excellent the mechanics are solid and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series as i was may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fpsshooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief brutal and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no minimaps no enemy ui iconsindicators no hit markers no health bars if you get shot a couple of times you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness cover teamwork suppressive fire and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles armor helicopters and planes each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts each containing 1215 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding and challenging i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete however the singleplayer campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer oh god the multiplayer wasteland king of the hill invade and annex battle royale breaking point so many coop opportunities the amazing looking upcoming epoch currently in closed alpha im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later if you do not find my review helpful please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback

this is quite possibly the most emotional shooter ive ever played and its not because of the campaign crowd around children its story time one day not so long ago my squad had just destroyed an antiair battery our pilot landed and the rest of the squad boarded one by one i was about to get in when the rockets started flying the chopper lifted off with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes unwilling to die before then i rushed to the nearest cover a small house by a narrow road i entered to find a ten yearold player who had also been left behind he explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his clan i politely declined explaining that my own squad was inbound as i finished a ghost hawk flew over the horizon my squad had arrived this noble child soldier and i were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting the sniper screamed as a 65 mm cartridge entered his leg his shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as i climbed in the transport my new friend was dead 1010 would experience survivor guilt again

cant tell you if you should buy it or not but i can tell you this you will find annoying bugs highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have but when you really get down to it and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission its something magical you just cant find in any other game arma is not a game which you pick up at launch play the campaign and a bit of mp and then trow away you buy it love it or hate it and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly arma is a game which you can never called finished there will always be added to it be it user or official content fixes features or optimizations hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it  if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare this will be your gem ill give it a 910 simply because screw bugs ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back read i will not accept random friend requests if you have a question please post it in the comments

i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 1020 minutes in a single location sometimes longer i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible unless doing paintballing or airgunning and if you do buy the game  i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game

this is the definitive military experience sure it might be rough around the edges and maybe it can be a bit unforgiving at times but no other military shooter out there comes even close to what arma 3 offers unlimited replayability thousands of campaigns and scenarios mods coop vehicles exploration and above all a sense of total inmersion with the upcoming free dlc and a huge community behind it bohemia interactive have again struck gold having played their games since operation flashpoint it has been an awesome surprise to see how far they have taken the genre forward although be advised call of warfare fans will be in for a shock as nothing they have learnt there will have much use in here the graphics are amazing the movement and controls are the best in the series but be advised you will have to take time to learn the ins and outs of the game as it is sometimes unforgiving of even the slightest mistakes eventually you get the hang of it and this game really shines must buy get your gun soldier and hit the dirt

i originally bought arma when it first came onto steam however back then i only played 12 hours of it and left it in my library to rot it was not only until a week or two ago when i started to play it fully i tried out most gamemodes and i must say it is a great game below is a long first match i jumped into a king of the hill match and it was hectic people were shouting over coms team and proximity chat strategitcal locations and manuevers the objective was 3 km away so everyone at the base was finding transport anyway they could i found this small helicopter almost full taking off i hopped in and we flew away the pilot attempting to avoid fire and a long flight flew over the deep ocean now we werent that far from shore but far enought that it would be an insanely long swim i was sitting in the middle of the helicopter looking at the pilot as he looked back and told me it would only be a couple minutes and that we would have to parachute as he looked back at me i could see through the windshield a missle coming right towards us there was an enemy hidden on the shore with a rocket launcher we were hit and falling at a rapid rate the launcher hit our back tail and we were plummiting towards the ocean fumbling with my keys to try to jump out the helicopter hit the water and sank extremely fast i was lucky enough to eject myself and swim towards the surface as i swam i saw several bodies of the other passengers i was the only survivor hurt from the crash i was unable to swim fast and i was stuck in the middle of the ocean the waves were big so i had to fight staying on the surface i was about to give up hope and drown myself as i knew i wouldnt make the swim all of sudden i hear a helicopter some pilot saw the crash and saw me swimming he lowered himself and i hopped in boy was i glad i thanked him a ton and we started to fly off as i saw the bodies of my comrades float to the surface i was able to capture a picture of the rescue below i play on three monitors so excuse the extremely wide screenshot httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid367509437 sadly this rescue would end soon as the same rocket launcher shot us down for good i spawned back at base and rode out on an atv with some random teammate on the back the drive was long 3 km and towards the end a helicopter lowered down and shot rockets at us it had come from nowhere as it hit us with one rocket a friendly jet shot it down hurt from the rocket my teammate and i escaped into the bushes we were still 500 meters from the objective moving at an extremely slow rate because of the injuries we ran into battle sadly we were both easily picked off my 30 minutes thus far has been a failure to go into actual battle and i wanted to actually fight for once i rode on a helicopter and we parachuted down all 12 of us people shot up as us as i saw a few friends fall i flew into a tree and hid in some bushes an enemy tank and some infantry walked right past me as i lay in the bushes once they left i ran into a broken down house with half of it missing i look out a window and see a dozen enemy troops parachuting down into the backyard none of them saw me but i knew once i started firing i was to be outnumbered desperate for some firefight i opened fire 1234 they all fell as i shot them down more men had landed but they were confused where i was firing from i had killed 4 men at this point and killed a 5th as i looked to my left to see a sniper in the bushes him and i stared at each other for a few seconds as i saw him aim down his sights and headshot me seriously 910 great game only reason not a 10 is because of some bugs and poor optimization on some servers this game isnt for a casual person looking for some quick action you should know what youre doing or else people will yell at you too much water ign

arma 3 is just as boring as arma 2 until you play king of the hill koth makes this game its the best worth the cash money just for that mode alone why progression teamwork and last but not least friendly helicopter pilots will drop you onto the hill of death just for  giggles and points 105 oh by the way its unoptimized like every arma game so to make it go from 20fps to 90fps you need to balance out cpu and gpu performance
recommended
arma 3 is another hard core shooter its hard to get into when you have never palyed arma ii the graphics are amazing there are multiple different scenarios to play if you dont feel like playing multiplayer but i would say multiplayer is where the game is at its best it may take some time to get into the action which is where the arma 3 fails at but once you are in the heat of battle the gameplay is unmatched by anyhting else communicating with squad mates tactically moving about to achieve the objective and the feeling of being in huge squad is just something no other game in my opinion has achieved if you are interested in arma 3 then i recommend you buy it although i dont have much time in arma 3 and i have played many other fps i can clearly say that this is one of the better fps out there the first time i got into battle was what changed my view of arma 3

we were a group of 3 soldiers stranded in a city in the middle of nowhere with only sidearms to protect ourselves 9mms in our hands which compared to the firepower of our enemy it would make them have good laughs our top priority was scavanging for supplies and guns we found an old suv parked in the middle of a town hall with apparent damaged transmission and busted wheel i procede to repair the suv while our squads sniper and combat medic scout for any enemy infantry or vehicles i was a professional engineer with 10 years of duty repairing stuff no one cares about until they are broken after the repairing took place with no problems we look to the trunk of the suv boy it was like looking at the lord two assault rifles accompanied by their respective ammo now we were loaded and looking at our next mission we saw a convoy 2 clicks away from our position we took this as a chance to gear up and scavenge food and water while fighting the enemy at the same time while en route to our ambush location we found a military truck with a big antitank weapon sitting of top of it it was the perfect setting except the engine didnt work we had to toe it to our suv even with all my experience i couldnt put the engine up and running but the gun worked we set up at the ambush point waiting for the enemy but while waiting we saw a big white vehicle in the mountain north coming toward us which was being towed is that a god damn boat sailing on land on the back on a truck  said our sniper it had miniguns attached to it and the instance we saw them we proceded to open fire with our antitank weapon it was a tough fight they shot back as soon as they heard our shots and fought the best way they could but our weaponry was too strong for them the truck catched fire and exploded after a couple rounds into it killing all the enemies in the vicinity it looked like a scene from a michael bay film after that we ambushed the convoy stole a couple of antitank rpgs and sold them into the black market to buy a tank 1010 it was good

instant buyers remorse i want to like this game i really do ive watched soooo many frankie youtube videos of various arma23dayz antics and i thought to myself boy despite the billion graphical glitches there seem to be present and the staggering amount of complete aholes in servers and the really really clunky looking uiinventory system this looks like it could be fun team based objectives mods that have huge open world survival based gameplay vehicles realistic seemingly weaponry military tacticsat a glance looks like a pretty decent game so free weekend 50% off 30 bucks for a game that has singleplayer and multiplayer infinite modding possibilities shut up and take my money sir 42 hourrs on my record i would say at least half was spend alttabbed googling various how do i do this or arma 3 tutorial since the ingame helpinstructionsinterface  is  i dont know if it is because ive never played any arma installment or im mentally  or the game is simply an unintuitive cobbled together sack of confusing and unhelpful  but either way prepare for a heavy learning curve some enjoy this aspect some people prefer a game with 400 keybinds to take advantage of their expensive gaming keyboards and mice i am not one of them its a first3rd person shooter with sim aspects  there should be no need for you to be a contortionist or have a 2nd monitor with a keybind list up at all times honestly a lot of the keybinds are whacky and frustratingly unintuitive i get it new things take time to learn like learning a new language like piloting a jet like learning how to script for me playing a game and learning the controls should be remotely similar to any of these things i do not want to dedicated 20 hours just to be able to navigate gameplay its not a mmo hell i have played mmos with less binds not only that but for the life of me i could not get my extra mouse buttons to perform the way i wanted them to arma3 is the only game ive ever played where that has been the case get ready to spend hours scouring the web for fps issues or fps tweak guides for a game that really isnt incredibly impressive graphically all the same it will make you wonder what your $700 video card and top notch processor 16 gigs ram ssd hd etc are ing doing youll notice if you have monitors up on your pc that they arent being taxed all that much 20% yet performance is still awful guides will have you downloading cpu parkingunparking software entering a billion command line switches sacrificing goats to the bohemian pagan gods but alas very little you do will change the fact that this game is optimized like a bag of bloody  dont bother searching through forums 95% of people that dont recognize there is in fact a massive persistent issue with fps in this game so maybe 20 people on all the internet will just ridicule your computer or setup and tell you to get a guhd computer i get 60 fps must be a problem with your setup     etc the campaign is horrendous the ai is bad like mind blowingly bad your teammates will just charge in and either kill everything in sight while youre playing realistically taking your time scouting moving from cover to cover etc or they will charge in and get annihilated either way prepare to be a spectator for a lot of the action simply because your character is bound by the realism parameters that both friendly and enemy ai is not examples of this include the enemy have clairvoyant abilities to spot you behind that tree rock building etc and the second you pop your melon out for a little lookieloo boom headshot from 300m from an enemy who isnt even rendered oh okay i thought i was fighting human beings not terminators with cloaking shields woops the enemy ai will have astonishing accuracy unbelievable and certainly not realistic accuracy accuracy that you simply cannot pray to match if you have been moving at all in the last few minutes before you raise your gun try drinking 1015 beers then playing that stupid game we did as kids where you get a baseball bat and put your forehead to the pommel and jam it into the ground and spin around and around and around for a minute then pick up an assault rifle and try to aim at something 10 m away let alone 300m away im not american so as kids we didnt have the assault rifles but the baseball bat spinny thing was a thing its not just the 15 beers talking this is what its like to try to aim down at an enemy after running 15 feet for a game striving for realism yeah this amazing and ultra realisitic military sim mechanic only affects you in case you were wondering besides the game breaking ai and mechanics and horrid control system and clunky ai and awful on screen instructions  the campaign itself is a lot of hohum lets traverse the country side for 15 mins listening to horrid voice acting to be fair its not as bad as what some people are saying but its still not good and considering its the only god damn thing to take your mind off how bad this game is performing on your gaming rig it just grates on your nerves literally a mission starts and they have you run from one in game cut sceen to another with zero action in between with a few fadeouts and 15 minutes of walking is this deliberate to bore you to  death so that when action takes place you dont notice how  the ai acts perhaps so prepare to traverse the same stretch of not so pretty landscape over and over as the save system is another baffling part of bohemias design i understand not allowing you to save whenever you damn well please waitno i dont but making me listen to same uninspired boring and inane voice acting while running up the same god forsaken hill for 3 minutes over and over and over because the ai consists of super soldiers who can no scope you 5 seconds after a full out sprint to prone is just infuriating after a while even during firefights i did not get an overwhelming sense of holy shieeeeet war is scurry man this is so realistic only supreme tactics and skill and will have me come out on top in this conflict it was more like why the fk am i druken soldier with asthma who cant run 5m and raise his weapon without swaying so bad its amazing hes even still standing upright more often than not you find yourself letting your ai teammates do everything while you cower in a bush hoping you might get to shoot 1 or 2 enemy soldiers or you allow your teammates to cannon fodder themselves and you mop up while the enemy is busy annihilating them either way you barely feel engrossed in the action and never really feel like a main player in the game dont even get me started on the uav mission to be fair this is the single player part of the game i have yet to really delve into multiplayer  im afraid to people state numerous times i might add that single player fps is fine but multiplayer is where it really goes downhill oh goodie when the game is made so inaccessible it makes it real difficult to start it up again let alone try playing with other people and getting into the lovely world of arma community friendliness better make another run to the beer store even if youre not a drinker spend $30 on booze you will get way more entertainment out of it hell if youre really not a drinker give the booze to a bunch of teenagers or your little brother or something you will be better off for it trust me

arma 3 is a very good game with fantastic graphics and physics however arma 3 is very poorly optomized to get a stable 60fps on highultra settings you need a killer machine singleplayer story is good enough and the map editor is very fun you can place units chose your own guns do whatever you want in the editor mode the multiplayer is where the main fun is at arma 3 provides large scale multiplayer 100 people and coop mode to enjoy user created missions with your friends however multiplayer is terribly optimized and most people have a hard time getting good fps coop missions new players have to try escape altis escape stratis multiplayer servers new players should try out  wasteland freeroam survivalpvp  altis life  king of the hill  battle royale there is a dayz type of mod for arma 3 called breaking point which is very fun it has its own map weapons clothings etc

arma 3 armed assault 3 is definitely the most graphically and mechanically impressive title so far in the arma series however  despite it being released there is still a heafty amount of bugs and glitches in the game although they may be small and more in the background than presented upfront there are also more optimizations that could definitely be implimented that would fix its problem with inconsistant few and far between but are still issues crashes happening during multiplayer experiences these issues have lead a number of users both old and new to see arma 3 as still being in beta developement that will ultimately be left up to you to decide though besides these issues though arma 3 has advanced from its previous titles in terms of an updated and continuously polished physics engine numerous graphical improvements to drive immersion new mechanical upgrades allowing more indepth maneuvering in either land see or air vehicles as well as hoofing it across the battlefield and already developing expansions to add more content to the game zeus game mode bohemia interactive are definitely heading in the right direction withthis title giving it all the love and attention they can muster and in my opinion doing the best they seem to be able to do as theyre still defined as an independent developer pushing onwards from their previous flagship arma 2 bi so blatently wants their entire fanbase present and future new and old to be able to take away and share the same amazing experiences from arma 3 as they did from the previous titles and making way to provide great enjoyment for said fanbase which consists of diehard veteran players and their amazing moding community which has put out vanilla contentworthy additions to past titles as well as already arma 3 being new to the series as of the official beta of arma 3 ive gone back to arma 2 to see where arma 3 is coming from even though a3 is considered by some to still be an unfinished product despite being released with a pricetag of $60 i can see that my investment will be paying off sooner or later however i spent $45 when it was still in beta so you may have to look harder if youve only recently purchased it

i was introduced to arma through the dayz mod for arma 2 it says a lot when a game is so moddable that it spawns other games ive bought arma 3 during the alpha best money ive ever spent find a good clangroupcommunity and youll have a hard time running out of things to do with this game cherry on top the devs are mad men they hammer daily on the dev branch and release monster patch notes every months the game has a few flaws like the scroll menu that makes me sometimes lose my  when i try to open a door and instead change weapon ladders oh dear god ladders if you want a good fps with awesome vehicles arma 3 is for you and when you think youre done go look at the mods
recommended
really good game but a little buggy at times
recommended
by far one of the best  or even the best fps game ive played in a long long time
recommended
endless hours of fun

i love it

arma 3  awesomeness

while its definitely lacking in content as of yet the developers are constantly pushing out more and more to add to the game as time goes on it has sleek graphics and very realistic gameplay incidentally if youre looking for call of duty or battlefield with tight corners and insanely overpowered guns and dumbeddown ballistics you sir have come to the wrong place as said by runekn so perfectly arma is not a game which you pick up at launch play the campaign and a bit of mp and then trow away you buy it love it or hate it and then play it forever or trow it away immediately the community is incredibly active and if the game is missing something a jet or faction or gun there are modders out there currently hard at work making this game more incredible at the time of writing the first of three campaign episodes have come out the next slated for early next year the game is becoming more and more intricate as people leave arma ii to rest for a bit while they pursue arma iii and more scenarios are being made thanks to workshop integration overall this is an excellent game and if youre sick of cod or bf need a dose of excitement or realism or just need a satisfying filler while the sequel [of cod or bf] comes out arma iii will give the experience yourself looking for

i love this game i genuinly cannot play other fps games without thinking why dont i just play arma it has completely changed what i expect from fps games and i look forward to continuing to play this game as it grows in both features and community made mods
recommended
unique game this doesnt count as a shooter its a military simulator but with good reason the term shooter is used loosely to designate any game with guns in this game understanding military language logistics and tactics is just as important as having enough ammo and good aim i rate this game highly but dont walk into this expecting guns ablazing and being an insane tank able to take down platoons of dudes its for its own crowd its up to you to figure out if you arewant to be part of that crowd
recommended
awesome and with so much content it is an amazing military simulator straighty game that will be forever epxanding and modding
recommended
really cool game when you have time to play it
recommended
i still need to learn how to fly a jet 
recommended
love this game love playing it still needs a bit of work like adding new weapons helicopters but other then that its a great game
recommended
very awesome game simulates how war is very well if you liked arma 2 you will love this you can play online such as wasteland which is fun ive had this game since they released it
recommended
i played the alpha lite and was not too impressed by arma 3 i saw it on sale and bought it i can say i do not regret my choice im having a blast with it thus far if you played arma series before you know what you are in for content wise its lacking compared to 2 but that has been out longer i have faith in the community to make some intresting mods for this game

about the game background in 2001 the game operation flashpoint was made for the pc it followed the cold war era fighting between america and soviet russia due to copyright names in 2007 bohemia interactive created armed assault or arma arma was followed up in 2009 with arma 2 now in 2013 the fourth game is out armed assault 3 is set in the near future of 2035 where nato forces are pitted with a equally powerful foe gameplay arma 3 is a very fast paced realistic shooter with smooth controls and advance movement and stance options the biggest feature is modualr gear and weapons the ability to switch scopes vests or anything else on the fly to help protect you or assist you in combat sets this game apart from anything else the ai in arma are ruthless and relentless with advance path finding and adjustable skill they are able to hunt you flank you and take cover from you multiplayer the game supports missions with over 80 players everything from death match cooperative team squad and unit missions with the new physics system weapons are more realistic and so is the damage the community armas community is one of the strongest around skilled missions makers release daily content amazing modders make new addons that completely change the way the game is played final words while i personally enjoy this game i do understand it has a lot of content that has not been added yet the development is always working on the game and adding more conent but in its current state it only has half the units weapons and vehicles of its predecessor graphics 910 gameplay 8510 story 510 next dlc will add more story content multiplayer 910 overall 8510 worth every penny
recommended
very good game for those who like to be tactical i dont recomend this for lone wolves you may just die alot of times  compared to arma 2 the aicampaignmultiplayer and custumization have significantly improved if you are used to playing any call of duty series this game isnt recommended perhaps 60$ is alot but this game is worth it to me it may be a bit glitchy at times but the gameplay makes up for it
recommended
great game it is one of those games i can always go back to 1010
recommended
this game is a simulation and it takes alot of tatics to play so if you like tactics and realistic games then this game is for you
recommended
this game has a lot of potential cant wait to see what becomes of it through the community
recommended
great game
recommended
you really need to play this to realise what a skillbased shooter is all about and its fun to boot
recommended
my potato has 2 anuses 1010

yes best game i ever played as in war

really well built game they certainly did not disapoint with this one
recommended
ok first things first this game has endless possibilities great campain pvp modes king of the hill or wasteland even better pvp in battleroyale role playing games like altis life and arma 3 life zombiedayz mods like breaking point in fact when you get arma its like you got 10 different games which is awesome my first day in altil life looked like this i go get my licence buy a car get a delivery mission i got one farest like 26 kilometers acros altis got on a highway after couple of miles i crash into abandoned vehicle on the middle of the road without toolkit some guys found me on the road and gave me their truck so i could continueawesome guys couple of miles ahead guy jumps in front of my truck trying to rob me and he did robbed me he walked back into his chopper and somehow insta chrashedtalk about insta karma i picked up his money and procced only to be pulled over by a cop for speeding he wrote me a ticket finally after 2 hours a got to my destination and delivered a package i was so happy 1010 would recommend to anyone
recommended
great game

buy it and start with the battle royale mod which is excellent for both solo and coop play if you like super tactical shooters with roaming like far crycrysis games the map is 270 km2 and super varied so the encounters are always different ive played 110 hours and i still havent seen everything on the map i experience immersion in this game like nothing else i have played for a long time there is a lot of potential in the mods the value is good because its future proof due to mods and updates you can really stress out your highend rigs with this game and the optimization isnt terrible  it runs better than arma 2 and dayz i tried the game with a 7 year old rig and it was playable the game is pretty much reliant on mods so you should be prepared to install some they are easy to install though the game is definitely not bugfree at this time and the physics are questionable youll get stuck inside rocks and walls shoot invisible obstructions and die some unfair deaths the controls are also really technical so it is best for hardcore and patient players maybe as an evolution from battlefieldlike games
recommended
i dont really like the vanilla game also the old arma ii missions like domination 2 and insurgency are terrible but when you play in an experienced group with a few hundred mods its freaking awesome vanilla i dont like the gameplay and their are only a few weapons but with some mods this game has no limits try to find a group or clan who makes their own missions and you will have an amazing time if not good luck with the single player
recommended
since the modcommunity is starting to warm up on this game i recommend it to every milsim gamerlover
recommended
armawsome get it play it live it more addicting the crack or cigs even more than ice cream if you end up getting and playing let me know so we can multiplay i been on this one alot with my buddy c0axl we love to have a teamclan on this one blackdawg out

this game is so good i love to play simulations especially military simulators i might not have alot of hours of ingame time now but im going to be playing this game untill it gets boringwhich it doesnt
recommended
great game
recommended
get this ing game give them your money
recommended
yeah i like the game it just doesent have the arma 2 feel to it it feels to bland and boring dont get me wrong its a good game but i dont see my self putting tons of hours into this like i did arma 2
recommended
this is a lovley game i have trouble finding immersion in games but this game is where its at i can sit an play this game for hours on end and not get bored has an amazing story and the multiplayer is just great there is zero reason to not have this game 1110 amazing job bohemia note even though it has some bugs i only find those relevent in multiplayer and its not even that bad doesnt take away from the game at all in my opinion
recommended
if you play solo using ai allies against ai enemy this game is a 710 but with the right mods it quickly becomes an 810 then add in muliplayer open modding pve pvp friggin zombies a bazillion weapons and equipment sound packs then forget that they added gokarts  i think the devs were on meth the day they came up with that idea  in my mind you simply cant find any current or past milsim game that can offer anything close to what arma 3 can this isnt your little brothers call of duty or battlefiled 1 shot can and will kill you thats what the kiddies dont like but guess what thats real sonny boy
recommended
best military sim out there you can do anything and the community is great alot of addons to download missions and people even make awsome gamemodes
recommended
very good game once you learn it so many gamemodes to try

recommended
if you are into realism andor a fan of the arma series this is a great game for you the game does need a few fixes here and there but the game itself is beautiful with steam workshop i can download the old chernaurus map from arma ii and play with the arna iii vehicles very fun especially with friends on wasteland for those who like realism there arent many other sims that deliver a military experience such as this game get past the difficult controls and see how great this military simulator can be
recommended
the best game

110 best game of the year  ign

forget the metascore this game is the best

there is something simply exciting about arma 3 and for me it is primarily driven by the moddibility of the game from vanilla to 20 mods every aspect is quite enteraining even after nearly 1000 hours of gameplay i continue to enjoy arma with my friends in the tacops gamming community arma 3 is worth its prce serveral times over
recommended
this games review has had a long time coming from me honestly the single most played game within my steam collection is undoubtly arma 3 it is one of the few games i play that i continue to come back to over and over again i wont go into much of the stuff you can read about online through professional reviews stuff like the mechanics graphics etc what i will go over though is why exactly this game is a gym despite any short comings and why it has such a loyal community arma is a game that scales with your imagination while not necessarily easy users can create whatever mod they want for this game just recently i saw a video for a trex mod trex aside many of the modders for this game take it upon themselve to implement items and equipment into the game that the developers could not most likely for legal purposestrademarks missions are made constantly so there is never a worry of running out of something to do in arma 3 with one of the largest maps realistic ballistics and a sometimes brutally hard ai the game provides a sandbox for players to play whatever military simulation they could every desire games can be designed to have a small 4 man team infiltrating small enemy camps or they can be designed to have huge operations with several platoons armored vehicles and airsupport my only warning would be to take your time learning the game and the modding community when i first purchased arma 2 i didnt play it for a year after my initial play through because i didnt quite get the game my brother also was not a fan of arma 3 at first this is a game you need to google and learn about the rewards are definitely worth the time
recommended
greatest video game
recommended
this is my first review arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim youll play in awhile the realism beats battlefield but is slower at first if youre not use to it you will wonder how you died after awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away arma 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefieldthe game has many positives and some negatives that i can note positives  amazing graphics in some places  big maps 2 really big islands with one about 270km squared a decent amount of vehicles  weapons alot of uniforms for player customization using the virtual ammo box that is present in some servers  a very good editor and a real time edior named zeus  life like situations with other players  no annoying kids like call of duty negatives  the campaign does not have a story that leaves an impression  the ai downright has no iq  needs a good computer  the map though big in some places are really just open land  hard to learn the game has its shares of positives and negatives but will not be like any other game youve ever played dont buy this game if you wont take the time to learn how to play that is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like call of duty
recommended
if youre looking for a great game to give you some adrenaline then arma 3 is the right choice for you warning this game involves massive team work on a large scale if you like playing alone then this game may be too awesome for you but other than that work together to succeed  it is singleplayer but i dont recommend playing alone  war has never been accurate in a video game like it is in arma 3 instead of run & gun combat you experience patient and heart pounding moments knowing the fact that if you die in a mission its a game over work with your friends to find advantage points to your enemys and call air support if a tank has you under fire and if you get it in maybe the leg or arm you can always bandage yourself to avoid bleeding to death many missions usually last many hours so be sure to have nothing to do during the day and time in your hands and if arma still feels like its missing something visit wwwarmaholiccom for all your modding needs hooah marines

i started the game up and when i got onto the main menu i crashed 1010 goty
recommended
it is completely undeniable that the arma series is one of the finest series of video games on the market and the latest installment arma 3 is no exception the endless amount of hours you will sink into this game unkowlingly is beyond belief and every hour is justifiable the countless mods and gamemodes at your disposal is borderline spectacular and not only bohemia interactive but also the community put an extreme amount of blood sweat and tears into making every second as enjoyable as the last from a casual player to a milsim enthusiast this game will be enjoyed and appreciated by most as well as this arma 3 incorporates some of the most astonishing graphics mechanics and customization options that many games fail to even begin with i am truly impressed with this game as some aspects are just flat out upgrades of the series predecessor arma 2 however this is not to say the game hasnt got flaws optimization has always been a problem with the arma series and that is definitely something i and many other members of the community believe should be addressed the game also has minor problems that do occasionally affect the gameplay and in some cases the immersion nevertheless i am confident that the simply brilliant developers over at bohemia will address not only these but all issues they encounter with arma 3 overall this game has got some minor flaws that get completely outshadowed by its complexity graphical fidelity mechanics customization and so much more if you are currently thinking of making this purchase id think no more even at full price it is worth every penny this game and the arma series in general have not just received my respect and appreciation theyve earned it
recommended
completely epic
recommended
in my experence with the game i have found that it is even more cpu intensive than arma2 unless you have a good cpu i would not recomend getting the game i have a fx 8350 and i only get 30 fps not to mention arma 2 has abour all the same stuff overall all a 810 game
recommended
this game is great combines between fps and simulation in a realistic environments it got everything a game needs starting with the amazing graphics sounds ambient effects everything gameplay is great & steam workshop got some of the best mods youll ever imagine great game a must have
recommended
it has turtles 1010
recommended
one of the best firstperson shooter games ive played in my life its also fun and realistic so is it worth the money oh hell yea
recommended
having bought this on day one i do not regret it ill start with the gun play small arms feel weak against anyone wearing a vest taking more than two shots to kill sometimes even with the almighty 762 however if you play a scenario without body armor of any kind you should have a deadlier match while i wish bi would fix the problem themselves the authentic gameplay mod seems to help or at least it makes me wanna go back to an arma 3 firefight driving vehicles feels a lot smoother than arma 2 in my opinion thanks to physx a lot of it is still off though for example the karts turn ridiculously fast its no gta iv in the driving department but its clear theyre making improvements over past installments in this department sounds are acceptable its clear why sound mods are always so popular for the arma series they smoothened out the dialogue but gun sounds sound weaker and quieter though they can still be heard from some distance the campaign is good improvement over the past or thats what i think at least up until the end although commanding the ai or waiting for them to move can be a tad annoying ai still need to be improved a lot ill leave it at that to avoid spoilers healing system actually seems kind of worse than arma 2 the first aid kits everyone has heal you up 75% so youre not totally good to go but it still makes medics feel useless again youll need mods like agm or xmedsys to get past the healing system content remains a bit lacking still theres only a few civilian cars literally no women of any kind and no civilian aviation also nato csat and the aaf all lack any kind of transport plane the only new sort of vehicle they added was either the tempest device or the bobcat a panther apc that clears mines by plowing them also the aaf only has mortars for artillery which isnt good against nato with their 155mm guns and 230mm rockets or csats 155mm guns and 82mm mortars also csat lacks rocket artillery fun and back to aviation nato and csat dont have an air superiority fighter like the f15 or anything which interestingly is where the aaf makes up if combat photography is your deal arma 3 delivers you can create some beautiful scenes or horribly gruesome to capture with the splendid camera just go into editor and set it up and then go to the menu and click splendid camera the new zeus feature is a fantastic addition though whether being added as a supplement to an existing mission to add challenges or relief depending on how things are going or making an entirely new mission in the zeus gm missions its usually excellent fun as either the victim or the zeus although like most multiplayers it can be ruined by awful people while it may be clunky at first with the controls or function when you get the hang of it its a great tool for making other peoples fun or in sp editor preview just making things for yourself karts are terrible fun enough said considering all these id give it a 7510 zeus bumps it up a lot although the weaker guns against just about any armored soldier and the weakish sounds take it down some notches its still great fun to play ps you should really ignore the people who whine about the futuristic crap seeing as everything ingame is either feasible or already existant theres really nothing futuristic if you wanna see for yourself check out the forums with the arma 3 is it authentic thread
recommended
very fun to play my favorite game modes are altis life king of the hill and wasteland overall great game
recommended
i love realistic games
recommended
im usually not into serious military sims but arma is more than just a sim its modding community is amazing and wasteland servers especially are what sold me on picking up arma 3 it is incredibly enjoyable to get you and a few friends together to form up in a squad and carry out objectives in a tactical style with somewhat realistic gameplay my only complaint is server desyncs and the random physics other than that totally worth it
recommended
not entirely sure how much of this game i have really played given that i simply took advantage of the free weekend who knows how long ago and was hesitant playing it given that my laptop has the processing power of a potato and even then i think the potato is lighter so yet another minus for this thing on lowest settings in the singleplayer act that was available i was able to get a terrible 210fps despite all of this i still enjoyed literally every second of the picture show that was playing infront of me riding in a helicopter getting to see a limited view of the still beautiful island seeing the troops and vehicles moving around below me to shortly after scaling a mountain while taking fire from well camoflagued native soldiers and rummaging through their gears to find the best sunglasses or helmet i liked every moment was constant excitement laughter or crying behind a rock as i am suppressed and see my squadmate fall and need medical attention somehow able to survive all of that with that terrible tract record i thought hey i lived im ready for multiplayer having seen countless hilarious videos of the survival or whatever the name is gamemode i joined that first as a civilian not having played much of arma other then arma ii free to play and even then in terrible fps i expected a few people to be slightly hostile but hoped deep down id find a good mate to run with shortly after spawning i found a fully loaded m4something or other nice shades a backpack and a cool helmet a few steps down the road i found a funny looking froglike apc truck with gas and decided to take it for a ride a soldier on an atv rides up infront of me i stop and say hey wanna hop i and hes already off pulled his pistol out and shot me in the face 1010 this is the driving force for an actual gaming setup my goal is to find the soldier that shot me kidnap him take his clothes pop his knee caps in the middle of the wasteland and leave him there he shall be mine
recommended
great and hooking game that keeps you engaged if youre looking for a war simulator youve found it
recommended
great game its very fun but it would be best to play with a mic multiplayer they also have some great mods
recommended
in zeus mode you can spawn hundreds of goats and blow them all up with artillery goty right here boys
recommended
this is a great military simulator and the engine compared to the last game is amazing the physics and the feel of it is just amazing the only problems i have with this game is the time period and the map is not as good as the the arma 2 maps apart from that thye game is beautiful
recommended
over 900 hours played im sure ill be well over 1k when all is said and done while the singleplayer campagn is ok the games true potential is unlocked in multiplayer this is a true military sim built by the same company that builds sims for the military with mods like breaking point battle royale wasteland and king of the hill its hard to get bored if you go deep enough down the rabbit hole you might even find yourself playing altis life the horror
recommended
a fantastic military simulation game that will provide you with hundreds of hours of entertainment it has a huge modding community constantly adding on new vechiles weapons & missions a solid performace overall & simply stunning visuals 1010
recommended
you either hate or love this game and i love it in my opinion its one of the best shooters out that that require skill that is rare these days
recommended
inconsistent performance but you soon forget about that when you realise the scale of battles and just how indepth a game it is amazing
recommended
this game is absolutely amazing it can be whatever you want it to be deliver any experience you are looking for whether that be hardcore realism like no other game imaginable shooting with your friends and driving karts simply taking in the beauty and everything inbetween this game can provide it it may be slow paced at times but this allows for a scale beyond all others in no other game can i say that i had a good time in a mission but also have used my compass more than my trigger
recommended
its a really amazing game very realistic and a variety of different gametypes i really recommend it
recommended
i really only play breaking point mod but this game is amazing even on the lowest graphic settings this game is beautiful unlike arma ii2 the inventory management is super easy to use if you like dayz then youll love breaking point so much more to offer
recommended
best game ever made nothing more to say
recommended
lots of guns lots of explosions much worth money
recommended
arma 3 is hands down one of the best war simulatorgames that i have ever played if you just want to run and gun then this game is not for you maybe cod or battlefield is something more suited for you but if you are looking for a full immersion into what war is really like then arma 3 is the game that you want or the game that you need arma 3 has hundreds upon hundreds of different mods and scenarios that you can play so that you are never bored with mods like battle royale breaking pointdayz and king of the hill you will find yourself playing for hours upon hours
recommended
as coming from arma 2 and what it gave was outstanding arma 3 atm gives alot to do from player made missions to mods with time to come am sure this game will grow the only downside is the fps lag and servers with lots of plugins and player count overall this is a great game and if you are fan of arma battlefield or just looking for a game to buy i recommend this 1010
recommended
this game is fun to play any time army simulator not just a fps but more
recommended
awesome way better then arma 2 has greatly improved should definitley pick up some time
recommended
i went from shooting a guy in the head to racing around in gokarts with machineguns attached to them 1010 would play again
recommended
great military simulator but the best part is the community
recommended
great game

if you want realism combined with awesome fps then this is a game for you if you want small maps repetetive gameplay no pshysicssorry i cant spell that word same game every year in a row on more than 10ys old engine with a bit laggy netcode and same gameplay with same gunsremodeled and screaming kids online then call of duty is the right choice for you yeah im not talking about arma here because i dont think it even needs a compliment everything it does and it was suppose to do  it does great not to mention the graphics but beware you do need a beast pc to run this smoothly on decent graphic setting long boring story this game focuses on realism also as on gameplay if youre a tactical player who wants a little bit of challenge and thinking then this gam is meant for you if youre a 12y old kid then turn around and play flappy bird on your stupid iphoneyeah im also against rippoffs  apple i am thinking of actually buying this game when i get bored of battlefield 4 to comparise if you can run this game check my specs in my profile i can run it on mediumhighwithout aa with stable 60fps my cpu is enabling me for longerlike 4000 view distance which is very useful imho not to even mention that this game has awesome community made mods for playing as example of arma2 dayz my rating 8510 pros excellent in what it does and is meant to do cons not for everyone but thats not the con well you do need quite a beast pc because if not youre in huge disadvantage
recommended
there is a dlc for go karts 1210 its okay
recommended
a huge step up from previous arma titles graphically and mechanics wise a3 has addressed nearly all the features i wanted added to increase immersion and to make the game a bit more fluid although set in the 2030s a3 retains its grounding in realism and all the military equipment in this game exists or could exist in 2013  pick it up early to save yourself about $20 before the games full release
recommended
this game is one of the most if not the most realistic shooter game i have played the multiplayer is a definate must especially if you can find a semi serious server where people work together to complete objectives all in all this game is very enjoyable and the community is great
recommended
this game is very well done it is about as close as you can get to total realism in a game this is also somewhat a downside though it makes missions being done by yourself without any ai or player assistance very difficult but if you have a group of friends to help you take on some of the missions you will enjoy this game the multiplayer is awesome before i found this game i had always been searching for a game with a gamemode that has teams with about 65 players or so each all fighting over one point the workshop feature makes the game even better being able to download new missions whenever you finish the ones you already have this is overall a pretty cool game
recommended
arma 3 is an excellent game in the way that gun play is realistic in the sence that if youre the first to shoot you usually get the kill vehicles are mega fun the general flow of the game is a lot more to my liking compared to say call of duty instead of run and gun it is probably best if you plan out what you are going to do probably the best part about arma 3 is the mods and other game modes they have 2 random examples are battle royale and altis life if you dont know what they are you should probably look them up theyre fun   but this game has down sides too such as to enjoy altis life you really have to play it with a friends otherwise its kind of hard to get into battle royale is definitely an option for lone wolves such as myself but theres a downside to that too you always seem to get a clan of 5 or 6 in every match i honestly dont understand why seeing as its a free for all they dont care though and they group up anyway to be completely honest its a game some people hate and some people love i myself love it but it really depends on if you like ultra realism like this game or the kind of realism in bf4 the things i have mentioned are my personal opinion and i really dont mean to change the view of the game for anyone

died walking up a staircase then went into space 1010

the newest iteration of the arma milsim franchise arma 3 is set in the near future on a set of mediterranean islands the single player is by far the best ive seen in an arma game and thats only after playing the first part of a three part campaign the movement and pacing in arma 3 is greatly improved in relation to arma 2 and the combat and ai are far above its predecessor
recommended
this is a very fun game and very funny whilst playing with mates on altis life but this game is buggy and are wierd for example if i volt inside a wall i start to swim in the air then die or i will drive a tank with my friends then drive into a wired fence and we all die overall i would recommend this game because it is fun and the bugs can sometimes be very funny
recommended
its the best
recommended
this game is an incredibly good one but like past bohemia works it has a long path ahead of it do not go into the steam community hub for this game it is a disgusting look at overrivliged and spoiled children who dont understand how the game works they expect it to run like triplea action shooters the reality is arma is a military simulator your character can get hurt from non combat experience he will become incredibly exhausted after running and carrying heavy gear one bullet from any range can cause him to bleed out it take time and patience to make a shot over 500m away the vehicle combat requires multiplayer players if your driving youll need a gunner and a crew chief to spot targets for the gunner helicopters are fragile and take practice for good maneuvering and landing part of combat is the journey from your base to the ao it can be anywhere from 225 minutes of no combat to enjoy this game you need to give it time the studio is still releasing content free content on an almost biweekly basis if you dont like the game than i recommend keeping quiet about and maybe return in a year or two for better opinions on arma 3 go to the arma 3 community website this steam hub is just a cesspool much like how the a2oa hub turned into a dayz orgy a year ago
recommended
this game offers an experience like no other although the learning curve is quite steep and boring this game offers literally everything from rpg environments to hardcore milsim groups if you like shooter games but you want a little more diversity and some more possibilities then this is a game for you my personal experiences with arma games could not be better with a mature community and helpfull forums aswell as an awesome modding community i have spent hundreds of hours playing everything from wasteland to missions with my friends and editingscripting missions what have i gained from this game  awesome experiences  really good keyboard controll  basic scripting knowledge  some fat <3  awesome friends  700 hours of amazing fun 1010 do recommend

you ever wonder what its like to snipe an enemy from a kilometer away well you can do it in this game which is the go to game for simulated battles forget your bullet indicator youll have to rely on line of sight and the muzzle flash from an enemy this game is fun but it shouldnt be played for short periods of time prepare to sink a couple of hours at a time and be cautious the cautious fighter will and that may mean camping and trying to scout an area from afar for at least a few minutes for enemy activity i usually play multiplayer and thats where this game shines wasteland its a survivla game pits three factions against each other in a war thats really only about getting better guns and owning certain parts of the map raiding an enemies base is always fun domination a large group of players against the ai you are tasked to take out radio towers to take control of enemy infested towns or bases they give you all the ammo it requires but this cant be done solo as the ai has very good aim and some players are soley invested in transporting troops or tanks from a helicopter

this is a good game it is fun to play but i think the intro with the helicopter is a bit to long for my liking i would give this game a 4 out of 5
recommended
this is a really good game if you like war sims and just fooling around on a big map with lots of weps and cars bottom line its just fun
recommended
i have over 300 hours plus into this game and i have to say it just might be one of my favorite pc games of all time i highly recommend if you like mass online game play and military simulations
recommended
this game can provide endless amounts of fun and entertainment it is great for being serious and tactical or goofing off
recommended
very realistic fps3rd person shooter with vehicles and gamemodes beware it is a hard game to run and requires though and patience to play well
recommended
although it may still only be in a disguised beta sort of stageits still immensly fun when you hop onto a multiplayer server try invade and annex which is what im referencing here hop into a formed up squad and clear aos with the help of coordinated allies zeus is also incredibly fun if youre into dropping people into st storms the ability to basically create your own batles is a very fun concept indeed workshop intergration allows mission creators publish their stuff easier and more people have more acess to it if you want to buy it or not i dont mind but you definetly keep your eyes on arma if incase something makes you just suddenly get the urge to buy it like many many mods and i hope to see you on the field
recommended
a more realistic battlefieldcod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free battle royal do i need to say more get dropped on an island with 30 other people find a weapon and survival of the fittest if youre the roleplaying person who likes to deal drugs have s women who sell their bodies to greasy guys or just be a corrupt cop then altis life is just the right thing for you so in general this game offers are great variety of mods its very own realism and its not full of garbage kiddies who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother like the codfanboys lel 1010 would buy again

best arma ever  love the attention to detail d

arma 3 has a great campaign and intense battles you can download and play countless singleplayer missions created by the community and even make your own with the level editor the multiplayer experince is certainly spectacular with the infinite amount of gamemodes you can play for instance stratisaltis life wasteland domination deathmatch armory and many others i recommend this game 100%
recommended
great game highly recommend

what a ing game xd
recommended
you buy this game for the engine and the possibilities not for the content this game revolves around the mod community not developerproduced content
recommended
i would give the game 4102 meows out of 100 woofs
recommended
this game amounts to about a half a pile
recommended
arma 3 hits the spot nicely loving the coop missions
recommended
great game what else can i say
recommended
this is the game ive been playing bohemians games since the first operation flashpoint cold war crisis played all the next games and still love this kind of gameplay theyve been improving the quality of it ever since and now it is an experience only playing can tell 10 ou of 10 stars
recommended
love this game
recommended
best open world sandbox game made to date fluid movement shooting and driving top tier graphics and draw distance make it even more impressive the newer dayz breaking point mod for arma 3 is also very good for how developed it is
recommended
if you have a good computer and you like in the  buy this
recommended
arma 3 is one of the coolest free roam army shooter that i have played i have played it for 66 hours with only me and my two friend you dont need much friend for this game just one or two or three arma has lots of other game mode there is modes like sandbox you can spawn items theres wasteland survive and found items like guns and cars so i give arma iii a 710
recommended
sick
recommended
great game the community is amazing and very active the content in this game offers new gameplay elements that other games may not give the option to try out this is a game you wont regret buying
recommended
arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons this time around its trump card is steam workshop integration though making downloading mods effortless a smart move by bohemia interactive because it are those mods that will give arma 3 its long lifespan unfortunately arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesnt seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts space time and perseverance are your best friends here until bohemias support starts paying off
recommended
really amazing game massivly multiplayer plus online mods
recommended
if you are expecting a normal fps experience walk away now this game is a simulator you must work with the team you are placed in this game is personally fantastic i have played the previous games in the series as well and this one is obviously the best one yet the community is amazing with adding new content and the develolpers are great too highly recommended for someone who wants to get a serious game going on this is one of the reasons to own a gaming pc personally
recommended
really fun game to play but gets really frammy sometimes i would highely recommend this game to anyone
recommended
this game is badass
recommended
do i recommend this game yes i do if you are coming from console shooters then the pace might be way too slow for you but i recommend you stick with it once you get over the adjustment you will be rewarded with some really memorable moments i found my way in to this series with armagold which still looks great to this day they all feature the same basic framework large open world your choice of weaponvehicleaircraft and a powerful editor for creating your own missions this is why it appeals to lots of us because you may have had airfix soldiers when you were younger where you set up battles on your bed using the folded quilt as custom topography arma taps into that part of you giving you the tools to create your own stories the only limit is your imagination other reviewers here im sure will have commented on the other game modes so i dont think i need to review them again prerequisites to enjoy this game are 1 patience you need to learn the controls and dont expect to be firing your weapon at enemies every second you sometimes will have to travel large distance by foot 2 a pc that exceeds the requirements it looks fantastic 3 toy soldiers as a kid
recommended
i think that if you dont have this game you should invest in it because its a great game
recommended
this game its really fun plus it has a lot of mods so the game types are endless
recommended
yes yes yes  you should buy this game
recommended
worth the money 1010 game
recommended
do you like arma ii you do good get arma iii and stop reading recommendations
recommended
if youre looking for a game thats both realistic and fun at the same time then this is the game for you
recommended
ive never tried the previous arma games before arma 3 and ive never played anything like arma its a hardcore military sim that honestly isnt for everyone but playing this games there are many spectacular moments that no other game can compare the sheer strategy and timing required in a well planned mission is intriguing the bility to edit maps and create custom missions along with steam workshop integration makes the experience more enjoyable
recommended
as a veteran of both battlefield and cod franchises i can say that this game wipes the floor with both of them due to recent computer upgrades i can finally dive into this franchise and experience what all my friends have talked about for years yes this game has its glitches bugs crashes ect but then again what game doesntyes even tf2 i have got to say this is a game that you either love it or hate it and since this game keeps me up till 3 am and gives me hours of mindless fungiving a reason why special forces is special keeping me on my toeson my butt and my head down nearly endless mods and player created content that are added everyday to keep the game fresh and giving a sense of realism that battlefield or cod cant this isnt any casual shooter that you can run at the enemy and expect them not to hit you and you suddenly regenerate health this makes you feel like youre at war should you buy it thats up to you and your bank account but in the long run its completly worth it
recommended
it is a great game to play a lot of traveling to do as well and many things to explore within the world
recommended
why didnt i get this game sooner
recommended
this is way superior to arma 2 better graphics better animations better physics alot of bugs but its to be expected on a game of this scale however with all the mods its one of the best game out there
recommended
the most immersive game ive ever played  need a beast pc to run it
recommended
aswesome game  best war simulation ever  it is worth every cent

recommended
if you loved arma 2 youll love arma 3 awesome game buy it
recommended
must buy
recommended
arma is such an amazing franchise and arma 3 is no exeption the game got over 40 weapons but with different weapons for each faction where two is very similar in arma 2 there was alot of mods like dayz or invasion 1944 but in arma 3 they added intigration with the steam workshop which makes modding really easy overall the game is amazing and definitly worth getting and i would give it a 810 with the only downside being what i feel as too few weapons
recommended
yo a this game is so swag i love teh fact that u can jump out of airplanes and quickscope people lol so fun i love planting marshellows in the ground and see them grow into full size tyronese militants this game revolves around the freeing of the small county of tyrone from ottoman rule while the ira is enforcing a heavy tax burden on the spanish navy all and all this game pushes the boudries of imagination with insane quickscope mechanics
recommended
its a very good game and lots of fun especially with some of the mods you can download
recommended
this is the definitive shooter forget call of duty forget battlefield this is leagues beyond those titles from fighting as a lone wolf to supporting a team of seventytwo other players on land above or below seas and in the sky everything feels just as it should just as it would be if it were real for those that love beutiful visuals sharp skill curves and of course bohemias trademark realism this title cannot be missed
recommended
the greatest military sim game and all of the above ever made keep up the good work guys and gals @ bohemia

aswesome game  best war simulation ever  it is worth every cent

vastly improved in movement combat and functionality arma 3 is a big improvement graphically and gameplay wise the content inside although is nowhere to be seen its still a pretty barren game with only 1 episode of the campaign but it is still very fun and i do reccomend it to fans of the arma series and even newcomers just wait for the modding community to fix most of the problems
recommended
arma 3 enhances on the arma 2 experience by running better and expanding on features to make it a lot more of a smooth experience with arma 2 movement was clunky and sometimes that could have gotten you killed in a firefight because you couldnt get in cover because of the really bad control scheme however with arma 3 that is fixed with the stances system the vehicles of arma 3 are a lot better than arma 2 it works i cant wait until mods like ace are released on arma 3 expanding on the experience even more its well worth the price although the content is slightly lacking the game expands on arma 2 loads and im sure an expansion pack like operation arrowhead will appear for arma 3 aswell buy it well worth it
recommended
a great game if you like sandbox milsims id recomend it if youre looking for a new game it is being constantly updated and its totally worth a try
recommended
arma 3 is definately improved on arma 2 and what it lacked at launch is now in the game full campaign when we start to get more maps i think arma 3 will be a very good purchase right now it is quite fun if you are in for a full military simulation however if you are looking for the aftermarket mods like dayz  or any big mods i dont think dayz will be in arma 3 for obvious reasons then you should wait a bit arma 3 was definately worth the full price and it was one of the only games in recent times to really wow me with such massive scale and for those new to the series arma 3 shouldnt be too intimidating as it has many tutorials but in game and outside it once again arma has a very good level editor which you can access from the game and begin making scenarios straight away or use external scripts for more advanced ones if you know how to
recommended
what an awesome game 
recommended
i friggin love this game d buggy as hell but i know sections  come on its too big to really know of the map better than i now my home town breakingpoint is a must have mod
recommended
this is definitely one of the hardest games i have played i mean i tried the first mission 30 times on easy and never survived the first encounter with the enemy i had to find a cheat just to get past the the first battle but the next was just as hard i dont think dark souls is this hard and it gets worse as you progress one annoying thing is when your character gets fatigued from running he starts to pant harder than a vintage german porn flick i guess nato must have lowered the standards in 2035 hell start panting after 30 meter and it gets worse if you continue to run even walking makes him sound like he a heavy smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but dont let the single player main campaign scare you from buying the game you can have much more fun with the editor it takes some time to figure it out but you can make really good missions with it the graphics is good but you need a very powerful pc to play it with high settings the fps is showing when you do the changes so you dont have to exit the menu to test it a joystick is recommended for flying the planes and helicopters the game have a good variety of weapons equipment and vehicles the ballistics add a touch of realism
recommended
some things in arma change customizable weapons customizable gear no more helicopter mfds scuba diving everything has flir bigger maps lots of vehicles lots of guns that kinda suck some things in arma never change sloppy mechanics buggy that mouse wheel menu hiking wandering walking around aimlessly 3 factions server lag sadly even with low ping sometimes verdict buy this game
recommended
extremely tactical incredibly fun to play with friends for people looking for a real military spec ops feel this is the game to get the giant maps and the ability to edit and create your own missions allows for infinite possibilities of gameplay
recommended
arma 3 is an absolutely amazing game some servers can be laggy but that is not the games fault it is such a good game with many things to do and the graphics are amazing its just like real life in a way arma 3 is amazing
recommended
the best action game made yet in my opinion with mods its really cool to create your own missionsscenarios becasue you can build pretty much everything you want to the only bad side is that the editor map can be difficult in the beginning but when you have learned how it works the game will be fantastic
recommended
a great continuation of a very successful series from a community oriented developer
recommended
this game is fun i have had loads of fun theres plenty of game modes and mods so engoy your self 1010 would play it again
recommended
very good tactical game through steam workshop offering hour days i think even months of fun and action
recommended
arma 3 is a visually stunning sequal to the legendary army simulator arma 2 although the game is amazing it still feels incomplete but because of it being one of those games that are continuesly developed i will say that it is not a major issue for what there is in the game thus far is well polished optimasation is a slight issue still but will hopefully be fixed in future updates all in all a great workinprogress title
recommended
well since the game campaign isnt finished yet ill talk about other stuff first of all altis life is awesome breaking point rocks and i havent tried wasteland yet performancewise the game is very demanding although the single player is playable for me i cant realy say i enjoy multiplayer with less than 15 fps besides i am running it on a gtx 260 and dual core xd oh and that menu music is frikken amaziiing oo
recommended
if you are looking for another fps to play like cod this is not for you this game brings a much larger meaning to combat oriented games the situations that you have to adapt to the fact that the map is about 19 sq km and how fluid everything is compared to arma ii thesse are all factors of the this game that stand out to me the most this game is not for any cod player or battlefield at that that just wants to shoot people for fun once you get used to everything and how the game is played it really latches on to you especially when you have some buddies to bring with you
recommended
the best thing about arma 3 is the open ended content you can play on it and you can get on a server with 10 of your friends and play together against the computer or other people the game has its glitches network blips that can be mitigated by going to a strong server host  game type and making sure you are close to it geographically this is because the game world is huge and you can see multiple kilometers away enemies running around and can snipe them from a distance or rocket their vehicle i am glad that dayz got me interested in the arma series as i have had a blast with them so far
recommended
free is free
recommended
yes it good game buy it

best military simulation game ever 1010
recommended
its arma2 brought to a new level which id never expect it to reach finding a clan or team and doing missions together defenitely is the most fun and epic thing ever if youre not that realistic tho there still is king of the hill which is one big bloodbath for you cod players  defenitely a 1010 if you ask me
recommended
pilot jumpsuit army vs iranians from outer space and some greek guys that suck
recommended
buy this awesome simulator and it doesnt need high powered computer for graphs
recommended
i typically do not write reviews or recommendations on alphas or betas of most game titles but it is important to note that even in its alpha stages arma3 is an awesome experience we all know that a3 is not built on a new game engine and that it is really a polished enhanced a2oa game engine with popular community addons integrated into its core combined with a graphic overhaul but you know what thats fine even knowing all that its a sweet first person experience if you do not believe in paying for alpha access then buy the game at the now reduced rate and do not play the alpha but wait for the full release but buy it its worth it
recommended
its a good game and with altis life the best game d

great game with altis life mod

this is the sequel to black ops 2 everyone throws away a bunch of the hightec stuff and now people fight more like its 2012 even though its 2030something fight against the army of greece and all of their spartans so that zombie menendez cant steal reznovs gold

played arma2 loved it played arma3 and loved it more i joined the ahoyworld team and thrashed this game hard since alpha came out and its great endless possibilities for missions with many servers editors mods and scripts awesome game to get a clan together for team play although just as fun to play alone or mp server dependent custom facesuniformsvehiclesweaponssoundstexturesvirt radios and more this game has so much potential its crazy although known for  frames 2030 on mid systems it tends to make up for that in good times to be had high spec systems will push up to 6070fps but conditional script running current spawned in objects and ai graphic effects overload will hammer some systems overall if youre system is good enough to run it and you can handle maybe turning some effects down on mid systems its an awesome game sure to entertain and war sim lovers 910
recommended
a big open wonderful military sandbox that is made even better by its active and passionate modding community
recommended
best game ever there is so much content because of people making addons missions mods all the time this is like 10000 games in 1 best purchase ive made only down side is that its in the future i mean that they are using prototype vehicles that nobody knows about it would been a 1010 game for me if they just made arma ii with this updated engine and graphics
recommended
fantastic game with a mind blowing amount of customization and a great modding community the game is a military sim and is quite true to the details though i will stress this game is very complex when it comes to the controls and customization as of now there is no easy way to create a loadout without coding in some nasty box of text there is plans to fix this but just be warned this game does require decent understanding of pc gaming due to mass amount of controls and options there is big leaning curve but i would high recommend this game
recommended
a great game if you like sandbox milsims id recomend it if youre looking for a new game it is being constantly updated and its totally worth a try
recommended
arma iii has outstanding visuals and a intense set of game play mechanics this game is not for the average fps player its for players who want more from the average fps shooter all in all it takes awhile to get into but once you find a good community to play with you have a  ton of fun
recommended
very good gamebut a little bit too heavy for a gaming pci have i5 4430 8gb ram & gtx770 and i cant handle it with 60fps while i am streamingplease just make a new patch for cpu cores because mine hits on 80& usage i am playing on high setting without antiallaiting on 54 fps on averagesoo bad for gaming rig with 2 ssds and some good parts
recommended
best game ever  you guys must buy it 
recommended
if you are looking for a proper armywar sim this is what you need forget battlefield cod and all the rest arma iii is a sandbox true as you will find sim not only that the modding community are 2nd to none adding tones of extra content
recommended
one of the most realistic shooters i have ever played if you love games where action is at every turn and everything is tramatic  this is not for you this game is about patience and time waiting for the right time to strike and getting into position for the battle once you are in battle things change and you have to adapt to them great game 1010
recommended

truly game that can call its self a simulator i have tons of fun with it and i always get amazed at how good the graphics look there is a ton of things to do you can play around the missions of the single player displaying all kinds of combat situations you could create your own made scenario and share it with others you can also live edit the combat events with the new zeus patch while playing multiplayer the game also features an realistic ballistic system including bullet drop shooting through walls also decreases damage and bullet speed and these are effected by the type of weapon you use and what kind of ammunition also the game has a lot of vehicles you can mess around with boats cars tanks helicopters planes drones and even submersibles and if that isnt enough for you than you could visited the stream workshop for many more vehicles weapons and combat scenarios i defiantly approve of this game
recommended
absolutely miles ahead of any other shooter out there its cheap as of now but snap it up soon before it goes into full release consider it a mix of any game you care to mention with amazing graphics arma 2 and the best simulator out there and youll get arma 3
recommended
if you like shooters this one has everything you could ever want in an fps simulator plus the graphics are amazing
recommended
amazing 3rd or 1st person shooter that has a very realistic feel aka simulator hard to get bored with all the user created content and the editor the controls can be a tad tough to learn at first but with in a few hours you should have them down being able to mod your game file gives you tons of customizable things to do i would recomend playing with a group of people because playing this game by yourself can tend to get boring that is the only flaw iv been able to find really aside from a few random bugs here and there
recommended
arma 3 is awesome
recommended
1010 great game and a great mods for it
recommended
im not going to say buy this game because its not for everyone if you like arma 2 or military fps shooters not cod thats more like an arcade game then yeah this game is awesome and is a leader in that market if you think this game is full on arcade style action packs bulletsbombs and metal flying all over the place its not but its just as fun as one of those games
recommended
amazing just wow graphics are so good its scary oh snap granade wait its just a game   i am a huge fan of bohemia interactive and codemasters from operation flashpoint when i was 7 dont tell anyne p  all the way to this beta game and for this price  which is steep but you will never ever run out of missions to create want to kill a government leader get a mod of that guy and do it  and the ai are tough to kill but if you catch them by suprise they are alot easier to destroy and no spamming units in warfare will help its all about strategy and with the new uavs and ugvs  im suprised the millitary doesnt use it to train their teams  would be crazy to even think about that but we have alot to learn from games to sum this up in two words buy it
recommended
arma 3 is a great game to play with friends
recommended
when you play this game you will become karma charger
recommended
as of late i find this game to be alot more entertaining that the current dayz although the dayz graphics are better in some ways this just has so much more to do other than runforever
recommended
this game grew on me one of my favorite youtubers plays this somewhat often so i was decently familiar with the idea of the game before a few friends told me to get it weve played a few of the multiplayer modes and recently been playing the battle royale mod which is a blast when you finally get into a reliable server as others have mentioned this is more of a combat simulation its unforgiving which is why players need to use actual tactics to accomplish a goal sometimes things get slow but that only helps to make confrontations way more exciting im looking forward to trying out much more of what this game offers which is a lot
recommended
very enjoyable war simulator the story is a little weak but who cares when it looks this good the multiplayer is what its all about really with a variety of servers and game modes 7510
recommended
this game is not for the console kids that play cod all day this is a difficult but fun game if you look at the negative reviews on it the reviewers have 300 to 700 hours in this game thats not the amount of hours you put in this game if you dont like it i dont get it anyways if you choose to buy this game get vac it will save your life the community behind this game is huge and there is always new player created missions and content available theres also breaking point mod for arma 3 basically dayz for arma 3 which i think is better than sa the guys saying they get low fps one saying he gets 10 frames its a demanding game play it on something besides the laptop you bought at walmart bohemia labels it a military sim thats what it is its most def not a run and shoot
recommended
the most realistic war simulator ever made i wont give it a 1010 because of its bad support for old graphics cards 910
recommended
this game is amazing straight up no ifs ands or buts about it it does fall short in some areas compared to previous titles for example the vehicle selection is tiny compared to arma2 but this will likely change over the course of the games life as bi is releasing new content in sections like the campaign then of course there are the myriad of mods to tide you over  if youre at all into milsim or hardcore fps games youre probably going to love this the games biggest strength is simply that you can do almost anything you want to in it you want to drive into the target area with a sub swim to shore and rise out of the water like a navy seal you can do that want to fly in in an ah6 loaded for bear you can do that want to fly a jet drive a tank skydive attack at night use a mortar be a sniper fly an attack heli or just go in as a footsoldier arma 3s got you covered its as it is advertisedthe ultimate military sandbox probably going to be my favourite or one of my favourite games of 2013 and 2014 especially in terms of longevity
recommended
best game in the world
recommended
with the right mods and people this is about as close as you want to get to actual combat [at least for the ground warfare] armas best feature is the dedicated modding community you can find a mod for just about anything for arma the game simulates fatigue breathing and pain effect as well as weapon weight meaning that there wont be anybody out shooting a sub machine gun with a long rifle after being shot in the chest at near point blank range there is a pretty good balistic simulation for vanilla arma but you can find mods for very realistic ballistics i love pretty much everything about arma except these two things of course nothing is perfect the game requires a pretty powerful computer setup to run effectively even with my nvidia 770 graphics card larger battles decrease frames quite a bit and finally armas controls can be rather clunky at times the stancelean controls specificly it can be a problem at close range where a real human could move much faster overall 9510 definetly worth the price if you can run it and enjoy teamwork and tactical combat
recommended
an amazing game 6510 as i started from the alpha of arma 3 i noticed as the game progressed i lost my ability to not only run the game once it hit beta but also blue screened three times ive had multiple problems and even mangaged to fix the issue after hours and hours of searching for the answer to the issues now as beta was a complete horror and full release was right around the corner i decided like many others to quit playing and go back to some good old arma 2 ace and waited till the games full release as i was pumped for the full release i noticed that nothing had changed from the beta same maps same vehicles same sounds same weapons and same factions the lack of things for the sea was a huge disappointment because the arma 3 engine actually has a working water system and it was completely wasted the lack of air vehicles especially no big cargo plane makes traveling on altis boring and hard to move from place to place although it says its a arma game i dont feel as if it compares to its counter parts yes a graphical update has been put up for the game itself but after playing arma 2 i dont feel the immersion of armagold edition and arma 2 in arma 3 but it does have alot of neat things like futuristic vehicles amazing hud system stance system amazing animations ability for both customization over weaponaryuniform and a bunch of downloadable modsmaps that can keep you playing for hours just like arma 2 im just disappointed that they didnt take their time on this game why couldnt they have made this game better by looking at what players loved in the previous games like the ace mod or even some of the other cool things like i44 vte and etc although all the bad things i have said its still a game in development and could possibly have a big turn around i just hope this game becomes better in the future so i can start enjoying it again
recommended
mixed emotions about this one bought it when it was 40 bucks kinda wish i didnt only real good parts about this are customizing levels of your own custom koth servers are good too other than that i didnt really enjoy this i was hoping a lot more from arma 3 arma 2 still has unlimited gameplay in it rp servers and normal servers if you want a good war sim this is pretty good if you want a semigood war sim with basically unlimited gameplay arma 2 i dont exactly recommend this game but its pretty okay 6410
recommended
the main story can be really hard as it is very realistic so you can die in a few shots but the mods are so fun  910

very fun to use the graphics and realism aspect of the game is extreme the firefights are intense and its easy to be immersed into the combat the vehicle including aircraft submarines helicopters interiors are nice to look at as well zues before this addon i couldnt get up close to watch a firefight without getting shot this makes a great rts and a pleasurable theater of war go karts i was kind of confused about this addon a war simulator with go karts i got it tried it out and to be honest it wasnt that bad bohemia interactive was trying something new it was apreciated

hello everyone thematrixman here giving my review on this fantastic game so if you have played arma 2 this is a huge jump in the right direction personally i didnt like arma 2 due to its crappy controls and bugs however i did like the big open atmosphere which arma 3 keeps and even out does it if i say do so myself i gonna be straight out with you guys i have not beat the campaign yet because of difficulty and just lack of interest the multiplayer is really the way to go as well as player made levels i recomend playing capture the island for it puts this game to its max and create the intensity of a real war overall if you are ever wanting to play cti msg me and we can frag some noobs the commaning is really crisp and you often have to think on the fly which is great for people who like strategy like me the ai arent that bad as they can fly helicopters better than me but driving is another story psst if you put them in relax mode they will only drive on roads so i conclude that this game will provide you with endless entertainment and i hope to see some of you online this is matrix signing out

i was half way through a very long operation which a friend created and my tv remote slipped and fell on my keyboard i threw a grenade reloaded went to prone and opened my backpack in all one hit then i ran up a slight incline and was fatigued we were then contacted from the south and a turned to see a squad my cod experince thought huh four guys easy i soon came to realise that even anybody can kill you in this game with ease a few shots down range at me and i was to shakey to even locate my target in my sights i got shot in the head and ragdolled down a hill the last save point was 20 minutes before this i decided to try a campaign mission where you are alone with a guy in a forest i was following him close behind and he stepped on a mine and killed us both turns out youre not meant to be close to this guy i played again and kept very far away from him i stepped on a mine this time and died a brutal shakeemup with a massive sandbox to blow things up in youre not even safe in the scripted events

arma is the most impressive ambitious challenging and rewarding game i have ever played arma is best enjoyed with friends and teamspeak the mod community is outstanding and our clan has really gotten into mapscenariomaking if you are new to arma id recommend first hopping in to a king of the hill hostile takeover is pretty good you can lonewolf it by casually moving with teammates you can take the next step and ask if someone has an ingame group going and move with them you can take the greatest and most rewarding step and join a group in teamspeak feel free to reach out to me personally for tips or if youd like to play with our community magnuslegionet

one word for this gamegreat how many hours does a normal ea title entertain you for like 6070 bucks 58 hours maybe 1012 hours arma3 is easily crushing those titles because of replayability nearly endless options of customization building your own szenarios scripts addons islands you can even find gametypes and mods that change the way to play arma3 they modify it to be played apart from the original way to play it those mods and missions are boiling point wasteland altis life rpg some might hit their heads now to a table as this isnt the way arma is meant to be played but it shows whats possible with the game and the engine at all  this is what gamers want a long term motivation look at my game hours d and a huge sandbox to be entertained for years sure there are bugs and features the communitiy is mostly right to complain about but the steps bis did to fulfill the wishes of the community involved changing parts of the team also since like 67 month the developing and bugfixing gets faster arma 3 in a nutshell a tactic shooter with simulation elements you have to actually think before making a move you can have great battles both coop and teamvsteam the mod support for this game is really great as above user created content like islands content addons mods missions campaigns replacements even a normal battle between a fireteam gets you harder than it would on every other game here around if you search for a game where you are entertained for years a semirealistic warfare combined arms gameplay an open world sandbox game then look no further trash the other games and get in soldier

this is arma 3 the game we have been waiting for forever to improve our arma experience for along time coming the game does add lots of cool new features to arma but the vanilla version of arma 3 lacks content if you are planning to mod it and play with a group of people then i highly recommend arma for you but in the long run without mods this game lacks content 710 update instead of actually adding content to this game theyve decided to release all the content this game needs as dlc very disappointing and cash grab move from bis

this game is fantastic infact it is the most immersive game i have ever played i realized this when me and some random person i met found each other on a wasteland server and survived by the skin of our teeth savenging items raiding towms and dying a little too many times in the varied and colorful landscape of altis this is only just a small part of the game that i happened upon so believe me when i say that i cant wait to discover the rest of it

if you want realism in a shooter this is where you go the bullet drop and lag make this game challenging along with the one shot death`s that happen alot using their new cover system you can go behind cover and shoot stuff that you never could before

this game is sweet but really need a high end rig to exprience the game

i barely got this game and let me tell you i had the most terrifying experence ever to me that is i just finished basic training and finally knew how to play and understand this game i joined a king of the hill server with 103 people in the game as i joined i bought the first gun given to you and went on i marked where my objective was at and catched a ride from a fellow teammate flying a helicopter over to the objective i introduced myself to him he introduced his name as well his name was john as we were waiting for more teammates to join us on the ride to the objective we chatted about this war trying to rp here and he joins me in rping as we were chatting he told me that he been playing this game for 769 hours now and that he was going to quit soon i told him i understood why the helicopter was full now and we began to lift off and go to the objective as we were going there we were shot at and began to crash everyone jumped off and was killed me and john were still inside the helicopter that was falling slowly he told me jump go now you er i jumped and made it into the ocean with a broken leg i swam up as fast as i can and saw the helicopter slowly fall and crash into the mountain side and then exploded i swam to shore quickly and patched my leg up and ran to crash i found his dead body and said in chat rip in pieces john i took his gun which was better then mine and ran to the battlefield as i made it to the battle field there were explosions gunshots helicopters crashing and then exploding and people dying right in front of me i have indeed seen some  i saw a fellow soldier on the ground i asked if he was ok he replied does it look like im ing ok im crawling for s sake when i could be running at the hill and be taking it over i said ok ok here i dropped a med kit and ran to the hill we were suppose to take over i saw 3 enemies run pass me i shot at them and killed 2 one of the enemies saw me and began to fire at me and shot at me chest once i ran and the enemy followed as i thought i was going to be found and then shot i attempted to heal up but then he found me and was about to fire when 2 teammates came to me and killed the enemy i thanked them healed up and ran to the belly of the beast i met a teammate being shot at heavily and was wounded i told him to run to me he told me he couldnt he was hurt and couldnt run i threw a gernade at the area where all the enemies were shooting at and got a double kill but 2 enemies survived he had time to run towards me and survive but as he tried to run towards me a sniper got him in the leg and made him crawl as he was about to die he told me to run the sniper finished him off and hen payed attention to me the sniper shot me injuring me and i began to crawl 4 enemies ran toward sme and all four shot at me and i respawned 10 out of 10 will get shot at by 4 people and wounded by a sniper again

this is a good game p

bought this while it on was on sale for 50% off so far it has been well worth the money and i plan to keep playing for quite some time so far i have experienced hilarious moments with friends and in online servers but at the same time ive experienced milsim roleplaying and taking scenarios and missions much more seriously which is a blast as well although there can be an fps problem at times which i have not experienced very much at all i highly reccomend the game with the in depth combat gameplay amazing graphics and and huge mod selection i cant complain much highly recommended
recommended
arma 3 is a war simulator but gets used for a lot of other reasons example wasteland altis life etc but there are a few problems with it as it still just been released example the fps on servers are very bad and i know its not my computer as many other people has complained about it but overall it is worth the $60
recommended
do you like a good shooter are you a strategist are you more inclined to play on hardcore servers in other games when you get the chance then this might just be the game for you the realism and beauty in arma 3 will blow you away with heaps of multiplayer game modes avaliable for you to play there will certainly be one that you will enjoy and if multiplayer isnt your thing then why not download one of the many custom made high quality scenarios created by the community steam workshop integration allows for endless fun on scenarios that you can enjoy alone or with friends this is a game you really must try

after playing altis life for the first time i accomplished holding a guy up at a peach tree field outside kola or however its spelled i didnt know how to pick the peaches so i made the guy pick em for me at gunpoint i then made him take off his cloths why i did this i dont know but it was very amusing he picked a couple hundred peaches handed them to me after doing so he booked it to my truck which i stupidly left unlocked he got in my truck pulled a uturn and hit me i some how survived this with very low health like very god damn low he had to get rid of the evidence including me he pulled me off the road and behind one of the houses he waited for me to bleed out i told him he didnt have to do it that he was a good person he just sat there and waited after a few moments the light faded it was game over i goofed best first time playing arma iii ever 1010
recommended
one of the most epic games ever made if you want a true simulator of a soldier  arma iii is the way to go i recommend it to every hardcore player there
recommended
from the perspective of a player that hasnt experienced the previous 2 armas this game is great its provided something that ive wanted for a long time a sandbox army based modable campaign the graphics are lovely and customization is very vast the dlc is actually worth it for once and i cannot wait for more to come out very good game get it if you like combat  1010
recommended
one of the best games you can get building on the old arma games this is a new chapter in the armaverse that allows you to create realistic or not  military scenarios unlike cod or bf4 arma 3 is a game that you can make what you want in it take a look at armaholic for example its not a storepage of hats to buy but a list of mods that add to the game you can edit create adjust so many times half of the game is creating the missions let alone play them if you want to make the best of arma 3 join a groupclan and get in on the dedicated missions altis life has its place but does not compare to actual teamwork

the best simulator and its called arma literally the best game ive ever played

why why why is this game so lagy i get 14 fps and i have a i7 4790k @ 47ghz and a msi r9 285 if i put all max i get like 14 to 40 fps on a good sever but wen i put all low i get 14 to 40 fps like wtf why is this game so bad like what do i need my pc cost 1700$ like really and yall see why ppl go to consols fix this my god you have a very nice game and ppl still play it even if they only get 14 fps with the top of the line hardware this is ridiculous

probably the best milsim game i have ever played 1010
recommended
this game is a definite improvement over its predecessor despite the optimization issues for those running lower level intel rigs or midhigh level amd rigs even on low this game looks impressive and if you have an intel cpu or high level amd cpu & decent gpu either brand you should be able to run it on high where the visuals are sure to impress the ai has improved over arma ii though not tremendously you will still have issues commanding your squad to do exactly what you want them to but theyre not quite as derpy if you decide to get this game youre definitely going to have fun with it i strongly reccommend to google custom optimisation settings and tinker with it until you have the most stable frames you can achieve finally the modding community for this game is excellent there are plenty of great mods on the workshop and community sites like armaholic
recommended
get this
recommended
this game is very enjoyable my personal favorite game mode is wasteland because it takes the least ammount of time to get into the action the game has amazing graphics and the game play is extremely enjoyable i personally havent came across a bug yet since ive played there is many game modes and such and i feel like this is basically another garrys mod for the simple fact that you can play it for countless hours and never get bored

this is the most realistic you will ever get in a military simulator i have over 50 hours on it and have never been so amazed by the content it has to offer not only do you have all this great stuff as in sniping cqb tanks and vechical combat but there is an editor for testing and making missions scenarios there has also been a new bootcamp update added in that lets mods and more expirenced builders of missions expand their ability to create missions

arma is a great series of games and the scope of each title is always more impressive than its predecessor yes like those it follows arma 3 has its bugs but these are in no way irritating at most they are hilarious because you become immersed with experience of being a lethal weapon methodically removing enemy ai from their short lived lives when all of a sudden the yells and laughs of comrades hoovering in a tank or being instakilled by randomly exploding vehicles that touched a small pebble breaks the cycle its a game you have to try out you can get into the game quite easily and add to your knowledge as you go but dont be a lone wolf and complain it was boring arma is about team work and not your call of duty or battlefield tdm capture the flag ballsbut actual teamwork where communication and learning your place in a squad keeps you all alive the ai on this game is effective  they will suppress they will surpise and they definetly do more than just flank you from obvious places its very dynamic and lonewolfs die quickly a good squad will have a much higher survival rate so get yourself in a game be a local on the server and join in with regulars to have the best experience there is a lot to learn but arma 3s new tutorial system is far superior to older versions of the game and many of the players online are very helpful heaps of content & the workshop has lots more additions goto armaholic for the best and widest range of addons my only gripe is that they can still be somewhat difficult to install so it maybe best to use a loader im a big fan of the arma series and this one has raised the bar again get your s off cod & bf and play a real game 1110
recommended
i think this is a great game you will probably learn alot of it depending on how you play it you can play either ways the typical action game way or the simulator way but back to the point there is so much to do in this game theres a big map and great graphics a well made game worth buying if youre into these games
recommended
you like realistic military games than this game is for you arma series has impressed me yet again steam workshop for this game pretty much adds a brand new game to arma 3 i use to play the deathmatch for arma or the coop for arma but now i find myself playing stratis life which is a life simulator game gets updated a lot and adds new stuff every month game is worth every penny pros open world military game everything is driveable small caves firefights are intense cons dlc are overpriced buggy

this game might be the best game ever it both got the tactical wastelandtake peoples base build base etc  an rpg mode that are really well done if u want a game that u actully learn from buy this

this game is a military simulator its very fun to play and instead of running into rooms guns blazing like most shooters there is a lot more stratergy in this it has quite a few mods that you can download from playwithsix and the workshop now im in a group called special team delta and we do operations every weekend and they are pretty fun even without my group i can have fun on public servers playing wasteland or koth the story is very good and is a good length there are optimisation problems with the game i cant really get over 50 fps on high with my $900 computer but even on 15fps it is still playable

i used to play a little bit of arma 2 back in the day but arma 3 sure takes the series to the next level the game runs better and smoother in general the graphical detail is sure as hell better its basically a repackaged arma 2 without cheap and incorrect copy and paste like eas bf4 most of the games content is user created by you and others within the arma community so youll never get bored its arma so its buggy but thats fine if you played or like arma 2 or operation flashpoint there is no reason that you shouldnt buy this game excellent game best $35 spent on steam 910 id give 1010 if there was more official content start by playing the base game and its campaign and server downloadable mods then download yourself some proper mods like battle royale or breaking point
recommended
this game where do we start well for starts is a good game with alot of game modes by default king of the hill is probably one of the good ones for solo players or domination if you like teamplay so this game is by no means bad vanilla but there is a problem it suffers from the same thing that titanfall does it lacks content of course there are a plethura of things to do but what the game does on its on really isent enough that being said this game truely shines with its modabilatiy and is best played with mods as they improve the gameplay alot so overall its a good game and i would buy again if it were lost somehow

keeping it real  bohemia is one of very few developers making games for the pc platform besides beeing a very beautiful game the frenchise is pushing the envelope and bringing you a community game  modable and keeping you the player the most important part of the game on todays gamesmarket the arma experience is like no other this game is one of the reasons why we still buy personal computers  cus we like to play personal games  buy it

this is one of those games you get because of the mods the core game is nice but the mods is what really makes it battle royale arma 3 dayz altis life rpg and many more things to do with this masterpiece military simulator its a big step up from arma 2 however arma 2 inc operation arrowhead have a few more things this doesnt have like island life great game overall

best preferred game in military simulation game this game is just not about military simulation but also have other roles such as rpg and survival challenges well i would like to say this game is mainly preffered for coop and working with real tactics of the army arma 2 brought me to buy this game at the pre orders itself getting it more and more playing the whole time and making new stuffs not only that it allows you to create own missions which is more good thing then any other games which have pre defined misisons are available this game also allows modding making the game whole next level third person shooters are very less available but this is surely best example for third person if you have vr glasses i would prefer to use it in first person as this game is so much realistic  hoping to get new updates about and the game and heads up if you want to buy the game

how to fully enjoy arma iii in my oppinion 1 get a launcher to run it with armaiiisync is great that way you can tweak the performance so it runs properly and it makes it easier to run mods 2 find a good clan to play with i can heartily recommend the vdvgru if you like serious milsim experiences in a friendly enviroment no matter your starting skill level be advised we use a lot of mods and we play as russians so be prepared for a lot of aks and shooting at natofriendly forces 3 get some good mods to shape your arma experience the way you like have fun sincerely efreitor hansen  bravo lmg 1 squad ccompany 45th light recon detacthment of the vdv russian airborne arma titles not real life

do you want realism well let me tell you in simple details how fuc awesome this game is sure a few glitches and errors but when you get it youll say its all worth the investment this simulator beats all of the other armed assualt series by graphics meaning textureterrain and others the sound is great just needs a little tweak customization for soldiers wicked i would recommend this game by my fullest ability no game can beat the realism of this game its just simply astonishing & jawdropping

when i played this game for free and it was only for two days my bro and me could not stop play arma 3 wasteland is all we played i highly recommend this game if you are in to big maps first preson shooter best game i ever played in years

good game but not worth 60 bucks

arma 3 is a game you will either love or hate ves2 is the actual simulator this game is based off of and yes simulator no rambos in this game no running into a little hut with a 50 in one hand and an rpg in another blasting guys who all take 5 years to aim their gun at you rather youve been walking for a half hour with no enemy contacts then in seconds you have bmps on your  like its ww3 save do i run north through the town and try to hug the walls nope bmp painted you from the hill to the ne double back around the coastline nope a chopper just landed some spetznaz looking dudes on the coast who take you down without reservation turn east and run straight for the trees nope that bmp to the ne is still holding you down no no no no since youre flanked to the front and rear its advised to draw fire from both crossing their firelines and reducing their shock value even slowing down the sf behind you as a bmp is firing in their direction now that the bmp to the ne has shifted into the town to avoid friendly fire you have only one chance to book it east into the trees which isnt easy with sf on your  everyone knows how clunky arma can be when comparing it to medal of honor or call of duty then yeah its a pretty clunky game its like the actor actually has to catch his footing before running rather than kindve gliding atop the surface oh and gahd this game sucks i cant even get into a doorway because your freakin sniper rifle is clipping the doorframe because afterall in real life soldiers just clip their rifles through walls to get around tight hallways tldr if you have always wanted a game that made you feel like a real soldier in a massive battle this is the one for you if you want akimbo uzis and love to spam insults at the other players stick to call of duty

i could tell you all about this game after near 800hrs 790hr at the time of writing but i wont because i dont want any call of duty or battlefield fanboys coming in and ing up my game   i mean really i should tell you to buy it because the only thing arma shares with cod and bf is that you shoot peopleok well cod i havent liked since modern warfare 2 and bf i grew out of as it was a good series that basically just got  all over by big companies seeking quick profits anyway arma on the otherhand has been around just as long as these two but perhaps didnt spend so much on its marketing campaign and put more of its budget into making their games i cant say for sure but if youre into realism not photorealism like you call of duty cs and military simulation types whether it be tank sims combat flight sims or just good old fashioned fps types of games youre probably going to enjoy some part of arma thats one group of people that could enjoy this then theres the creative types have you ever wanted to drop a fishing trawler from 20000ft onto an airport runway filled with fuel trucks planes helicopters tanks cars whatever you fancy just for fun to test your pcs capacity or performance you can do this have you ever thought of a scenario and wanted to see how it might play out with two or more opposing factions in some kind of freaky multinational royal rumble in the middle of nowhere with armour air and infantry forces going at each other  i know i never did until i played with the mission editor in arma 2 i played around making small missions in the previous games but not really until arma 3 did i experiment with weird  like that its quite fun for wasting time and it looks great anyway you guys could keep reading or you could be downloading it as you read its worth whatever the price is at the moment i dont really care how much it is its worth it ive been playing this series since 2001 in the very beginning back when it was a codemasters game operation flashpoint ing awesome game if youre currently in the military plan to enlist in the future or have previously served and want realism  buy arma join a tactical realism clan or milsim group depending on your preference theyre both the same to me immersive groups are best warning not so much a warning but if you have ptsd and are triggered easily perhaps this isnt your thing having ptsd myself i can safely say this game will scare the absolute  out of you occasionally depending on how you play and what triggers you or maybe just ease into it i cant tell you not to get it its an awesome game just try to remember that its just a game easier said than done in some cases like mine i couldnt play properly for a week but thats another story that i dont think you need to know about ha best game ever  possibly not best storyline i liked arma 2s campaign better but everything else in arma 3 is ing awesome  dont take my word for it though try it out  oh did i mention upto 64 player online multiplayer coop pvp etc and thousands of servers internationally im australian and even we have low ping servers to  around on ahh i think thats it i chose not to technically review the game because it doesnt need a review there are plenty out there just dont go with any saying anything negative about it theres very few things that i dont like about it and the list gets smaller each day with the devs constantly releasing new fixes or dlc buy this game i bought it in its alpha stage and the list of bugs was relatively small back then so you can imagine what its like now after having been out officially over a year now

todays review arma3 short scorebased review longer review below overall [7390] singleplayer [710]  the game is hard you would do well to save as often as possible multiplayer [810]  its great for multiplayer sadly the ingame browser still lacks refresh button and fails to ever find the server you want to find on a properly forwarded server still stakes 30m  1hour of tinkering for your friends to find it vehicles [ 710]  vehicles are cool plentiful feel well balanced and responsive weapons [910]  lots of weapons with now as added bonus you can customize them multiplayer missions [310]  couple of premade missions most of them proof of concepts no real fun to be had untill you download some from workshop or armaholic i recommend playing my zeus based map which is like playing with a dungeon master who can spawn everything and anything if not that use their awesome easy to use editor and make one yourself editor [610]  it works but doing advanced stuff requires lots of google usage lots of wiki diving and being best friends with the bohemia interactive website also doesnt generate a full mission as it does not include some sort of default descriptionext in the mission file dlc[3340] 1 zeus [1010]  play as a dungeon master make a scenario on the go & its free 2 karting [810]  make races drive in karts and wear the arma 3 karting outfit adds racing elements for race lovers 3 marksman [910]  adds weapons loadouts weaponmods some items facepaint garrage  its good trust me 4 helicopter [610]  adds two helicopters and helicopter pods adds sling loading aka pick stuff up and drop it elsewhere long review below if you have played arma 2 and loved it you will love arma 3 its the same game with better graphics a lot of additions and great changes anyone can just say that though so lets get into some specific as to why arma 3 is a great game for fans of the series and for new players lets start with some points for new players arma 3 is a realistic military combat simulator or that is at least what im going to call it every iteration seems to contain 2 big landmasses one is generally a lot bigger in this case the big landmass youll probably find yourself always playing on is altis its big varied from mountainous to large flats and has a small dessert the game comes with many vehicles for both ground air and water transportation as well as combat we have well known vehicles and newer imaginary versions based on existing vehicles there are also uavs that can be controlled by a single or multiple players as for the gameplay you play as the traditional teams bluefor opfor independant or civilian movement system is great feels very fluid and responsive vehicles can be damaged as a whole or you can shoot out their tiresengine realistic physics allow for some holy  moments no seriously if you have no idea how physics apply to fast moving vehicles this game will teach you by making your car roll over at high speed bends or lets not forget the time i drove a truck on top of a plane hangar because i hit a quadbike then bounced up onto a sand barrier which launched me in the correct angle and with my speed i made it up there then i asked an admin for salvation because falling off was certain death player damage can range from just a fleshwound to holy  my  leg is gone medic if you get shot in a leg you wont be able to run etc 10 for pain uhhhh ahhhh uuuuuuuuhhhh arma 3 is mainly a big sandbox missions can let you roam all of it or just a small ao still you know at all times that everything you see is somewhere you can go almost all buildings can be entered and interestingly with enough explosives almost all of them can be destroyed into nothing but ruble too for veteran players its arma 2 with better graphics and some improvements the old maps can still be played and included with mods warning button bindings make sense now g  grenade i  inventory car mirrors now actually work lots of overhauls to the core game systems helicopters from the dlc pack now can lift cars vehicles boxes ingame server browser is still  arma 3 has a launcher which allows you to play without battleeye if you dont want your computer data compromised no seriously before accepting read the tos for using battleeye i think most people would disagree if they actualy read it you can still play without agreeing to it arma 3 zeus maps aka make your own fun on the go its a sandbox dungeon master its fun try it arma 3 has arma 3 dayz epoch its great try it if you love zombie survival racing is now possible karting and other vehicles too ai are improved no longer  and are deadly at close and long range expect to be fighting them like trained professionals because they will wreck you for the rest its basicly the same as arma 2 i guess simply if you liked arma 2 then buy this one youll love it its worth it thank you for your time

arma 3 takes me back to the days of deltaforce long time ago it being a thoroughly enjoyable tactical military shooter albeit with its own special glitches and graphics fails the interface may seem somewhat clunky at first but you soon overcome that and although the game has many controls they quickly become familiar and are relatively intuitive the scales and graphics on arma are pretty impressive although as in many games the graphics are less impressive up close less the textures and more the number and complexity of objects however with a game of this size if each house was packed with objects you can bet the frames are going to take a massive hit what bohemia have done is find a reasonable balance with this generally the environment looks great there are some questionable physics interactions which can make for some strange happenings although that is part of the charm with arma if you want a military sim that generally plays pretty well with a decent amount of guns and vehicles to mess about in then this is well worth it whilst not quite as slick as some games built on newer game engines arma does hold up pretty well

bohemia interactive never stop surprising me when you think they reached the best anyone can do you notice the beta or alpha in the name that tells you that isnt even the best they can do from arma ii and pretty much all the expansion packs to arma iii if you enjoy a realistic war simulator or wasting times in the huge amount of mods you can find for the game looks like skyrim this is your game
recommended
not many games will amaze me but this one did i did not belive that arma 3 would stand a chance to arma 2oa but it gives it a good run for its money only downside to arma 3 is the lack of weapons and vehicles but mods seem to patch that right up good job bohimia interactive

great game tons of possibilities and modability although lacking serious realism factors at its current state such as weapon sway said to be fixed  which in reallife being a gun owner say i ran a quarter mile as fast as possible i stop and aim my gun you hold your breath as much as possible since its necessary but in this holding your breath is nothing and it is the exact opposite of what real life is like your gun will be bouncing literally side to side on your screen after a long walk when you actually need it youll be hitting 510 feet left and right of a target 30 yards in front of you ing rediculous and the fact that the dlcs even exist is  imagine getting into a wasteland server seeing a heli and you want to fly off in it then you scroll wheel up to it get in yeah all gud in tha hood rite wrong without paying $1599 for two helicopters you will be kicked out and not able to fly it is it just me or is $16 rediculous to fly 2 new helicopters yes i own it because i bought the dlc bundle im not saying dont buy arma but think about the stupidity running through their heads about these ideas might i also mention that the helicopter physics in the afm advanced flight model is somewhat exagerated in some areas speaking of the afm its optional which is stupid because like 1200 people are actually using it now which makes the dlc a god awful waste of time

mcdonalds is a good game i would recommend it

arma 3 is a game that you love or hate if you liked the previous armagames you wont have a lot of problems getting into arma 3 quickly pros improved hud improved movement and more control over your character great graphics good for simulation but also provides a lot of fun due to the variety of missions you can play from racing to a life simulator you will find something that fits your taste amazing player interaction and great to make new friends overall fun to play with other a variety of workshop content cons the controls while being better than in arma 2 are still rather unresponsive very demanding when you want to play the game at high setting and a good framerate especially when youre playing online altis and stratis are very boring maps that dont bring a lot of tactical possibilies nor are they really fancy fences and rocks will be your worst enemies very few weapons and equipment to chose from this list might be uncompleted i will add further points when i encounter them while playing the devs are still working hard on this game and are releasing some reasonably priced dlcs that add new gameplay elements such as new vehicles new mechanics or new weapons aswell as free updates to balance and fix any issues that might accure after all i highly recommend this game wether you like military simulations or not you will have a lot of fun with the variety of possibilities this game gives you
recommended
arma 3 is way more than a game arma 3 has a vast variety of things to do in the game and it gives you an amazing feeling of what its like being in the military you can fly a helicopter or planes roll out with a tank or an ordinary car you can use boats etc this game also has amazing graphics and it feels like your in the game but the best part is the developers they have made the game way better than when it came out and they continue to do so 1010

arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community you will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title the game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like arma 2 for example personally i used to be big on the battlefield series but once i started playing arma it was arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter the depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing everything fromt he graphics to physics to sound effects are really good oh and if you dont want to use the vanilla stuff again theres mods even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one theres also a really fun multiplayer mode called zues which is essentially dungeons and dragons meets first person modern day shooter one player acts like the dm and the others play in his  her world allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly this one gets my whole hearted thumbs up for information on how to mod your game check out this youtube video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkk6rswmivyi

general arma 3 is an amazing game that simulates real military actionobjectives and tacticsonce you start the game for the first time you will see that there are tonns of controls and commandsbut youll get the hang off it eventually well start off with the campaignyou play as corpral kerry in the nato forcesaltis and stratis the two main islands are being invaded by csatbad guyseven though there is nothing you can do about itthe nato forces are trying to force them backand near the end of the campaign you have two choices try and find out where jamesfriend is or play a part in the final stand against csatdepending on the choice you choose you could win or losethe map editor is a good addition it alows you to create your own missions or you could just tour upand down the islands like i dothe scenery on the islands look amazing and realistic and driving at night is even better the realistic weather is by far the best weather youll see in a long timelike if the start of a mission is suny the weather will probably change drasticalyit is also very easy to get lost in the vast open world at night but the accurate star map should help you find your way also look out for animals like goatsdeer and rabbits on landin the sea there are fishturtles and sharks to make you nervous when diving there is a dedicated community on steam workshopthey create player made missions weaponsvehicles and mods there are also updates rolling in frequently to improve the game aircraft the aircraft in the game look well designed from helicopters to jet fighters but you do have to be a certified aircraft pilot if you want to play multiplayer or a lot of people will laugh at you because you crashed the 3 million dollar aircraft land vehicles the land vehicles also look well designedthe selection of tanks in the game are plentifulthe civilian cars are good for exploring the huge islands and the infintry transport look and drive just like they should water transport there arent as much boats as there are land vehicles but there doesnt need to bethere are 2 civilian boats and 2 military boats there are also submarines as well pros 1 great simulation 2 big open world to explore 3 amazing scenery 4 well designed vehicles cons 1 hard to learn aircraft piloting over all score 810

seriously its not your average battlefield or call of duty shooter far from this is real war simulation what all possible factors included if you want to wage war like a real soldier in lifelike situations this is a game for you this game however has many different controls and doesnt exactly have a userfriendly control because you need to press multiple buttons mostly to even execute one action apart from basic movement and such but if youve ever played any other bohemia interactive game you should already know that other than these hardtomaster controls this game is truely amazing breathtaking and even lets you use an editor for putting together your own missions i personally like it for combat flight simulation

honestly hands down the best realistic fps ever the authenticity just by itself is worth the price but the multiplayer is phenomenal and very tactical and fun highly recommend this game but there is one thing this game needs to be optimized i have gtx titan and i still get from anywhere 2065 fps which is unacceptable like really 20 fking fps but other than that super fun

if you are considering buying this game read this first let me say this i really enjoy this game its massive open world environment makes it an awesome combat simulator it comes with fun stock game modes and has a good fan base but if you really want to have fun i highly reccommend playing some mods such as breaking point battle royale and altis life to name a few pros large open world terrain challenging gameplay there is a thrill everytime you play it never gets old good mod support lots of vehicles air land and water realistic engine almost endless possibilities cons poorly optimized even on my $150000 custom build i still averge only about 40 fps dipping to 15 fps sometimes this is a minor problem seeing as my average of 40 fps is more than playable however it is still an anoyance the game has its fair share of glitches for example sometimes ill be driving behind one of my teammates when his truck snaps back and destroys mine killing me in the process nothing happens on my teammates screen many of the glitches are purley aesthetic for example when you die sometimes your neck stretches out to 5x its size a bit like bf3 while the sounds in the game are decent they are not exactly fantastic to fix this get jsrs sound mod are you thinking of getting this game just for altis life many people do thats fine infact many of the biggest servers are altis life servers i play on gsns altis life server it has an excellent community and friendly admins overall the game is very fun and a massive improvement over arma 2 i would give it 810 thanks for reading ________________________________________________________________________________ update so after spending over 200 hours on this game i will say this playing this will change you if you are a cod player battlfield player etc you will find yourself not challenged by the gameplay anymore ive gone back to cod once or twice and it no longer provides me with the realistic thrill that it once did if you are in the market for realism and a game that requires real strategy get arma just remember your play style must adapt you cannot rush you cannot spray well you can but you will likely die and get yelled at

the arma series is fantastic in its flexibility and mod support arma 3 is no exception the shiny new engine is great still a bit clunky with a few underlying bugs but definitely a step up from arma 2

i have almost 120 hours in this game and i still dont know half what it got to offer it is simply the best game of 2013 if you is wondering wether or not to buy the game so buy it the editor is the best way to experinece all the vehicles play it as the game is ment to be played and you will enjoy it if you are an battlefield or cod player dont buy this it is slow phased and you dont get you healt back after 5 seconds so buy it if you like slow phased and realistic games this is the best way i can describe it i have to go and play the game

well to start off im not a very big third person fan but with this game i think it beats all first person shooters i have now logged over 400 hours with in the first months of owning this game this is by far the most adictiverelistic warfare game i have yet found on the internet or steam this game redefines warfare to omg need more i highly recomend this game to all who like warfare ps in order to have loads of fun get a group of friends or forum a group to play with

after plying 75 hours of it i can happily say that this is my favourite game it out does warthunder and worldoftanks by far an arma game isnt complete without mods and i love the mods that people have come out with though id love to see hunters with gpk turrets cause it annoys me with only having 4 seats in a hunter 1010 best arma game and i cant wait to see if they release some awesome dlc

besser als der vorgnger schon in der alpha gefllt mir die allgemeine spielmechanik die grafik ist schn anzusehen und die bugs sind bei der alpha nunmal nicht anders zu erwarten trotzdem besser als battlefield 3 und der andere shooter mll i can already say that i like the alpha from arma 3 more then arma 2 with better game mechanics and beautiful graphics the bugs arent unusal for an alpha version but i still prefer arma 3 rather than the rest of the shootercrap like battlefield 3
recommended
an interesting fps that is highly realistic but still maintains a very fun feel note it is a fairly intesive game hardware wise so i belive it will require a decent computer
recommended
great game only with there was more guns and vehicles

i really enjoy this game this game is different to other wargames you can make your own missions the graphics are epic and the maps are 200km big you can play alone or with friends either way you will enjoy this game i suggest this game to anyone who is wanting good gameplay and epic battles

i might be biased but this is worth the money 100% the dlc the community made mods and scenarios the game itself its all at the top of the pile when it comes to being a game spanning the entire military simulator genre i have 250 hours in the game and i know that its only the tip of the iceberg the quality of some of the mods released for this game all free by the way are worth the price of the game alone then comes the dlc from bohemia free to access to all players only difference by paying is almost entirely cosmetic bonuses this is a great game single player or multiplayer its all good if you like being immersed into an incredibly large and diverse world where splitsecond decisions matter you will love this title be warned though if you are used to fast pace action shooters this is not one of them

its realy a cool game while playing with friends

ive had this game since early alpha and all i can say is that it is a very good game the amount of details and ways to play makes it very injoyable you dont need the dlcs to have fun in the game or experience anything more just the base game is fun as it is the amount of gamemodes and mods w addons just shows how much fun you are able to have in this game the graphics are astonishing and the controls are amazing as well finally what i have to say is that if you are wanting a good fps game with many other things to do whilst playing it then this game is for you 910

it is hard to review arma 3 without using the word platform because it is one arma is one of those game where you first see the horrid ui and you go theres no way in hell im playing that and then you try that thing and another one and the magic happens for instance optics are actually useful in this game and when you see the little 4 on the rco sort of acog scope its not just there to look good it actually tells you where the bullet will hit 400m from you and its in the little details like that that you understand youre not gonna play any game youre playing arma it would be all good like that but it gets better the community of players is amazing ever wanted to play a proper tactical game just plug your mic in and coordinate your attack with 2 3 or 20 teammates or even more you just randomly met on a server a coop server otherwise prepare yourself to get killed pretty darn fast oh and forget about codbf fanboys theyre simply not there and griefers and other trolls are probably jerking off on dayz so its all good thats about it i think i played 170 hours and i still cant get enough i found a miriad of likeminded gamers to play with and i never cease to be amazed by their skills and willingness to cooperate to get things done get this game get over the ui might take a couple of hours at least and find a good community youll forget about other fps in a the blink of an eye

if say you like call of duty straight into some action then probably not the game for you however forget this games campaign and clunky  controls and go to the multiplayer give say an invade and annex server a try trust me if you are to just follow a group of players you are bound to have some of the best moments in your gaming life so far

i owndl&crackplay tons of games my rig  2x gtx970s  i4970  16gb ddr3 this is by far the best online shooter ive ever played the emotional experience of playing online is on par with that of the hl2 single player campaign although the games are nothing alike everything in the game is rewarding if you stick around to figure it all out every day i play this game i love it a little more and ive had it for about a year hard to get bored in mp because there are so many different roles to perform fighter pilot vs tank crew vs combat medic vs sniper vs drone operatoretc i get bored of games easily and this one has managed to keep my interest the setting and gameplay is similar to the battlefield games however the battlefield games are arcades this is a military simulator you can simulate the tedious monotony of being a plane or heli pilot groundpounder medic tank crew others i prefer the helis because they are very realistic in both physics and detail including working gauges i recommend this game to anyone looking for an indepth military simulator that is more rewarding the more you play i rate arma 3 mp 89100 for reference i rate hl2 sp 91100 i rate bf4 80100 on a good day

after two hours of benchmarking and testing my fps i finally played it smoothly so i decided to join a coop server  i chose to be an autorifleman and grabbed an lmg big backpack and ammo a few grenades too d i took a helicopter to a droppoint to come under fire by the enemy o i quickly laid down and just began shooting and after killing about two i laughed evily over direct communications >3 my friends died and i tried accessing their inventory so i pressed g like in arma 2 i threw a grenade and died d i respawned and did the same mistake just to get banned from the server c 1010 would benchmark again

this is a very fun game with stunning graphics and amazing amount of detail this game looks breathtaking and have so much multiplayer cappabilty however the content included with the game at this stage july 2015 is very limiting when comparing to previos arma games such as arma 2 and arma opeation arrowhead however what orginal content this game lacks is made up for in the extensive amount of mods this game holds there is everything to suit your needs to zombies base building if you liked dayz epoch and then relism mods and there there are rp mods this game is great and keeps getting getter i would recomend the dlc espically if you intend on playing mods as they will give you a great advantage

offline60 fps constant @ ultra settings online25 fps @ lowest settings apart from the terrible servers this game is amazing in my opinion its the best military sim to date at max settings the game pulls just over 2gb of gpu memory in a heavy area ie towns with heavy foliage and lots of buildings it runs smoothly on a wide range of hardware  as iv tested and is easy to achieve solid 60 fps on all hardware at good settings

if you are buying arma 3 expecting the fast paced point and click first person shooter style that games like call of duty have made popular you are looking in the wrong place arma 3 is the most challenging exciting military simulator i have ever played i place emphasis on the word simulator if youre approaching an enemy occupied town and plan to use your sniper you better find a good hiding place on the hills and change positions right after taking your first shot this game is very complex i tend to stay alive when i work in good groups i tend to die a lot when i work with people who do not take it seriously the maps are gigantic in this game this is the most impressive open world military style game you can play

ahharma 3love it so much that makes me hate it in the same amount arma 3 is not your tipical guns game its not an fps and if you are coming from games like cod this is not the game for you arma 3 is a simulation game where you must stop to take a shot consider the distance between you and the target set your aim according to the distance of the target consider the bullet drop if necessary and take the shot this is a game where you will fall on your belly in the woods and crawl 100 meters if necessary the game map is something like you have never seen and that sets the right playground to have large and i do mean large scale combats where you have soldiers running inside a building to rake refuge from enemy fire helicopters landing to deploy soldiers airplanes making a strike at the city and leveling the place tanks set on a hill 1 kilometer away from the target location along with snipers and all kinds of madness it is pure epicness and you feel like you are in a war so if you like those kind of games where you run jump do a 360 shoot with a sniper rifle in mid air without scoping and headshot a guy this is not for you you must have patience in this game like i said you will crawl 100 meters if you need hide inside a house and die if you are unlucky enough to have a airplane missile dropped on you peek around a corner and get shot by a sniper drive an helicopter and it gets shot down you must be prepared for that but that is why it is so epic there is no game like arma 3 that acomplishes what arma 3 acomplishes its the best war game i have ever seen that i think a lot of people have been waiting for games have taken a step foward and if you played fpss like cod and those other fpss under the radar like artic combat or what not and kept imagening it would be cool to have a game like this but more tactical with a huge map and lots of players and cool stuff like helicopters parachuting having kilometers and kilometers of map to play instead of a close quarter corridor map this is the game you have been waiting for but be warned its so good but it has a huge flawit feels like its an alpha performance wise its so frustrating that you cant just enter the game and playbut you cant because you will play with 5 fps even if your computer meets the recommended hardware its poorly optimized and it sucks to play a game that you should be able to play with max settings and you have to play it with low settings or a find a certain combinations that gives you more fpss and even then it will lag and cause things like you have a guy laying prone in front of you and you press to aim and your fpss drop just because of that and he kills you you start shooting and the image freezes for some seconds and the person you were shooting is no longer therethats the only problem with arma 3 with that said its still a thumbs up on my part but be warned about the problem i just pointed out if you are considering on buying it to you do you think the epicness of this game that no other game can provide out weights the huge fps problems the choice is up to you

rating 4 out of 5 cans of tactical bacon pros open world military simulator emulates infantry combat and tactics extensive community support means the game doesnt get old through the release of community based mods scripts addons and missions great mods available altis life epoch breaking point battle royale exile and more realistic and accurate firearms ballistics and ranging as far as a game can attempt to emulate beautiful and well designed maps destructible buildings and map features huge variety of weapons and load outs especially with the addition of the marksman dlc highly recommended large number of vehicles to drive more mature community player base its a game where you need to use planning teamwork and tactics to succeed so it attracts a higher age demographic arma 3 is not call of duty battlefield csgo cons prone to bugs and glitching death by staircases instaexploding helicopters and being sucked into walls is sadly not that uncommon deducted a full point for this as it sadly detracts from the quality of the otherwise brilliant game it is worth noting there is a steep learning curve to the game but this can be offset by utilising the in game virtual arsenal virtual training and practice scenarios will eat your cpu and gpu for breakfast you need a solid rig to run this with ultra settings not a problem for me personally but players do experience fps issues inventory system could do with improvements dlc content people however do need to be aware some content requires dlc personally i dont have an issue with dlc as it supports the development of the games i like but i do understand dlc annoys some people summary highly recommended if you would like to experience simulated infantry combat not recommended if you want to kill die and respawn constantly like in a typical fps shooter its a difficult game to master but if anything learn to shoot first finding a group to play with that can show you the ropes helps learn to communicate meaningful information to your team mates eg contact 2 infantry bearing 40 200 metres left of the house with the orange roof effective communication and teamwork is key to succeeding check out the mods available and extensive arma 3 online guides and wikis

the game was released with very little content except for multiplayer its not worth it and even that is empty because of the lack of content they release the game with good points would be the graphics if your computer runs it ok even very powerful machines will have some issues with it community is great modding is highly supported and the modding community is extremely active my conclusion would be to wait basically the game is in beta the game will be amazing however the state its in now its barren buy it when its on sale or in a year or so
not recommended
a broken unfinished mess made by some hilariously incompetent developers runs like  on any machine and will never get any better thanks to the brain dead decision to stick with a decades old engine and 32 bit code despite arma being positioned as a simulator it is nothing of the sort it is just as much of an arcade shooter as battlefield of cod with the only saving grace being a greater freedom of gameplay variety and depth despite all this arma 3 is still the most worthwile game to have been released on pc for the past five years and even if it is still effectively in a beta state i cant help but waste more and more time on it any sane person will stay the  away and find something more useful to do with their time

this game is  i keep trying to enjoy bohemia interactives war simulators ive a couple of operation flashpoint games and arma 2 played arma 3 over the steam free weekend when the game isnt glitching the  out the prosniper ai will shoot you in the head from 300 yards in 2 seconds all while your scope is swaying around like a drunk man because realism im so glad i got to preview this game for free because damn its infuriating and sucks bi and arma fanboys go on and on about how big the maps are and how realistic the simulation is but as a single player game this thing sucks major c&k go read the mission reviews and help for tipping point this  ending to the 1st stage of the campaign made my decision real quick on wating to buy it i finally said  my squad and left them to die while i went to the mission end by swimming on my 20th quickload because of robot snipers again when i got to the boats at the end the mission was bugged out and i couldnt get into them  i wish people would just stop buying bis junk they improved the graphics here but the same  ai and buggy interface still exists

interesting game but its not worth the amount of money you will have to spend also keep in mind that new mods will come or dlcs and you might be forced to pay more and more also the game play itself its too glitchy and buggy it feels like a early 2000s game you die from fall damage instantly your vehicles get wrecked instantly with a slight bump if the wind was included in the physics it would probably kill you this is proably really good game for army tactic training but as a gamer i dont recomend it

awesome and pretty realistic game if you have an amd setup do not buy this game  if you have a 800$ pc do not buy this game because even on lowest settings you cant get more than 30fps other than the first 10 minuts of game then it drops half way down if you are ok with games that run at 20 fps then you will be happy with arma 3 since it sometimes run at 25fps the amount of desync is insane so if you have the battlefield 4 getting killed gehind walls dont buy this game because its even worse literally  the huge fps drops when there is an explosion is insane and the sound crackling and making you drop to 5 fps is constant the amount of times where you empty a mag on an enemy that just turns around and 1 shot you is prety common if you have 1000$ build a intel setup with nvidia gpu and buy this game then buy a streaming pc if you want to stream well if you have 1800$ actually and not 1000$ if you have 1000$ build a amd setup with ati gpu and do not buy this game then buy any other game and play with 60 fps on ultra while streaming the graphics and the resources this game demands makes no sense at all arma 2 looks as good if not better oh yeah theres ragdoll in arma 3 woohoo no seriously do not buy this game constant dlc that you have to pay for optimization updates followed by lower performance unless you have intelnvidia setup this game is based on x87 the most  thing to do 3 years of dev and yeah you get the picture just deleted the game myself will never reinstall will never recommend it and will never buy a game from bohemia interactive in my life and will beat my kids uo if they buy one jk or am i game is at 50$ on steam and then you can spend 50$ on dlc probably 50$ more when future dlc will be released and 1400$ on a pc just to play this game isnt that just great oh if you have some spare money after all this feel free to donate some to me so i can play a game that i bought 2 years ago when i had the same performance 25fps on my old dual core pc with gts 260 that i have on my 8350 with r9 270x setup

tldr 1 still has as many bugs as in arma 2 2 better graphics 3 even less fps 4 the game only uses 1 core of your ncore cpu no improvement a bad thing overall 5 32bit only even more lags 6 the developers made a huge focus on dlcs not much content in the game itself weaponsvehicles verdict wouldnt buy if i werent a fan of dayzmod or arma 2 hello dear let me guess arma2dayzmod fan as of now i have 833 hrs on record playing arma 2 oa primarily dayzmod and derivations at the beginning of this review id like to write down my expectations before rating this modern game many of you know if you dont it might actually be a good thing arma 2 especially talking about the dayz mod had more bugs than the whole african tropical rainforest most of the bugs were depressing but some were really funny and those became true insider jokes among my mates back to the notsofunnybugs and the laggy game engine which only could effectively use 1 cpu core > 70fps at most on a 2011 midhighend pc those were the reasons i bought arma 3 i wanted a better game which has better graphics less bugs and most important higher fps regarding these aspects 1 arma 3 has better graphics what else would you expect 2 and 3 bohemia interactive did a great job on their part applause sarcasm off surprisingly arma 3 still uses only 1 cpu core  thanks now i have even less fps than in arma 2 the average fps for me is 1530 and theres no way to increase the fps firstly because the cpu is the limiting factor game uses max 15 cores of total 4 so lowering the graphics settings doesnt change much secondly ram is still an issue we now live in the 64bit era in case you didnt know 64bit applications not only can use more ram theoretically more than 4gb on windows more than 2gb but also perform a little better 520% as you guessed arma 3 is still running 32bit only this mainly results in heavy lags on my machine same applies to arma 2 but this is an old game why bother after a while when arma 3 uses up all of the 2gb ram provided by windows the great lag begins every now and then i get this lag spike giving me 24fps for a second or two the game becomes practically unplayable everyone with a better cpu have a huge advantage over you in terms of fps teh tech explanation when arma 3 hits the allocation limit for 32bit applications win32 2gib it begins or windows does doesnt matter to offload additional memory objects to the pagefilesys file which is on your hdd hard drives are muuuuuuuuuch slower than ram and everytime the game requests memory chunks from this file you run into the 24fps lag spike as the game has to sit here and wait for the data pagefiles on ssds reduce the lag spikes but dont csgoguneliminate them completely so blamebohemia blamearma now whats about the bugs it has got even worse probably vehicle damage has become unpredictable  a slightly damaged wheel thats what the hud tells you visually still 100% but the vehicle will crap out and drive at 70% speed if at all el helicptero with a fully broken main rotor i dont care still going up in the air liek a god roflcopter is on the way next example playing king of the hill fun gamemode with all vehicles and weapons you are the pilot of a transport helicopter with 10 passengers in a rocket hits your heli and it either goes down or explodes instantly all good so far so whats about a little reward for the guy who fired that rocket and killed all the people in the helicopter nope er they all died because of magicsuicidingebolachanafrican beesing cactuses again we would like to politely inform you the player who did kill all these innocent soldiers will not get any kills for that in reward do you still want to pay so much for a game dont forget youll need a pc costing at least 25 times as much to play the game comfortably

awesome and pretty realistic game if you have an amd setup do not buy this game  if you have a 800$ pc do not buy this game because even on lowest settings you cant get more than 30fps other than the first 10 minuts of game then it drops half way down if you are ok with games that run at 20 fps then you will be happy with arma 3 since it sometimes run at 25fps the amount of desync is insane so if you have the battlefield 4 getting killed gehind walls dont buy this game because its even worse literally  the huge fps drops when there is an explosion is insane and the sound crackling and making you drop to 5 fps is constant the amount of times where you empty a mag on an enemy that just turns around and 1 shot you is prety common if you have 1000$ build a intel setup with nvidia gpu and buy this game then buy a streaming pc if you want to stream well if you have 1800$ actually and not 1000$ if you have 1000$ build a amd setup with ati gpu and do not buy this game then buy any other game and play with 60 fps on ultra while streaming the graphics and the resources this game demands makes no sense at all arma 2 looks as good if not better oh yeah theres ragdoll in arma 3 woohoo no seriously do not buy this game constant dlc that you have to pay for optimization updates followed by lower performance unless you have intelnvidia setup this game is based on x87 the most  thing to do 3 years of dev and yeah you get the picture just deleted the game myself will never reinstall will never recommend it and will never buy a game from bohemia interactive in my life and will beat my kids uo if they buy one jk or am i game is at 50$ on steam and then you can spend 50$ on dlc probably 50$ more when future dlc will be released and 1400$ on a pc just to play this game isnt that just great oh if you have some spare money after all this feel free to donate some to me so i can play a game that i bought 2 years ago when i had the same performance 25fps on my old dual core pc with gts 260 that i have on my 8350 with r9 270x setup

tldr 1 still has as many bugs as in arma 2 2 better graphics 3 even less fps 4 the game only uses 1 core of your ncore cpu no improvement a bad thing overall 5 32bit only even more lags 6 the developers made a huge focus on dlcs not much content in the game itself weaponsvehicles verdict wouldnt buy if i werent a fan of dayzmod or arma 2 hello dear let me guess arma2dayzmod fan as of now i have 833 hrs on record playing arma 2 oa primarily dayzmod and derivations at the beginning of this review id like to write down my expectations before rating this modern game many of you know if you dont it might actually be a good thing arma 2 especially talking about the dayz mod had more bugs than the whole african tropical rainforest most of the bugs were depressing but some were really funny and those became true insider jokes among my mates back to the notsofunnybugs and the laggy game engine which only could effectively use 1 cpu core > 70fps at most on a 2011 midhighend pc those were the reasons i bought arma 3 i wanted a better game which has better graphics less bugs and most important higher fps regarding these aspects 1 arma 3 has better graphics what else would you expect 2 and 3 bohemia interactive did a great job on their part applause sarcasm off surprisingly arma 3 still uses only 1 cpu core  thanks now i have even less fps than in arma 2 the average fps for me is 1530 and theres no way to increase the fps firstly because the cpu is the limiting factor game uses max 15 cores of total 4 so lowering the graphics settings doesnt change much secondly ram is still an issue we now live in the 64bit era in case you didnt know 64bit applications not only can use more ram theoretically more than 4gb on windows more than 2gb but also perform a little better 520% as you guessed arma 3 is still running 32bit only this mainly results in heavy lags on my machine same applies to arma 2 but this is an old game why bother after a while when arma 3 uses up all of the 2gb ram provided by windows the great lag begins every now and then i get this lag spike giving me 24fps for a second or two the game becomes practically unplayable everyone with a better cpu have a huge advantage over you in terms of fps teh tech explanation when arma 3 hits the allocation limit for 32bit applications win32 2gib it begins or windows does doesnt matter to offload additional memory objects to the pagefilesys file which is on your hdd hard drives are muuuuuuuuuch slower than ram and everytime the game requests memory chunks from this file you run into the 24fps lag spike as the game has to sit here and wait for the data pagefiles on ssds reduce the lag spikes but dont csgoguneliminate them completely so blamebohemia blamearma now whats about the bugs it has got even worse probably vehicle damage has become unpredictable  a slightly damaged wheel thats what the hud tells you visually still 100% but the vehicle will crap out and drive at 70% speed if at all el helicptero with a fully broken main rotor i dont care still going up in the air liek a god roflcopter is on the way next example playing king of the hill fun gamemode with all vehicles and weapons you are the pilot of a transport helicopter with 10 passengers in a rocket hits your heli and it either goes down or explodes instantly all good so far so whats about a little reward for the guy who fired that rocket and killed all the people in the helicopter nope er they all died because of magicsuicidingebolachanafrican beesing cactuses again we would like to politely inform you the player who did kill all these innocent soldiers will not get any kills for that in reward do you still want to pay so much for a game dont forget youll need a pc costing at least 25 times as much to play the game comfortably

i was really hopeful about arma as it is it was pretty lame maybe itd be better if i had a super fast computer and everyone had the fastest internet known to mankind it is almost as realistic as warthunder but jumpy jagged and with laggy multiplayer some say the controls are confusing but i dont agree the controls are a little different but you get used to them fairly quickly some of the confusion comes from putting more than one action with the same button switching based on whether it is a tap or a hold i referenced the controls menu a bunch but there are numerous tutorials guides training scenarios and other practice available right in the game i really appreciate how realistic it is in that there are no markers for the enemy and it only takes a couple of hits to kill you unfortunately it always takes at least 4 bullets to kill an enemy unless you hit the face the helmet will not do you must hit the face or neck this is actually pretty hard to do when you are at distances of 100m which you usually are engaging at those distances  50m and when they shoot more accurately than you because you have been walkingrunning everywhere and thus have less fatigue avoid ever sprinting even though the map is bigger than any map in any other game youve ever played in just be patient and take 24 minutes to walk to the next battle if you run youll just die tired i went into a multiplayer game and saw helicopters flying around in crazy upside down positions crashing and falling to the ground perhaps a contributing factor was the fact that it was a 70 person game when i joined i saw in the chat room that players were complaining about the lag as i quickly downloaded a 34 mb setting file from the server obviously my joining the game clogged their upstream pipe this happened a couple times in the game as new players joined lag spiked perhaps a fix of this could be a download mirror used for all servers or something to save on server bandwidth this game made me laugh at how unpolished it was at several points mostly this was for multiplayer lag jumps but it was funny when i tried my first multiplayer mission and my trooper who was not the squad leader would not stop calling out orders to everyone every 10 seconds i tried figuring out why i was issuing all these commands but it happened without my pressing buttons or anything close to the squad command buttons it was also funny because the ingame voice chat toggle button defaults to [caps lock] so when i returned to typing out messages they were shouting half the time oops i couldnt figure out how to stop ordering everyone to regroup with me nor could i find the enemy it was a coop mission so i decided to try something else in my second multiplayer game i was starting to get the hang of it i died plenty at first sure but there was always a nice helicopter pilot ready to take us to the battlefield when i respawned im really glad i didnt have to walk all that way because if i did once would have been enough for me to quit i was starting to get the hang of it and even a few kills someone finally got me while from a higher building and i was returning to the battlefield in a helicopter i started typing to my teammates while riding in the heli and even though i was typing a message when i used spacebar during the message it caused me to jump out of the helicopter without a parachute i died before i could finish typing out my question but in a way it answered a different one i decided to stop playing multiplayer and try the campaign in the first mission it was funny to have an enemy blazing away full tilt at my essential npc partner and for him to not even notice the enemy was there walking on by i would have preferred my ai teammate to actually engage the enemy but im sure walking up and shoulder checking him as he walked by was pretty effective in the same mission i snuck up on a machine gunner in the same first mission and wanted to see what the action button would do when i got close it turns out instead of knifing him or doing some other crazycool cqb maneuver i pulled out my medical kit and started bandaging him while he turned his mg on my face and opened up in the second mission i wasnt able to progress because one member of my squad spotted an mrap that he really wanted me to destroy even when our mission didnt call for it the rest of our squad was fine to go to the rendezvous point but that npc squad member kept yelling for us to take out the group of enemies by it the squad leader kept yelling for him to return to formation and i just kept walking through the forest for a while hoping that hed return at the next script line for the story he didnt i ended up going back to the last autosave and taking out the rest of them by myself after 20 tries without backup i was a little glad i did because when allies engage the enemy they die as fast as the enemy does which is as fast as you do which is quick i never neded up finishing that mission because even when i knew generally where the enemy was coming from i couldnt see them to shoot them but they sure could see and shoot me through all the leaves and bushes in the forest i died over and over im sure it was a bit like nam and just as fun so i decided to uninstall if it werent for that the campaign at least has great production value on par with call of duty the voice acting scripting of scenes and music all are top notch it is ready for oculus ir and maybe id enjoy it more if i had a computer that wasnt at least 6 years old i am usually a simulation enthusiast loving realism even over gameplay hey i like warthunder where you also have a hard time identifying who is an enemy and you die in 12 hits however this was just not very enjoyable arma is like fighting on 3 or 4 battlefield 3 maps at once with 100 players that sounds fun and it could be as it is however it tries to do entirely too much for my computer it ends up being a laggy frustrating mess itd be fun at a convention on a lan with computers with monster video cards because the draw distance is intense but i was frustrated not having fun and ready to uninstall after just a few hours

i approached this like any other game though i have played operation flashpoint arma 1 & 2 before played the campaign first flaw i noticed is that once the fighting starts in earnest the games checkpoint just stops and it wont even let you quicksave for long periods of time as a result youll be playing the same sections over and over again unless youre really good at spotting enemies in janky terrain and shooting them through inaccurate terrain hitboxes really most rocks early on in the survive campaign seem to need about an extra foot of clearance so if you use them as cover youre just wasting your very limited bullets and i grimly suspect they would have screwed up just as many collision boxes if not more later on in the game the enemies you are fighting in that mission also have some pretty good body armor so you need to accurately put a bunch of 65mm bullets on target against targets that are running using terrain and dont have any problem injuring you even having played the prelude i wasnt ready for the long stretch of running with occasional dicey battles and no opportunity to save your progress for a good 10  30 minutes fairly early in the survive campaign it would have been sensible to maintain flow for the game to at least allow me to manually save before or after each of the firefights that are about 5 minutes apart of just running or 20 minutes of stumbling along if you take a shot in the leg requiring a marathon jog through fighting 3  4 decent enemy squads including snipers and machinegunners with only one ally without even the option of saving let alone automatic saves anywhere in there amongst all the scripted chatter and setpieces that you do encounter would be fine as an optional challenge but not the start of a campaign where you have to get through it before anything cool happens you dont even start with a single first aid kit to patch up your leg if you take a round through it so one unlucky hit and youll be staggering between checkpoints instead of a 2minute sprint for my money id rather buy either something a whole lot more interesting and deep than arma 3 or something just as simple in theme but with tight controls and good flow for me arma 3 sits in that uncomfortable spot between a simulator and an action game where im going to be frustrated by the intricacies and slowness of getting to the action and then the battles themselves arent any fun either especially not with bad checkpointing that said this sort of game really lives or dies on its multiplayer which i cant be bothered with so as a singleplayer game no i wouldnt recommend it if a games singleplayer campaign cant hold up to scrutiny then it shouldnt have one

this game has serious playability issues starting with trying to see something to shoot at something is wrong with the zoom functionality it says there is a target to shoot out there i affix a scope and even at maximum zoom i see nothing just more white green and brown blobs on top of that everything looks bad and walking gives me motion sickness after 20min my solution was to get up and walk 300meters to the target so it would become visible and then shoot it so i could progress my ai companions did all the shooting when the fighting started the objective markers virtually disappear and are hard to see against the textures used by the game the training starts with an npc talking about greenbacks and aafs and i have no clue who these people are i started the campaign and that just made things even worse it explains that nato peacekeepers are pulling out of altis fictional mediterranean island to fight csat in the pacific there are a lot of hanging plot threads that make no sense whats with the earthquakes why do some of the bases get attacked who is this dead guy i find on the road what happens to the guys on the bases finally you get to the shooting part and it just doesnt work after the first dozen deaths i end up having to put my face a few inches from the screen to try and see any bad guys and that only causes eye strain you do not see anything to shoot they see you even prone but you will not see them no tutorial is given to explain how to nullify the bad guys ability to sense your presence i quick view of lets plays on youtube shows they are playing a game that actually displays the enemy moving on to multiplayer would be nice if there were actually multiplayer games dont be fooled by youtube or the tab that says multiplayer in the menu there is no multiplayer there is only multiplayer if you join a community through the forums and they will have a list of mods to play and generally are about playing with people who already know how to play arma3

first and foremost the graphics and realism is very very very good id say exceptional the controls however are severely lacking as they are in no way fluid using the aswd  mouse for control with half of your controls on the other side of the keyboard does not make this all that fun to do again dont misunderstand me the games realism and graphics are exceptional and the storyline was intriguing but the controls are simply horrible and it severely detracts from the game when youre having to remove hands from your movement controls or from the mouse to hit backspace to clear the squad command windows in combat this is not something you want to have to do but there it is take it as you will if youre after a game with good graphics and realism and a decent storyline check out arma iii if however you want something that you can play fluidly and not want to bash your keyboard after ten minutes of dealing with the akward controls move on

the sole purpose of arma 3 is the advertisement of overpriced dlcs  and therefore beside the singleplayer campaign the embodiment of pay to win in pvp you want a decent weapon to bad  you dont have the dlc ran out of ammo on the battlefield to bad your opponent has the dlc  no weapon for you the performance of arma 3 is subpar 30 players on an onlineserver work fine every player added to that will drop your framerate  even on a killerrig you might end up with 20 fps the bugs in the game are plenty and sometimes beyond funny the game has its moments yet those are rare if you can grab it in steamsale do it if not well  i warned you

have you ever played delta force 2 its a fps game from 1999 this game looks like a hd version of that graphics are really bad if you turn them down a little bit otherwise you would need a very hefty machine even my gtx780 cant give me stable 60 fps on everything maxed vehicles look like they are made of papers or card boards attached to each other some people call it a real combat simulator what they do not explain is that why there are characters running only wearing pink underwears in a realistic fps game physics are extraordinary bad the game is clunky sluggish and stupid try to climb a ladder and you would understand the bad physics as your character would climb on an invisible ladder looks to me the devs did not spend any time on this game for a full price my recommendation is a big no i bought it when it was still alpha and lots of problems were never solved heck war thunder is a free to play game on steam and the graphics physics models and environment in its tank simulator looks a decade better than a 3999 arma iii also i must add there is a horrible customer service and tech support from the devs combat simulator real fps game could someone explain to me if high recoil on any weapons is anything next to realism for instance m4 carbine is a very weak weapon in real life with 556x45mm nato cartridge it has very low recoil for an adult in this game it looks like a 8 years old child is firing a m4 the recoil is unrealistic and stupid bfbc2 is ten times more realistic than this this game is not optimized well enough watch some videos on youtube first there is no environmental destruction what so ever like there is in bf series avoid this game i can not stand it for 10 minutes oh the positive side the community of this game is a very matured kind friendly generous and helpful one thats the only bright side here my love and respect to them wish there were more of these people in bf4

not a simulator its a pseudosimulator it wouldnt be 50% playable if it wasnt for the community based addons bohemia semi true sim is sold only to the military im playing since flash point i got a milsim corp since armed assault we gave up since we couldnt play due to bis patches  that always ended ing up the addons versions  bugs crashes and glitches it has a master piece concept of make your own scenario and mission this is the best concept in a game and what gripped me into the series to be true ive lost more time making missions than playing then the editor was actually very fun and easy to operate however arma 3 doesnt even have a proper armor system for the armored vehicles you can shoot them with a 50 to death within a minute physichs will always be below average due to the engine and as a great vehicle enthusiast this is a major fact while driving them  very wierd to hear a tank lowering its sound when its going uphill when the torque is at maximum so the engine sound should be at the loudest point  another major fact is that arma is not made for cqb you will never see good cqb fights or even decent urban fights you can even see some semiurban firefights but you will never experiment a true close quarters firefight simulation in arma i wish we could have some alternative to it bohemia must chage this engine and make the game more realistic or it will lose its fan just as codemasters with that cool operation flash point dr

be careful you are paying for a beta game this  has release in 2013 and is bugged as  crashers glitches all the  you meet at arma 2 this game does not seems to be finished and the devs arent really trying to the content of this is laughable is lower than arma 2 with that half futuristic  mods and the comunity are the only thing that save this franchise other wise it will be dead quick mod are not flawless the are very buggy more than the main game but still wort to get so if you will buy for the vanilla get off this is not a good game but if you want to play with mods you can give it a try i recommend you to buy on a steam sale to not be too painful for your pocket

not recommended even for people who like a good military simulation game good  lots of potential for realism and immersion  massive variety of ways to interact with game elements bad  lack of variety in terms of gear three colours dont make three different items  lack of any real weapons its all nearfuture stuff  gunshots sound too mechanical or like movie sound effects  weapon animations are loose effects dont sync up right two gunshots when you shoot three bullets etc  vehicles are very difficult to control without dedicated joystickwheel very bad  needlessly complicated control scheme which will take hours on hours to get used to literally  to say the learning curve is steep implies that there is a learning curve  many functions of the game are hidden unexplained unintuitive or poorly implemented  potential for realism is destroyed when each mission becomes a sprint between ambushes there are several different tutorials  some in the virtual reality some on the islands some as textonly and none of which are adequate each tutorial is about tenthirty seconds long and involves no actual help assuming that because you pressed the right buttons once you now know how to do it in combat the team seems to have put zero effort into making the game intuitive you will spend much of your time looking up various controls and reading about methods of interaction this game is not finished if youre looking for a good intuitive fun military simulator to get away from the call of duty bullcrap pick up operation flashpoint red river it might not be as extensive and it suffers from a lack of replayability but it isnt nearly as frustrating as arma

i give this a thumbs down not becaue its a war simulator and im looking for another cod but because its so glitchy that every time i feel like im starting to be immersed in the game it knockes me back out i use the binos to see where enemy troops are and it just decides that i have selected another item and pulls that out i change from my rifle to my pistol and it changes back by itself 10 seconds later it just loses all feel to it and when it happens and it gets you killed it just makes you think it not worth it i wouldnt buy till they can iron out these issues on the posive side the actual game would have good potential without that issue

if you think this is another call of duty knock off youre far from correct i know i havent played for a while because i got it free this weekend and i dont want to spend the 60$ on it the game is one of the most realistic games ever that can be a good thing and a bad thing people have been asking for realisitc games forever but now that we have one do we want it let me just get to the pros and cons pros 1 fighting enenmies is actually a challenge unlike many other shooter games 2 the story line seems to be very good theres alot of twists to through you off 3 when you kill enemies you can loot their body and take their gun attatchments and clothes 4 there arent many dull moments like i said the campaign keeps you on your toes 5 open world thats really where the pros end cons 1 its so realistic its annoying dont we play video games to get out of the real world 2 if you run for 200 feet or more you will be fatigued and your max running speed is your normal walking speed 3 the sway of the scopesights is so bad i wish i could show you how impossible it is to kill people from 100m away unless you get lucky 4 the map is confusing to understand at first theres no legend telling you what everything means 5 the amount of bullets that it takes to kill an enemy is the same amount of bullets it take to kill you 6 ais will see you from 200300m away 7 you have to manually save if you dont want to respawn 30 mins back 8 multiplayer was confusing i spawned in and walked around for a little while tried to type to people and nothing happened so i left maybe its because im new to arma and dont know what im doing 9 enemies with grenade launchers seem to have unlimited grenades to launch you cant move out of cover without being blown up at times 10 the game thinks you should know what to do and how to do it so it will tell you what it wants you to do and if you havent figured it out in about 5 mins it will finally give you and objective point so if youre confused at some point or lost you get to run around wildly for 510 mins 11 the graphics need to be better you think its still loading in but its not the graphics are just not what i expected thats everything i experienced in the short time that ive played if you do purchase this game hope a mod as good as dayz from arma 2 comes out for this game aswell

let me start with i love this game let me continue with i really wish i could love it more so its an awesome feeling when you get a kill me personally i use a sniper so i can expect quite a few however the game has an awesome idea but terrible terrible engineering when a server is 5 hours old you might was well leave because its going to get hacked when you get into a game that doesnt ban easily you might as well leave because people will continuosly teamkill you with no punishment when you see an explosion at base you may as well leave because someone is going to crash a helicopter into you respawn and repeat it would be better if hackers got banned not to mention on decent titan x gaming pcs it gets an average of 30 fps i wish i could like it more 310

graphics are pretty shocking and the tutorial is very simplistic but when you begin the first mission there is little help regarding what to do as a soldier youre left to your own devices and to complete goals solo yet some of the goals arent clear not sure if its just my old pc but if youre running windows 7 you may have a rough time as i found myself constantly lagging which heightened my annoyance i personally would not recomend this game to anyone and i can 100% guarantee i will not be buying the full version of this game

tried this game on the free weekend to see what it was like running on an intel i5 34ghz processor with 20gb ram and a wired 47mbs internet connection it totally lagged out even on lowest settings i couldnt join a game without spending ages in slow and badly designed menus mixed with painfully slow loading screens badly optimised game would not recommend

greedy dlc the game is still in beta the funnest thing to do by far is koth online but good luck getting in a server randomly the server broswer will flip out and report 0 servers at which time the only solution is to completely restart the game every time hearing that stupid theme when it starts up duh duh dunnn duh server broswer reports 0 servers restart duh duh dunnn duh 15 bucks for a couple of rifles and diffrent color guillie suits << helicopter pack 15 bucks still in beta my  money grab poorly optimized 610 duh duh dunnn duh  510

the best 30 fps simulator i have ever played game is so good that user mods are better than the actual game my personal favorite part about this game is the desync where you see people in tanks flying across the map raining down shells across the map

its like arma 2 but with less content poorly optimised and cash grab dlc loadmasters anyone was hoping it would get better but its still worse than arma 2 in almost every way except graphics i think ill stick to operating in chernarus and takistan instead of a greek island that has antiframerate technology

why simulate a semi future era then thats not simulation i think the best arma will be arma 2 optimizedeven with smaller island i want that but not these robot combatno

game is pretty cool and detailed  but its aparently going down the pay for any extra content road im a cheapskate  paying for extra model just make me sick  if they would come out with actual addon ie wait a year or two finish singling out every issue with your engine then come out with a dlc adding a bit of everythng  some mission i m on thats fine by me id buy but here the game does not feel finished to me maybe they need to come out with more dlcs  just my opinion

dont buy this game unless youre willing to pay more money for a game you already payed for the game has the est marketing system i have ever seen you have to pay $70 just to get it and an extra $20 to be able to use half the guns in the game you would have thought its original hefty price tag would have been enough other than that its a good game

terrible 1st impressions fps is huge on almost every server if theres ppl its impossible to play because of the fps if the fps is low theres like 3 ppl on the server impossible to find a normal sever i get handcuffed for doing nothing and a lot of other boring  i would absolutely not recommend buying or even wasting your time on this game
not recommended
i personally think that this is a love or hate kind of a game and i hate it more specifically how it controls yeah it looks great but if i cant enjoy the way the character behaves i wont enjoy the game its just too clumsy in my opinion if you dont like arma 2 then you wont like this one
not recommended
this game could be so much better if they fixed the ai was the same in arma 2 and unfortunately nothing has changed stealth is dead enemies will spot you in the dark 200 meters away or from a moving helicopter while your underwater it is so inconsistant and really kills the immersion when concealment is moot instead of enemies getting smarter on higher difficulties they just get aim bots got to the point where even sticking my head out of cover for a split second meant death from a distant machinegun headshot thats not more challenging its just cheap best thing about this game is the editor
not recommended
it took them far too long to polish this turd for me to recomend anything bis is involved with yeah the game is ok now that they have finally added the features that should have been there from day dot but i bought a physical copy of the deluxe edition from eb and as such i expected a finished game not the alphabeta i was confronted with it should never have been on shelves 6 months ago let alone when i bought it back in 2013 and you would think deluxe edition implies that at least some of the dlc would be included nope not sodeluxe then is it imagine buying a new car and on your way out of the dealership the shady salesman casualy states oh just so you know even though you have a dashboard none of the dials or switches work but as soon as we get some in we can install them for a nominal fee seems a bit rude dosent it paying for something and realizing it dosent even come close to expectations and the excuse why not just use mods is just a sad way of admiting the game isnt finished andor it isnt any good on its own and even though i may pick it back up and try again i really dont see myself spending anywhere near the time i had intended to as the experience has left a very bitter taste in my mouth

one of the buggiest and most unfinished game ive ever played starts game on medium settings 20 fps sets to ultra 50 fps thats also a very bad framerate for having 2 r9 280x firstly none of the sound is working sound is working everywhere else except for arma 3 then i got into a multiplayer game which takes a few restarts btw i couldnt find a single server so i had to end up just joining my friend through steam and it worked then i got into a server and after waiting for all textures to load i noticed the bad framerate then we started driving around for a while and even the driving is really bugged if i start going forward i cant stop going forward and the same for going backwards then i decided to go out of it i got thrown out high up in the air and landed so i died also a small little thing the cursor is still visible it flies over all monitors but the game doesnt tab out or click anywhere so no big deal just a little bit annoying one of the buggiest games ive played in a while

this game is on the opposite side of most of the games that are simply too afraid to make things too hard i normally dont like these types of games because they seem to create their own version of reality that makes the game even less realistic for instance enemy troops who have just been established as being too dumb to find their  on a map of their own homeland are now able to hit you without scopes in heavy cover at 300 meters in contrast a veteran marine gets tired from walking up a gentle slope for two minutes however the single player is meant to train you for multiplayer and it succeeds in doing this or you would think the multiplayer allows for plenty of roles so if you are new you can always stick to support unfortunately the fps is going to be around 25 on standard gfx i also get this feeling that 80% of the people have no clue what is going on this is usually a sign of scattered game design optimization is kinda bad depite being almost indistinguishable from a game from 2006 with a ton of aa modded in but how else are you going to move those newly rebranded nvidia cards off the shelves every year the keyboard bindings are a tragic mess double right clicking to use the iron sites five different buttons to use all the menus and submenus various key combinations to draw a line on a map using a layout standard that does not resemble anything any other well known game uses it does not help that there seems to be a 75 second delay to all commands this is the crusader kings ii of fpss except where crusader kings is ed because of random events that cause your kingdukewhatever to grow a nipple out of his forehead totally trashed mechanics that allow for an army of 14 archers to defeat your army of 1240 because it was raining and they felt kind of down and ai that seems to really hate you especially for no clear reason other than that they want to capture you and cut out your eyes and testicles arma iii has controls that make no sense and optimization that makes company of heroes 2 look like it could run on a ti83 calculator buy for the extremely short single player on sale the idea is novel but not so much the implementation i feel sorry for those poor designers who got arrested by the greek armed forces during this games production not worth it

another day another arma game another load of bugs and lags dont expect this game to run well if you want a solid 60 fps it will always find a way to ruin your performance im constanlty monitoring hardware usage and arma iii lags even while not loading my cpu or gpu above 70% im running the game on a 6 gbs ssd i cannot help but compare this game with battlefield 4 that runs almost perfectly well i do realize that bf4 isnt running a whole load of ai and scripts plus its maps and object count are much lower but somehow i feel dice could do optimization much better than bis seriously what excuse would you have for a game that lags without hardware bottlenecks so it seems im definitely not recommending this game as im absolutely convinced that steady performance is above fancy visuals ive tried all kinds of performance tweaks for this game  launch parameters custom memory allocators edits in the cfg and ini files unparking the cpu cores changing process priority messing with settings & etc all they do is give you a tad of extra fps and nothing more no tweak will change the fact that arma iii uses a 32bit executable and obsolete overcoded engine with no proper multicore support on the other note i dont really like the pseudofuturistic setting of this game its indeed pseudofuturistic as most all present equipment is denied prototypes or current tech that has nothing futuristic about it except being exotic mid2030s even while not being a mil expert i understand that realistic portrayal isnt this what a tactical shooter is about of this age is not possible as we have no idea of technology thats going to be used at the time scopes with builtin rangefinders and auto adjustment thats something already created greatly promising and not even present in this bogus  same as triton oxygen mask google glasses smart bullets thermal goggles and even real time active spectral matching camouflage edit the current version now includes nightstalker scope that has a builtin rangefinder a3 setting ended up on the side of cheap pulp fiction thats not really a major problem since im looking forward to mods like ace 3 and rhs escalation that should reintroduce the modern stuff by adding new or converting old assets and its really good to note that eula and a3 engine allow this the game wields many improvements over arma ii the inventory system is marvellous radio comms sound much more like live chat visuals animations and sounds are vastly enhanced but is that really enough when the game often lags like hell because its purely unoptimised a3 is too expensive for its content quality but i may change my mind if devs manage to improve its performance however its unlikely they ever will the way i see it in order for arma iii not to lag bis will have to code a new but reverse compatible engine on the basis of directx 12 with proper multicore support and a 64bit executable httpimgleprosoriumcom2096814 pathetic performance core usage ram usage gpu usage and video memory usage the game barely used 50% of availiable computing power horrific 22 fps are of course the result the only solution is to lower the viewdistance and object distance to the point where whole world turns into a permanent hazy  like your silent hill needless to say that flying aerial vehicles becomes a questionable undertaking

unless you have a half a dozen friends who will play this game with you then i strongly recommend that you do not buy this game its all about teams and cooperation and it is absolutely zero fun to play on your own you will have no idea what is happening and even worse you will be at a massive disadvantage while playing because everyone else is in teams usually you will be trekking along normally walking for miles since your fully trained soldier can only run about 20 yards before passing out from exhaustion youll hear a pop pop from two miles away and then you are dead and will have to make another 20 minute trek back to the battlefield without coordination with a very sizable squad of friends then you will always fail the game is supposed to be ultra realistic but unfortunately this makes for a very poor game we dont want to fight long distance firefights against invisible enemies with your gun waving around like youve got cerbrial palsy just because you jogged down some steps the graphics are definitely good youve got to give it that but the performance is trash if you are playing on low to mid settings then the game will be even more difficult  good luck seeing anyone further than 100m away after your lod turns them into blobs literally the only joy ive gotten out of this game is driving trucks around and flying helicopters but since this is supposed to be a shooter then that is not good actually fighting other players or even the ai in the campaign is massively frustrating my  mexican friend who made me buy this owes me 4499 this game is worthless

im sorry i do like this game it is different from other fps with wide open combat and amazing community made missions tactical multiplayer and interesting vehicles but if i can crush crisis 3 on ultra @ 1080p and bf4 on ultra @ 1080p and maintain a solid 60 fps what i dont want is to see a game use 25% of my cpu and 45% of my gpu under max load and since this game is cpu intensive it adds insult to injury i can barely hold 25 fps in big citys on low but somehow i get 60 on ultra if im out in the middle of no where i swear it renders every texture and unseen geometry well it does the game is not optimized at all the game cant utilize hardware at all intel better than amd i must admit offering a laggy and unsatisfying experience to people and i cant imagine what framerates people get on lower spec systems  and bipods arent a ting i can see it i can touch it but my soldier is mentally handicap or it is stuck like a stubborn bicycle stand that needs some oil i will get fanboys arguing with me but to be honest they probably dont care abut graphics wish i could be like that  i dont want my game to look like it runs on a console tho my specs someone asked gtx 780 4gb vram  16 gb 1600mhz quad  amd fx 9590 stock clock so yeah i should be able to run this os dual boot  linux  windows 81 on an ssd

gameplay is perfect the idea is perfect but expect low fps  even on high end pcs  some times my gpu load drops below 20% this happens on low to ultra settings my friends have the same problem it happens in the citys not in the open looks like this game cant be fixed cause the problem ik the engine were the game is build on the only fix is a entire new engine like they are going to do with dayz standalone i get 75 fps average but drops which are like in the 20s if you can live with fps drops to 25 buy it the gameplay is the best part of arma 3 the sound is below average not the quality but direction of the sound is coming from

do you have a monster computer then i would suggest checking this out because it is an amazing game dont have one then this is the laggiest pos you will ever play they didnt really bother on the whole optimization thing i guess its too mainstream to optimize your game im running a phenom quad core @ 28ghz 8gb ram and a radeon 7770 and i have to put this game on dead low settings just to make it even possible to play that is just ing ridiculous when these specs allow me to play any other game at high settings i loved arma 2 and arma 3 improves on the series so much but the amount of power it takes to get into a decent size game just is not worth its price tag

arma 3 is easy to explain imagine arma 2 now add proper stances to it alot better performance alot of fixed bugs alot more introduced aswell and on and on arma 3 is a good game for what it is the main problem is the devs are ing lazy they didnt bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2 instead 4 or 5 that just have different skins about 1 tank per faction 3 or 4 helicopters and  me only one ing jet i mean thats ing lazy the amount of content in arma 3 is ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2 bohemia interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc but this game should still either be in alpha or very early beta not a finished game overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not its down to you if you want a game that runs and plays really well if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets then get it if you cant however just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc again this game should be in late alpha  early beta not a finished game

this game is amazing i have been playing bohemia interactive games since operation flashpoint cold war crisis i have never had an issue with online play however until yesterday i got a global ban for an unknown reason as i have never downloaded any kind of preformance tools hacks scrips or anything that could alter game play in any way i have never had an issue being banned until yesterday i emailed battleye and got an auto responce saying buy another game or suck up being banned that is unprofessional and unacceptable if this issue is not resolved promptly i will never buy another bohemia interactive game the money is not the problem here i have more then enough money to invest in the game all over again but i simply refuse to pay for a game twice this is especally wrong when i did nothing wrong i hate cheaters in game as much as any one hackerscheaters ruin the fabric of the game and make it no fun to play but banning people with out any kind of investigation is not the answer i hate criminals more but when some one is arrested for commiting a crime they are at least given a chance to challenge such an offense at this stage i do not recomend arma 3 or any bohemia interactive game to anyone the fact that they do business with battleye and support the product developed by bastian suter with out any type of customer support is unacceptible i hope either the issue is resolved or bi finds another anti cheat engine with a better customer support channel i have sent multiple test emails to battleye after getting what felt like an automated response back no matter what i put in the emails it said the exact same message this is so frustrating that i wish there was a way to take legal action against the company never in my life have i been so frustrated by a company and their product i am editing my post to add a little information i have recently contacted a lawyer whom i am close friends with as i do not want to make sure i am not wrong on this matter he has recomended me to do the following file a claim on econsumergov file a claim on httpswwwbbborg file a complaint at wwwripoffreportcom contact steam and inform them of the situation and that i will be disputing the transaction with my credit card company contact bank  credit card company and dispute the charge anyone else having the same issue as me i strongly suggest doing the same  i did not pay $6500 to be banned from 90 to 95% of the servers this will not stand legaly as the customer support at bi and be are useless this is a huge problem with this game i have talked with over 35 people who have confirmed to have the same problem as me two of them have video of them being blocked for nothing one got blocked with in 72 hours of owning a second copy of the game the other was blocked with in 3 he literally recorded buying the game installing the game playing the game and being banned from the game i will never buy another product from bi and would not advise anyone else to either

disappointing on several levels essentially youre paying $60 for an engine that mods run off the mods that currently exist are pretty underwhelming and arent made by the studio they have universally low production value and there are only a couple that are played the insulting part is the engine isnt even good its pretty slow no matter what settings its on and this is with pretty decent hardware maybe if you can get this game on super sale it would be worth it but the amount of content in this game in no way justifies the price

bad optimisation in the engine leads to fps lag meaning you need a pretty insane rig to run it even tho you shouldnt have to has a lot less content than previous arma versions not counting community ofc i enjoy the game but the fps issues which cant be fixed because they have to redesign the engine and the lack of conent makes it stale quite quickly edit due to some incredible community members some missions are now actually playable wasteland by samatra is very stable as are some altis life servers system i5 2500k @ 42ghz 16gb ram @ 1600mhz gtx 660ti ocd with this i get around 2060fps wether its on low or ultra it still runs the same

i really want to like this game but i cant the games mechanics graphics and the characters competency with his rifle is too far below the average shooter for me to enjoy i find myself yelling at the game to just hold the gun still enough to shoot and find out where my impacts are the character can not hold his rifle still to save his life ive seen 90 pound women hold them better than the players character he feels totally unsupported like he is floating in the air even when laying on the ground im fighting the characters complete lack of ability to hold the rifle still constantly any reasonably competent shooter can easily track a target from a prone position without needing to fight the rifles weight to stay focused the player never feels grounded zeroing feature is kinda cool if it made a difference ive shot a lot of rifles and none of them behave like they should in this game the game says that when shooting close i should aim lower to compensate the reverse is true in real life because of height of the sights over the bore of the barrel if you imagine and draw out an arc and you sight your rifle to the highest point on the arc all other ranges besides the one you are calibrated at should be below the highest point this is of course excluding the fact that bullets dont travel in perfectly shaped arcs a round could travel very straight and flat then gravity wins out and will drag the round to the ground very quickly before 200 yards as is the case with the ak47 a rifle like the m16 will shoot a very flat arc to 300 yards and can even stay predictably flat enough to make accurate shots out to 600 yards without a problem all of this feels like the game completely ignores or has wrong so using a weapon system that uses a round i know well makes it difficult and frustrating when the rifle wont do what im asking it to do for a simulator that is bad very bad the game markets itself as a combat simulator but i find myself fighting the controls so that much the whole keep it simple stupid philosophy of combat training sorta gets lost in having to press 3 buttons at once to make an accurate shot let alone assembling a drone and using it with any sort of practical use i understand they want certain aspects of the game so a player feels like he actually has to do his job in whatever unit he is in because everyone has their own roles to play in the war however that isnt how the game plays it would be one thing if the missions were objective based and if you are a drone pilot your objectives in the campign would be different than say the medic or support gunner however your role changes from mission to mission and sometimes even on the fly this causes you to pause the game and read the field manual so you dont crash the helicopter and get yourself killed while in flight or sitting there like an idiot trying to figure out how to put a drone together so you can use it to spot a mortar team on the hillside that complexity would be fine except if i only get a chance to play this game once a month or so the the particulars of addressing the problem requires me to look them up again so when i forget how to switch to secondary sights on a rifle it isnt a matter of pressing a button but looking up which buttons to press in sequence hell i could have done that in real life with a simple twitch of the wrist or adjusting my cheek weld the game would play out smoother if you were to pick a class of soldier to play at the start of the campaign and played missions with those roles so you arent finding yourself learning how to drive a tank when in the last mission you were on foot doing ground recon calling in air strikes i get it one hero wins the war on his own but once again if you market it as a military simulator i shoudlnt have to memorize and be profiecent at the entire game just to play the game and do a complicted task maybe once or twice in the campagn pilots can play as pilots officers can play as officers and scouts can play as scouts it also adds replay value playing the same missions from a different perspective and learning a new job in the game this game makes my eyes hurt im not sure what it is about it but something about the lighting effects tends to cause me to have to stop and close my eyes for a few moments ever couple of minutes or so the background blur is so bad i cant scan horizons and look for subtle out of place details of a sniper in the brush or look down a street without letting the games blurry lighting effects to catch up with what im trying to do which is hunt the enemy i thought maybe it was my graphics settings at first no its just how the engine is made im not a fan of battlefield 4 but at least the game is clear and i can predict ranges and bullet drop its no wonder im squinting all the time holding the gun up is often like looking down the reverse side of a telescope everything seems shrunk and distant then zooming down your sights looks how it should have to start with especially bad with pistols all in all i feel myself in the mood to play the game only to find myself yelling at the screen for my guy shooting 15 rounds at a soldier standing upright and facing me presenting a perfect silhouette and not hitting a damn thing because my rifle is floating in the air if i survive that encounter i find myself looking up which actions to even look up in the field manual just to turn on flir in an apc because i am now apparently a tank driver at night then i explode because the ai has to do none of this so i go back and play something more satisfying like xcom or mechwarrior

review for win campaign episode this campaign episode was unfortunatly shorter than the rest i finished it in 3 hours and 24 minutes while throughout the short time you are presented with interesting scenarios and action sequences these are overshadowed by short length and a lackluster ending i guess were waiting for arma 4 to continue this story  action packed and well acted and scripted  update has improved and added features  unacceptably short length  lackluster ending

i thought i would love this game but after dealing with sloppy menu systems unoptimized game settings and ridiculously varying quality in gameplay i just wish i never spent the money on this all the online gameplay shown is under incredibly set terms that youll almost never see without dedicating a ton of time to a community with a teamspeak

a great game fun to play with friends honestly i feel a bit ripped off by the lack of content provided by the developers and the gameplay seems aimed at entertaining the call of dutybattlefield fps crowd they continue to update it with new content but it just doesnt hold my interest very long not to mention the many unrealistic features they added in to make it combat seem more fluid and fast if you are overflowing with $$$ and you feel like buying it go ahead i would not recommend buying it just yet

awesome graphics and plot but games playability is very low controls are very hard to use you can not change them in the way you choose it is the worst game i ever played for 45 years really annoying just because of controls there are universal keys like t for chat or y for team chat they are totally different and another problem is that bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like dayz another not recommended game for me

this game is probably the least fun game ive played in a long time it tries to sell itself as a military sim but its as much a military sim as minecraft wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun also 60 dollar price tag games like red orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper youre money is better spent elsewhere

this game is arma 2 only with enhanced graphics on the same buggy ing engine that hasnt been optimized for graphics cardsin campaign mode is the place where your fps will always be its highest once you join multiplayer the fps will drop fast than a 1990s cellphone call in a tunnel to truely enjoy the game you have to purchase a monster eight core cpu which can go for around $800 or even $1000 and ill be damned if im gunna spend that money on a cpu to play a $60 game thats really only worth $20 if you decide to ignore this or any of the other negative reviews or buy into the lies of the  stains you call a positive review then i hope you enjoyed playing arma 1 cus thats what its going to look like if you want any decent performance the game relies heavily on cpus which will leave you at times skipping at times that leaves you feeling like your on a laptop with an integrated nvidia 9000gt i have two ati radeon hd5770s i was playing with one alone i get 12 fps after switching to crossfire the game gets maybe an increase of 12 fps metro 2034 last light gets more performance on one 5770 save your money and go buy something else its not worth the cash why you should spend your cash elsewhere same buggy cpu heavy engine as in arma 2  also somewhere you may see something about realistic bullet penetration and that sort of thing i have shot on occasion several soldiers who have needed more than 9 shots before going down at ranges near of excess of 500  feet or meters  and you know you hit them can they twitch their bodies at 90 degree angles the game goes by meters a meter is 3 feet more than a yard so do that math so it doesnt have realistic bullet penetration again a lousy game same graphics only with more bloom and water reflections you can now swim underwater and have a 2 man submarine that is unarmed except for a laser pointer still experiences the same crashes and glitches as arma 2 its the same ing game too many mods and generic mod servers like wasteland basically dazy without zombies still terrible

i played 11 hours on the free weekend and i use to enjoy the flashpoint series but found this game hard to get into and the missions seemed the same most of the time only the first episode was available for free but it seemed the same run through some trees shoot a few enemy then go to objective shoot a few more complete objective wait 2 minutes then mission ends couldnt connect to any multiplayer servers so maybe this game is too old now and no one hosts severs for it in the pacific region i might pick it up on the sale again if its 6070% off but 50% off and i will still hold out on it for now

having spend many hours in the buggy but innovative at the time operation flashpoint i took the opportunity to try arma 3 weekend deal for free while being 2 minutes in the tutorial i somehow got my camera stuck i can only walk back and forward and turn my head how to undo this no fraking clue rage quit uninstalled and never ever going to install another bohemia product on my pc

lemme tell you what i think about arma 3 arma 3 is a fantastic military sim game the physics are great the graphics are awesome and everything about it i enjoy especially the addons its a great improvement and i dont know why dayz isnt running on this amazing engine the zoombies mod that i enjoyed is gone now thanks to bohemia and dayz i hope you guys rot in hell what i hate about this game comes from a deep part of my soul and also a very external part of me too the amount of dip and try hards and ing posers i come across rattle me bones like no other going into a server with spec ops as your slot to choose to be makes me want to shoot my brains out the moment i went into these servers felt all i heard was spec ops ready for pick up this is spec ops going into fire this is spec ops sucking  for crack money that last one was a joke but you can see my anger in this so i ask in the chat bar that doesnt have a scroll up option for some ing reason are you guys in the military or have any of you served and with a gust of wind that screams oh  here we go it came no we have never served luckily we have this game my wtf face was not big enough to show how i felt these  heads have no idea what its like to be in combat i dont know yet my self but i plan on knowing very soon nor military tactics nor anything of particular military from anyone not just these spec op dumbasses anyway i get out of this server cause at this point i am growing a giant vein on my temple because i am holding back my self tearing these guys a new one alright i tell my self as i decide to browse through servers ah this one must be great seal team 8 okay seriously i get that youre a ing  and dont want to actually serve but naming your ing server seal team  doesnt make you look cool it pisses people off i go into this server and ask if any served or serving noopee seriously what the  do you think youre doing what part of being in a seal team do you ing know besides call of duty or some stupid  okay well theres alot of that let me get to my closing statement arma 3 is fun i love the game graphics are nice but the mulitplayer is so unoptimized it drives me insane having a nice pc and trying to enjoy games but without devs optimizing their games or using 64bit gaming even though the game you released is a pretty hefty game to play baffles me the physics engine is great physx engine its called from nvidia its some cool  too bad it doesnt look cool at 20fps and i am trying to drive but go right into a ing rock physics are working though that some good  anyway also the game feels stripped like theres nothing compared to arma 2 regarding weapons and vehicles i would not recommend this game if you have ever servedserving in the military or you want something casual if you have served or serving you will want to gut everyone theres no point in playing a game where no one knows what they are doing and pretends to be some badass that they will never be except maybe online but the pre pubescent or going through puberty voice doesnt sound like you want to follow them the amount of posers and wanna bes ruin this game for me oh and especially the 15th meu oh pretends to be a real marine meu like seriously these guys think they are marines their website says how much of they follow marines they even pretend to have medals and shadow boxes what the  is this  as someone working his  off to join a special group of people i can no longer play this game without getting rage singleplayer is fun though i like the single player mods are nice and i really cant say much else i would and wouldnt recommend this game its up to you

theres a famous world war i quote that says warfare is months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme terror replace terror with frustration and this game does indeed give you the true combat experience written on the tin from the description and tutorial missions i was expecting a military simulation with experiences like the commander ordered my squad over the radio to go to grid point 134190 and hold the bridge so we mounted up in an apc and fought out way there to hold the line against the enemy advance basically i expected a much deeper and more realistic version of battlefield  like the falcon 30 and gunship 2000 military sims i played when i was a teenager but with infantry and tanks and tactics and whatnot what i got is nothing like that the singleplayer is more like what i would call a walking forward simulator seriously my left middle finger started going numb from holding down w while following the squad leader character across a field for 15 minutes while only encountering two enemies of course when i did encounter enemies i tended to get shot in the head pretty quickly because the ai can see right through the ohsorealistic scrub brush that covers the landscape whereas all i could see was the tangle of bushes in front of my face with a big red target box floating in the middle of them then the squad leader guy stepped on a landmine the only one in the world apparently  of all the luck and i started following some other guys across another field for even longer only this time with an ambush of several lethal bushes a few minutes out from the save point after snoozing my way all across the field and then getting killed in the same spot about a dozen times i thought okay maybe the real draw here is the realistic chainofcommand combined arms multiplayer scenarios let me try that so i popped into multiplayer and didnt see any of that either there were scads of rpg servers where i could play as a random villager aka playing walking foward simulator toward the corn field at the edge of town and trying to earn a bit of money to buy food at the market and not starve true combat gameplay right there were wasteland servers where you spawn in the middle of the continent somewhere with nobody around and only a vague suggestion of what your supposed to be doing fortify a base gather supplies and hoard them and of course a halfhour walk to the nearest point of interest i wandered around the airport for 10 minutes looking for supplies or a vehicle found nothing shrugged and disconnected there were also king of the hill servers which at least featured combat well actually they mostly featured waiting for helicopters to respawn the objective was to go from my teams base to occupy a town about 15 kilometers away which equated to a halfhour walk a tenminute drive assuming you didnt run over a bush which would pop your tire and then its back to the halfhour walk or a oneminute helicopter ride so helicopter was the obvious choice but those only spawn every few minutes half the time some jerk would crash his truck into the helicopter and destroy it so wed have to wait again on the occasions i actually got to the airspace over the town i would jump out of the helicopter open my parachute and generally be shot to death while dangling in the air the one time i parachuted out early and walked for a minute to get to the town i survived for a good while sneaking into the town but didnt run into any enemies to fight eventually i got bored of that and ran to a tower to see if i could snipe people from the top but as soon as i peeked out over the railing i got shot in the head so was it realistic you bet months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme frustration was it fun not really i had a lot more fun playing luftrausers while waiting for it to download overall a colossal disappointment im so glad it was a free trial weekend  i would have cried tears of rage if i had actually paid for this thing

bohemia interactive made their debut with operation flashpoint and then changed to arma series afterwards since the first installment it has been downhill up to third one the engine is heavy unoptimised clunky for smooth gameplay no matter what setup you may find for your pc the menu and ui interface is also archaeic and still as slow as it was in ofp days i cant see justification for this game unless it would be around 490 and even then its not worth your time the map is boring and unimaginative compared to that of chernarus sahrani and the multiple locations of ofp as for gameplay the shooting is well done and the many ways of controlling your character is definitely the best of the industry has to offer its unfortunate that the teamplay and coordination falls down to its own clunkiness finally the modding is still there which offers replayability and whatever people come up with to use but still i find the engine and other problems within the core too deep to actually be worth of ones time

well what to say about this game in two words its bad arma 3 is terribly optimized for pc mine isnt the greatest but i saw someone who had two 980s try running it didnt even get over 50 fps never knew you needed a $4000 computer to even get over 60 fps the servers are terrible there are rarely any servers that are populated with a <150 ping even if i try to connect to any of them it says connection failed people may have thought i made a bad review because of how difficult and realistic it was i like games like this too bad bohemia interactive didnt put enough effort into making this game run really well and to make the server connection good instead of fixing these problems and making announcements about them they decide to release dlc after dlc to add onto this broken game if you are stupid enough to pay $15 for two helicopters you must not be too wise with your money i should have mentioned when getting into a server you must either donate or go into ts to fly why cant they just use game chat guess i will never get my pilot license they probably sould have fixed arma 2 as well before making this one i refuse to run this on the lowest possible settings because there is no reason i should a game like this you need good view distance and things need to looks some what nice you cant see an enemy a few thousand meters out but they sure can see you please do not buy this game unless it goes on sale this game is nowhere near worth $60 i would say its worth 2030 range

this game is beyond disappointing it has so many elements to make it the best whatever the  it wants to be but its too buggy and unoptimized there really is no excuse for arma 3 to run this bad at this stage of development honestly this game is in alpha whether it says full release or not there is a huge lack of content compared to the previous arma arma 3 has just about 14 of what arma 2 had the saddest thing overall is the fact that there has been no effort to fix this game in quite sometime i am fairly certain that bohemia has the resources but they refuse to even bother with it they seriously used resources to make ing karts a presumably broken waste of money instead of fixing their  ing game

i really really wanted to like this game it has a lot going for it but unlike the previous games they changed the damage model so that enemies take 4 body shots by an assult rifle to die and can take multiple shots to the head you cannot change this in the options and i couldnt find a good mod to change it basically it went from a very realistic fps to call of duty what a bizzare decision for the devs to make

i think the forum post that i made sums it up well tldr the games community is terrible and the multiplayer is full of  mods that barely work with the occasional gem ruined by the community that inhabits it for a more detailed review of my free weekend day with the game read below after my dad bought arma 3 i thought i would try it out as well ive been interested in a realistic modern fps but they dont really exist in numbers these days after taking over an hour to install the game i was able to play the tutorial while tweaking with my video settings i eventually up to over 30 fps while looking really good then i decided i wanted to try the multiplayer out what a mistake that was arma 3s player base is actually worse than arma 2s in that every single online server is some  reincarnation of the hunger games or dayz without the zombies i spent about 4 hours trying to have fun in these game modes but to no avail i was playing a really bad set of mods set in a gigantic map that might as well be a copy of just cause 2s getaway island all in a modern fps simulator it was like trying to play paintball in playground that was clearly a copy of mcdonalds playplaces after some searching i eventually found a domination server which was as close to vanilla arma as i was going to get it was incredibly confusing there was no tutorial to explain any of the game mechanicsmod additions and people were wrecking the bases vehicles i was desperate so i tried to play anyways after about 1015 mins of gameplay i noticed that my fps was lagging really badly i had just found a team of coordinated players though so i just tried to play through the pain after the 5 of us singlehandedly took the next objective everyone was complaining about fps issues and i was getting 1318fps there was clearly something wrong but luckily for us a moderator just got on he reset the server for us which i thought was really nice but it was to no avail everyone was still having fps issues and i guess that has to do with arma 3s terrible optimization andor the custom maps or plugins memory leakage filling up our ram then i encountered a new problem the moderator he was especially grumpy and clearly over 40 so being so outoftouch with not understanding everything he was getting really upset at all of the new players he understandably kicked a new player that was spamming the minigun on our helicopter even after the moderator told him to stop and then i got kicked for no reason presumably because i was also in the helicopter i came back in told him that he kicked the wrong guy and the moderator essentially blew me off whatever screw him then i found a fob to spawn on that somebody set up on the enemys flank i was able to shoot a couple of guys before they shot me off the hillside i spawn back in and everyone is doing awesomely the enemy has a frogfoot firing missiles and bombs into the city the warthog is doing the same thing we had mortars they had mortars and i was able to move into the town because it was getting absolutely hammered so i set up shop in a 2nd story window down a street when i spot a couple of soldiers i aimed at thier bodies but couldnt see a iff tag so i shot one of them after the other part of this ambushed squad came back out in the open i shot another one i was unsure about whether they were friend or foe still so i kept an eye out for server messages in the lowerright corner loe and behold this guy was a friendly and i just shot him the other guy mustve been a friendly too which means that i accidently killed 2 of my teammates i immediately said sry on side chat but it was too late apparently the immature community that seems to make up arma 3s multiplayer though it would be funny to set up a special plugin for teamkillers whether it was an accident or not after 23 tks you are immediately teleported away from the game and your position in the town to some prison with several annoying soundbites going on in the background and nothing to look at but other tkers and a really lowquality repeated billborad of some kind after i sat there for a few moments i was also wearing pink clothing that had team killer printed all over it and there was a soundbite of a baby crying because thats how annoying the moderators wanted to be in short i accidently made a mistake and was punished in the most immature way possible by being imprisoned in an annoying micspam room with nothing to do for 6 minutes wow in every other fps you either lose a bunch of points get kicked or are killed by the server in arma 3 the s that run the only closetovanilla server throw you in a prison that forces you to listen to once again mic spam that is against the servers own rules im so glad that i got to try this game out this weekend because i would have regrets had i bought it thank you arma devs for letting me experience the tiness that is your multiplayer glad i didnt waste my money on it

arma 3 broken game broken promises arma 3 alpha comes out has great voice over quality great hit registry guns work when you shoot them they update it broken voice over broken hit registry 90% of bullets dont register a hit car physics are for trolls all the servers are run by admin and friends donate money and they will ban whoever you dont like planes dont work aa shoot you down from 5 km away the only thing fun is flying a helicopter running is broken in the game play epoch mod and get shot by a five year old hiding in the bushes in his underwear bad games made worse just pretty graphics however half the servers run terribly and dont support high frames so even if you have a nice computer good luck getting good frames would have been great if they just left it in alpha instead of screwing it up

armas popularity stems from the fact that its a modern shooter with good modding support thats it the game itself is heavily flawed and buggy bohemia interactives strategy is to exploit the lack of moddable shooters by releasing a half game and letting the modding community fix it sure there will be some great mods for the game but their success shouldnt be attributed to arma games like battlefield 1942 battlefield 2 and the halflife series were hugely popular due to all the great mods made for them but the games themselves without mods were actually competent with the shift to catering towards console gamers modding support has fell by the wayside and arma perhaps unintentionally fills that gap but arma has horrible ai horrible physics horrible performance a clunky ui and so on if arma werent moddable im confident its metacritic rating would be more like 510

tried this for the free weekend to see if i could enjoy it played on normal and the difficulty was far too great for me to find fun i respect this game and feel its good and everything but even on the lowest difficulty i find it near impossible to find and shoot the enemy gun sway is really intense and this is with me lagging behind the rest of the ai players walking to preserve energy im aware of the extra stamina drained when moving crouched enemy seems to be able to see through foliage if you like incredibly difficult things this game is for you i took my time to do the tutorial learn the buttons positioned myself carefully and usually just ended up getting shot theres time compression thank god however a lot of people might not even realize its there this game has its moments but i would recommend operation flashpoint red river over this any day i find it much more satisfying moment to moment i am an adult with a full time job walking through the woods simulator isnt my thing i gave this game a chance and i feel as though i wasted two hours of my life yesterday i want to love this game as much as the original operation flashpointbut i cant i simply cant in cleetus voice graphically things went well i have a gtx 660 and 10 gigs of ram on an i5 with shadow play on and recording i was getting somewhere between 2570 fps fps drops intensely around buildings i am runnning it on ultra settings if you have a system similar to mine you can be pretty much assured to play at an acceptable framerate if you have friends to play with turn on ofred river the friend i tried this with was too frustrated with the shooting mechanics to enjoy it this game is good mind you but not for me

arma 3 is definitely more improved than arma 2 the experience is much better and the graphics has improved and the maps seem to be bigger however to play it with at least 30fps or higher you need a supercomputer to do so as this game is horribly optimised here is a comparision of my frame rates playing different games battlefield 4  70fps ultra settings tomb raider  120fps ultra settings arma 3  40 fps standard settings the graphics of this game is comparable to tomb raider verdict dont buy it unless you own a supercomputer

i like military sim games and this one has a lot going for it but in the several hours i put in to try it out i found a huge flaw to me it has way to many keystrokes to accomplish what you want just the simple task of engaging an enemy requires you to hit 12 dozen keys almost many keys are dual purposed press or press & hold and have to be held with other keys  which means you dont always get your character to do what you want or he does something you dont want you can of course rebind any of the keys but then you end up using every key on the keyboard literally even the num pad if you have one on your keyboard i think this is just bad design sure after a hundred hours you probably could make it 2nd nature to tap all the keys you need to do what you want quickly but come on i think this game couldwould be great if they would simplify the controls doesnt need to be cod easy but certainly needs to improve the one other thing that got me trying to play multiplayer and its very confusing there is not much to tell you what is going on and what you are doing  and thats just getting into the game multiply screens to get thru with no instrutions or details once you do make it into a game again no instuctions or details about whats going on and what you are suppose to be doing i wasnt the only one other people on the team seem to just be wondering around clueless such potential such fail

meh i have a couple of issues with the game 1 you need a fantastic cpu and decent gpu to handle this game otherwise you will be constantly playing at 20 fps 2 for how much processing they take up the ai is downright stupid they are still too slow and hardly use enough cover to blend in with players to make up for difficulty the ai is incredibly accurate and good at detecting 3 the vanilla campaigns are set so your teams are at poor odds with the ai this is supposed to be realistic where real world tactics are used why is my team running into an enemy town through a valley 4 the armor system is awful it takes 56 shots to kill with the medium caliber assault rifles i know they say its because of plate carriers plates dont necessarily stop bullets they take a lot of energy out of them so you dont die immediately getting shot is still going to put you out of a fight anything past 243 or 65 is going to start breaking bones it would be amazing if you could even still move on your own let alone shoot back accurately 5 the campaign is mediocre with missions that take too long and put too much responsiblity on the player trying to have fun arma2 also had bad voice actors with bad lines but this is a little better its stilll not much of an improvement 6wonky user interface this have improved on a lot over time and there are mods to make it more intuitive it still takes a while to do anything in your inventory though maybe because in real life it would take time to rummage through your pockets and ruck sack to find anything it still sucks though 7 no tutorial yes i know there is a boot camp thing now that hardly explains how to use anything it still missed subjects like actual fighting flying helicopters and jets taking cover 8 mission editor how do you use it i dont really know ive been messing with it for years i still dont think i know much about how it all works 9 multiplayer it doesnt happen at least from what ive seen just about all the servers are locked clan servers or empty public matches the server browser is cluttered and confusing with no explanation of what it all means i mean call of duty was so successful partly because of its join a random lobby feature i know i mentioned all the bad stuff there is much good to this game and im sure other reviewers will point it out i played this game franchise until i got sick of it now i play insurgency because its much more fluid and refined with the same idea of critical dammage and little hud

at first this game was a lot of fun to play but with the time it rather got worse than good  the game does not go above 29 fps for me on i7 4770k gtx 770 ssd  it easily drops under 20 fps when there is a bit of vehicle movement around the map  the ai is programmed really bad not finding paths not moving at all when told to the game is just as good without ai as it is with them maybe some dummy targets for your enemies which again are overly op compared to your ai  since the shutdown of gamespy it is completely unavailable for coop missions with friends hosting steam servers was not working since the games release and last but not least the price is way too high for a game said to be still under development i regret every cent of the 45 euros which i payed for this game

some missions that were around since the ofp days like cti just arent there the gun handling feels like something straight out of battlefield if you know how to control the recoil which by the way is not hard it basically goes straight up you can be completely accurate at 300m with a fully automatic weapon the character handling feels very awkward and this is coming from someone with 2000 hours on arma 2 i know about awkward controls there are like 3 movement speeds all of which take around 3 keystrokes to get inout of what happened to the good old days of just pressing w then going this isnt a damn car i dont have to switch gears depending on the speed i am going at speaking of cars the cars handle very awkwardly aswell the acceleration is just ridiculous it takes forever to get up to around 30kmh then it just switches on the afterburner and off it goes hey look an afterburner oh wait its a trainer jet a stealth a10 and some freak su25 thingy oh boy there is so much wrong with the planes and helicopters in this game i love aviation hell im trying to make it my job so this part hurts me the most where do i begin with this lets start with the easiest l39 its a trainer its not supposed to carry weapons and youre gonna tell me its gonna go up in battle with no other air support ha good joke im gonna be honest i like the looks of the su25 looking thing but its never going to happen much less in 20 years the su25 is still doing well and if it were to get upgraded in the next 20 years it would probably only be the systems and avionics either that or they will build an entirely new aircraft from scratch or replace it with the already existing ground pounders oh boy here comes the big one that damn stealth a10 freak there is so so so much wrong with this its not even funny alright lets start with what stealthing an aircraft is all about sharp edges to bounce the radar off in a different direction than where its coming from the whole aircraft needs to be sharp guys not just the engines notice something about the stealth aircraft that are flying around today internal stores you dont want those suckers reflecting radar signals now do you the a10 is a subsonic cas close air support ground pounder it is literally designed  the enemy up and theyll know what hit them but it wont matter cause theyll either be dead or their equipment will be too ed up to shoot back there is no use stealthing a plane that will be flying at under 5000 everyone and their mother will be seeing that bad boy its also supposed to take damage the whole titanium bathtub  and whatnot by sharpening the edges you are adding more structural failure points in the event of you know a missile hitting it im no aircraft engineer but to me this makes sense if someone is reading this and actually is an aircraft engineer please tell me how wrong or right i am same goes for stealthing helicopters i mean come on how are you going to stealth a ing rotor spinning at hundreds of rpm and constantly changing pitchangle the mi48 this is not how things work you cant take 2 choppers merge them together and add some stealth  on it and expect anyone to take you seriously arma 3 is set in the near future around 20 years from now if you look at military history in the 20th century progress was at its peak in ww2 up to vietnam and then kind of slowed down till the mid 90s and were now more or less at a standstill were still using tanks aircraft and weapons designed in the 70s and 80s and perfectioned it takes a world war or some major conflict of some sort to get us off our asses and to put our thinking caps on so do you really think that 20 years from now the aks m4s m16s etc will be out of service and replaced by a new standard of 65mm caseless shells that we wont be still using abrams strikers t90s and bmp 90s well probably have the f22 unfortunatly probably the f35 pak fa and others most of this stuff will most likely be old  with fancy new systems i half blame dayz for how this game turned out dayz iswas a good modgame but it attracted the wrong kind of people to arma it didnt attract milsim people it attracted the general public that likes shooters and zombies the funny thing is most of the dayz servers you find on arma 2 are those stupid 10000 vehicles ones with military weapons in every corner and everyone shooting everyone else in chernogorsk thats not survival thats just glorified deathmatch either way i digress bohemia probably decided to make the game more accessible for those people leading to this casualized shadow of what was once great i could let the whole it doesnt seem finished part slide if they werent releasing dlc for the parts that arent finished you are expecting me to pay 15 bucks for 2 helicopters when there are barely any in the base game to begin with and i do agree that all of the future bs thing that ive been saying can be fixed with mods but modded servers are not popular and the most modding the general public wants to do is grab one of those all in one mods like dayz tldr its a casual version of arma 2 designed to cater to the general public if you want a military simulator id recommend arma 2 over this if you feel like arma 2 was overwhelming then this is probably the game for you

arma  well what can i say that havent learned from the last time make a better server list that doesnt suck your internet dry or makes you get kicked out for not being able to connect almost each and every time i was doubing to purchase this titel but when it got on the free weekend and i played it well  lets just say im not turning my money into this game

its ok and all but i really think some things need improvment the sprinting animation is really unrealistic for me and when you play the game on minumin graphics you get these weird light glitches across the sky also for $60 i think is too overpriced i got the arma 2 complete collection for $40 and thats better value the gunplay in arma 2 is somewhat realistic and the running animation is a whole lot better plus you can get dayz free of charge overall im a little dissapointed with arma 3 i wouldve thought it would of been better 510

hi im a big fan of armas i have been since the first release back when it was called flashpoint i believe and i have spent well over 20000 dollars on computer upgrades and probably more then 2000 hours of my time making levels over the years all the time thinking the next patch will fix the bugs plaguing this otherwise beautiful game most of the levels i created never worked out because of the bugs i would leave the level work over night to see how the ai faired and to check for stability it was always the same you would find the ai stuck on some tree fence or even just a rock now anyone that drives know how to avoid and get out of this situation but the programmers at bis must be pedestrians because after all these years these devastating bugs are still just as obvious in arma3 in fact almost all the things that make the game useless are still in the game the best you can do is make little missions keep it simple and for gods sake dont let the ai near a vehicle most casualties in an arma missions are ai vehicles driving over there own guys and crashing into each other then taking shortcuts though the wood and cliffs its bad enough that the men are 3 feet tallreally im 61 i always think im on my knees the vehicles are drivable in third person only the windows are to low cant see out the side windows thats why i thing the guys at bis are kids without driving experience then theres those annoying thingsnot bugs like every time you go to the map you come back crouched the gun is always up in my face the gun should only be up if i put it there you cant hold a gun in firing position they are heavy this is a terrible thing to do in a game any hunter will tell you its crazy and unrealistic and very annoying the gun should always be shouldered on your chest pointing up safely or hanging is hands pointing down safely never in my face or anyone elses unless you intend to shoot them but ai has always been the main problem especially driving and taking corners the map look great until you try and use them the buildings are in the street what happened to the 3 to 6 meters on both side of the road even front a lawns so its not suppressing to see the game all jammed up on a unrealistic street corner and ai dont understand bridges so you constantly find them all stuck at one i could mention another 30 bugs that have persisted in the game making useless since the beginning so instead of fixing arma2 they just added a bunch of new modern stuff and knocked out all the great stuff we played for so we lose all the work we did no backwards compatibility well i could live with that if they fixed the plentiful persistent bugs if the sandbox has just a few toy and they are broken why do bis continue adding dlc to add to the insult we played for this game ahead of time its still in beta and generates so many errors the log have to be turned off to use it why dont they just fix the main bugs that have always beenlike ai  that would be the only thing anyone could ask for please im getting tired of wasting my time making script and mods that cant be used because of bugs in the game dont get me wrong i love this game for what it could be if they fixed it i think its the best game on the market if they fixed it they just insist on ignoring the faults and try to mask them with other stuff ohh and fyi lately everything is reversed if your man says enemy on our right its actualy left and even get in and disembark tags are reversed effects from some tanks are on the wrong side of the vehicles  the speed of ai vehicles have the hicups very annoying and so does the camera using switchcamera it just bounces back anf forth making the camera views useless in fact at present date the game is not usable this game needs some major repairs but they just go on with future features and let the bugs addup and up if your car has a flat tire painting it will not fix the problem thats the way i see it anyway

i loved flashpoint but this game has one of the worst singleplayer campaigns ever at some points completely unplayable if you are into singleplayer  dont buy this game the only thing you can enjoy here is the multiplayer which can be awesome at some points and it is the only reason why i have bought this game  at some point i was hoping the campaign will be at least a little enjoyable but i am very dissappointed now i dont recommend buying this game until they fix all the issues in the campaign

i have been playing arma 3 for the past couple days with the free trial and i was really concidering buying this game however even with all the realistic featues that i love i cannot stand the fatigue and weapon sway system after running for 34 minutes a short sprint or getting nicked by a bullet it becomes nearly impossible to aim even while focusing and holing my breath the weapon is still moving to dramatically to accuratly hit a target at even a hundred meters with a scope the army is trained to be able to shoot under stress fatigue and even injury i myself have done 100 meter sprints and half mile runs then grabbed my ar immediatly after and can still quickly and accurately hit a man sized target at 100 meters also i only shoot with iron sights until this unrealistic fatigue and weapon sway system is fixed i will not be buying the game honestly what is the point of buying it if i cant even engage the ai who guess what can still accurately shoot you while injured or fatigued
not recommended
no decent manual available the training in the beginning does not show you how to use the sight on the gun so the next step where you have to shoot targets in a field you have to hit one 400 yards away but theres no clear way how to use the sight on the gun the cross hair on the screen is not accurate enough wished it had a better manual because playability is paramount to graphics

this really is a poor game and should not cost 36 heres why 1 recommended system specs are a lie i could not run the singleplayer campaign above 30fps at 1024x768 lowest everything including draw distance with a fx6300 and hd 7770 false advertising and also extremely unreasonable hardware requirements fanboys will tell you arma 3 is super advanced etc so demands a lot of the cpu but i believe its just poorly optimised you can have a lot of units moving about and framerates will stay smooth but as soon as people start shooting performance plummets so i believe its something to do with badly optimised effects not demanding ai which is pretty poor in any case multiplayer performance is even worse and when 20fps is considered normal its effectively unplayable people should not accept 20fps due to game restrictions and the devs ought to really address this 2 gameplay is terrible  so bad that it feels like its buggy rather than poor design decisions jogging for about 10 seconds will cause you to start panting and creates extreme weapon sway  maybe they are trying to simulate a walle future of fat soldiers again really kills the gameplay considering the size of arma 3s missions which require a lot of moving about recoil on weapons is ridiculous and feels like your guy is shooting with only one hand with the gun held sideways damage is ridiculous enemy targets will take 2 headshots and some more chest shots to be brought down it all adds together to completely kill immersion and makes the game feel like a chore 3 immersion  again keeping in mind how bad the shooting mechanisms are the ai are utterly gamebreaking as well you can empty a clip of bullets in a relatively small 1 meter area around an enemy target he will not budge he will not flinch he will just keep on shooting you until you die and you probably will die because of the awful recoil system in place which makes aiming for the player impossible the ai are basically terminators who will simply run about from time to time stand still and then shoot you to death there is a mod which reduces recoil and with this mod a player can mow down these ai like fish in a barrel simply because they dont move once theyve decided to stop and shoot you 4 content  really really lacking okay they have a single player campaign which is pretty dull but whats really bad is that they seem to have left a lot of the content up to the community to develop there is no ambient combat module in the editor unlike arma 2 there is no specops module in the editor unlike arma 2 there is no quick mission creator unlike arma 2 this makes a huge difference in the game because it means if you want to actually experience the sandbox of the game with ai you have to either 1 create relatively complex scripts yourself or 2 download other missions or mods its not a pickup and play game which is disappointing considering arma 2 was arma 3 just goes wrong in so many ways from the gunplay to the ai to the stamina and damage system basically every aspect of a fps and the lack easy to use content such as an ambient combat module or quick mission creator to the incredible system requirements it really is not worth 36 and while the futuristic setting is very appealing and graphics look nice theres no real reason to get this over arma 2 which is much better overall save your money

i thought this game would fix the giant mess it created in the last arma game i was so wrong and i wasted my money on yet another stupid pile of crap when you cant finish the tutorial because it wont tell you how to aim down the sight or tell you what the hell barring 220 is supposed to mean i give up and shoot the drill sargent game deleted

once again bohemia has delivered a garbage war simulator with mediocre graphics in comparison to other war shooters in the industry and optimization worthy of being related to the original release of crysis 1 im using a gtx780 i53750k 34ghz 16gb ddr 1600mhz and it ran pitifully not to mention the voice acting is once again terrible and robotic sounding and the gameplay is awkward and cumbersome with the worst control scheme in the history of shooter games i get youre going for realism but at least try and make it accessible you dont need crap controls to make the world more immersive you need smoother controls so that you forget youre even playing a game youre better off reinstalling battlefield 2 and downloading project reality if you really want an immersive war simulator

for the money well no this game is worth 10 times less than what i paid for it actually i have played phone games more exciting than this my review for arma 3 is simple i got it on steam sale i played it 3 times and its been pretty bad  the servers cause fps lag because i get 40fps normally on some servers and others it crawls to 9  the missions are basically to try and troll people  the maps are big and awesome but theres not many people and whoever you see just kills you  its just boring half the time so if you like just exploring the virtual map and doing jack all half the time then this games for you but you could be doing that in the real world and have an extra $30 bucks in your wallet sale price decisions decisions

the worst the campaign is lame and lacking to say the least i had to restart it because of friendly fire 10 seconds in while i was driving the truck at least 4 times for no reason as soon as you come across enemy forces which were your allies 10 seconds earlier you have to shoot them 4 times with your  weapon while they shoot you twice and youre dead and you have to restart from 5 minutes prior sitting through the same horrible coms talk between leaders tried some multiplayer wouldnt even let me chat to ask them how i can move considering i started as a citizen with my hands cuffed behind my head on a random island no where near anyone or anything what the  is that im hoping steam will refund my money this is my most regrettable purchase yet dont buy this game

this is more of an infantry simulator than a computer game its an fps but with flight sim controls and realism the tutorials are called showcases which is not at all helpful or descriptive if youre coming to this for the first time youll likely make the same mistake i did and try to do the campaign first the sim itself is insanely hard the realism means youll often come under almost instantly lethal fire from shooters who are completely invisible to you and thats just in the tutorials even when you can see the enemy theyre often dots on the horizon who can nevertheless pick you off behind cover with unerring accuracy ammo is incredibly restricted meaning i was actually glad when one of my team got killed because it meant i could resupply there may be a way to get resupplied without your teamates dying but like so much of this game it is not obvious how to accomplish that the controls are far from intuitive it took me the better part of an hour and some editing of the control menu to get the gun optics to actually come up reliably when i clicked the right mouse button much of what you are supposed to do happens through the order menu i think youre meant to use this maybe again it isnt clear to order npc team members to do stuff like attack a particular target but it is far too unweildy to use in combat to select the order menu you have to press 0 or   didnt work and the font chosen means it isnt obvious if you should be typing o o or 0 its zero btw but zero on the number keys at the top of the keyboard zero on the keypad does something else the keys can also do different things when modified by alt and ctrl in the middle of a firefight where you die instantly to targets you cant see navigation seems straight forward until you try and apply it and realise that waypoints dont actually appear in your hud or maybe they do and i just dont know which buttonmenu item to select to make them visible even the inventory system is overly complex if you try and loot a corpse you have to loot each individual part of their kit separately clothing webbing and pack not realising this for the first hour and a half contributed substantially to my shortage of ammo ive tried the campaign and the first 2 showcases i cant complete the 2nd showcase because on the rare occasions i dont get instakilled by the hostiles the antiaircraft missile is unguided and i dont have the knack for hitting moving targets with it ive died at least 100 times so far >20 of those to land mines which are also invisible a punishing exercise in misery and frustration not recommended

worst arma game in history it feels more like cod or battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really didnt do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like vtol planes when you fly really fast i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50 cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another lmg finally the nato forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the opfor and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes helis and ifvs is terrible there should be more ifvs than tanks and thats not the case if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 mbts and a ifv im more likely to take a mbt and 2 ifvs im patroling not trying to take an airbase those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on arma 3

sp or anything that isnt a mod is a no go wish i could have given my cash to a few mod devs instead if you do have it you should definately get the breaking point mod plays better than the rest of the game update as of 11315 still a better flight sim than a tactical shooter by far

played this over a free access weekend i have a highend gaming rig so no problems there  liked what i saw i really wanted this game but decided to do some research before i pulled the trigger i really wanted a game that would let me play with modern vehicles i couldnt wait to jump in an abrams or apache or a leopard 2 or a t90 or jump in a tunguska to try and shoot down a a10 i had visions of massive armored battles with supporting infantry artillery and drones oh my all with badass graphics and realism only a simulator can give  beyond the laughable dumbed down versions found in the likes of battlefield and cod then i came across screenshots of what initally looked like a russian mi28 havoc sweet with the dual contrarotating main rotor blades of a ka50 hokum apparently arma iii much vaunted hardcore military simulator doesnt even have realworld vehicles in it fantasy island nations with ficitious governments to battle in i can handle completely madeup armored vehicles tanks and helicopters in a supposed highend military simulator no thanks

i say no simply because the arma 3 main game multiplayer including wasteland feels like it is still in beta with the amount of bugs glitches lag etc it is worth it for the mods takistan life and altis life but i still wouldnt pay 35 for it if its going cheap and your tempted get it otherwise avoid it i still enjoy arma 2 more its smoother

the game looks good the audio is fantastic and the style of play when considering other fps is very authentic the mission designs and training are great and well thought out i can clearly see why many people are taking to this game franchise as it provides a much more realistic diversion then one would get from cod etc so why am i giving this a negative review because this game does something with its control format that i just do not like in an effort to make the game more realistic the developers provide too many customization options for the keyboard it took me roughly 15 hours to tweak the controls to the point where it was halfway playable and even then because you have a button for what feels like everything it isnt smooth i know some will disagree with me but despite the unrealistic approach to the cod etc franchises one thing i feel they always get right is how intuitive they make the controls feel that is really the best way i can describe it i can say from experience that with enough training and practice weapons manipulation tactics movement etc becomes second nature and smooth despite the chaos that a battlefield provides it has to be said this game gets most things right but whatever fun or joy there is to be found in it in my opinion anyway is taken away by an overly complicated controls layout

software is buggy ill get stuck between water and land and have to restart the level also i can do 2 direct head shots and nothing happens but the character can take a single hit anywhere and die this is on novice if i take a differnt path the level gets hung and nothing will progress unless the levelagain has to be restarted my team members will have super human powers and they take off leaving me in the dust while my character never recovers from exhaustion i understand they try to make this a realistic as possible to being a foot soldier but i spend most of the time walking from one end of the map and back i wish they did more r&d before releasing this and spent more on combat i wish i could have my $ back

arma 3 yes a huge game with lot of fine stuff in it its really fun to play actually but you gonna reconize very soon what ruins this game again  if you think you put 1500 into a gaming machine and though arma would run proper forget it in singleplayer you wont get troubles but in multiplayer some server run with 50 players or more and thats simply too much for this game gotta be honest it depends on the mod you play but compared to singleplayer its a huge framedropdifference  as you noticed its 2014 this games has bugs that takes you back in the 90s it seems to me as its still in alpha maybe beta now 45 aint justifiable  and for sure not the dlc that includes 2 chopper for 13 cmon the community can make better addons and doesnt want any money for it  if the fun isnt ruined by the stuff i already mentioned it will after you noticed youre hard work was wasted by a hacker you need to seperate a good gamer and the fact that 3rd person can be very tricky if used smart or the fact that its not like hitting stuff in cod or it can take up to 5 bullets or even thermalattachments was used with a hackerchild that uses godmode and hits anything with his aimbot or even more annoying stuff like finish a whole game by probably 1 click 80 peoples will lose all their stuff by 1 hacker how can bohemia make it that easy to hack its game im not talking about a hacker once a month if you have some game experience after a while im personally talking about 600h you will notice them in almost any server and dont think they get caught steam wont support your work with finding and banning the hacker of course not  its like hmm the more hacker there are the more player dont wanna play this game anymore and what will they do  buy a new steamgame perfect lads this game is death good bye

this game used to be good but since bohemia which doesnt listen to people have made this game into a drunk simulator 2014 just as they did with walking simulator aka dayz standalone they have taken weapon machanics to next level of unrealistic where your soldier has no muscles to control and hold a gun in his hand since it has unrealistic exaggerated sway in a shape of number 8 and will be adding unrealistic inertia into the fact where when you move your weapon even a bit it starts to rock from side to side they need to stop changing things that werent broken and fix a million other problems in their game i do like how they spent a lot of time to imrove some stupid door sounds and yet when you wanna open a door you have one of the worst action menus in the world where you have to scroll your mouse to do anything on their forums they dont like any negative feedback and only wanna hear all praise on how awesome their unrealistic sway and inertia are i will be uninstalling this game cause its just unplayable especially since this game cant even give you 30fps online and usually goes down to 20fps or worse and then you realise how horrible the sway becomes save your money on a finished game and support developers who actually listen to the customer

this game is an interesting concept but is not for everyone it is a modern military simulator and it does this pretty well tiny little nuances of the miliary experience show up leaning around corners to aim having spotters for sniping and switching fire modes on a gun and healthy amounts of bullet drop are all things you will have to get used to those things arent that bad and some can even be fun especially the artillery targeting computer which has a maximum range well beyond the edge of the map has different types of shells and shows how long the bullets with take to get to their destination and it will take time if you shoot from one end of the island to another sometimes however these nuances can just get annoying the keyboard is cluttered with keys assigened to different things in places that dont make much sense lets just say i wasnt expecting to have different buttons for my watch my compass and my very real map there is no typical first person shooter radar showing where enemies or self made waypoints are although mission waypoints do show up long story short this game is incredibely complicated to control and will not be controller friendly the big draw for me and for most people after seeing reviews from people like nerdcubed will be the map editor appearently this is what the games developers were expecting as well because the game didnt even come with campaigns at launch they are being added as dlc over the next few months the editor is incredibely detailed to the same extent if not more than the rest of the game unfortunately it is even more userunfriendly particularly concerning nonphysical items like spawnpoints and mission objectives some of these require you to close the game entirely and edit the text files for the scenario other things like controlling where you want units of the map to go and who they will attack is another mystery entirely the learning curve is a monstrosity im not particulary concerned about graphics but this game is pretty underwhelming in that respect its textures are uninspiring and driving physics are woeful where the game makes up for this is in scale the game is freaking huge it will take and uncomfortable long time to cross even in a helicopter i believe the estimates are something like 270 square kilometers of space in other words very very large and possibly of the largest maps of any game it is pretty empty but there are some small towns churches and all sorts of terrain to give a lot of creative leeway when designing a scenario if you can figure out how if you know toare willing to code and have a lot of free time on your hands arma iii could actually be a lot of fun but for everyone else its probably best that you dont fork over 60 dollars for something it takes dozens of hours to fully comprehend

feels like i wasted my money game looks beautiful but it got too frustrating when it felt like everyone else was going on with the mission and combat and i was left looking around for the enemy outisde of waiting for some tracers to show up and give the enemy away my efforts to eliminate my target were futile 99% of the time id use up all my ammunition and theyd land in a perfect shot every single time it got to the point that i would end up sitting back while the ai on my team took care of it after all they knew exactly what to do while im just sitting there shrugging my shoulders this is not your typical combat fps the controle are wonky and i spent a hardearned $60 on frustration i have a titan video card it runs all of my games on maximum settings flawlessly with arma 3 it seems like all i do to ajust the graphics settings makes no difference as im hit with major framerate issues after a few days i reinstalled the game to give it another chance but i just couldnt get anything accomplished i personally dont recommend the game

the next generation arma awed reviewers with promising graphics and an intense single player campaign what seemed like a would be goty quickly has faded away as people slowly possibly dreadfully make the switch to arma 3 they will see it is a myriad of misfortune with very little solid content to speak of compared to its predecessor it has left people in want the game has been an overall disappointment for me with a lowered sense of viable large scale combat and very little aircraft to be talked of i was sorely disappointed at bohemia interactives next generation game in the arma series the only thing that has made it playable is the limitless community made mods to add things that the developers seemingly forgot from arma 2 this causes me to not recommend this game
not recommended
everything about this game improves on arma ii except for one key point the game simply does not run not on high end machines not on anything it is so poorly optimised and coded that no system can run it smoothly 60 fps online games lag all the way down to 1015 fps in cities just because the server code is poorly written and results in server side lag that effects frame rate as well as hit detection if this game was actually able to run at a decent frame rate that stayed decent online it would be a wonderful game until that time i cannot recommend this game

i decided to try arma 3 as everyone was recommending onlinei am going to start out with this game does need some work to be put in not worth to spend full price on this pick up when on a good sale other then that this game isnt for people who like fast paced action now performance issues i apperently run into with other complications firstly so i got 20 fps everything maxed to lowered it still some 20fps terrible port needs to be compressed properly controls are also clunky i would say the simulation at the start was 60fps but once it ended fps dropped drasticaly secondly i would recommend trying to run with a single gtx 980 & 970 or amd equevelent never crossfire or sli not responsible if fps will stay the same usually i get over 60fps maxed out in games but this one you probably should use a controler since its not k&m friendly lastly lets not forget the story you run to point a to b i know its supposed to be realistic but we customers need playable material this rant is to prove that servers have connection problems sometimes you get kicked from online most of the time i get messages saying arma 3 stopped working as i play through dont get this garbage unless this is below $10789 eu or $5395 eu please bohemia interactive fix this trash and make it playablepeople with 770s780sand 280sand 290s are really dissapointed that this game doesnt run well on their machines an utter dissapointment to people who dedicated their money on powerful pc hardware just to have 20 fps in summary not worth buying this game since it isnt demanding but more unoptimized unfinished product this is a spit on pc gamers and their rigs and before you say something to defend early access let me tell you something valve needs to work on testing this games before letting them be published on steam conclusion dont buy it not worth your time unless you like capped down ports then support the video game monkeys who make video games this bad and horrible final rating 5510 for walking simulator

i dont really know what to say about this game i perfectly understand that some people may like it but i know that i certainly didnt basically if youre not a hardcore military fanatic do not buy it the main problem i had with it was that i bought it thinking it was a more realistic battlefield with bigger maps and more accuracy concerning vehicles weapons weapon mechanics and that stuff and as you probably know because you arent me it isnt first of all the game mechanics themselves are in my opinion faulty and sluggish it doesnt feel like youre in control of your character whether youre controlling a vehicle or the character himself the ui is the worst i have ever seen in a game especially when it ocmes to looting one of your victims then the ai is completely buggedoverpowered in the singleplayer campaign which is ridiculously bad btw i was grenaded by enemies from 300m away the multiplayer is bad too because servers are very badly managed and end up with your spawns being so far from the war zone that you spend most of your alive time in a chopper to get to the warzone and then end up getting killed after 2 minutes on the ground by a camper in a building who knows the map better than you and trust me this gets very frustrating after a while it just becomes a cycle of death > long helicopter ride > death > long helicopter ride etc the only context i would recommend buying this game is if you have maybe a squad of a friends with the game and mics who will play with you in coup community made missions but thats pretty much it

i like shooter games and i always saw my brother playing them and they looked very fun when i was old enough i got call of duty and had a blast i kind of expected that kind of fun from this game but i was dissapointed even on beginner difficulty the soldiers take 30 minutes to kill and you take 2 shots to the foot and you are dead whereas you can shoot them in the chest five times and they ill crouch and order their whole squad to fire on you with their unrealistically impeckable accuracy if you like pulling out your hair and the feeling of overwhelming rage this is the game for you if not you are wasting your money

while arma 3 is a good game it is still has issues myself as well as a lot of other players have experienced multiple problems while playing one such problem would be when we are launching the game a message pops up saying handle is invalid dont risk your $60  $65 on a game that still has issues dissapointing edit there have been a few things that i wish to add to this review i think it was a poor decision on bis part to add dlcs that cost money with little content the zeus free dlcupdate hasnt done anything to the game multiplayer wise the karts dlc looks a bit fun but still needs more stuff the helicopter dlc only adds 2 choppers and a few new gameplay mechanics that should have been in a free update which costs $15 also like i have stated before my game often crashes on even at the lowest possible settings im overall dissapointed in this game and its just a huge waste of money that could be put to games that are actually enjoyable and not riddled with bugs and costly dlcs

i buy arma 3 on sale and after the weekend sale they bring out the helicopter dlc for $1599 ok i got bit but remember when things like helicopters in a game were part of the game not a here are 2 helicopter for $1599 dlc money grab i didnt know this was a pay for dlcs that really should already be part of the game i would not recommend this game to anyboy

arma 3 a lot of walking tactical etc fun but the ridiculously mind blowingly stupid ai is so stupid that u wont believe it do i also need to wipe their rear after they take a dump its stupid like hell when in danger they cant even run theyll just act smart even though theyre stupid as hell and walk tactically even though theyll be cut down in no time these stupid crap cant even take cover properly and stand in the middle of the street never mind about the cover they cant even follow the player properly bloody disgustingly stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid as it stands the ai are just virtual meat shields i have never completed a mission without all of the stupid ai dead and they deserve it for being so mindblowingly and disgustingly stupid i only wish that the body parts are detachable in arma 3 so that i can view their stupid dismembered corpses because theyre so bloody disgustingly stupid that make u go wtf all the time whenever the ai i lead dies i say yeah f u u deserve it i hope u burn in virtual hell and i hope it also hurts like hell leading the ai is worse than babysitting where the player being the babysitter has to resist the temptation of emptying the entire magazine into their stupid faces every single second of the game i hope somebody makes a mod to turn all the ai on the players side into clowns because that is exactly wat they are  now that i got that off my chest time for the actual review as the story goes the year is 2035 but the nato forces still wear the old school camouflage damn stupid decision not to give everyone pixelated uniforms also year 2035 wheres the talos suit wherere the high tech gadgetry that ud expect flir goggles nope everythings the same as the 80s or 90s except now u have rifles with different names thats all the explosives in the game are totally useless against infantry because theres no chance in hell ull kill the ai with it the splash damage is too small damage is too little and this is totally stupid because arma 3 claims to be a military simulator ive been to grenade ranges and let me say that the ballistic glass more than 100 metres away is full of marks from the fragmentation of the grenades wat do u think thatd do to weak flesh and bones according to arma nothing or nothing a simple first aid cant fix oh and lets not forget that every injury can be patched up and the character returned to normal function after some first aid ha and u call this a military simulator total nonsense this is also why i want to be able to blow limbs off in arma the injury system is stupid just like the ai well beside the cool factor of seeing somebody cut into half after getting hit or become a red smear on the floor after getting run over by a tank or have his arm hanging by the skin after getting hit etc u may say that im being graphic but let me just say that this is supposed to be a military simulator and therefore there is absolutely no need for any type of sanitisation if anything these are features that were overlooked by developers and needlessly accepted by the arma community anyway if u want to have fun play multiplayer but then therere concerns with cheating if u want future soldier combat stuff as ud expect in the year 2035 stay the hell away if u want to play single player only forget it itll only make your blood boil if u r into heavy breathing buy it now ull love it because the player character runs out of breath quickly

it doesnt work you have enormous lag on pcs with quadpcs the engine uses only 1 core _ so if you somehow still use a dualcore pc you can play this game if you have a really new quadcore processor you can play this game too that aside the game feels like its unfinished and just a money grab they didnt invest in a new engine that actually works you have no story and it totally depends on mods which still doesnt make it any good you are thrown on an island with a pistol and there are some vehicles on the island thats pretty much arma 3 in a nutshell

i have been a fan of tactical shooters for as long as i can remember my first one being the original rainbow six and all of its additions hidden and dangerous ghost recon and the game that spawned this one operation flashpoint as buggy and screwed up as that game was i was still able to eveintually play it not the case with this game there is no excuse for the graphical bugs and gameplay issues present in this game there has been ample time for this game to be optimized and yet it is still a mess i am able to play every graphic intensive game out there on my system yet this one is barely playable it seems some people have been able to get it to work but no luck here this is unfortunate as it looks like i would love this type of gameplay based on my history however looks like ill never find out since i cant even get it to run properly

for the small amount of time that i have played this game i have found it to be extremely boring and monotonous you might think that it would be fun with zombies or karts or other stuff but no its not if you want to play a moddable game might as well play garrys mod which is much much cheaper the game is full of bugs and the controls are all backwards half the time i find myself looking at settings when im actually trying to open a door overall this game sucks and i reccomend that everyone steer clear from it i also forgot to mention that it is poorly optimised 910 if you want realistic 010 if you want fun

dont get me wrong this game plays fine and is really really pretty so if you are after good graphics then this is your game it just didnt appeal to me because at the end of the day it is really boring this is coming from a guy who has played previous armas and operation flashpoint games and this one is by far the worst pick up arma 2 instead and install a graphics mod its cheaper and is more fun overall just my opinion btw so you may totally disagree if you have the game

a youtube adventure with multiple choices that are about a bunch of toy army men and indians would be a better military simulator than this this is very incomplete full of bugs and hackers tons of servers who have admins that dont do anything but ban people at the snap of a finger i would of rather preordered sims 4 honestly and i dont even like sims biggest waste of 60$ ive ever seen cannot believe more than even a thousand people bought this crap its just a reskinned arma 2 with way less content all hating aside now it does have good graphics but bad physics so youre literally paying for graphics

confusing  choose your rule set what 3 2 1 go what weird controls  vaulting changing weapons everything else no jumping or climbing strange hud  sub missions pop up on screen look at map nothing relates the two together nonintuituve  dragging and dropping items using vehicles flying helicopters reloading crouching etc all feels weird empty  even on a full 64 player seeing anyone was rare you can only find weapons in vehicles boring  combat feels stiff no indication of bullets hitting sounds arent great lots of lumpy hills and trees with no unique features that tell me where i am on the map joined a coop mission that consisted of riding on a boat for 20 mins to reach the start of the mission $60  i could have bought any other game on steam or 6 other cheap games other  i will probably put some more time into this game and try the player made missions but as of right now i dont like this game very much [

it would have been better if call of duty actually tried to simulate this game pros 1 informational i think arma might be informational shows you how to read a map though basic geography in school is approximately the same thing cons 1 too semirealistic while it might be interesting to learn about real combat it is not fun the gameplay is very similar to playing world war ii first person shooters i am unsure if they were trying to make a realistic shooter or an unfinished game the crosshair still exists for some reason which isnt realistic the run speed is at a maximum of 18kmh 5ms which isnt realistic in game fatigue is like an assumption of what real fatigue is like bots actually require 3 bullet hits to die they bounce backwards each time they get hit 2 too clunky movement keys are too clunky z for crouch x for high knee just press once for crouching two for high knee 3 weapons its horribly backwards as if the arma military was stuck in time
not recommended
the game really tries to recreat combat experience at a platoon level the interaction with team member is good however there are some problems with the game enemies usually takes 4 shots to take down there does not seem to be a difference between a head shot and a shot on the hand all the enemy ever does when shot is twisting a little its rather boring to pull a head shot and still have to land another 3 bullets on the enemy the shots do not penatrate grass or leaves very well there is an obvious bug where your aim is snapped to the nearest object when close behind that object for example when you stand behind a tree your aim will be snapped to the trunk the zoom with the scope is very fake you look into the scope yet you see everything in the peripheral also zoomed so on and so forth the game needs more work
not recommended
if you were the smart shopper that decided to read reviews before by this game congratulations you already outsmarted me i bought this game because i had imagined something relatively like battlefield or call of duty but on a much larger and more realistic scale well instead i got an overly realistic laggy impossible campaign game that breaks if you try to play 1 mod personally i would not recommend this game to anyone i found absolutely no enjoyment in this game ive played with some friends on a wasteland server and it was fun until it became minecraft faction servers in which case you build a base and wait for it to get raided while spending days trying to find someone elses base just to return and find that an xray modder has already taken it out if i was given the opportunity to get a refund for this game i would in a heart beat the campaign is impossible even on the easiest difficulty because 1 the guiding voice example world at war sniper mission with reznov when he tells you to wait for the bombers gives you the most basic and obscure directions and expects you to figure it out ie the mortar team in the forest finding the mine detector 2 the hostile ai will drop you in less than 3 shots and youll never know where they came from and just keep respawning at a check point and trying to find a way to get past them without dying 3 youre friendly ai can and will die in combat and the medic rarely heals anyone or tries to revive anyone multiplayer wasnt as bad as long as you were among friends a friend and i would play zeus a gamemode in which one player is able to do anything while the other players just play and wait for the zeus player to do something and mess around with vehicles the vehicles were probably the only thing about the game that i didnt hate except for the artillery there are no instructions or help tips or anything to help you fire the artillery vehicles there is no hit indicator as to whether the shell even made contact with the ground or hit four miles to the right of the target the aircraft are another thing i hated mostly because the were nearly impossible to fly if you tried landing a jet or a helicopter you were better of grabbing a parachute and hoping for the best because more than likely the aircraft was just going to explode on contact with the ground even going less the a half of a mile per hour so overall i would rate this game 210 just because not all of the vehicles and gamemodes sucked

right from the gitgo you are in a virtual reality which is basicly training you get familiar with the controls and play it a few good 3 or 5 mins then you get farther in the game and you realize the entire game is about driving around a basicly endless map that has a few houses and such pros and cons pros fun multiplayer shooter even eithout the multiplayer great level design cons really terrible graphics it haunts me to this day like those targets after the vitrtual reality looked like tan pieces of plastic the controls were so sencetive i couldnt go down a simple flight of stairs my overall rating 310 still better than cod though

do not buy this game untill developers fix this problem you will be sad a lot explaining the reason in following shortly demostration whom needs visual proof httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvdmdzwanxny for those whom just wants to read this games engine is not using your graphics card & cpu properly to give you a good gameplay even if you have 3000$ gaming rig the best you can get is 2040fps if i put every single graphics to very low or disabledshadow etc  i get 22 fps if i put everything to ultra settings including aa & renders guess how much i get   21fps   this game is veeeery badly optimized and engine is failing hard on hardware usage developers are not caring about the issue since arma 2 its same problem all around

sorry to say but this game is wasted potential at this point i hate to say it because you can see how much work they put into the maps and guns and im not a programmer but it seems like an amazing feat for a company this size also the i put 68 hours of gameplay exploring the content and online and trying to enjoy the game and it is very good sometimes mostly online so what issues does this game have well first the ai is still subpar better than arma 2 but still subpar many times my entire team has been wiped out by 12 guys because they happen to not be facing them and dont react the way they should or one squad mate goes to the other side of a wall and gets shot and no one comes to his aid i have managed to be successful but i have to control every single action of my team to prevent them from getting shot that it takes away any fun from being a squad leader the other problem was the graphics and ui of this game make it impossible to spot enemies i know that they are wearing camofluage but the jagged looking foliage and low contrast make it unrealistically difficult to spot who is firing at you i think that most of the people giving this game good ratings managed to find a good online server because that is the only time you get competent teammates and the game could definitly be good then but much like arma 2 most of my time online was spent waiting to get picked up or trying to find out where to go not the devs fault but it needs to be known for anyone thinking about getting this game if you have the patience to find good people to play online with than i could see the game being fun if you have the patience to do this and like simulators you could like it but the issues this game has killed it for me if they would just fix those 2 things i would recommend this game because they are major issues and would need to be overhauled completely

tldr game is gud dlcs are  unbalanced  i have been a fan of bohemia interactive after the whole arma 2 dayz mod craze i purchased and played arma 2 operation arrowhead and played the dayz mod and base arma 2 year or two later arma 3 came into beta for 2999 naturally i purchased it after how much i loved arma 2 it showed so much potential i fell in love with arma 3 the game came out of beta a year or two later not a whole lot added but the core mechanics were there april 1st 2014 the karts dlc came to be offered fun little karts for 499 still accessible with out paying that fee november 4th 2014 the helicopter dlc came out offered new helicopters which i was very excited about i did not have the dlc at the time but i was playing king of the hill and someone spawned in one the new helicopters i was really infactuated with it i went up to it to check it out and all i got was a little window telling me to purchase this dlc to have access to this content i was a little upset but understandable its dlc it is now april 11th 2015 the new marksmen dlc just came out and i played it for the first time in a while me and my buddy hopped on the new end game ctf game mode everything seemed fine headed out to secure the intel i hear a lot of distinct gun shots the new vss vintorez and the 338 lmg that i fail to remember i spot an enemy down the street from me near the objective i take cover and then peek him with my vermin 45 acp submachine gun i take 3 shots at him he is hit notices my position aims and shoots me once in the body and i am immediately dead annoyed i respawn and head back out to gather the objective intelligence the site has been cleared and me and three guys move in i round by a corner and see an enemy player crouched in a firing position i switch to fully automatic and spray my whole magazine into him i mean why not his player model visibly displays the damage done and yet the man still lives he turns to look at me with his large lmg chambering the new 338 caliber round and puts a round straight into my chest once again im put to the respawn screen yatatata shoot more dudes kill a guy miraculously ] and attempt to retrive his fire arm a little window pops up telling me to purchase the dlc to have access to this weapon at this point i was rather upset learning i cant use the new weapons without purchase of dlc the devs even stated the game was lacking something in terms of weapons so this was created so for something that should have been a free update kind of like the weapon resting and face paint etc i am quite livid these weapons completely change the dynamics of fire fights and weapons in general with these weapons chambering such large caliber rounds every kill requires 1 or two rounds to kill an enemy how is it fair that because someone paid 1599 they can decimate infantry as well as vehicles one of the new dlc lmgs that chambers 338 can destroy almost 3 stryders with one belt so thats really fair that people who bought the dlc have access to weapons capable of destroying the planet while im here with my  on my hand

the dlcs are disrespectful towards the players arma mostly deserves a very good reputation due to its fanbase and community modding content by adding content you have to pay for they are not only screwing with their loyal customers but spamming you with advertisement if you do not own the dlc for the vehicle  whatever you want to use its a shame because arma 3 is such a great game just like arma 2 but because of this i cannot recommend this game to anyone milking the cow is one thing but forcing you to drink out of its udder is udderly nauseating
not recommended
i really need to know how to get my money back
not recommended
sorry to say but this game is wasted potential at this point i hate to say it because you can see how much work they put into the maps and guns and im not a programmer but it seems like an amazing feat for a company this size also the i put 68 hours of gameplay exploring the content and online and trying to enjoy the game and it is very good sometimes mostly online so what issues does this game have well first the ai is still subpar better than arma 2 but still subpar many times my entire team has been wiped out by 12 guys because they happen to not be facing them and dont react the way they should or one squad mate goes to the other side of a wall and gets shot and no one comes to his aid i have managed to be successful but i have to control every single action of my team to prevent them from getting shot that it takes away any fun from being a squad leader the other problem was the graphics and ui of this game make it impossible to spot enemies i know that they are wearing camofluage but the jagged looking foliage and low contrast make it unrealistically difficult to spot who is firing at you i think that most of the people giving this game good ratings managed to find a good online server because that is the only time you get competent teammates and the game could definitly be good then but much like arma 2 most of my time online was spent waiting to get picked up or trying to find out where to go not the devs fault but it needs to be known for anyone thinking about getting this game if you have the patience to find good people to play online with than i could see the game being fun if you have the patience to do this and like simulators you could like it but the issues this game has killed it for me if they would just fix those 2 things i would recommend this game because they are major issues and would need to be overhauled completely
not recommended
bohemia interactive is doing to arma just what eadice does to battlefield content release after content release with no attention given at all to actually fixing the game but i guess thats the sad truth about gaming corporations today

dont buy that game  battleye will global ban you for nothing and you will be banned from all server for nothing and you will have to create another account to buy it with 60$ again  only if you throw money from the windows because its the same thing  its disgusting to do that  the game telling us to leave our account and buy the game 2 time  good job bohemia you introduce this  battleye to your game to ban all player of your game for no reason and win 2x of money for telling to player to buy it again and again 
not recommended
i personally think arma 3 is a terrible game and a waste of my money the campaign is dreadful and the multiplayer is worse you can never seem to get a game on multiplayer and when you do youre usally kicked from the server campaign you constantly die and the ai do nothing but also die so youre usaally on your own against an enitre army this game is not what i expected and no where near what i wanted i wasted 25 on this game

right from the gitgo you are in a virtual reality which is basicly training you get familiar with the controls and play it a few good 3 or 5 mins then you get farther in the game and you realize the entire game is about driving around a basicly endless map that has a few houses and such pros and cons pros fun multiplayer shooter even eithout the multiplayer great level design cons really terrible graphics it haunts me to this day like those targets after the vitrtual reality looked like tan pieces of plastic the controls were so sencetive i couldnt go down a simple flight of stairs my overall rating 310 still better than cod though

spent 60 dollars for this game played it alot played the alpha and beta to test the game then today got battle eye banned for no reason and cant play one of my favorite games ever it seems like bohemia interactive is so cheap they have to use battle eye a screwed up hacker security setup that bans people who do nothing i was on yesterday play altis life then today i get on to go play with a friend i get a ban message they are too cheap to use vac that actually works and doesnt ban people that do nothing it bans people that do hack and break the game i have also been banned on arma 2 oa and i sent a support message to battle eye and bohemia interactive and then i got a bot that messaged me back saying that i need to go to steam and i did i went to steam and i got a message from one of theyre support consultants an actual person not a freaking bot i commemerate steam for this and i scould bohemia interactive and battle eye i will be missing out on arma 3 life city life battle royale and many other fun game modes because i get banned for no reason by battle eye

campaign is cool until you have to control your ai team then it becomes kind of boring since the ai doesnt do quite what you asks of them and they end up dying pretty easily mods seems to be ok although if you are an arma 3 rookie its a little hard to play at first cool game but wouldnt recommend it if its not on sale though
not recommended
this game is very unrefined if you play the campaign use the endmission cheat because some of them bug and some of them are impossible not kidding some missions are fun i went online and tried some multiplayer just some dudes driving around in vehicles nothing fun there but i might try more later since i spent money on this game overall i dont recommend the game its clear that you need to modify the game with mods and scripts but the base game and campaing should be involving fun and consistent
not recommended
what a  pile
not recommended
ok so this review is quite short and you probably think its really stupid but anyways this game is amazing from the user created mods to the interesting missions and level editor i got this game about a year ago and instantly got hooked to the king of the hill mod my first day of playing it i got to about rank 12 and i loved every second the next day i started playing some more but when i logged on i was banned why no idea ws admin ban random numbers i dont care about i thought it was just that server so i tried joining another banned tried another banned until i realized i was banned from all servers this especially sucked because i had just baught the game and i was not hacking i have played flashpoint arma cold war arma 2 arma 2 oa and never cheatedhacked in those games due to this incident i can not recommend this game as i wasted my money and only bothered to do this review now because i watched a rhinocrunch video sniping 101 which was awesome and i hungered for arma but i never satisfied it
not recommended
well so far arma 3 has been an excellent game except for one problem i cant play anymore so i get on arma and go to play wasteland and then i find a server join it choose my role and then i get the loading screen for the server as i hear the arma 3 backround noises battleye justs ruins everything you have been kicked off the server client not responding i would like it if someone from bohema or battleye did something about it ive only played for three days and this happened i dont know how to fix it so i spent $40 on a piece of crap that wont let me play all i have to say is that battleye should be removed theres thousands of more servers to go play on let them hack how about you do the work instead of a client that doesnt work i love arma 3 but sadly this is what keeps me from playing it this was 92% of the games i play but ii cant play it because you guys wont fix it so far we have ive seen other ways to fix it but none have worked for me but instead of keeping players on by taking away some hackers as in the ones that dont know what there doing you taking away 13 of the population of arma and the sad thing is you know about this its been on your forums its been sent to you but you havent said anything i am just dissapointed that you made an excellent game that 13 of the people that bought it cant play i just hope you read this and realize that your game is going downhill  one less player

do not buy this game untill developers fix this problem you will be sad a lot explaining the reason in following shortly demostration whom needs visual proof httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvdmdzwanxny for those whom just wants to read this games engine is not using your graphics card & cpu properly to give you a good gameplay even if you have 3000$ gaming rig the best you can get is 2040fps if i put every single graphics to very low or disabledshadow etc  i get 22 fps if i put everything to ultra settings including aa & renders guess how much i get   21fps   this game is veeeery badly optimized and engine is failing hard on hardware usage developers are not caring about the issue since arma 2 its same problem all around

i constantly felt like i was cutting this game slack for the scope of its map but in the end the campaign is pretty awful way less interesting or even realistic than the original ofp which is a blast btw theyve done almost zero to make controlling your ai squad even remotely interesting or intuitive the gunfights feel very clunky performance is meh  graphics are poor by todays standard even on max settings multiplayer is often a lagfest heres a word about military realism  most sp missions have you go in either alone or with a squad ingress is mostly on foot so is egress there are zero radio options for backup or any kind of coordination i didnt even find an option to choose with position in a vehicle an ai should take so you are alone and you get wounded trying to take on an enemy base cant call for backup and good luck egressing on foot even at 4x speed while your character grunts like a pig in laborits certainly nothing approaching realismi was in the infantry this isnt how warfare even remotely works id say that arma2 sp was far better in this aspect with vehicles and a way to call a helicopter to pick you up and drop you offit felt way more intuitive overall no i would not recommend this game having a giant map doesnt excuse all the above mentioned issues also having a gigantic map and a 75 or 100 player limit is more of a frustration than a benefit id say if you want a good military game either play ofp or arma2 campaign both are rather good

tons of bugs the ai is horrible the enemy ai can shoot your  off from across the map commanding the ai is a  trained soldiers cant keep their weapon still after sprinting 5 meters c3po has smoother movement than the player i know this is a milsim but it doesnt play like a sim at all controls are confusing and there is too many of them and theyre spreads across the keyboard making me feel like i have to use both my hands on the keyboard it feels like im trying to fly a spaceship not make a human do simple everyday movement yes i know i can place my own keybinds but whats the point of making the controls stupid like this in the first place flying planes and choppers seems to be harder than it was in arma 2 im not sure if anything is changed or if its just been a long time since ive played arma 2 so im not gonna criticize that as far as tanks and other land vehicles go it has the same problem as controlling the soldier stiff and confusing and the instructions arent really helping if you like the feeling of actually having control of the charcter youre playing dont get this

after the very high paywall for the initial game they try and charge you 16 dollars just for a weapon pack of 7 guns which effectively doubles the amount of the vanilla weapons this game seems like a cashin like most triplea titles

arma is still clunky frustrating innaccurate garbage i like the scale bullet drop and the selection of weaponsvehicles thats it but interface and interaction is recycled junk the immersion is ruined by the inaccuracies of the game cant jump cant climb fences cant run more than 4 feet without dying of exhaustion etc cant effectively interact with your environment ai is the worst i have ever seen in any game since goldeneye for n64 engine is horribly inefficient and clunky i can run it at maximum settings with 60 fps no problem but it dose not look as good as it should for the load it puts on ones pc and it dose not even use all of my cpugpu to do it it is not a simulator it is a frustrating exercise in lazy coding and very poor interaction the inventory system is garbage and ruins immersion all they did was add new models and up the poly count compared to arma 2 they need a smoother feel of interaction in their games and no 3rd person view whats the point in making a game realistic when you can switch to this magical 3d camera and you spend a lot of time digging through menus rather than playing a game bf4 with more animationstimers for actions would be more realistic and a basic inventory system would smoke armas broken  if ea where ever to make a game world in the frostbyte engine that is that large arma is a slow clunky bore fest that kills any allure of a tactile feel with the hobbled game play and clunky unrealistic mechanics this game should only be played with a group of friends and wmods that fix some of this is the only way to go even still it is pretty bad that the modders and gaming community have to be relied apron to make the game better because obviously bohimian dont know how to innovate and the ridiculous aiming sway is beyond the most  and the most inaccurate thing i have ever seen because when i was 13 years old i could reliably hit targets out 150m out with iron sights on a 15 year old 308 and the characters in arma have a furious shootout @ 50100m without hitting  or the sway going crazy and this is with bleading edge tech in both their weapons and sighting systems and a soldier with years of training and experiance and i am no expert marksman dont believe me take a trip to the range it isnt that hard to prove me right here

i wish i could like this game i really do but after about three days of trying to get microsoft net frameworks to install for the game trying over 28 differnet solutions found on the internet and trying to get help on the phone from microsoft them selves i at last wiped my entire computer to factory settings finally was this my moment of truth was i gonna be able to play this game i was sadly wrong after udating windows and my drivers restarting my computer twice i downloaded steam and installed arma 3 took about a half hour total download and install including the first time start up finally i see the arma start up menu im excited at this point 3 days of constant strugle to get this one game working i click campaign and it asks me about the bootcamp tutorial thing i go yah why not ill do it to get used to controls it loads up to something that can be described as an open plane with cubes here and there with a blue soldier with camo gear on it says arma 3 bootcamp i sit there waiting for something to tell me what to do few minutes go by im getting bored of waiting so i start pressing every button trying to move look around some thing anything i found only ne button that did anything it was the esc button so after about 15 minutes of that non sense i decide to just jump inot the campaign hoping that it will teach me the ropes along the way i load up the game it tells me to walk about twenty feet to a heli and hop in so i do after what seems like a 5 minute heli ride we land and it tells me to go report in after figuring out i had to just walk up to one soldier and have him salute me i wonderd what i did wrong because when i walked up to him it said check point complete and that was it for about 8 minutes where i wonderd around went back to him pressed a bunch of buttons cause no one said anything no text popped up nothing finnaly after those 8 minutes it gave me three objectives right in a row get in a truck drive to outpostroad block and then drive some where else i got into the truck drove to the check pointroad block and i waited and i waited some more and more turned the truck off backed up pulled forward almost hit the guy turned of the truck waited said well maybe im supposed to jusat run the guy over and break through the barricade nope dont do that you fail and have to restart the whole objective over again from the heli after you all ready waited 20 minutes at the road block i tried again three more times i now have 5 hours on record and i have not even started the game yet im gonna give this game a 110 because of graphics only cause all i saw was a good looking game that i couldnt do anything in 110 probably gonna refund waiting simulator 2015

have to ammend my recommendation after making it almost enitrely through the campaign why almost and not completely this game has the most awful ai i have experienced in a long time its honestly at a point where the enemy ai are either expert snipers with any weapon at any range or are completely ignorant and stand in the open waiting to die realism is entirely gone from the firefighting which is ironic considering this is supposedly an ultrarealisitc war simulation the customized difficulty controls consist of two sliders precision and accuracy at 40 for example the ai will not let you win a firefight period at 30 they are so dumb they miss 80% of their shots and are basically waiting to die the only inbetween is 35 which is much closer to professional sniper even when using a 9mm pistol than normal guy who sometimes can hit you its pretty absurd frankly and almost comical when they market this as a simulation i wont even go into the friendly ai its so bad its become a joke and meme at this point there are dozens of modders who have tried to address the issue which is fine but the fact that the team ai is so bad after years of patches says a lot about the developers priorities i can no longer recommend this game unless you can tolerate your team standing straight up in the open running in circles firing recklessly into the air or missing every single shot without a single way to control them or help in the middle of a fight this sounds ridiculous but i was intentionally killing or letting my team die just so i could finish missions not sure how this game is so positively reviewed honestly its like they did everything right except the important parts cannot recommend

eh im gonna plug away and play this to the end someday but even if you buy it now and arent affected by the fact that the initial release contained maybe one fifth of the final content they slowly leaked out to users there are still so many issues with this game that its not really that fun to play yes its realistic i suppose if you dont count the fact that you can be shot in the face by a man with the vision of an eagle and the aim of a robot who is so far away or hidden behind bushes that you cant even see him but its not fun to play consider the mines in the forest of the second level that you cant detect and kill you forcing a checkpoint restart and a frustrating trialanderror progression through the area again and again consider the checkpoint about 5 minutes along from that one that is placed at the start of a 3 minute march followed by a battle that if you die during it makes you start back at the beginning of the eventless 3 minute march consider these issues exacerbated by the manual save system that only lets you save at certain times effectively dooming you to long endless stretches of replaying and replaying until you can slog through whatever ery they stick in front of you consider the poor optimisation that leaves the game chugging on a highend pc and still displaying all kinds of lowres textures anyway consider the frequent updates that corrupt your save files and render them unplayable consider the lack of a coop campaign  one of the few things that made the buggy mess of arma ii fun and literally the only reason i bought this game in the first place perhaps i should have done my research but then perhaps i had no idea what the total content of this game would contain when it bought it and was shocked to find it barebones until they released the last of it months after i purchased it in some ways its a vast improvement over its predecessor  it looks much better and the confusing and encyclopedic control system is explained much better the mission objectives are also a lot clearer and completing a given mission isnt as much of a pray that youre in the wrong place rather than that the game as bugged out scenario but i still i dont know what bohemia were attempting with this  so many design choices leave me tearing my hair out in frustration why on earth would it take them months after release to add a tutorial section to the game should that not have been one of the first pieces of content released however i suppose that most of my gripes regarding content have been resolved at this point so at least thats a plus for those considering whether to buy but all the odd little design quirks combine together to make playing this game a minefield in itself one wrong move and youre ed i do not recommend this game

this game is trash arma 2 with updated graphics and controls you cant run for more than 10 seconds at a time because everyone is overweight apparantly just ruins the game cant go anywhere quickly unless its in a vehicle awful was going to buy if it was like 10 bucks at christmas sale but not anymore this game blows just like arma 2 the only thing arma 2 had going for it is dayz mod and even that got old

first off i have to say i hate multiplayer games they are not fun for me in the slightest just a bunch of idiots modding to win so i never tried the multiplayer i got this for the singleplayer and i have to say it sucks its far too scripted i cant do any thing my way i have to stand here stand there listen to some idoit talk and curse for half a hour when he could just say it over the radio whilst i walk or drive so i am not so bored with the crappy dialogue but no its borring even when i actually got to shoot half a hour later the gun physics are so lame i laughed and shortley after quit and uninstalled it if you shoot a rifle at 50 metres square at a target the size of a torso the bullet will hit it but in this so called sim it wont most of the time guns just are not that unaccrate shotguns have spread not rifles a rifle at 50 metres will be 1 cm each way tops not 50 cm that alone is enough for me to quit and uninstall it and never play it again

terrible optimization controls plot and animations most of servers have white list so they will kick out as you join them when you find a good server all you play is a walking simulator and not a war game i am not a call of duty or battlefield fan but i think they are good games if you compare them to this also people pretend this war game is realistic no its not the only realistic thing is the boredom

arma 3 more like gayrma 3 because it frickin sucks azzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz okay lets begin this 1 the graphics are frickin terrible they look like they were made in a ps1 connected to a nes and atari 5200 they are very horrible and yet the game was made in 2013 what the frick my god couldnt they just use an engine that made call of duty advanced warfare the game would look stunning with the engine 2 the gameplay is bad like real bad there are no crosshairs hitmarkers and the recoil looks it was made by a drunken donkey because you cant shoot normally and your character looks fricken gay wielding the gun 3 the maps are big and empty also the props are repeated 2000 times making the maps look boring and not even new worst of all you find an enemy in 1 hour because the maps are so empty that you and your team cant find the frickin enemiess 4 story doesnt make sense and its only you joining the military thats it you play the bad campaign and realize that all you have to do is listen to your gay boss who will yell at you if you dont shoot at the frickin enemies the story is so bad that the ai is gay and unrealistic unlike call of duty so arma 3 is a very bad game and its very overpriced it would be better if the developers werent such monkeys and learned from call of duty they would be rich and grateful by many fans so i give arma 3 a 110 bad game

this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things this is the kind of line youll find in most positive reviews of arma 3 the thing is arma 3 fails miserably in every single front involving both the finer things and the basic things bi studio decided to use an ancient patchedup engine used since the times of the operation flashpoint youd think the bright side of this is they used the saved money and resources to put everything into solid focus on most important aspects of a military sandbox they claim theyve dished out long story short  they didnt arma 3 is not actually worth a comprehensive review so let me show you some of examples of how bad execution you can expect in every single corner of the game ironically the praised mods greatly expose arma 3 as a game that doesnt provide even a basic set of properly implemented essential features what the dayz developers achieved with the engine also show what kind of bad apple arma 3 is performance arma 3 has already become legendary of its poor optimisation within the gaming community the game has completely inadequate system requirements to what it presents even taking into account some little simulation unlike by the common opinion under the hood all of it topped with lack of proper use of multicore processors just one of the forum topics on the subject httpforumsbistudiocomshowthreadphp147533lowcpuutilizationamplowfps damage and wounding model i knew it wasnt perfect but what i saw and read left me in awe a military focused sandbox military simulation so youd think the model is at least solid right if so we could as well call return to castle wolfenstein a military sandbox fear 1 would be something arma 3 could only aspire to to put it simpler the model is nonfunctional you can shoot a man in a freakin finger few times and he will die you can put a bullet through the back of a knee of a man and he will only flinch helmets protect whole heads uniformly yup including the face bp vests protect the entire torso uniformly to put it into perspective some of the damage and wounding aspects of arma 3 are worse than those in the decade old operation flashpoint same developers see httpforumsbistudiocomshowthreadphp168548damagesystemsucksfixneeded&p2784549&viewfull1post2784549 ai not a trace of humanlike behavior in a close quarter engagement if you put bullets into ais arms it will only flinch slightly first second third  flich flinch flinch and the hell kill you with a perfect headshot without any delay ai also simply isnt bothered to survive ai under suppressive fire no problemo for ai see httpwwwarmaholiccompagephpid23969 sound youd think sound location spatialization would be important for developers of a military sandbox you pretensious brat arma doesnt use any sort of spatialization by now you should already know better you shouldnt expect positional audio of any sort hrtf binaural rapture3d71 surround is not positional audio the game doesnt even do the basic stereo panning on many sound samples sic its unplayable for me without dolbyheadphone enabled in the preferences of my asus xonar to top it off if you imagine a certain situation should involve 20 audio samples steps equipment 1 equipment 2 wind ambient birds door opening squad mate unholstering his pistol you can cross off about 10 of those to get a feeling of how rich the armas audio environment is erm so maybe the potential until there will be a copy of armas potential for sale id like to stick to evaluation of what i see even if i give it some slack it doesnt really make the picture more bright arma has been released a year ago fundamental aspects of it by all signs need rewrite or groundup implementation which isnt even on the horizon you plan on giving feedback and asking on the forums the only thing youll get is a slap in the face in a form of a shopping cart dlc women dlc real sea streams dlc or maybe latin america forces dlc

this game was just too slow for me some servers are meh at best the maps are so large and the server populations are so low its a very slow experience ive tried several of the game modes which does tend to make for a different play experience but for me i like combat atleast every 35 mins in a game versus runningdrivingflying across maps for 10 mins to get to the action

it was fun at first but it grew old quickly i purchased due to atlis life mod and quickly found the lack of players willing to comply with server rules made the game not so enjoyable the large maps are nice and all but too damn big for 100 or less people i enjoy the realist consideration of the game such as fatigue from sprinting and its effect on aiming overall arma 3 does not have a lasting effect on me some of the situations that occur are very fun and memorable but i often find myself logged in running around in circles doing nothing for large scale combat meaning hundreds of players at the same time in the same location on maps the size of arma 3 maps i would recommend planetside 2 which is a freetoplay game the simulation arma 3 offers is extremely impressive and quenches my thirst of rendering 360 noscope headshot noobs useless however as a game i dont enjoy it as much

this is my opinion on the game do not freak out this game is a military simulator so it is for certain people who enjoy this type of hardcore games im just going to say this game takes a long time to get used to and you will not get many kills im just going to say if you come from titles such as call of duty this game will be very confusing to you after playing it for about 2 hours i have to say it was very fun and i only got one kill the controls were very confusing every key on your keyboard is used i had a hard time even knowing how to get into a vehicle or such other then my opinion on the game this is a very good simulation of the military where not everything is about camos and skins this is the real deal and as realistic simulation is going to get if you come from arma 2 you will like this game as it offers much more do i like the engine no this is only reason why im giving it a no how are you supposed to play a game with such confusing controls and lack of knowledge given to you im just very confused when i get into the game buy arma 2 and see how you think about that game before buying this 60 dollar game

still horribly unoptimised a year now and it still runs badly random hardware configurations of less powerful systems sometimes outdo those of very powerful rigs most of the work done in game is done over 1 core therefore very high clock speeds will benefit over multicore low frequency setups according to bi but this is not necessarily true since some people find that the game is not properly utilising their cpus to the fullest extent i beat the recommended requirements but regardless of settings tweaks etc the most i can get is 40fps at 1080p ive waited patiently for over a year now and still this game runs very badly regardless of settings drivers os tried win 7 win 8win 81 sadly 40fps is a generous mark since when heavy action occurs the frame rate typically tumbles i have a core i52500k at 4ghz and a his radeon 7870 iceq x @ 11001250 unfortunately this game is pretty much unplayable for me and has been since i preordered it during the alpha stage apart from single player missions being added after release and some bug fixes here and there performance issues are still a big problem for many people unfortunately biased people with a love for arma will disregard this review and vote negatively they believe that because their performance is fine that this review is untrue and therefore deserves a thumbs down this doesnt take away the fact that the arma engine is incredibly inefficient and unoptimised and doesnt take away from the fact that in many reported cases weaker systems have better performance over beast rigs with very high clock speeds core numbers and multicard configurations again this isnt always the case but it has been reported on many occasions and highlights just how unoptimised and hit n miss the engine is the gameplay is good the performance is not buy it at your own risk do not childishly downvote this review just because you have a blind passion or appropriate setup for this game

the only way i can describe the inner workings of this game is to envision a car junkyard now imagine throwing a giant white sheet over that junkyard and painting nice colors on it thats what arma3 is just unnaceptable for a 2014 title i cant believe how poor this games engine and game mechanics are its just shocking to look back 16 years at games like delta force 2 in 1998 and think that this is actually worse there is so much erratic behavior as a result of poor engine mechanics it is not even possible to even pretend to try fixing them all after looking into it i discovered that this game uses the same exact base engine as operation flashpoint from back in 2002 the same engine that arma1 uses arma2 and now arma3 its like trying to reuse a 50yr old boat trailer meant for 13ft boats on a 100ft yacht its just lazy and unacceptable i even read a huge article about how the actual developers of the game confirmed that the engine does not utilize multiple cpu cores and why would it the engine is ancient and just heavily modified i know this is the part where you argue and toss out comments like ohh but you didnt type in the command parameter 8 threads or something shallow like that that does nothing if a game is not hard coded from the base engine to unload different tasks onto different cpu cores than it does not make any difference if the game can recognize multiple cpus or not arma2 had much better graphics in terms of realistic color pallette if you ever look at arma2 screenshots or dayz videos it actually looks real and there is so much in the way of woodstreesbushes and other vegetation in arma2 to the point where you genuinely feel like you are in the woods arma3s colors are unrealistic and just plain fruity arma2 was more acceptable as a 20089 product do you remember all of the different maps in arma2 do you remember the thousands of different structures in terms of housesouthousesfarmsindustrial machinery what does arma3 have it has one map stratis and the other map is no different so please dont tell me arma3 has two maps when it just recycles the same terrain from stratis

such a beautiful game excellent realism and tactical combat you truly feel immersed in a real war however arma 3 has major failings firstly it is poorly optimised runs on only a couple of threads meaning the newer your pc the slower the game will run the review pc was a piledriver 45ghz 8core amd with a 680gtx card ultra high settings the game had the same frame rate as low settings  averaging between 18  30fps which was jerky but playable until you got somewhere where a tank rolled in behind us and started shoooting then everyone there was down to 3fps people say there pc runs fine but half the people i know who play are barely able to move and shoot until arma 3 is fixed and written properly to support modern hardward you should not buy this game the developers have never managed to fix arma 2 i hold little hope they will fix arma 3

call me stupid close minded or awful at this game i read the reviews plenty of people said you either love it or hate it welp i tried joining 3 or 4 games it was buggy as all get out i clipped through random crap there was no meaningful tutorial the controls were confusing and the maps seemed huge once i managed to join i had no idea what i was doing most of the guides were either in cyrillic or were mentioning some game mode nothing outlining the basics im not usually one to say something is overcomplex and walk away but  this game is hard to enjoy ill take another crack at it im sure because i did just sink $40 in to this that i can never have back but id advise others to avoid purchasing even if you arent a filthy casual like myself because damn this game is stupidly obtuse

its an alright game not as good as the past installments but it does bring some new stuff to the table improved graphics  more stances and better running animations dont think that they should have set it further into the future just wrecks the immersive factor also contains loads of bugs and frame rate issues i would recommend buying arma 2 and arma 2 oa first before buying this becuase the modding community has not backed this game enough and as far as i know they have not added aceacre mod and a propper vietnam usung mod yet

this is just to recommend others like me this is in no way saying the game is horrible i understand its not a casual shooter but coming from battlefield to play this i know what people may say about my review of the game but holy  movement mechanics by far are too complex i typically expect to use only the minimum amount of keys to perform movements but what the  i am not going to count the plethera of those required to perform different movements but its some kind of high  number i played the campaign as far as i could take and halted completely when it came to flying the uav i took me about 10 tries until i gave up and shouted obsenities at my tv every time i tried i flew it into a rock a house myself and even into the ocean tldr i dont have the patience to play this nor the appetite to constantly learn how to bind keys if you are a casual shooter kind of person stay the  away from this trust me im pretty good at battlefield but just terrible at this two different games completely i guess thats what makes this game unique pros its pretty beautiful though

has alot of desync and makes you pay for extra addons that should be added to the game to begin with and they just rely on the community to finish their unfinished game the main problems with arma 2 was bad optimization and desync and after 4 years of making this new game they still have the same problems that they still decide not to fix i really dont recomend this game

whoever is over the aiming department to you sir i sayduhduhduhdownsyndrom you   i shoot alot in real life and thisthis is just patheticlike truly patheticthe skill it takes to hit someone running without a gun is just godlikein real life hitting fast targets really isnt no more difficult than one moving slow but yall act like it takes a navy seal to shoot a guni dont know if yall are part of the anti gun group that thinks you dont have control of your gun while aiming but you doeven a 5 year old does

after several months of trying to use this game i have had enough today the latest update removed all the mods in expansions with no guidance about how to reinstall them that made this half completed game playable despite its huge potential and possibilities bi have developed and sold a half completed game thats over complex unintuitive with poor single play functions gameplay and ai command & control editing and character  vehicle modifications despite excellent features virtual arsenal and editor they are not interconnected but isolated elements requiring complex and out of game processes to bring them together when was this acceptable for some reason its set in 2030 why and relies far to heavily on the modding community to make up for its fundamental weaknesses eg bipods for lmg and snipers rifles are an urgent requirement you can not use the weapons effectively or realistically but no bohemia interactive priorities go carts over critical game weakness to be addressed waiting 2 years to have this addressed in the dlc stream can i ask how i get my money back please

overall this game is not an enjoyable experience due to several key factors the foremost being the enemy ai which are unbearably difficult to fight a lot of the time it seems the game will put nerfed teammates with you againsed enemy ai that are impossible to fight againsed with the weapons and equipment provided the game will often put you in positions where you are on your own againsed impossible odds  not in the fun challenging way either more in the way that youre laying in a field by yourself being bombed while having to take down several enemies at long range with unsilenced weapons with no cover keep in mind that these ai spot you the second you fire a weapon and will 1shot you instantly the only reason you should purchase this game is for the mods and multiplayer this games optimization is absolutely terrible so unless you have a really bulked up gaming pc do not buy this

this software is beautiful absolutely but the game play is slow and frustrating making it a negative experience the ai is absurdly accurate too you can hide back as far as you want and it doesnt help you could have run so far that those enemies are tiny dots even through your scope hidden under a few bushes and trees a long ways away and they will still repeatedly headshot you then you can spend another eternity getting back to where you were in that mission a few minor bugs aside i found a couple bugs with the checkpoint system one example is in an early mission where you are swimming from a boat to attack a small village with a few scuba buddies but on several occassions that i restarted that mission the npcs would go completely braindead and do exactly nothing it is a gorgeous product i just wish there was a high quality game with it

not worth the price arma 3 is a quite enjoyable game but far from worth 40 bucks why 1 singleplayer campaign is lame and unexplained though i have to give the community a thumbs up for making some great scenario missions custom missions 2the game is poorly optimized when driving flying or anything where your character moves fast framerate drops to extremely low i mean like from 90100 fps to 2030 fps thats bad 3 the graphics on terrain vehicles and houses are just beautiful though the playermodels look like theyre from a ps2 game

disgusted i played all the armas and really enjoyed arma 2 that game hit the nail on the head it had everything sure it wasnt smooth and optimized but it was a real sim with the right mods it has everything life ace and survival gamemodes arma 3 is disapointing they added dlcs for that extra dollar which is really disapointing i want to buy a game and not worry about paying more to enjoy it sadly in 2014 every game just about has some sort of dlc or microtransaction it sucks another problem no one even plays this game for what it was intended for this is a military sim not a bloody battle royal on some random island or any other gamemode theres only like 5 empty servers that actually have proper coop missons and theyre usually empty i feel that all the arma 2 players like me are the only people to experience the true type of gamemode for this game connection issues a few people have it and this game sucks i lag so many times until i can properly join and play boehimia doesnt care either or they wouldve patched it optimzation i shouldnt even bother just blame the engine little kids yes this game has been advertised to little kids way to much on sites like youtube its gotten to a point where life servers are full of wingy little  who dont even know how to rp and follow the rules of the server yet waste admins time they dont get banned either because most of the time theyll donate for a high postion on the server arma 3 is never gonna be the same until something changes drastically its alright but no where near as good as arma 2 was 610
