this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

space ninjas i shouldnt have to say anything more fair warning if youre not willing to spend a long time playing this game youll find your options kind of limited you start with 2 character slots 6 weapon slots and 50 plat 20 plat can get you a character slot and 12 plat can get you 2 weapon slots youll pretty much want to spend this 50 plat on slots as everything else is a waste getting more plat costs money and i highly recommend that if you want to spend some money on plat log into the game every day and wait for the 75% discount to show up with the discount a one time purchase of about 1000 plat should set you up for life if all you buy is slots and you dont care about having all the weapons if you want to collect all the weapons youll probably want to spend $50 and go for the 3000 plat option the mod grind collecting thingies to improve your stats and the stats of your weapons can take a stinking long time to work through but if you can have fun doing it after all it just means playing the game a lot youll be rewarded with weapons that feel like they do more than tickle the enemies you fire them at good mods and good weapons are required if you want to be more than a leech on the later planets but everyones usually blasting through the missions so fast that they hardly notice if you lag behind and die horribly to the handful of enemies they overlooked id say the biggest problem this game has is a lack of reasons for veterans to return to old content it can be really difficult to get a group for that one mission you need to unlock the other mission you need to unlock the mission that unlocks the next planet you want to get to to work your way towards that boss that drops the parts you need to make the warframe class you wanted a week ago and still havent reached playing with friends is recommended

warframe in its simplest parts is a amalgamation of mass effect 3 shooting old school diablo looting  hoarding free running  parkour and freaking space ninjas did i say space ninjas its really really fun living out your childhood dreams of dropkicking baddies in the face while throwing stars at a secondary target if you ever wanted to be bruce lee this is your game it has boss fights with actual strategies plenty of unlocks to find lots of socializing for those that want to chit chat as much as kick things in the derriere the new weapon damage system gives hardcore mathematicians something to theory craft about but is as easy as paper rock scissors in its simplest form weapon choice is varied in feel thus you many choices to find the perfect weapons that suit your playstyle alternative playstyles such as stealth plays a prominent role in warframe you can absolutely wreck targets from the shadows you can choose between support frames offensive frames and defensive frames for a mission invite your buddies or grab some guys  gals from the recruiting social channel if you want to meet new people join a completely randomized group of 4 players hell bent on conquering space you have multiple saved loadout slots for free digital extremes doesnt really nickle and dime you in this game like other f2p games they do need to make a profit so they sell cosmetic items xp boosters warframe slots weapon slots and materials for those too busy to go fight nearly everything in the game can be acquired by doing fun events that last nearly a week so you can choose when to partake of them they give away the best guns for free during those events they have a xp system that also nets you some of the best guns in the game for just running missions to collect loot and crafting that loot into weapons and warframes leveling up those frames and weapons gives you the xp necessary to unlock the sickest weapons this is a play to win game where you can buy materials to craft if you are impatient but you can just play more and get it isnt playing the game the purpose of it of course you can buy completed warframes for real money but spending a couple hours of your time you can get the same thing for free of course you still need to buy the inventory slot for that frame to use it at less than $1 a slot no subscription fee and no initial game purchase this sounds like the steal of the century and you dont have to buy them and still have fun but its nice to be able to support the developer for their time and effort in short play this now

there is only one thing you need to know about warframe its free oh maybe i didnt make myself clear enough when i say that warframe is free i mean literally speaking it is free still not clear enough alright ill elaborate apart from two different types of items  appearance items such as skins and coloring pallets and weaponwarframe slots  it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone in this manner it is possible for you to obtain every warframes characters or so to speak every weapons every nonvisualbased items and the likes of course there are conditions to fulfill and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time isnt this what you are looking for but the point is it is perfectly possible to play warframe in the long run without paying a single cent its your choice so what is warframe in this game you are basically a character known as tenno who fights battles within a futuristic solar system you will be teaming up with 3 other tennos this is a 4 player coop game to complete missions laid out by lotus a female commander issuing you orders nah she is nicer than your exgirlfriend so dont worry about that you will basically be facing three separate forces grineer corpus and the infestation think of the three races in starcraft if you want to get a better idea there are different types of missions ranging from elimination rescue spy to defense and rescue as for weapons basically you get to equip a primary weapon rifle shotgun sniper and many others that are hard to categorize a secondary weapon categorization is hard for this as well and a melee weapon sword mace fist you know the deal as for your character you will be using one out of the somewhat 10ish slightly less than 20 though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by warframes each warframe comes with different stats such as selfrepairing shields like those in halo health energy mana and speed still more importantly each warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills these skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy one thing to note is that gender is preset so those transsexuals dont have to fake their gender anymore which is well  you decide if its good or not there are also mods modifications that you can insert into your weapons and warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are oh and there are parkour learn how to press wasd  lshift  lctrl  space in fluid coordination it will be helpful and painful but you will definitely need them simple unlike many coop shooters warframe definitely has its merits one of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most mmos you can level up both your weapons and warframes to a maximum rank of 30 moreover you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful in this way warframe wont be a simple runshootkill seescore gosleep type of game never there are things more important than that another merit of warframe is that there are frequent updates when i say frequent i mean frequent as in one big update per month or so there will be new game modes warframes weapons mods  etc i mean come on who thinks that l4d2 came too fast after l4d1 is released i do who is still waiting for l4d3 after all these years i am who thinks that gabe newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of valve games i do come on we have been waiting for l4d3 and portal 3 and hl3 and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting this wont happen for warframe though the game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating you get new contents every now and then and they usually blends well with the game usually still like most games there are pros and cons of warframe and i have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games one major shortcoming i wont say flaw of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line apart from some trivial storytelling there really arent much of a tale going on there are stories told im not saying there arent but they are rather weak i know that is not their aim and that is not really the point of warframe but compared to the rich though monotonous storyline of l4d and portal warframe needs to good a better job here also the game can be rather repetitive you know this applies for most coop shooters so there really isnt much to say about this yeah repetitive so in general try warframe its free if you dont like it drop it simple as that if you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run like how i felt after my first 100th hours do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and warframe slots i bought like 1990 usd worth of platinums not much but it is the spirit that counts right

[06212015] edit made some changes and fixed some grammatical errors so i playing this game nearly more than 2 years and i want to write this this game have great graphics  but with only graphics you cant make a good game so this game have a great choice of weapons  but 70% of them feels the same and more than half of them are not very useful with highlevel enemies and this game have a lot of enemies  but all of them feels the same and doing the same tactics nearly only things that change with them are weapon models and protection types flesh cloned flesh robotic or ferrite armor etc all enemies dies the same in your daily slaughter edit but they adding new miniboss type enemies such as grineer manics corpus bursa and infested juggernaut diversity of tilesets  and they all beatiful and atmospheric but it doesnt really profitable to play on 60% of tilesets because some of them dark sectors have bigger resource chance and more xp and orokin void which have prime parts and more xp for example are more profitable archwing  its nice to fly in open space and shot\melee every enemy who flies near you but right now its just barebones nothing more interesting in it than few extermination sabotages and interception missions and all of the archwing and their specific weapons are locked behind a grind kubrow  you can got and rise your own doglike loyal companion but they are just running everywhere and dying and then they losts their loyality which you can refill only by 30% per day they losts it like 20% per their dead and their health drops about 10% per day you need to buy refills dna stabilizers 6 things per 75000 credits which refill only 40% per use and to find a egg you need to spend about 2200 runs depends of random and your luck to get one so in point of view they are just creditsink and any normal sentinel can replace every type of doge and sentinels dont require credits to take care of them and dont lose loyalty after death this game have great variety of warframes and their awesome abilities and most of them have many differences in abilities and different stats and cool looks this game have a nice amount of bosses one boss per planet but most of them are bulletspongy and boring for example you need to wait until they become vulnerable or you need to shot into specific hitpoint to kill them example councilor vay hek general sargas ruk lephantis or mutalist alad v and some of them closed behind grind for keys to get frame which drops from them  vay hekhydroid no longer needs a key lephantisnekros mutalist alad vmesa in this game you can get every weapon\frame without paying platinum ingame currency you need to buy with reallife money but still you can get it through ingame trade with people but you need to grind for them blueprint costs credits ingame currency you get through doing missions some blueprints requires research from clan dojo s laboratories which requires credits and resources too and blueprints requires resources and credits to craft them resources you can get through missions from killing enemies cool variety of mods for warframes and weapons which drops from enemies and you can make you weapon\frame more powerfull with them but some mods are rare and some mods drops from rare enemies and some mods are very very close to be useless intruder 6 seconds for hacking maxed rifle aptitude 15% status chance maxed but even so this game is very good and i had a good fun with it im recommending it try to play it with friends and kill things together developers support this game with weekly updates and hotfixes in which they fixing bugs glitches and adding some new changes or items 9510 this game still grows and becomes more interesting with time i hope on this games release developers will get rid of all disadvantages in it honestly this is best f2p game on steam dont count valves tf2 and dota 2 in my opinion

youre looking at a player who has logged in a beefy amount of hours after playing some hours i am sure that you will be hoofed on into this game as well so let me write this review to mootivate you to start playing pros  beautiful graphics  active gameplay  endless content  a broad range of customization  over 100 ways to kill something  f2p cons  a lot of farming and repetition  very limited for a low rank player the only major downside to this game is the farming and repetition unless you dont mind doing so overall this is a great game to satisfy your inner space ninja needs

intro warframe is a fastpaced third person shooter the developer digital extremes is the studio behind the darkness 2 and dark sector digital extremes gets involved with the community by providing regular patches video updates and participation in the forums digital extremes borrows heavily from their previous game dark sector that was developed in 2008 and scrapped on 2012 in favor of making warframe summary great atmosphereenvironments great weaponskillscharacter selection great clan system dojo is impressive great developer supportupdates are good chunks and come often great movement opportunitiesrunning across wall is fun grindblueprintsmaterials gameplay the gameplay is pretty solid if you are looking something flashy like devil may cry you are not going to get it here that being said the variation of weapons really make up for this the warframes themselves are great in terms of variety and design each one has stats and abilities that set them apart which results in a fresh experience every time you play with a new warframe being able to run along walls or run up them makes mobility in the game more dynamic in terms of getting from point a to point b rank system rank system emphasis on developing experience with warframes weapons and equipment rather than getting exp in general your rank is a signature of how much firepower you have accumulated in your arsenal since rank challenges vary it will test a wide array of your skills from marksmanship mobility and combat abilities this system results in the player being more well rounded by fleshing out your skills in a multitude of areas customization upgrading transmuting and fusion are several methods to improve your options the level of equipment acts as points for attaching mods this allows for multiple combinations of mods to get different desired advantages to fight certain factions or missions the forma is also a great way to make a weapon use less points in certain slots allowing you to develop it even further atmosphere the setting is great and in my opinion helped attract alot of people to this game the atmosphere and level designs are becoming more varied as the developers are updating the game with new environments the new environments are really fun to play in and sometimes have their own perks updates as someone who made a long guide for this game i can say that their updates are so solid i feel my guide gets outdated every month and requires me to go back and make it relevant this is most apparent in their ui changes they have made which made my videos abit weird to see for the newer players clan the dojo is one of the nicest additions i have seen yet not only does it offer a nice place for members to go to but in a sense its structure is an achievement of everyone who has helped contribute to it the dojo offers a wide variety of nice side things like being able to do pvp and being able to craft new weapons that are only available through research pay to win if you are worried about this game being pay to win rest assured thats not how it is the only real benefit to paying besides cosmetics is being able to get slots you can put time in and get the same results you just cant have many warframesweapons at once they also designed it in a way that is hybrid in some areas for example in foundry you will be able to pay money to speed up the process so instead of buying the weapon you can collect the resources craft the item in foundry and then pay to speed up the process so you dont have to wait grinding yes there is grinding when you are looking for specific warframes and materials generally you will grind in the places where you reap the most benefits and try to get the payoff aka the warframe as soon as possible the grinding got a bit worse in a way when they introduced more materials which made the chances lower of getting blueprints this is setoff a bit by the fact that they introduced alot more environment maps which increase its replayability so if you do not mind grinding buy slots to make more warframes if you like the game enough conclusion overall warframe is a classic example of how free to play games can be great and interesting and still give developers plenty of profits without turning it into a pay to win game if you are looking for an interesting game just give it a try i am sure it wont disappoint

there was a big bunch of bugs back in 2013 but most of them have been fixed by now so warframe is overall a good game for a f2p  with enjoyable combats awesome graphics and all those weapons and frames that you could get  its true that warframes coop missions are repetitive but it is still an impressive title with those awesome devs this game is totally worth a try

warframe is the best free online game out there warframe is 100% free you will always have access to all of the games content except cosmetics without needing to pay any money if you want cosmetics you have the option of spending money on platinum the game currency or you can just trade other players for platnium ive played over 3000 hours without spending any money because i just sold items to other players for platinum and then used that platinum to buy cosmetics you control a warframe there are over 20 warframes to choose from and they all have unique themes fire berserker stealth etc and special powers fireball warcry smokescreen etc there are hundreds of weapons to choose from rifles snipers shotguns launchers pistols swords axes etc and every method of killing is perfectly viable i have the most fun when i use all the tools available to me for example ill use my fire warframe to burn five enemies then ill use my shotgun to shoot another six and finally ill use my sword cut up the rest warframe is a coop game but its still fun if you want to solo there is also pvp but its not balanced and not the focus of this game warframe updates pretty frequently so there is always something new and interesting to do warframe has good graphics but doesnt require too much from your computer if you have any questions about warframe feel free to add me

i started writing a review for why after a year of playing the game i changed my review for it from recommended to not recommended and it ended up being far longer than is a reasonable length for a review it is not the proper forum for me to write four pages as to what happened to the game and why i cant suggest playing it anymore if you want to read more on it i suggest going to the actual forums for the game not through steam but through the official website the players there are very active in posting and there will be a lot of threads going in detail about the faults of the game and talking about how des actions have never been further out of sync from what players want from the game and from the direction they were once taking it instead of writing four pages ill summarize it into something short and concise again if you want more specifics feel free to go look into them but ill summarize as i have logged more than enough hours into the game to be very familiar with it and what has happened what it really boils down to is this the company is using grind walls and severely crowded rng tables to deliver content which is one of the least creative and worst examples of game design i have ever played it wasnt originally going to be that way but that is what it has become now and considering it is supposed to be an action game and not an mmorpg the grind really kills the feel of the game you are much less of a space ninja saving the solar system and more of a mindless drone collecting resources for new weapons all for literally no reason at all due to the lack of story in my 20 years of gaming experience i have never seen a company so unwilling to work with what their player base wanted and just outright ignore them the community is incredibly vocal with ways to make the game more enjoyable for the players and keep them interested and avoid just getting burned out on the game and patch after patch they go ignored from the past year of expereince with this game the current state is that it is a fantastic concept being delivered in one of the worst ways imaginable by an inadequate design and balance team

warframe is kind of like mass effect 3s multiplayer but better in many ways it has a power system similar to me3s power system but it has a variety of missions instead of only a deffencehorde mode it has some really cool weapons and it has bows these bows are what sold me when i first started i saw a bow in the store and spent $10 to buy the thing faster than put flash joke here its not a pvp game some of the warframes like rhino are really op in pvp but overall its a good time especially with friends i should note that you can buy almost anything in the game via plat this does lead to a pay 2 win kind of game you can get almost anything in the game via plat  trading but you can get everything in the game without paying anything a lot of the weapons in the store are around 275 plat which is really overpriced and warframes will run from 75375 which is a little better because of the pain it is to build them i must stress here that warframe is the most fun when you are just playing and not grinding for something yes grinding is something that you have to do in order to get anyware in warframe but at least for me this does not ruin the overall experience

so ive been playing warframe for around 2 years now and i have to say ive had fun it wouldnt be fair to review this game with a negative bias like the one i have so im presenting facts as objectively as i can here in as fair of an environment as i can warframe is a scifi thirdperson action game that plays more like a firstperson shooter on steroids it essentially feels like a crossover between older fast paced games like quake and unreal tournament with properties akin to that of a more modern shooter that being said i cant call into question the fun other people have playing this game so i cant consider that a worthwhile approach to determining whether or not the game is worth paying any money into or not but i can say its fair to judge other factors for example this game is based heavily around modding the use of items to upgrade weapons appropriately and crafting the use of materials picked up from fallen enemies  broken containers or enemy storage lockers to build things like weapons and characters to use it takes a very long time to gather these materials and because of this it has been referred to as farming when a player repeatedly runs the same mission or runs a mission for a very long time in order to gain more of a material out of it now heres where my reasoning comes in as to why i dont like this game as much as i could it takes too long i am someone who has a lot more free time on my hands than the average gamer so i havent had to buy much in this game using the ingame currency platinum  which is purchased with real world money  now thats fine having microtransactions to skip the time consuming part of a game is okay because you can still have the option of acquiring it yourself over a longer period of time with simple hard work whats not okay is something warframe players refer to as rngesus the random number generator whats also not okay is the extensive nature of farming a significant portion of content in this game is hidden behind a grindwall or rather an extensive task or list of tasks that must be performed before you can access certain parts of the game this is not as bad as dlc and it isnt as bad as microtransactions in some other games but it can be fairly irksome at times all in all this game is fair about how it treats many things especially how it treats microtransactions  in the fact that a huge number of things can very easily be acquired with time and effort  except for one problem pricing it effectively costs around $10 to get a typical weapon and $15 or so for some of the more expensive ones this is a problem that is very hard to argue against or in favour of because of an even larger problem the value of time calling into question the fairness of the pricing of microtransactions in this game is difficult because you call into question the value a player has of their time is it worth spending $10 to get a weapon now or is it worth spending a day to collect the credits and resources to buy it then wait an additional 12 hours for it to craft is it worth spending $15 to get a warframe  playable character  immediately plus bonuses or is it worth it to spend several hours acquiring the parts and the credits and resources then waiting approximately 45 days on average for it to build the problem here in my eyes is that it is not worth it typically because in the time it takes to acquire these things i could have done much more in other games or even worse for $15 i couldve bought an entire other game now we move on from pricing and platinum  microtransaction issues to another thing that irks me balancing i admit that warframe is technically still in beta and that many things still do need to be complete but this does not feel like a beta game any longer there is a huge quantity of content in this game which i would easily value as being worth well over $40  generous for a game that has no form of very specific story or singleplayer campaign  no straight up form of sandbox as well as being restricted to missions that are run from your liset which is essentially your main menu of sorts  the audio quality is impressive and the visuals are even moreso the animations for melee weapons are both practical for gameplay and impressive to actually look at though the game begins to disappoint when it comes to the secondaries and primaries which all share one unified means of holding primaries and holding secondaries where you hold all primaries as a rifle and you hold all secondaries as a pistol there are unified reloading animations for some weapons although thankfully it also seems many weapons have their own unique reloading animations and firing animations in some cases bow weapons all share the same animations and no one single bow weapon has its own animations unfortunately thus far countless assets are recycled in this game although this has no significant effect on gameplay so i wont consider that something to tally against recycled assets in this case being many enemies who share the same model with different colours for example an enemy known as the nullifier makes abilities useless  abilities in this game are essentially akin to spellcasting from other games where you can throw fireballs set up shields etc many things really  i personally dislike nullifiers simply because they detract from an environment where the use of abilities is one of the main things that makes the game stand out from similar shooter games many enemies in this game rely on actions that knock you down  rendering you unable to fight back by any means  using attacks that in some cases are completely unavoidable thankfully unavoidable knockdowns are rare although the true problem is not the knockdown itself but the fact that knockdowns have no counterplay  once youre on the ground youre unable to do anything to make your character get up faster  unable to defend yourself even if only rolling out of the way of incoming fire  this game has plenty of cover but no cover system to make greater use of it thereby unfortunately making no use of an otherwise potentially unique addition to an otherwise straightforward gameplay system the enemies are fairly intelligent and make use of cover to the point of it even being annoying in strange ways at times for example enemies will frequently change course repeatedly  running back and forth or even running in circles  because they are trying to move towards two different sources of cover simultaneously ai bugs aside the ai is intelligent and fun to fight against there are countless weapons to use but another unfortunate thing is that with how the game treats enemy scaling the most useful weapon always ends up being the one that cranks out the most damage generally speaking you will always perform better with a weapon that does much more damage than another weapon that operates in a more unique fashion  for example the flamethrower weapon does so little damage and has so little effect on enemies that its generally just a better idea to use a heavy machine gun or rifle that does vastly superior damage overall  artificial difficulty is a topic commonly talked about in warframe with the most common subjects being the repeated nerfs and buffs being done to characters who typically arent deserving of the treatment they get another topic tends to be the way in which difficulty is improved or upped as the game gets into higher levels with enemies becoming textbook bullet sponge enemies and increasingly cheap tactics such as unnecessarily frequent knockdowns or locking the players movement and so on all in all i cant really recommend this game to people who either lack free time or are at all prone to being frustrated by what can be described as an unfairly balanced environment

similar in some ways to the multiplayer experience seen in mass effect 3 warframe wastes no time in telling stories particularly elaborate the background narrative in fact will give us an excuse to put ourselves in the shoes of ninja called to fight a futuristic alien faction home menu you can choose between different worlds to visit where we await missions to complete possibly in the company of three other players challenge between intergalactic ninja the objectives vary enough but the main flaw of the title digital extremes is out soon given the limited variety of levels you will be prompted to save the hostages locate a reactor to destroy or find an object but whatever the delivery in warframe youll almost always eliminate waves of enemies chasing the various waypoint marked on the map the gameplay fortunately fairly obvious problems of repetition of the title with the view placed behind our tenno the name of the metal ninja who impersonate we will have firearms and trusts katana come into play the warframe champions representing the different possible configurations of the armor these identify the different classes of ninja with unique features useful to customize the game experience challenge between intergalactic ninja initially there are three while the other can be purchased with real money or get through the crafting system included in the title the warframe not only change the appearance of your character but activate specific skill such as enabling stealth attacks rather than providing armor thicker than usual and so on the user then accesses to further customizations to buy with credits earned in each mission completed successfully these enhance the efficiency of its warframe but not only there are in fact many consumable items to carry around for the later missions useful to address the weaknesses of its configuration and style of play

warframe is an impressive work of a game you might think just by looking at its store page with the free to play tag and the dlc packs underneath that its pay to win that is not the case not even a little bit you can obtain everything noncosmetic in the game without paying a dime you can even trade rare items for the ingame currency platinum so you really can get everything without paying you start off with little taking a weapon of choice for a primary secondary and a melee weapon as well as one of three warframes your warframe has certain abilities that set it aside from others as you master your weapons and warframe the lotus takes notice and allows you to test your abilities and rank up after youve ranked up you now have access to better weaponry to take on bigger things the mission variety is good the amount of weapons can be overwhelming but theres always something to do give this game a shot de is an excellent company they do livestreams every other fridaycould be mistaken on schedule and talk about whats going on what theyre working on and what they want to do they listen to feedback from everywhere steam forumsugh their own forums or even reddit they are not a greedy company give the game a try its pretty fun

speaking as a player from the steam release in 2013 wasted potential the game horrible weapon and frame balancing devs seem to outright refuse to fix fundemental issues with the game and are just content with piling more shiny things onto the garbage heap endgame can be hit within the first 510 hours of play its just grind and scamming other players in tradechat game is incapable of being difficult without also being tedious at the same time meat sponges instagibcapable foes forcing gear limitations stat restrictions etc in part due to the satisfying but ultimately imbalanced movement system and fundementally broken mod system mod system relegates player progression to the mercy of rngs whims mod drop tables are oversaturated with useless things like 75% radiation resistance that absolutely nobody runs if anybody tells you that they run those mods theyre simply horrible players or their mod count is lower than the number of combined digits across their fingers and toes stances advertised as a longawaited fix to the horrible melee system were a disappointment and also relegated to the drop tables futher saturating them no variety in builds if you want to grind efficiently stack damage mods on guns slip in crit mods if the base chance is 20% or more put every power mod that would be suitable on your frame then fill the rest with durability mods melee has been awful forever and only serves as a mobility tool enemies are either inconsequential glass figures or spicy meatsponges due to the messed up scaling bought upon by the mod system dont ever buy platinum paid currency unless you get a 50% off coupon or better as a daily login reward its horrible value for money otherwise for the love of god do not buy the starter packs on steam at their base price they are a huge ripoff only reason i bought the tenno pack last year is because it was like 75% off during winter sales and became excellent valueformoney weapons and warframes in the market are hideously overpriced considering youll need to go through tens of weapons and warframes to rankup pvp is an absolute joke you know how in most rpgs you deal a lot of damage compared to enemies but also have a lot less hp compared to them its like turning party members in those games against eachother you just run about instagibbinggetting instagibbed and finding ways to cheese the system enemy variety is poor with the only real distinctions being the differences between heavy troops and regular ones the former of which is the only thing you should really consider when modding weapons as theyre far far more resilient than regular enemies theres no pay2win only pay2notgrind warframe utilizes a timebased gating system like those commonly found in mobile games you kill enemies in missions theyll drop materials youll buy the blueprint from the marketplace and then youll craft the item weapons take a minimum of 12 hours to craft clantech takes 24 hours plus the time spent crafting the prerequiste materal this can make the cumulative time of some clantech to be over 96 hours if youre deadon with your timing in moving through each stage although there are many missions available which offer those special materials as rewards massively reducing the total clantech crafting time warframes take a minimum of 84 hours to craft get the helmet system and chassis blueprints as random boss drops they take 12 hours each but can be crafted simeltaneously then combine them into the main warframe blueprint from the market which takes 72 hours to craft to be honest i dont have an issue with the timegating system as it isnt coupled with pay2win stuff like most timegate systems are although some might which is why ive explained it here the good things about the game it looks very nice although the atmosphere is nonexistent as opposed to how it was years ago go search for early2013late2012 footge and compare it with 2014 footage movement system is fun but is almost impossible to balance around without introducing tedium gunplay is okay i guess devs dont do rollbacks whenever exploits pop up and are fixed if youre fast you can capitalize only real reason im still onandoff with this game is plainly put some form of addiciton although i did quit coldturkey for about 8 months earlier this year out of plain disgust with their implementation of the stances system at the time of writing this it seems im phasing out again whether or not ill come back i dont know although im looking at this from the perspective of a longtime player so if youre new then you probably havent become disillusioned with the game quite yet and will enjoy the bit that you play its like a worse version of mass effect 3s multiplayer also warbros 1

warframe is a fast paced rpg hack and slash and third person shooter mix that blend concepts from popular games like halo assassins creed and call of duty into one jam packed freetoplay online game this game supports nearly every play style and there is no one way to play unlike other games with four or five classes this game includes 20 unique armors with unique skills to aid in your fight and with new ones added frequently also unlike most other freetoplay games it is not paytowin granted you can only go so far in the game without the special currency which you have to use to get extra slots to store your armor and weapons but thats is one of the best parts of this game you dont have to spend a penny to get this currency you can trade it with other players for things youve obtained in your missions that they need you know how some people want to just buy their way to the end of the game so there are always people buying and selling things to each other passing around this currency to each other as far as the graphics go i am extremely impressed the graphics surpass those of a lot of games that cost $40 and still remain freetoplay the gameplay is even more impressive with 20 different warframes to choose from and each having unique abilities the game is very dynamic the way i might use my favorite warframe might not work for you and you might be killed frequently while i blaze through killing everyone also there is a miniature card game involved and each warframe and every weapon has slots where the cards go drastically changing the stats survivability and the abilities of your warframe and weapons these mods are sometimes dropped by your fallen enemies with different enemies having different mods they can drop these mods can also be traded with other players for the special currency other mods or for blueprints for special items found only in a special kind of mission which brings me to another aspect of the game crafting as you progress through the levels you will pick up materials that you use to build new weapons armors and some very useful equipment different locations have different components that drop from them being a game that takes place in space each of the different locations is an entire planet although most of the time your missions are inside the ships orbiting these planets each planet has most of its nodes ruled by a single one of the factions from time to time there will be missions where you support one of the factions to either invade and take over the node or defend it from the opposing faction there are three distinct factions the corpus the grineer and the infestation the grineer are the first faction you come into contact with they rule the entire first planet and are the faction in the tutorial they are a race of humans deteriorated from years of excessive cloning they are heavily armored units with standard bullet shooting guns and feature everything from standard machine guns to flamethrowers and rocket launchers the next faction is the corpus these troops are a mix between robots with mounted laser guns and cyborgs with different laser shooting guns these units also have recharging shields like those seen in halo this factions weaponry is comprised of mostly repeating energy guns again much like those in halo and continuous beam lasers also like those in halo another faction is the infested these are troops from the grineer and corpus that have been afflicted with a parasitic growth that takes over and changes their bodies a lot of halo references here these being completely identical to the flood in how they work these units are almost all melee units that are very strong and attack in swarms as far as weapons go they have their claws and the heavier unit will slap you with its stretching arm almost every planet has their own boss which will randomly drop one of the three pieces you craft to form you new set of armor each boss has its own set of skills which most of the time will have some correlation to the warframe obtained from killing them for example the boss general sargus ruk uses a flamethrower and has a variety of fire based abilities he uses to try and burn you alive upon his defeat he will drop one of the three parts needed to craft ember a fire based warframe with two abilities nearly identical to those of ruk while on the subject of bosses i am going to mention another of my favorite features upon killing a boss you have a chance to receive a death mark getting one of these will give you a chance to have a deadly assassin appropriately named the stalker spawn randomly into literally any mission many levels above you with extremely overpowered weapons he is thought to be a rogue tenno those who can use the warframe armors and has the same weapon load outs and many abilities shared with other warframe armors as far as weapon load outs go you may carry around a primary secondary and melee weapon and have the choice of only bringing one weapon with you if you would like to with this comes even more diversity in play styles personally i prefer t use mostly just a melee weapon relying on a powerful long range primary and short range secondary for those tricky kills others might use only there primary weapon completely ignoring their secondary and melee weapons each weapon can be outfitted with mods to drastically change how the weapon works one mod can cause your weapon to fire two bullets at time while another may cause your weapons bullets to travel through enemies and objects such as walls or doors right now there are nearly 350 of these mods with new ones added all the time there is also a large variety of mission types some of these include defending a certain object from the enemy destroying targets such as the ships power core or special machinery to straight up kill everything on the ship this game also includes a very popular rpg tool customization on top of the mods you add into your weaponsarmor you can also customize the clor of your weapons and armor and there are special attachments bought with that special currency or obtained through one of the frequent events as a paid game i would give this a 910 but being completely freetoplay it gets a 1010 definitely a game worth trying and if you dont like it you can just delete it with no worry about money you waited because its free

so after playing warframe for 1040 hours steam says about 658 hours but its incorrect i finally decided to write a review on the game in this review ill be stating how free to play the game actually is and what the gameplay is like what the game offers in terms of content and a proscons list at the end of the review to sum things up so first off how free to play is this game anyways as a lot of us know most free to play games have you paying for microtransactions to get most content in the game with no way of using the ingame resources or currency to get them instead warframe does not do this only cosmetic items color pallets interior decorations for your liset etc things like weapons warframes and companions can all be earned by playing the game and getting enough resourcescredits although warframe and weapons slots cant be obtained without platinum warframe slots are 20 platinum each and weapon slots are 2 for 12 platinum you can trade items in the trade channel to people in exchange for platinum another thing i should mention is foundry build rushing if you are building a weapon or warframe in the foundry you will notice a rush build option this isnt spendy though usually only costing 2550 platinum to do so trust me if you have what people want you can obtain a hefty amount of platinum without paying a dime and have plenty to spend on rushing builds or buying slots now if you actually start liking the game and want to spend money to get things quicker this is where you could have a tough time market prices from digital extremes are you could say extreme with weapons usually costing about $5$12 depending on the weapons and warframes costing $5$20 depending on the warframe to put this into a better perspective it costs $5 for the most basic package of platinum which is 75 platinum all the way to $200 worth of platinum which is 4300 platinum there is a cheaper way to get platinum though the game has a login reward system and sometimes you can get a coupon for 25% 50% and 75% off your next platinum purchase this would be an ideal time to buy some they started doing prime access which allows you to access the lastest prime warframe and weapons instantlyfor $150 of course the cheapest package you can get in prime access give you just the prime accessories a 90 day affinity booster and a 90 day credit boosterfor $50 i feel prime access just isnt all that affordable but maybe thats just me my rating on warframes free to play factor is a 910 alright next thing to talk about is the actual gameplay is it fun is it rewarding well warframe can be very fun to play at times other times it can be annoying and tedious to play its a 3rd person view cooppvp shooter with unique elements that will be talked about later in the beginning you will have a choice among 3 warframes  excalibur mag or volt you will have a choice between 2 primary weapons  mk1braton or mk1paris you will have a choice between 2 secondary weapons lato or mk1kunai and you will have a choice between 2 melee weapons skana or mk1bo either of the warframe are fun to play in my opinion the mk1braton is garbage both secondaries are good for beginners and both melee weapons are good for beginners as well getting used to some of the controls might be a pain at first such as wallrunning and sliding but eventualy youll get the hang of it and be flipping around like a space ninja in no time basically what im saying here is that the beginning of the game is hard to get past in the sense that you feel underpowered and weak compared to your foes if stick with it long enough to get better equipment then it becomes much more fun to play weapons are fun and all but i think the warframes are what spice the game up the most each warframe has a set of 4 powers that you unlock as you rank them up the powers are some of the most fun this game has to offer example scenario you are a rank 10 excalibur surrounded by 25 grineer troopers and there are just too many to shoot and kill before you die yourself what do you do at this point activate radial javelin which is your most powerful power as excalibur and watch as all 25 of them are pinned to the walls around you eventually youll be able to do the same thing but with 50 guys surrounding you warframe powers yes please now what about rewarding gameplay this game can reward you at times however it can be very grindy the first thing youll probably farm for in this game are resources resources arent that painful to try to get although orokin cells neurodes neural sensors and argon crystals are the ones you will be grinding out on the most in terms of farming the only real things that could be tedious to obtain are warframe parts prime warframe parts prime weapon parts and archwing parts speaking of archwing if you have played the game awhile now and feel the need for something new to do try getting the odonata archwing and fly through deep space in archwing missions its a breath of fresh air if you feel like ground combat is getting boring gameplay can get pretty intense at times if you finally have the loadout to survive 30 minutes on warframes survival gamemode or 30 waves on warframes defense mode all in all the gameplay is fun the farminggrinding usually isnt fun but once you get that weapon built or warframe built the fun begins yet again overall warframes gameplay gets an 810 from me now to talk about what warframe has to offer in terms of content well it has a lot of content to offer compared to when i started back in june 2013 there are 22 warframes available to play as not counting the prime warframes only difference is they have an extra polarity and look way cooler there are 100 weapons in the game as well not to mention the primes of course there are 14 planets to visit each with increasing number of missions available tons of mods to choose from including melee stances which enhance your melee weapons by allowing you to perform combos just plenty of content for a newcomer to explore every other wednesday digital extremes usually updates the game with new content bugfixes and changes that improve the experience of the game usually every two months digitial extremes puts out a massive update usually going up a whole number  as in update 145 goes to update 15 these massive updates add hours upon hours of new things to do warframes amount of content gets a 1010 from me now finally a proscons list to sum everything up and some things i didnt talk about pros the game is fun to play once you get the hang of things easy to learn thanks to a tutorial pve and pvp you can earn content in the game without paying friendly community there is a wealth of content at least 7 gamemodes to play endgame is cool more to come no pay to win business models rewarding exploration especially in void missions warframe powers are fun as hell most boss fights are awesome for a f2p alerts invasions and infestations as daily missions are great and rewarding most all weapons past the beginner ones are great pet dogs cons market pricing is a bit steep prime access is ridiculous there is some farminggrinding some bugs still in the game a frustrating napalms are jerks beginning of the game loadouts can be tough to get past because of how underpowered they feel higher mastery rank tenno entering your game could ruin the experience for you some people in trade overprice everything ever let me know if theres anything i could add as this is my first review  if you need any help ingame add me as ttrlabs02 if im online and not busy i

update 4315 i started playing again once i heard about the sanctuary update it had a dragon warframe included so why the  not right any i picked up right where i left off months ago and some nice changes have been made the new law of retribution raid is pretty much the only reason i can recommend this game now for a variety of reasons it gives you a purpose for one before i was just swapping gear and getting more powerful just to do the same old  and get even more gear now with a massive raid as challenging as this i finally had a reason to get my frames up to snuff and whatnot secondly this raid is the only gratifying victory in the game i felt accomplished only by the end of lor nothing else as this was the only mission that wasnt just a fetch quest or grind another thing ive learned to love about the game since i picked it back up again is the glory of trading do you know how fun it is to rip off people who paid real money for digital  in this pos game for your digital  its insanely fun yes kind sir you can pay $30 for platinum and exchange it for my crappy rare mod that i have lying around then ill buy the mesa warframe with your cash and you can enjoy a crappy mod that i can farm again in under an hour its great fun as long as youre not on the idiot side of things in short heres the scoop chroma the law of retribution raid and ripping people off for plat are the only kicks i can get out of this game and now that ive done all three i assume ill rarely be picking this up again after my recent binge this game is still the equivalent of smoking in that just because you unwittingly catch yourself doing it doesnt mean youd recommend it to others update over enjoy the original review below its addictive for all the wrong reasons sure the space ninja gameplay starts out fun enough what with the stabbystabby and shootyshooty  but then well you realize that your only options to explore more of the game consist of a spending real world dollars on ridiculously overpriced content or b grinding and farming your way to the top of the freetoplay food chain now of course the game is built for farmers and grinders because there is a lot of farming to be done every single item requires a blueprint which requires farming then materials which require farming then parts of the blueprint which need farming then the final assembly which requires farming and grinding in short you could be looking at seven hours worth of work and literally three days worth of waiting just to build a new ing pistol unless of course youd like to speed that process up for a measily $999 now im not not knocking the monetization as considering the games target demographic the farming aspects are very well done and youre ultimately never really shoved into a corner where the devs beat you up and steal your lunch money but heres the thing its not addictive because the gameplay is great its only an okay time killer and its not addictive because any of the rewards are great because no one gun or warframe is that spectacular no its addictive because the temptation to get more  whatever that more might be for you is always there after 40 some odd hours wasting away my life on this game i realize that there was no real accomplishment to show for it no overarching story no greatly increased op character no real progress just a swap of this frame for that frame this gun for that gun in short it was like shuffling a deck of cards for 40 hours if you have literally nothing better to do with yourself and want to spend days weeks and months of your life like that warframe is hands down the freetoplay game for you but poke past its initially endearing facade and youll find a game so utterly trivial even by video game standards that shame is all youll feel long after ignoring the clock

way back then i have had a good look at firefall and warframe both quite unpolished and in so much need of work gave firefall the benefit of the doubt and just loved it i needed a change though and a good buddy of mine in firefall was also playing warframe and so i asked how the game was these days three months later and i am all in on this game with firefall having open space and more of an mmo feeling warframe is level based with a mission a big change for me but liking it lots you get to know the mechanisms the frames mods etc etc and just get better at it frames keep leveling so are the mods all these things give you a feeling of accomplisment in this game the frames are quite distinctive and all have their specific abilities that make you come back for more de is adding more features releases frames or updatedupgraded frames prime and hopefully in the near future id like to get more into the lore of the tenno every week a live community stream and i believe every other week a dev stream as well both with giveaways all in all a great game that will let you have a great time with your buddies ps its certainly not p2w at all almost everything you want you can get it by playing certain levels etc etc if you do pay thats great the game deserves all the support

its an interesting twist on third person shoot man games that leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to accessiblity versus a grind its free to play so obviously youre gonna run into roadblocks but eventually youll be wondering why youre running through the same levels blasting the same enemies for the same if not less rewards if youre a sucker for aesthetics though then itll suck good twenty hours outta your life with the player character designs and weapon variations give it a spin but dont bother dropping money on it unless you really really wanna be a space ninja

i have very mixed feelings towards warframe when i first played warframe it was a little bit after its debut on steam in terms of content it was after they switched over to the current ability system when banshee was still the hot stuff since then ive grinded my way to near end game collected most of the shiny macguffins theyve thrown at us and felt generally terribly annoyed with the developers there have been a lot of mistakes bugs and some downright stupid decisions that should not have happened in the first place there are times where i do wonder if they ever bother to think how the players will react yes there are constant hotfixes and updates but the real issues frequently brought up on the forum are not addressed in the updates the contents released feel slapped on empty and almost always really buggy the beta excuse is lame and abused warframe is released on ps4 and we are still in beta people have been asking for better net code fix for ages and there have been no significant improvements since i first joined hiding and encrypting the data to prevent people peeking into drop rates is an overkill and does look suspicious going by what they did around that time ie not doing thier job of fixing the drop rates the recent release of prime access and its outrageous pricing makes me question if they even have an inkling of how to properly price a f2p game their digital currency plat is pretty expensive enough as it is only with a 50% or 75% coupon would the price be more reasonable oh but you cant use the coupon for prime access the concept of a space ninja is great but digital extreme doesnt have a clear direction for their baby all this incessant padding with gimmicky weapons and frames is getting old and stale very quickly older weapons and frames wont get adjusted unless people are really vocal about it theres only nerf nerf and nerf if they think a weapon is too over powered buff is rare valkyr is also a poor choice of a berserker frame is she has such a squishy stats damage 20 might fix some things but the biggest problem of connection issue hasnt even been touched while warframe is indeed a game where the important content such as weapons and frames can be farmed without digital currency i still would not recommend it for those who are looking for a coop online game this is not the one this game is very grind intensive and not very friendly to the new players connections will be an issue if you dont have good internet as warframe doesnt have any official servers to host missions because of the way is constructed the envrionment doesnt always encourage good cooperations between the players you are better off joining a good clan or kidnap some friends to play with you public matching can be boring and disastrous the recent events also brought out a lot of campersleechers

for a game in its beta version it is actually quite impressive this game is a 3rd person coop shooter game featuring the generic definition mothering space ninjas with magic there is a large variation of characters to fit anyones play style including various and very unique and powerful energy abilities and weapons i have never seen a game with such advanced player movements including wall runs sliding jump kicks and dodge rolling which really keeps the game feeling fast paced and exhilarating the game excels in graphics level design and combat keeping the game very dynamic with the best experience making this one of the best freetoplay game in existence

this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

well this game has actually surprised me i love anything ninja based and when they said ninjas with guns in space at first i was like wth but after playing for the past few weeks i have to admit this game is freaking awesome a few problems here and there but the design team are always coming up with new content and fixing those bugs faster than they pop up i absolutely love the starter selection of warframes your cyber ninja suit and would only recommend adding a notice that the weapons and sidearms you select in the first mission will be that you are stuck with till you can make your own later on and also a way of maybe choosing to play the first mission as one of the alternative warframes a way to test the different classes out you are offered i mean as a new player the skills and stuff mean very little and the only way to test it all out and find your niche is to play the different character types with alot of game where you have to pay for certain in game items you know from the get go guys who have cash to blow will get the best and the rest of us meer mortals with  exchange rates will be stuck with the scraps warframe gives you the option to jump ahead with paid content but everyone can get there eventually no items that are platinumin game real money currency only that can not be found or made later its all just a matter of time and according to some higher level friends you can actually start trading platinum at a later stage overall i love the game a bit of a rocky start but well worth it

a very well made free to play 3rd person shooter uses a custom lanucherupdater gameplay gameplay is quite repetitve in the long run there are a bunch of planets available to you each with sectors  missions  with different gamemods which you complete for rewards the game uses tiles to randomly generate levels some planets have unique tilesets etc has a bunch of different weapons and weapon types each item has to be ranked up with xp you can then mod your weaponwarframeetc with a huge amount of mods to tweak each parameter to your liking has a lore but theres no campaign as such just a few story quests real money basically almost nothing is locked behind a paywall in this game the only exceptions i found are some cosmetics  character attachements color pallettes animations sets  and inventory size  for weapon and characters  you can trade ingame currency bought for real money to other players at higher levels which means that you can unlock pretty much everything for free which enough time put into the game not only that but you can get a 75% discount on platinum  currency bought for real money  as a daily login reward and for 5$ you can get enough of it to lift all restrictions on the inventory size and buy some cheap cosmetics buying weaponscharacters for platinum is pointless because you can simply craft or acquire them otherwise score if i had to give it a score id say 7510

interesting but very grindy and samey artificially difficult you need to have grinded enough to not be dead weight to your team the weapons are horribly imbalanced even with the new damage system and while youre supposed to be stealthy ninjas the best way through a level is to gun everything down with the heaviest weaponry or ignore enemies and alarms entirely the developers seem to almost genuinely care about the community but some of their ideas are halfbaked and their quality assurance team appears to be nonexistent ultimately a casual runandgun with severe balance issues that still manages to be one of the better f2p games on the market

warframe simply put is a solid well rounded video game i spent a while trying to sum it up with a genre but it borrows from several mass effect with jumping its a third person shooterbrawler that puts you in the role of a tenno a nearly extinct race awaking to find several factions ruining the galaxy and various shenanigans occuring that are for your detriment going on missions in various space stations ships and planets using tons of weapons and warframes in a free2play game that looks and plays like a current gen aaa game  good graphics & sound design  large amound of varied enemies unique styles and boss battles  procedurally generated maps with dozens of tile sets  very satisfying gunplay and indepth melee combatcombo system  fantastic replay value  hundreds of weapons covering all different categories and type & plenty of warframes to get with very unique abilities  decent story and universe created  f2p  lack of direction to new players after initial quests  late game can slowly get repetetive  minor inconveniences to be had if not spending any real money  pvp is currently peer2peer and very laggy with no tangible rewards for putting time into it  a lot of mechanics go unexplained unless you actively check the codexwiki in essence you are able to progress through hundreds of missions that are instanced for up to 4 players in a squad completing random objectives in procedurally generated maps against one of the 5 possible enemy factions or sometimes a combination this is a solid formula with a lot of different planetmap tilesets a ton of very well crafted rooms and a very hefty roster of enemies for each of the main faction combine this with the hundreds of weapons you can craft varying from pistols to grenade launchers to crossbows to electric boomerangs to rail guns 20 warframes classes with very unique 4 abilities akin to a moba to choose from a very good looking engine and some solid gunplaymelee combat and youve got a fantastic game in its own right you level up and upgrade all of your gear with mods that drop from enemies constantly so everyone can tailor their weapons and warframe to their own liking and you do get a very solid sense of progression you can parkour around the maps wall run pull of some complex melee combos and act like a space ninja or you can be moving from cover to cover coordinating with your team and playing it through like a tactical third person shooter it has a very good looking engine that stands up by todays standards depiste the game being nearly 3 years old counting the closed beta its got a godly particle system as well as full usage of physx very cool looking units and maps and a consistent art style throughout the sound design is very competent but the music stands out the most there are several dynamic sound tracks when fighting each of the factions that change depending on how much combat is happening but they all sound very unique and cool to listen to in the middle of some hectic shenanigans the kicker being that this is completely free to play this is a hybrid coopmmo without the 19 button smashing on the keyboard and it relies entirely on your skill with the weapons abilities and movement to be good it being a f2p mmo esque game you do have to craft new weapons and warframes which take time but due to how inherently fun the actual gameplay is farming for materials or blueprints never feels like a chore and 99% of the time youll be collecting more than enough materials just while playing normally theres a ton of pve mission types some new pvp horde modes a space combat mode think zone of the enders and plenty of replay value inbetween there are several story quests and tutorial missions to all new players a grasp on all of the basic mechanics however once the tutorials are over you are just sort of left to your own devices the lack of constant direction might annoy a few players but i strongly reccomend just deciding that you want to go and check out a planet or get a cool weapon then work toward those goals seeing new things and acquiring more equipment on the way planets have bosses new planets need to be unlocked and so on so there are tangible goals to set yourself you can create a clan with your friends build a very large dojo that can be used for trading researching exclusive weaponry dueling storing event trophies as well as assisting in building solar rails for the very large scale pvp solar rail conflicts i would reccomend if youre really into it getting just a few dollars worth of platinum then buying a scarf theyre cool because its in space

this game has nice graphics and the gameplay is fun however theres a reason why this is still in beta after playing for a week or two youll see that pretty much all the missions are quite similar sure there are different ones like extermination and survival but most of them end in getting the task done and then running back to extraction also this game is a complete grindfest the devs put up ridiculous prices so you either have to buy the item or you have to grind for days in order to get it however if you do get your item it usually takes days for it to be ready a new warframe takes three days three and you need three components which all take a day each to build in order for you to move on to the main blueprint takes 3 days to build so this game emphasizes on you either having money or time but yeah not much content or backstory either i seems interesting enough but its so vague i would just play this for a week and then get on with your life

well after almost 1000 hours i think i can judge this game i started playing just before update 12 was rolled out i think it was 11 let me start off with the pros nice graphics large diversity of weapons can be an issue  see below large and mostly friendly community definetly not pay to win can be difficult at times though  see below tons of new content again can be an issue  see below igc purchased with real money platinum is available through ingame trading can be very difficult to work with mod system that can slowspeed up progression can be an issue explained below now to the cons with the weapons they get very repetitive and unimpressive you do get a few gems rarely but the amount of bad weapons in my opinion is extremely annoying and unfair the grind oh my this game is an endless grind explained below no story line again explained below credit farming is a nightmare too much new content being introduced and longstanding bugs are being ignored confusing to newer players not so much anymore unimpressive and prehistoric social menus the lack of story warframe doesnt have a story at all this makes it an endless grind to have the best gear and be as rich as possible i find this extremely annoying as this just makes the game as stated above and endless grind that goes nowhere the game has no purpose and is not immersive at all as a result there are obviously more reasons although they did implement a quest system for obtaining certain warframes suits but due to how the crafting system works you have to wait 12h  24h for most items to craft 72h for warframes quest progression is extremely slow bugsimprovements there are quite a few gamebreaking bugs in the game which de digital extremes have refused to fixignored if favour of new content i have nothing against new content except when the developers focus completely on that and only partially on fixing bugs and the parkour system  it is absolute trash  although there has been speculation about an improved parkour system  the new parkour system has been confirmed but its eta is unknown it makes doing what this game is advertised as  being a space ninja  nigh impossible when you wallrun you fly off the wall when you let go of space it is clunky badly animated and extremely difficult to work with the parkour and stealth goodness me ive never seen a stealth system so bad just like parkour stealth is the worst ive ever seen imagine accidentally walking in to an enemys line of sight in reality he might become startled and go to check it out but never would an enemy instantly start firing and alert the entire ship it makes being a ninja impossible the only way to stealth is to get a loki invis frame and spam invis hence the quotation marks by stealth with a loki i mean go invis use hushed invisibility and spam your tonkor or boltor prime they really need a rework of stealth oh yes and they completely ruined accuracy at one point they would fire like stormtroopers and now oh boy now the have pinpoint accuracy they will rarely miss ingame currencies the ingame currencies work well and in fact its probably the best ive ever seen the currency thats purchased with real money platinum is available to trade using ingame items as you would imagine it has its drawbacks but the only thing platinum is mainly used for is rushing items that are crafting trading with other people and buying cosmetic items you can buy weapons and warframes with it but its not necessary as you can get weapons via grinding it can make getting platinum extremely difficult but say if a new player was to buy platinum most weapons that arent primed can be bought with platinum this can unbalance the game but it usually doesnt due to how the mod system works credits can be extremely difficult to farm without a booster and are spent up far too quickly for the sake of newer players the drop ratesamounts should be buffed or the prices for everything should be lowered a bit and now on to the mod system the mod system works because it limits progression as you can imagine this has its drawbacks too it can make higher level missions difficult or extremely easy in short it can unbalance the game very very easily summarytldr this game has quite a few flaws ie the mod system stealth parkour ingame currency farming but it is a real gem and it has potential stick with it chip in at the forums and maybe just maybe some of the issues may be addressed i may update this later as new content andor bugs are fixed thanks for reading

before i even begin my review warframe is still an open beta there are always glitches bugs and issues that accrue the ire of many players but de the company behind warframe is next to always on top of releasing patches warframe in a brief nutshell is a spaceage scifi ninja hackandslash with an intriguing storyline the prequel to warframe is dark sector where the tenno  the race every player is  has been pushed back into the void and has only recently come back to find the sol system in the middle of a threeway war between the militaristic and brutish grineer the greedy and technological corpus and the overwhelming numbers of the infested the tennos role in this game is to bring balance back to the sol system by assassinating key personell from all sides who threaten galactic stability gameplaywise warframe is  at the time of this review  very grindy such as other mmorpgs to level up one has to fight the enemy collect resources a drop from enemies or by releasing a titan extractor to systems collect modifications a drop from enemies and clear planetary systems usually by defeating the boss weapons are unlocked via purchasing blueprints and crafting them with ones gained resources and one must also have the appropriate mastery rank on paper your overall player level separate from weapon levels warframe levels and sentinel levels which is leveled up by leveling up warframes and weapons weaponwise combat feels visceral and satisfying for the most part some weapons have become outdated while some have begun to shine the warframe you control determines how fast how wellarmored and what powers the players has with a general rule that casterclasses have low shields health and armor but possess potent powers and fighterclasses have high health shields and armor but have less powerful abilities than casters there is a realworld currency market in place but 99% of the items sold there can be madefound by playing the game itself the 1% of items not found are purely cosmetic such as color schemes and syndanas capes the realworld currency to game currency ratio in this authors opinion is quite unbalanced however 75 platinum the game currency is $5 usd with bonus platinum being awarded depending on how much one purchases in one transaction for example 180 platinum is gained from $10 usd 150 being from the $10 and a 30 platinum bonus warframe is able to be played alone but is much more enjoyable and beneficial with friends or a clan with a moderate amount of startup resources one can start their own clan or can simply join a preexisting clan to save resources clans offer clanmates to join games with a player clan technology which offers highend weaponry and miscellaneous activities such as 1 v 1 pvp in a dueling arena trading and obstacle courses finally warframe has a dedicated forums page to report bugs meet with potential clan members introduce yourself make suggestions offer feedback or generally just shoot the breeze with fellow players pros multiplayer with clanmates or friends is enjoyable and practical everything save for cosmetics can be obtained without real money solid swordplay gunplay and warframe powers complex damage system which promotes a wellcoordinated squad and a variety in weapons many side activities many graphics settings can be changed so lowerend pc users dont have to worry as much forums have a decent active community cons prone to glitches and bugs after major updates but are rectified quickly playing solo can be tough at higher levels and bosses real currency to game currency is at an uneven ratio damage system can take some time to learn and master grinding for resources can be a bore at times

having played quite a lot for almost 2 years i can highly recommend playing warframe but only if you have got some time to get into it it is slow to get started but at an enjoyable pace if played with a couple of mates that can quickly get you through your first few missions mods and a new weapon and warframe to venture out on your own with it can be a bit of a grind getting everything you need to get that new frame or weapon that was just released but again when played with a bunch of friends and you combine your missions for everything you team wants to get it is a tonne of fun i think they are getting a bit complex now  but the devs have always done an awesome job of not only adding new content but making sure that they can please their fan base while trying to enlarge it the live dev streams are also pretty cool if you get into it you will probably spend more money on this free to play than any other title you ever bought outright you can get by without spending any cash but it is not as enjoyable

reasons to play warframe to feel like an awesome ninja to feel like an awesome robot to feel like an awesome martial artist to feel like an awesome marksman to feel like an awesome archer to feel like an awesome swordsman to feel like an awesome mercenary to drown in content updates pretty sure the dev team has adhd or something my goodness they cant sit still for a minute most companies are down for sitting around on their latest update like yeah we did a good job meanwhile at warframe hq the dev team is like done this update gotta make a new one go go go the game feels so good plays smooth as shaved balls everything feels good to do and even if it bugs out a bit its generally entertaining to some degree eg flying off walls at hyperspeed downsides honestly not many im sure computer strength can be a major issue but its fairly good for the most part mid grade computers should be fine at like 20 fps on reasonable settings while it is possible to play this game free and nearly everything is obtainable without paying even many cosmetic stuff it does take quite a long time the further you get in the game and the more time you invest the less this becomes a problem anyways it is very easy to spend way too much on this game im sure ive spent hundreds on this yes yes i feel the shame also inventory slots are platinum manditory however you can get platinum from others in game selling recipes for stuff like formas and such you will need inventory slots if you want to have more than a small handful of warframes at your disposal at one time or weaponry long story short lots of fun watch your wallet its tempting so so tempting

this game started out fun enough especially for a free to play game unfortunately every patch and theres about 4week makes the game even worse its been out for almost a year and i dont think a single bug has ever been addressed while every patch brings a whole host of new bugs most minor some major the netcode is terrible there are no dedicated servers instead relying on one of the four players to host it seeks out the absolute worst host imagineable for every game when i play with friends its fine but about 910 times you play with the public the lag is so bad as to render the game as unplayable the game frequently refuses to accept certain inputs its fairly common to just be plain unable to use your melee weapon or be unable to crouch for several games bosses occasionally become completely invincible did i mention the lag its bad i dont just mean theres lots of snap back and targets become impossible to hit im talking extended intervals ie doubledigit minutes where its so bad you have trouble leaving the room youre currently in the variety of weapons started out as neat unfortunately theyve increased the grind factor needed to get them every day this is the rare case of a an early beta game being pretty fantastic but absolutely every change theyve made since then has been for the worse i would pay money for the warframe of 8 months ago i wouldnt pay $001 for the warframe of today

are you a fan of dark souls are you a fan of monster hunter then i would highly recommend giving warframe a shot this game is the best of both worlds bringing difficulty and fun gear collection to the forefront of freetoplay games without requiring any money to be spent  contrary to popular belief  first glance  after delving into the deeper aspects of what this game has to offer i am without a doubt mesmerized by its beauty and presentation the overall design and scale of this game has been a welcoming experience  as i am tired of most games lately the same cut and paste formula used from one game unto another yes warframe is based loosely upon the scifi genre but the way digital extremes has gone about creating this particular universe and breaking the mold of every other scifi game has been much appreciated on my end the strange and unusual that pushes others away from this game has drawn me closer and given me the desire to learn more about its unique direction  key aspects  this game has a lot to offer i will admit that i was one of the original beta testers that walked away after closed beta the fact that the game only had two different tile sets and lacked content was an immediate turn off but now after returning many months after my last login i find the game has grown substantially thanks to the communitydeveloper relationship which in respect has gained a lot of traction due to the various features that keep veterans from the community and development team going what this game has to offer is simply boundless once youve peered through the veil 280 procedurally generated missions which include  standard missions  alert missions randomly generated location and reward  infestation missions guaranteed reward  invasion missions guaranteed reward x3  challenging boss fights  void missions private instances earned via key drops  orokin derelict missions  nightmare mode then we have character progression  limitless ways to customize your warframe via mods  limitless ways to customize your weapons via mods  clans and clan hall building  clan research for clan specific gearmaterials and with each patch there is a special event that takes place something big and eventful that ties into the lore and awards players with unique gear that can no longer be collected after the event has ended talk about gratifying  pitfalls  the only drawback i see this game having is with people and their lack of patience if youve made it this far into my review then by all means get to downloading it should be mentioned that most crafted items need to take 1272 hours in real time also using revives is limited you can only carry a set amount of revives and when youre out youre out until you gain another one one per 24 hours on the flipside all gear and warframes can be attained through gameplay and the only things platinum real money need to be used for is additional weapon slots warframe slots and aesthetic items earning platinum through the game is easy as well selling rare mods to other users is an easy way to attain this currency in order to make the small purchases you need to maintain your collection of warframes and weapons therefore real money from your wallet is not required   to help alleviate confusion while playing keep this warframe wiki [warframewikiacom] close by  understanding  from the moment my friends log out i find it interesting how the community in this game thrives aside from the recruiting chat channel to enter hidden zones with a preformed party there is little to no communication between users its as if there is an unspoken language between those who have survived the tutorial and beginner missions experienced players in most missions have zero communication and there is a strong sense of synergy as if roleplaying our speechless tenno comes with the experience and territory  conclusion  i feel most people overlook this game by the sheer fact that their first experience was miserable and they didnt take the time to give this game an honest chance from the surface its overly complicated and doesnt hold your hand but for those who carry on that is the draw that is the appeal set your own goals and the game will become very rewarding what are you waiting for masterful tenno persevere while the inept are left to drown

warframe is a refreshing take on the squad based 3rd person shooter in its over all game play and especially its art design while not every gamers taste i find warframe to be a refreshing take on design the characters and aliens are unique very inspired and striking my compliments to the art direction and the whole team the gameplay is tight responsive and franciticly exciting giving the player the experience of feeling like theyre a true space ninja youll be parkouring over obstacles climbing on walls hacking apart enemies and sliding across floors while going all john woo on anyone that stands between your teams and your objective ninja ive found myself coming back to this game over and over again ever since a friend got me into it way back in june 13 as of today ive already spend hundreds of hours in warframes game sessions can be as pick up and play as a half hour or turn into longer survival and raids its one of the most open to all ftps out there paying players dont overwhelm the f2p players in the gameplay department they just dont have to spend the time gathering and crafting those items all of which can be easily found in the game and created with miniumal grind time compared to how many other f2ps work digital extremes really did this game right give it a try and you wont be disappointed

ive played this game for a long while now i love ninjas and slaughtering my enemies this game gives both of that to me i have always been a huge fan of third person shooters and warframe gives me the extra boost that i need to be on the top of every game i mean come on im sure those of you who want to see how awesome your character looks while your slaughtering your enemies i mean a game just doesnt feel right if i dont look cool right anyways this game does not really have a story yet and i still love the game i have spent a lot of money on the game even when you arent required to i put this one aspect of the game on the top of this list because the game is not p2w pay to win and that is the main reason i have stuck to this game for so long you can craft everything in this game the warframes the guns the ammo and health packs i mean you dont have to spend money aside from if you want to have more than 2 warframes or if you want an awesome looking cape or scarf that has absolutely no attributes but you can buy every gun and every cape and so on but you can craft it it may take around 1224 hours or if youre looking at warframes it adds up to 3 days but you can wait trust me also if you arent looking to collect every warframe youll be just fine with just 2 frames i have only used the frost prime and the vauban im stuck on those 2 frames i have a lot of other warframes but im just so connected to the ones i currently have because they are epic there are some items you cannot buy and that is what makes them so precious they have a special name to them also that way you can rub it into your friends face that you finally made the weapon or warframe the first 3 items that came out were called the frost prime the latron prime and the reaper prime they were such a high demand people were always asking people to take them on void runs which that reminds me to have a chance to get the parts to make the weaponswarframes you have to get void keys from survival missions or defence missions dont worry it will take a while but its definitely worth it the game can sometimes get boring to me i will admit after playing for about 34 hours you get tired of slaughtering your enemies because most of the time you will be farming for supplies or just surviving it out on a survival mission with your buddies but then you can just go play a different mission and have fun all over again they have a variety of different mission types out there while your waiting for that storyline to come together some like extermination capture defenceand plenty more the game does not make all enemies level with you you can choose to play on a low level mission or you can choose to play on a high level mission each planet has its own set amount of missions all with increasing difficulty as you go along every update they have had and i will say they update frequently they have added more and more content i will tell you this if youre tired of games having a limit on how much weapons they have on the game then this game is the game for you there are tons and tons of guns and melee weapons you can choose from ive played for a while and i can say some guns i dont like others i love and will use over and over each warframe and gun has 30 levels you can achieve each level it adds a mod point that will allow you to add mods to your gun now call of duty players dont get so excited i dont mean mods like scopes and camo i mean mods that will change fire rate bullet damage bullet elemental damage and so much more but now you call of duty players can get excited for this you can relevel your gun why you ask because you get to change a mod slot to make it have a symbol on it now youre wondering what does the symbol do well if it matches the symbol on the mod card it only takes up half of the points that the mod uses it is definitely worth it to relevel a gun especially if you plan on using that gun for a long time i cant wait to see the storyline come together and i cant wait to see what warframe becomes 1010

while sometimes a bit repetitive and grindy the game offers a fair free to play market based system with just about everything not cosmetic on the market place obtainable in game with a little work my only real complaint is actually just the community at times if you arent used to the games parkour speed tricks and moving while fighting mechanics some of the higher end players doing lower level missions will simply leave you in the dust and not look back completing the mission themselves leaving you sort of an empty experience with the mission the most intimidating thing about the game is its parkour system though being able to move at extreme speeds wall running climbing and vaulting just about anything sliding while unleashing a torrent of melee attacks or gun fire and using it all to your advantage give it some time after a couple of hours practicing it can start to become second nature especially anyone used to combo based games but in the end when you are feel confident about your ability to do it all nothing feels more badass then executing a series of attacks while sliding and moving through waves of enemies quickly and efficiently and being able to turn around when all is said and done to see some of their bodies still falling to the ground and come on whats better then being a freaking space ninja with guns

the amount of hours ive invested into this game should give you an idea of how much i love it warframe isnt meant for the impatient the rng in this game will make you angry a lot you will stumble rage and even bleed over how unforgiving it can be but thats what makes warframe worth it its a game that makes you work for everything theres a certain progression level that once you hit you can play warframe for fun comfortably if you choose to do so but then theres the extra mile warframe wants to test your patience and determination when it comes to farming it wants to show you thats its not as willing as other games to just let you have whatever it is that youre looking for if its not giving you a run for your money its giving you a run for your time but if youre willing to spend your time on warframe it wont let you walk away emptyhanded it will reward you its simply a matter of when it chooses to do so so while the platinum system may be overpriced it doesnt matter if youre willing to put time into it ive gotten almost everything in the game for free just by farming for it on top of that im sitting on a comfortable pile of platinum just from trading what i earn to others dont let warframe intimidate you theres a reason people are still enjoying the game to this day and will continue to do so for perhaps years to come

warframe is a retrofit fastpaced animated novel youll encounter deep and thorough story elements along with deep and interesting game mechanics youll find no grinding in this game so farmville lovers beware this first person tatical realtime strategy tower defense game is very hard to put down and will have you racing around the track for hours on end i give this game a square enix out of an electronic arts

warframe is an enjoyable game but heres the list of things you dont wanna do if you wish to play it for a looooong time rushing missions warframe gets boring and hard to play if you play the missions just to get the loot enjoy the game in whole playing every mission online now you might just laugh at this one but its true there are many trolls and whiners in this game since its freetoplay many rushers too getting someone to get you all the things you want this one is the biggest reason to become boring i knew this guy he played for a week and already had 70 hours on record he got all the things he wanted in one week eventually game became boring and lame to him and he stopped playing now the things that will make you play the game really neat developers will often respond to community questions and bugs constant devstreams which spoil all the things you always wanted often patches often miniupdates which bring in new weapons and stuff no paywall you can basicly get everything in game for free except the cosmetics which are here just for those who want them things that make not play this game trolls and whiners hard to get materials elitistic s if you really like the game like i do you will ignore all the things that make you quit the game

i been playing warframe for almost 1300 ingame hrs for me warframe is a game with beautiful graphics i must admit game artists are very original and it keeps me hooked into this game gameplay wise the game requires you good amount of grinding if you are a rpg kind of player that is adapted to play repetitive missions this will not be an issue at all warframe developers are great they release constant updates every month sometimes even every week and game support is the best ive seen devs are always in contact with the comunity and constantly reading player opinions a good point about warframe is that it doesnt require real money to become strong you can get almost all equipments without platinum real money currency anyways platinum is a great help mainly focused for players that lacks time to play

pretty fun game they keep updating it

never have i been so proud to be a space ninja and warframe teaches you all about it overview\ warframe is a 3rd person shooter hacknslash game that takes a very wide amount of choice to the way you like to play with quests your own ship known as a liset many different locales space missions in space with a pair of jet wings archwing and 16 different mission types theres alot of fun to be had even if theres not much story to it couple that with the good 100 weapons total in the game and youll have lots of time to try out everything now on to the review itself points triumphantly warframe was made by digital extremes a company with an already impressive reputation after making the multiplayer for bioshock 2 helping out with the unreal engine and even making one of the unreal tournament games they also made dark sector which was actually supposed to be warframe but frankly was turned into something different so they could pitch a sale that the console owners liked it was alright but ehnot incredible the details were impressive though the game youre reading this review for right now is packed with action and stealth depending on your playstyle you take on the role of space ninjas known as tenno you are the tenno warriors of the gun and blade  the lotus each tenno has his or her own warframe to pick from and a good third of the warframes in the list so far have special prime versions of themselves you can get from the orokin void ill talk about the wonderful funderful void later warframes\ now what does being a tenno mean it means your a certified bonebreaking body burning ember heartelectrifying volt void sentencing limbo gunslinging mesa wolvering clawslashing valkyr gravity crushing mag stophammertimeing rhino like a bawss radial javelining excalibro like a

ship cannonnering hydroid pinball wizarding vauban skyhigh flying zephyr undead raising nekros mind controlling nyx stealth style murdering ash badass yyyyyyup lots o frames guns youll use them youll use big guns small guns silly guns cool guns future guns stupi you get the idea\ aside from warframes you cabn get some pretty badass weapons assault rifles homingfire machine guns compound bows that

thank you john prodman for gracing us tenno with your battle prowess battle hammers battle axes dual hand axes and of course katanas sentinels and kubrows\ because the origin system just isnt fun enough without your own pet robot or space puppy theres a plethora of sentinels wyrm blinded by the light shade the first two are the original ones also you cant see this dethcube my companiun cuub d

sahasas be careful theyll dig all over your backyard and raksas no not roxas from kingdom hearts totally different game>> [were hisbodyguards  neebs the noob]  there are also archwings your first is the odonata missile powah theres also the elytron dem nukes bebe and the itzal the newest one high speed slammah jammahs in short you can play any way you so gods be praised please mods\ in addition to this is an awesome way to modify how your weapons warframe sentinels kubrows and archwings function known as modules are simply mods i just call them mod cardsi mean they basically look like that xp anyway mods change the way you want to play letting you further augment how you define fun wanty to jump high and slide far slap on some mods to compliment it want to run walls for longer and have rocket launchers with miniature nuke blast radius explosions slap on some mods looking to make your dual machine pistols fire three shots with each round released slap on some mods theres tons of mods literally hundreds of mods so i wont list them all now this game does have the capacity to get repetitive but thats only if you keep using the same weapon for a month switching up how you play makes life alot less dull moving on to the nexzt series of things now the foundry\ now this is where you craft stuff from most things you craft will take 12 hours warframes however will take a whole 3 days but you can instantly complete the production of your item with a premium currency called platinum now before i get into that too let me explain some about the foundry you collect resources from multiple planets then use those resources to produce weapons warframes parts whatever you need just make sure you have the credits and youll be golden thumb up platinum\ this is the games premium currency and you start off with a little under $5 worth of it you get 50 platinum right off the bat which is pretty cool i usually advise people to spend it on a warframe slot and 4 weapon slots they come in pairs warframe slots are 20 platinum and weapon slots are 12 pltainum for each pair a daymn good deal if you ask me its pretty easy to make platinum too if you know where to look for items that people will buy planet locales\ so each planet has a unique theme earth is overgrown jungle mars is snow and mountains phobos is nothing but desert and so on but youre not here to learn about all the fun places and listen to me spoil the locales in one shot are you pokes face of course not youre here to know a little bit about the orokin void orokin voidsderelicts\ these are kind of like bonus reward missions and it really shows you get tons of credits out of these missions and typically a prime part or forma you dont get blueprints of the parts though oh no well the warframe parts are collected as blueprints v_v you get the full part youll see why when you try to complete one prime weapons and warframes take a little more dedication to complete the derelicts are the opposite of the voids pleasant appearance looking more like a nightmare done right here youll find other prime parts as well as orokin vaults containing corrupted mods make sure you have the dragon key for the vault door though as theres four different dragon keys squads work best and ill discuss that topic later tooactually now coop facial destruction\ thats right you can band up with three broccoli or broccolettes and destroy your way through hundreds of grineer corpus infested andor corrupted faces in any way you so please however rushers tend to be a problem so watch out p the developers\ this companythey are the epitome of awesome if south koreas best is neople canadas equivalent is digital extremes theyre very dedicated to the game and its community hearing any and all comments complaints suggestions and otherwise about to or for the game they also have devstreams every 2 weeks and prime time streams every thursday and give out awesome prizes because they love their fans i give this game a 97 out of 10 would grind 9 more times in the name of rngesus 9 thumbs up

the thing that immediately drew me in to this title was how apparent the use of zbrush was when creating the characters seriously as a character modeler myself this is like all the stuff you want to make in zbrush but can never get into a real game because its too far away from mainstream design the dev team is a bunch of hardworking people who outdo themselves with each update i cannot begin to describe how happy i am with the growth of this game it blows me away every time an update rolls out the events are super fun the weapons modding is full of tons and tons of options there is an ever growing list of items and warframes and there is just so much to bite into in this game i am a person who enjoys deep detail and stats and customization and this game speaks to that need very well in addition to the utter beauty of the visuals oh by the way its totally free the only place i find a little lacking is lore they have done a lot of worldbuilding and set up a great stage for their characters but have not embellished them or the history of the world very much this grows with every update of course but i feel it is growing much more slowly than the game itself is id love to even just be able to read more somewhere if nothing else however there is enough there though to latch onto to make stuff up and that can be fun would love a bit more ok go try it now

its pretty good i guess

warframe is a free to play game where you can play coop up to four players or solo if you wish really great games and a lot of customization for different play styles and it gets updated constantly which is always a good thing you play as a space ninja wizard with guns exploring different planets in the solar system obtaining minerals blue prints and mods to create your character build and craft new weapons and make new warframes after playing for 68 hours im still having fun so thats saying something i still have not explored all the planets yet overall i really enjoy the game and love that the game gets updated with new content so frequently

really good game for those who enjoy a good third person shooter

i hate this game it steals all of my money because its so good eugh
recommended
i see this game going up to its 10 rating i think it deserves at the moment its extremely linear designwise despite that i play it religiously at least every other day also it being a f2p you seriously dont need to buy anything with real money ever i bought 8 dollars worth of platinum for a color pack weapon slots and character slots its the only free to play i have ever bought anything fromexcepting dota 2 i highly recommend getting this game9310
recommended
ive been playing this game for 1000 hours and it completely ruined my life never try it 1110 but being honest this game is just great the only true free to play game where you are not forced to buy dlc with weird crap that allows you to shot enemy or buying some weapons to make a kill on a low level farming loots you can choise between hardcore farm and trading with people or quick purchase using your wallet that what i truly call f2p free to play not pay to play
recommended
this game is so awesome you can do parkour stuff in it kinda you can decapitate enemies and you have an awesome looking character which you can customize >3 and well its so fun i give it a rating of 1010

this game is a must have

best free to play game ever probably much better than some paid ones either

im quite surprised at how far along this game has come along the graphics have gotten better and the gameplay while repetative has also gotten better as the beta has gone on if you enjoyed games like mass effect 3 multiplayer gears of war horde mode or any other type of game where you and your crew of 4 take on endless waves of baddies in pure coop awesomeness sprinkled with the loot grind of dungeon crawlers like diablo or torchlight then you will have a blast with warframe if had to say one thing in the negative about it it would be the real world dollar cost on any of their items luckily everything can be gained in game with some rng luck and time as well as the in game won from missions currency all in all a great game definitely worth checking out its free what have you got to lose
recommended
pros excellent f2p model the only things you are forced to buy with the premium currency platium are purely asethic everything else can be crafted or traded for with enough patience addictive gameplay good community lots of weapon and character choices involved dev team very pretty graphics for a f2p and character and enemy designs are quite nice fun parkour system balanced difficulty highly customizable characters in terms of appearance and playstyle multiplayer is some of the best ive seen cons the same maps will show up again and again though the devs are working to avert this not all mechanics are fully explained ingame such as the channeling mechanic for melee weapons crafting can take days of actual time ash warframe 72 hours though thankfully it will track time even when you are not logged in overall one of the abosolute best f2p games on steam if not one of the better games overall the game is free so i highly recommend at least trying it out and deciding for yourself invite some friends while youre at it

english and italian review recensione inglese ed italiana english prefixing that the steam game time isnt correct and that is since the first closed beta that im a member of the warframe community i guarantee that this game is awesome ive been watching it growing up being developed step by step with the improvement and the progressive addition of contents what about the graphic is great and also the gameplay as in every free2play you can shop items with real money but the concept of pay2win is definetly relative all the items and the equipments that you can shop you can also get them by playing well and a lot with patience what else its based on teamplay as every good pve has to be and the variety of playable warframe and weapons in constant increasing is impressive the only defect its that the scenario tends to be repetitive in long times trust me and give it a try possibly with some friends you will not regret sorry for my bad english italiano premettendo che il tempo di gioco di steam  inesatto e che  dai tempi della closed beta che faccio parte della community di warframe vi assicuro che questo gioco  geniale lho visto crescere venire sviluppato passo per passo con il miglioramento e la progressiva aggiunta di contenuti che dire la grafica  ottima e il gameplay pure come in ogni free2play non manca la possibilit di shop ma il concetto di pay2win  decisamente relativo tutto ci che pu essere comprato nello shop si pu benissimo ottenere con impegno e pazienza guadagnandolo allinterno del gioco che altro dire e incentrato sul gioco di squadra come ogni buon pve dovrebbe essere e la variet di armi e e warframe giocabili tra laltro in continuo aumento  impressionante lunica pecca  che le ambientazioni alla lunga risultano ripetitive ma questo accade nella maggior parte dei f2p fidatevi di me e provatelo possibilmente assieme ad amici non ve ne pentirete

oh boy this is gonna be a long review buckle your seatbelts boys & girls grab a snack and enjoy the ride so ive had the game for about a year & half two years something around that long though just to make it clear i might get one or two things wrong about what i know during this so just bear with me  the game so how do i explain warframe to put it in simple terms its a game about some kickass space ninjas you play as a tenno you have been in cryosleep for decades until you are finally awoken by a character we known only as the lotus your guide through this journey as you are awoken you are giving a choice between three different suits which are called warframes that allow you to channel power and three different weapons in primary secondary and melee you are a defender of the solar system and all its inhabitants you will find yourself travelling to all kinds of different planets in our solar system earth mercury mars pluto and so on so far there are five different factions in the game four of them are your enemies which you must defend the system from tenno grineer corpus infected & orokin each with all of their own unique units and bosses tenno is the race that you play for so you will not be finding any other tenno units as enemies during gameplay unless you count pvp where you fight other tenno warriors in online battle so youve picked your warframe and your weapons youve completed the tutorial now you have your personal stealth ship the liset controlled by your untrustworthy companion ordis a computer ai this ship is where you will be spending a lot of the game and is pretty much your main menu from here you select planets and missions you check the market for weapons and warframes you customize your gear in the back of the ship you craft new weapons from materials you pick up in the game you select mods to put on your equipment or sell or even transmute them into better cards this is basically your own little hq  the good  variety of warframes each with their own abilities  huge variety of different weapons in all areas  good planet variety each with enviroments detailed to that specific area  decent level scaling higher level planets having tougher enemies and more variety  detailed graphics apart from one or two popins or missing textures though its very rare to find one  brilliant lore in the game even though it could be hard to finduse the wiki people  mods of all types to apply to your equipment allowing you a different variety of elemental attacks to use on various enemies and specializing for different scenarios  teamplay you will always find yourself playing in a squad of up to four though this isnt forced on you as you can play strictly with friends or completely solo  the bad  very repetitive the game involves a lot of going back to the same areas for grinding for credits and resources  controls can be difficult at first for new players though they should easily become used to them after tutorials and a few hours of gameplay  very grindy game youll need to work hard to get that specific gun you just bought for 20000 credits with 1000 salvage to craft from  final verdict so i know i went easy on this game not a lot of bad and plenty of good but this is my own opinion and how i see the game yes the game is very grindy and it does have platinum in the game which you purchase with your own money to buy equipment instantly without having to craft it at the foundry although this is in the game i personally wouldnt say that this game is pay to win because you can still get every single piece of equipment you can buy with plats though it will take some grinding to get to but itll be worth it even if you do choose to buy a piece of equipment with plats it gives you a little extra by giving you an extra slot for another weapon and putting an orokin reactor or cell in it which doubles your mod capacity personally i love this game its one of my most favorite games ever and will continue to be for the next few years the developers do amazing work and they can only make this game better than it already is they have a great community that they keep in touch with and the players and clans are just as amazing and theres no subscription fee for this all completely free for as long as you like so i definitely recommend at least checking this one out my final score is 910 the game is brilliant has a lot of future potential despite a few faults here and there if youre interested in finding out more id recommend checking out the wiki to learn more about this game or go on youtube and find some gameplay videos or tutorials to learn more about the mechanics of this game there is so much more about this game that i cant fit into detail here things such as companions syndicates relays bosses units types clans dojos levelling though i guess i must leave something to the discovery i hope to see you all on the battlefield soon have a nice day

warframe or as we call it ninjasliding simulator 2014 is a great game visually its absolutely amazing and the art style is very distinct with very identified personality between the factions the combat may be glitchy at times but it flows and shows a degree of freedom seldomly seen in other games movement is also very indepth wall runs slidejumps and they can all chain together so that you dont just run anymore you run slide jump land slide attack slide wall boost land with an almighty smash of your melee weapon by this time you commit these moves to muslce memory your left pinky would be substiantially strong than your right one so if you were plan to thumbwars with your pinky id highly recommend this game game play currently is very diverse with several game modes assisination or sabotage missions for those who enjoy hitman survival or defence missions for those who have nothing better to think about than shoot those dudes for 30 minutes boss fights for your inevitable grind for blueprints not to mention all the weapons and warframe you have once you get to the 400hr mark youd have more suits and accessories than a spoiledrotten 16 year old with her own creditcard the bad unfortunately being any hardcore tenno require a lot of grind as every weapon warframe needs to be grinded to level 30 and then repeat if you wish to formamake it better not to mention all the grinding for material needed to craft the weapons and these awesome suits of course it being a mmo grinding is tolerated and since i have 600 hrs in this game certainly entertaining enough the really bad money credits and orokin cells are easy enough to grind for but to get to the real end gameown everythang you need platinum certainly you can now sell blueprints and mods but thats very inefficient way to get plat so if you are willing to commit to the game dunk 50 bucks in the game during a deal its well worth your time

suddenly a very high quality f2p game the coop size for 4 people as has long been the actual start you have to shoot the enemies of the crowd whether robots or mutants the game has a great variety of missions there is a pumping system with those experiences not only gets the character for whom you play and weapons that you fight interesting system improvements the visual part of the game is full of colors and effects lots of explosions lots of glowing stuff all very nice it should say that the game is not pvp pve only can in the future it will be in the game and well until  the battle against hordes of mutants ps i almost forgot in the game at first do not understand what they want from you in a mission where to go and who to shoot but eventually everything falls into place sorry for my english    f2p    4

introduction this is a dungeoninstances based action third person mmo kinda like vindictus dragon nest etc i have 1k hours and i play this since cbt which was way before it came to steam i can say for sure i gave this game my time and hopes for get a good experience as the game gets made on the go i really wanna write a wall of text explaining why this game is soo good and why is kinda bad at the same time but lets be honest here nobody likes to read now days so ill try to keep it short starting with the good and bad things but if you feel like reading bit more please do so good and bad things new content every week developers that are close to the community not real paying restrictions that will fck up your enjoyment nice graphics theyre nice not mind blowing but nice great amountvariety of characters with their unique set of skills cool upgrade systems with mods that look like 3d cards which you can add to your character weapons pets etc well set up in depth and immersive enviroments variety of missions it gets repetitive yes even though it does has several game modes maps and lots of content long period of wait time for build craft each thing in the game and you will be doing that a lot we talking from 12h to 72h of wait time these can be rushed with in game currency but you dont wanna be doing that with every thing you build so it is definetly a downside glitchy and buggy at times plus cam angle will be a total mess if you downside your aim in close to any in game model npcother players will turn into giant monsters if you do so hahaha and i doubt they ever fix this lag yes this game will lag if you get paired with a bad host you can fix this by putting pingregion restriction but keep in mind this is a f2p most people playing will be people with not great internet connections and if you put restrictions you will find yourself playing alone most of the time broken pvp as this was never meant to be a pvp game devs put it almost by force by high demand from the community and believe me you wanna stay out of that and stick to pve experience it gets grindy at times mainly toward 60 hours when you start farming for new mods and weapon parts etc you can get these by trade but the most rare ones will requiere almost an equal item rarity or platinum for make the trade happen also for rank level up your stuffs will need several time of grindy missions for get it done no matter how many game modes they add into the game for get the stuff level up fast you will often find yourself playing the same game modes survival and defense a short txt of what you should know the game started to be a very early beta more alpha like with only 1 map type and the overall game was barely 2gigs size now after 2 years i think the game is 10 gigs and that fact should give you an idea of how much content the developers put into the game ever since it was released the game gets weekly updates most of the time every wednesday and is just a new weapon skin or some random thing but you can be sure new content will arrieve every week for major content update these come every 2 to 3 months and normaly its a huge update that will change the entire game experience unfortunally so far the core gameplay its still the same and grindy i highly doubt they can improve that no matter what crazy content they add into the game the so called f2p restrictions as almost every f2p they need to make some money out of you and unfortunally is not just costume or skins they have a system in the game that went worst over time this system is that will requiere certain amount of time to build craft every new weapons warframes heroes you play with almost anything will requiere at least 12 hour to build but if you do decide you can rush the build time instantly if you use platinum in game currency that you can acquire by paying real money or by doing trade with other players it is not a huge downside but it is something to keep in mind as you wont really see it when you start playing and more when you get at least 20 to 40 hours in the game other restrictions that you will notice right when get into the game is that you will need platinum once again for buy warframe slots weapon slots petsand almost everything will always requiere a slot that you will need to buy these are cheap tho 20p warframe and just 12 for the rest you can get 75p for 5$ also once again you can get plat by trading with other players overall and all i give a thumbs up because i did had my fair fun time with the game and i do really recommend it but keep it casual this is not a game you wanna put 100s of hours in as it will get repetitive and boring fairly quickly the small restrictions are a bit of pain in the  but is not that bad is playable enjoyable but i feel the need to say that these restrictions will get worst over time so if i was you i would play this casually if you put the time in it which i already stated that you should not do so you could have a truly full free to play game have fun

warframe is a free to play coop or solo third person shooter this game obviously had a lot of work put into it which is why i do not understand why it is free it has outstanding graphics even on the lowest setting however this game in some aspects has a pay to win feel to it to be able to get new items and characters in which they call warframes you can either buy them with real life money or invest immense amounts of hours into the game to get them which isnt that bad at all because the game is really fun the gameplay is terrific and the given ability to free roam each individual map is superlative each map has different objectives environments and climates whether its to the inside of an enemy ship a snowy mountain or some abnormal planet if youre looking for a new game to play thats free and not to mention fun then warframe is most definitely the game for you if you heard any previous bad reviews about this game just remember it has improved a lot since its release date back in march

i played a bit in closed beta then came back around the time nova was released i put a lot of time and money into this game i like the game but i cant really recommend it to other people the majority of the game is spent redoing really similar missions to level up your weapons and warframes so that you can have enough money to buy more weapons and warframes so you can grind those up to get even more weapons and warframes and thats only if you want to use half of a weapon to unlock a weapon or frames fullish potential you need to install orokin catalysts or reactors that double the amount of mod points the weapon has the recepies are pretty rare too you can get one from a daily log in reward but the chance is  poor the lack of free orokin catalystsreactors has been dubbed the great potato famine since theyre shaped like potatoes to get the actual full potential of a weapon you need to potato it and get these things called formas which add polarities to mod slots if you put a mod with a matching polarity the symbol in the top right corner it costs half the usual amount of mod points the thing about formas though is that they reset the level of your weapon to 1 each time you use one and can only be applied to weapons at level 30 warframes themselves can also be potatoed and formad which resets their levels as well so what do you get for grinding up all of these warframes and weapons nothing you go out and find more weapons and frames to grind that is the entire game there are so many weapons and frames to grind that youll spend the better part of 1000 hours to level up most of them just for them to add more to grind but theres nothing beyond that all of the updates are essentially you can now grind in this new tile set or you can now grind in this new warframe all of this considered i loved the game i loved my clan warbros number 1 i loved the atmosphere the grind just became too big to handle de is an alright company with a rather extreme fanbase who will behead you or in certain cases ban you for complaining about anything thats wrong with the game you think the loot drops are too rare just farm more a warframe underpowered theyre fixing it lack of anything to do other than grind this game isnt grindy youre just a troll this game is perfect you can still like something and acknowledge its flaws please calm down shills if you do decide to delve into this world id heavily suggest ignoring as much of the playerbase as you can bring in a group of friends start your own clan and do missions with them that is in my opinion the best way to play the game

nice graphics and a highscifi ske story the shooting is not bad nor decent the maps are too large ans shameish and all are the same metalwall corridors with too rare exceptions but is a nice game what make it nice is some adictiviness to unlock stuff how easy is to go somewhere and shot things and the diabloske mania of collecting upgrades a mix of diablo and some japanese nightmare

ive been playing this game nonstop for the past few weeks its a great game although i feel that there isnt a lot of story or plot there is however a nice backstorylore and a unique setting the game allows you to customize your character to an extent and has a large selection of weapons and warframes to suit ones playstyle in the beginning the game felt very pay2play everything i wanted at that point costed platinumpremium currency and wasnt available until i progressed further and it required what i assumed to be heavy grinding but now having progressed much further ive found that most things could be acquired with just time and patience and the only things that truly required platinum were cosmetics and bundles and platinum is a tradable currency so if you really want x that costs y platinum you could make platinum by trading with other players but is the game fun yes its loads of fun the gameplay is relatively unique progression freels rewarding and it looks great updates are pulled out quickly fixes are adminstered hastily overall its a very refined game especially one thats in beta

does being a space ninja saving the universe from vile technology oppressive tyranny and malicious infestation with guns swords and other implements to destroy bad things sound interesting to you even if it doesnt this is an awesome example of how to do free to play even though most of the maps are randomly generated sets of similar rooms once you start getting better equipment youll start to ignore and possibly enjoy that you know the way through the different rooms you can access nearly everything without spending actual money instead only having to spend time finding resources in missions and waiting for them to build once youve got the parts you need if you feel like supporting the developers and getting something sooner you can buy platinum real world currency equivalent and get things straight away also only buy that stuff through the games official site steams packs of dlc are overpriced unless on deep sale there are also discounts you can get through ingame login rewards ranging from 20%75% off platinum so wait for that if possible now get in here and help me get potatoes would you kindly

verry fun game and can be verry adicting this game has a long learning curve but when you got the basics there is always something to do always 1 more mission to play 1 more thing to craft 1 more resource needed to find all these things add up in the big picture and make warframe much bigger then it seems to players its not your typical free to play game or pay to win game no you can do all free theres no advantage in paying its super fun for me and my friends with who i have spent in this games are numerous days several h a day and we never got bored we only runed out of energy to play the game and was super fun to yell at each other to help him and not to run away from reviving a budy  arround and all that cool stuff there are numerous guns from mashine guns to shotguns from pistols to laser riflesyou play on planets arround the solar system and in each planet there are multiple missions in wich you can unlock mods to upgrade your warframe character and guns those are called mod cards wich are randomly droped by enemys or boses each warframe or gun has a lvling system from 130 leveling a warframe makes him to have more shields hp armor etc but with mod cards you can upgrade him the most you like him to be bore tanky or to dish out damage its all up to you theres a clan dojo where you and you clan buddys can go and build structures like power plant and reserch facilities in reserch facilities you can reserch new guns mostly that enemys use can reserch warframes but all that takes multiple day resech time there are game events in wich players allways kinda keep their aye on the game to see if there is a alert mission in wich can be droped a mod card they want or a accesorie item they want for a warframe wich can be bought only by real money but with alerts can get them free anything is posible when you play like a true ninja warior my score for the game is 9510 game worth a try not your 2h bot it deserves more then that

played warframe with a few friends earlier today we all agreed while its great for a free to play game containing some beautiful graphical work some interesting game mechanics and good controller support it gets tedious very quickly and nothing really makes it stand apart from a failed thirdperson action game like too human unfortunately its also quite a tough game to get a grip of as it contains lack of explaination about how certain aspects of upgrading and customising a character work regardless id recommend giving it a bash its a good bit of fun at first but nothing i can see myself playing in the long term and spending money on

warframe is a great game its a pve where people actually use teamwork its f2p and almoast all of the items that can be bought with real money can also be crafted by getting ingame resources and credits the graphics are great and so is the gameplay its a really fun game the devs are great and actually listen to the players on their forums if theres a bug you report it and they fix it in the next update in short warframe is a great pve teamwork game also dont forget ninjas play free

digital extremes crafted an amazing freetoplay thirdperson hybrid actionshooter in warframe technically the game is just a more polished up version of their 2008 outing dark sector but the polish has turned the game into something for the ages making it one of the most badass freetoplay games on the market right now the game originally launched last year to little fanfare but managed to grow a strong community based on the games infectious lore and equally infectious gameplay basically the story revolves around an ancient race of space ninjas known as the tenno who must serve and protect the interests of the galaxy from various overlords amassing their forces in the hostile alien races known as the grineer and the corpus simply enough players in the role of the tenno must don their warframe bioskins yes the warframes grow on the tenno like skin and sabotage destroy and disrupt the forces of the corups and grineer the very basic plot outline sounds like typical mmo fanfare but my goodness does it work and work well mostly because its set against the motif of spaceronin without proper masters doing all that they can to save the galaxy the game starts when the excalibur tenno is freed from his chamber while grineer forces are trying to collect and breed their own warframes from the tenno race and thats where players hop in and start kicking butt and taking names the actual tutorial stage is short sweet and simple and doesnt even begin to tackle some of the more complex elements of the game so how complex is the game well the story is barebones the dialogue is simple and the quests are all mostly repetitive and circulate around the same formula what makes warframe so complex and so badass is that the gameplay is just ballstothewalls awesome you can wallrun which isnt anything new you can climb up anything you can reach you can backflip off anything solid and you can shoot dodge like nobodys business the game also has a variety of melee weapons that offer very very very different styles of play for instance using the dualbladed poleax is nothing like using a long blade or dual daggers or boxing the crap out of enemies with modified armored hands each melee weapon requires a completely different approach to the gameplay thats rarely seen in many games the attention to detail in the combat is one of those added reasons why digital extremes freetoplay shooter is so addictive and yet so versatile in its approach to a tried and true gameplay format the above example isnt even a remote exaggeration but more like an underrepresentation for some of the absolutely megabadass things you can pull off in the game its insane the game also has a variety of melee weapons that offer very very very different styles of play for instance using the dualbladed poleax is nothing like using a long blade or dual daggers or boxing the crap out of enemies with modified armored hands each melee weapon requires a completely different approach to the gameplay thats rarely seen in many games the attention to detail in the combat is one of those added reasons why digital extremes freetoplay shooter is so addictive and yet so versatile in its approach to a tried and true gameplay format but it doesnt end there you can combine your melee combat with seamless transitions into special powers and abilities on a whim even more than that you can transition from your powers and abilities or melee combat into shooting with your primary or secondary weapons with ease for example you can run across the side of a wall jump off split an enemy right down the middle with a sword literally split them down the middle mortal kombatstyle and then do a sideways flip and land a headshot while in midair blowing the brains clean out of another enemy and yes you can see the brain particles fly if the graphics are turned up enough and did i happen to mention you can customize your weapon stats affixes and abilities like a micromanaging rpg fanatic well you can you want to freeze enemies with every pistol shot no prob how about combine fire and ice together along with electrical damage so that they burn freeze and then convulse on the ground in a single swipe from your warhammer sure can do increased critical damage for fastasafly instant kill headshots done and done while the game is as grindy as a butcher factory the fact that the gameplay is fun more than makes up for it even more than this all that fancyschmancy matrixstyle spaceninja stuff you can pull off isnt done to the effect of boredom the games difficulty scales like a crazy mofo instead of choosing a difficulty the planets themselves work as the difficulty factor  the further out into the solar system you go the harder it gets the best part about warframes difficulty is that the game isnt artificially difficult yeah a lot of you know exactly what i mean saints row call of duty mercenaries just cause and uncharted are prime culprits of having difficulty that scales artificially and by that i mean that the ai isnt smarter its just more of them standing around and shooting incessantly without missing its a copout on difficulty in warframe the ai takes cover calls for reinforcements uses ship panels to lockdown areas or suppress players its difficulty done right and forces players to adapt cooperatively and get out of a situation using both skill and intelligence again its difficulty done right and this is just another reason why warframe is so badass after fixing some of the mod cards balancing some of the warframes themselves and expanding the universe the game has come a long way since launch and offers players a really unique freetoplay experience thats hard to find anywhere else maiet will have their work cut out for them in gunz 2 this review was

pleasantly addictive game with human mutated space ninjas 1st time i tried warframe was almost 2 years ago i guess  its was approximately 900mb big didnt played much that time because it became quite repetative and visually boring pretty soon i downloaded it again 3 weeks ago almost 10gb and i cant even describe the huge improvement audio graphics level desingvariety everything while there are still some bugs i didnt encounter one that would discouraged me from playing fair business model which dont force you pay at all what can be little annoying are frameweapon slots but either that can be obtained by earning platinium from marked i got myself little more than 200 platinium which is equal to 15 usd by selling rare stuff to community if you dont mind grind i highly recommend this game 7510 if you play alone 910 with friends for free 2 play game

warframe is a very fun game with space guns space ninjas and space bad guys oh and spacebadassery once you start playing its hard to quit having login rewards really keeps you going the one drawback is when youre just starting your weapons dont do much damage anymore even though theyre maxed damage but you can use all your hard work to buy blueprints of weapons and build them the boltor is very good to start with too this game is very fun with friends and a group of 4 people with a wide range of game modes and modifications for your warframe and weapons theres even lots of secrets and lots of hidden lore i hope people enjoy the game like i have

you know what within a monthpossibly even a few weeks i sunk over a hundred hours into this game and i would like to say those are the best hundred hours ive had in awhile first of all there will be grindingfarming this game kinda works like that i understand not everyone has the patience to well grind for a certain itemsin the newest update kubrow eggs will be your worst nightmare in farming unless rng is on your side then i hate you but i do think its worth while because it gives you that feeling of progress towards what you want and that feels pretty good second there are microtransactions but they are not needed you will only need them when you want to fully buyrush something want to but additional accersoriescolor packs armor etc and when you want to trade for certain items i must say this game handles microtransactions very well as long as you dont spend it too fast like two of my friends which i will not metion either of them third this game will sometimes require some sort of teamwork like other people to help you i used to think you can fully beat the game all by yourself until a certain entity called the stalker absolutly whopped my  then i realized i need a team to play with im not sure if you can fully solo the game from the beggining but if you can id be happy to know last of all its just fun to explore every weapon and warframe in the game i mean when i first built a warframe that had the ability to stop all damage coming to her bring out energy claws to rip people up and gain her health back i was damn well surprised and i still enjoy the warframe up to date i recommend this game to anyone who is interested in rpg like elements and a game that you and your friends could enjoy i mean who doesnt enjoy being a space ninja cutting people in half shootting people up and jumping all over the place i enjoy it immensely

ive been a part of this game since the closed beta ive seen a ton of changes and dont let steam fool you ive logged in more than 400 hours on this baby right here you play as a tenno a master of the warframe armor the universe is set years and years after dark sector de confirmed that hayden tenno was indeed the og tenno where the tenno are at war with 2 factions the corpus and the grineer both of which are at war with each other and the result is an imbalance in the system which the tenno are tasked with balancing there is a fourth faction the sentient infected the technocyte ravaged beings twisted into monsters after years of dividing and acquiring biomass they pose a threat to everyone in the universe the game itself has quite a learning curve but the community makes it so easy to learn there are a ton of events and rare items as well as alert missions that allow you to take certain rare items or platinum items that you could buy ingame with microtransactions but the game allows you to get them for free you dont need to spend unless you want to prime frames are the same you grind for them to get em for free i personally spent money into this game and am a founder and have not regretted spending money on this game it has given me so much fun and joy and i just love being a space ninja 1010 easily one of the best games i have ever played

before i get on with the review id like to say that my opinion on this game in particular is sort of mixed but leans more toward the recommended side so just keep that in mind as you read with that out of the way here we go warframe is a pve coop multiplayer online third person shooter that brings in elements of a variety of different games and genres that make up its gameplay as a whole there are similarities to hack and slash rpg and stealthespionage though the stealth aspect is rather lacking and more of something thats just there rather than something that is a large focus all in all the game can tend to feel like the developers of dynasty warriors mirrors edge mass effect and any mmorpg game you prefer to imagine got together and said lets make a game then occasionally went to the devs of ghost recon assassins creed and hitman for small suggestions on stealth here and there but is the game fun is it original i can honestly say yes to both i cant say ive seen another game that was exactly like this and the experience is definitely an enjoyable one possibly the greatest part about it is that you dont have to pay a penny for anything in the game save for aesthetic items and slots for warframes and weapons but theres an alternative for that too  its called trading however whether or not i recommend this game for you depends on whether or not you have a few friends you would be playing it with on a regular basis if you dont then let me be the first to tell you that youre going to get very bored very quickly if you do then by all means you could have as many hours as i do if not more why is this you might ask warframe is set up in such a way that the gear isnt ranked at all theres no weapon nor frame that is part of the pro gear that you work up to aside from primed items primed items are your endgame and theyre a pretty easy endgame to reach rather than a long time spent visiting new areas and slowly working your way up to the cool stuff your starter character alone can be modded correctly to take on the void decently if you know how to use it most planets dont have their own tilesets and theres only four families of enemies the grineer the corpus the infested and the corrupted the corrupted of which are limited to the void only and infested only appear during certain quests specific invasion types dark sectors and derelictseris meaning that youll really only be seeing the grineer and corpus frequently unless you do void runs all the time or choose to go to erisderelictsdark sectorsinvasions to fight infested however once you reach endgame which is the void which doesnt take long at all to get to you wont be seeing the infested grineer or corpus all that much because the void is where youll almost always be trying to get prime gear andor credits since the void offers the most credits per run out of any other area in the game from then on its just a matter of first getting a decent set of gear you can use and learning how to properly mod it to get a viable build for surviving t3t4 void once you can do that its just a matter of grinding the void over and over again to get the parts you need for primed gear which all lies in the hands of rng  you go through rng on the regular worlds to get keys for the void and then you go through rng in the void to [hopefully] get the parts you need for the item youre trying to get note that on some runs you may not get a part at all and instead get a forma blueprint or maybe 5 fusion cores because thats definitely what you wanted but once you have your primed gear youll bask in the glory of having such items and begin grinding to get more of them  until that is you ask yourself the question that ruins the game as a whole why all thats left for you is making yourself op so you can do the same things youve been doing with more efficiency so you can get more gear to grind more with there is no content youre working towards there is nothing else youre actually accomplishing other than getting more toys to play with and youre going through heavy amounts of grind to get them all of this can be ignored if youre playing this with your friends as its definitely a fun coop game but if youre hoping to find something to just do by yourself in your free time youll get burned out fast warframe also however features a pvp mode that was recently enhanced however this new pvp leaves a lot to be desired will it be enhanced in the future maybe but honestly the devs will and should be more worried about the main game than the pvp meaning itll be much like the archwing mode in the game  a decent concept that does add more to the game but it has no impact on the main game whatsoever is lackluster compared to the main game and theres little to no incentive to actually do it how is it lackluster well for starters the weapons and frames youre allowed to use in pvp were carefully handselected by the devs and worked specifically for the pvp yet there is still a vast lacking of balance overall some weapons and frames are statistically superior to others limiting it all to an even tinier number of the tiny amount of things you can actually use add to this that the pvp only has around 4 maps and theres only one mode  ctf youre not awarded credits nor mods for doing any of this in fact you only get exp with the conclave if you wear the conclave sigil which exp with the conclave is used to get special mods  mods that can only be used in pvp theres also the new raid which is what de believes to be the answer to the lack of endgame it seems the raid is where 48 players join together to take on a much harder mission than what players normally face however unless you pleasure the idea of everyone spamming mics and some kid screaming at you for not being 100% perfect take my advice and avoid the raids like a plague so all in all a good game but the devs need to focus less on giving us more stuff to grind for and focus more on giving endgame players more content to enjoy less rng grind and overall providing more incentive to actually play the game another thing they should focus on is the quests in the game that provide a bit of story for the game as those are interesting but theres not even close to enough of them its to my understanding that all of this is planned to happen eventually but theres no telling when that will actually be i give warframe an 8510

ok im a new player of this game i just started right before the new ui update your ship that just came out a few weeks agoi have to say this is without a dought one of the best f2p out there at the momentthe game starts were you can pick out of 3 free tennosyou can get more tennos from the store for plat paid currency or you can farm them for free by buying the plans off the market for credits free currency you can get tenno parts and plans and weapons plans off boss fights and as login rewards and misson rewardsthe games game play is pretty much 3rd person action gamethink gears of war meets the pilot part of titanfall  the gfx are amazing has to be the best gfx i have seen in a f2pthe games controlls are spot on you can slide dash and run off walls and melee your target real fast and move very fluid back to your main weapon or side armas for the missons they do get repetitive but there is so much action that you dont seem to mind bigtime when your tenno and mods lvl up  there are a buch of diffrent mission modes are as follows > assassination  capture  conclave  deception  endlesswave defense  escape  exterminate  hijack interception  invasion solar rail  mobile defense  rescue  sabotage hive  spy  survival pvp  environmental hazards there is also mission alerts also this pay good credits and have gear and weapon plans at times you can make in your foundry  the game has solo play and squad based action of 4 players there is also settings for friends only and invite onlyso you can be social or anti social as you want its up to you  the real beauty of this game shines in the mods they are like cards you collect and lvl up and add to your tenno and weaponsthey can take a average tenno or weapon and make it superior as for the paying part of the game they have a good slection of prices and you really dont need to buy any unless you want stuff fast and dont feel like farming or want cosmetic addons for your gear and tennoi would recommend saving your plat or buy plat just for tenno spots20 plat and weapon inventory slots12 plat 2 slots  but if you are like me and dont mind spending on a few plat to help suppport a real good f2p by all means spend away   plat price packages range from $499 74 plat to $19999 4300 plat  rare card modsi give this game as a f2p a wopping 910 only reason i gave it a one point deduction is i think the prices in the store could be a tad cheaperbut all in all a darn good game so give it a shot if you are looking for a solid action game see you on the battle field tenno

warframe is a third person over the shoulder shooter with customizable options at first glance this game seems like it has it all upon closer inspection theres a few key elements missing for a quick first impression imagine the games destiny and halo having a child except they gave them a sword i have to give the game credit for putting jumping sprinting dodgingrolling as well as crouching into the game any game that puts basic movements in make it all the more enjoyable your weapons can be modified and changed as you please including armor but i cant help feel like im playing brink when using the guns in game its not necessarily bad but it can be bland at times they did provide a secondary handgun though which to me the more the merrier the game itself provides a good foundation for gameplay but if you are looking for over the top missions doesnt seem quite here it feels as though your running to point a to point b press this object then done onto the next place enemies sort of stand and shoot at you when you make your move they dont quite react to your movements or shots what was a good addition was the melee weapon or sword i feel like a bit more could have been done with it maybe allowing for more control but either than that youre mashing a single button to take a guy down it does however also have a double jump feature sort of or at least i think i did a back flip while running full blast at a wall and sometimes i jump twice as if i bounce off an obstacle when trying to climb ridges this game has quite a bit but just feels it can have so much more put that together with paying to get better stuff well that depends on which side of the microtransaction side youre on the games graphics are good and can ask a lot of your computer depending on what youre running i havent noticed any hiccups or glitches not even clipping as of yet the textures they used were nice but in dark scenarios i feel they could have added a bit more light the sound is good but can be bland to those looking for authentic qualities for a free game definitely not a bad choice rating  7310 it could have gotten a 8 easily with the addition of local coop and removal of micro transactions if they were to add vehicles and some sort of practicality to use airships that would have been greatly appreciated what you should know  there are micro transactions in game if this sort of thing pisses you off or you dont support it i wouldnt suggest downloading the game screenshots  what standard shooting looks like using a special attack using a standard melee attack view from the front of the menu ship

this is a top notch f2p 4 player coop shooter  platformer however if you and your friends are looking for a game with a solid story line and character development look some place else while the free running is tons of fun to master the levels are massive and the combat is fast pace and thrilling the game is without a doubt a grind get a mod level a mod get a frame level a frame get a gun level a gun there are tons of guns mods and frames to level but without a team of friends to do it with i could see the task being a bit daunting the levels you play in are huge but the maps are cooky cutter to say the least it can take ten minutes to make it to the escape passing one deja vu after another lots of detail and care went into some parts of the environment while others are dull and uninviting the free running is a blast so fluent and fun to play around with tough to pull off in combat but thats what keeps you trying it again and again unless you look up videos that show all that there is to learn it will take a long time to figure out all of the techniques the graphics are shiny and clean a fun game to look at and it is extremely well optimized the character models have great detail and the colors can be customized that is if you buy a color pallet the bards the weapons fall a bit short there are a ton to choose from but a lot of them feel very similar fortunately the melee weapons are a good balance with the guns each player can also have a sentinel that does a number of useful things attacking enemies and picking up loot items are examples all the weapons can be modified through a unique leveling and modding system that i have only seen in this game it works well but adds to the inescapable grind the combat is splendid there is a good variety to the enemies and a solid balancing system that can lead to easy pushover style fights and intense battles that have the players pushed to the edge at all times the free running plays a large role in the combat over all the game is the perfect addition to any group of friends looking to add another good coop shooter the their lists plenty to grind and plenty to uncover and discover i recommend buying some platinum in the being it can take a while to get going without it httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid221726417

more of a warfarm than a warframe i have become quite addicted to this free to play game most things are available in the game with out having to pay cash for it just requires a bit of farming to get only things that arent are warframe slots weapon slots and vanity stuff like scarfs and colours third person 4 player coop shooterhack and slash but of course if you are too lazy to farm stuff up you can always pay money for new frames and weapons too

grinding has never been so time consuming
recommended
albeit i do not play this game anymore i cannot do anything else but whole heartedly reccommend it it has been one of if not the my best f2p experiences with intense action a wide variety of characters weapons abilities and customization still expanding often even you hardly ever get bored plenty of clanhousing with many different options once again with loads of customization seriously the amount of customization in this game is friggin nuts the only bad thing is if you feel its becoming a grind so play it with people you think youd enjoy it with to increase the life of the game for you id probably give it a 810

honestly this is one of the best video games i have ever played if you are a fan of mass effect than you will have a great time with this game everything from the graphics to the market to the battle mechanics of the game are all well developed at first glance i saw that they provided a tutorial for this game which blew my mind away usually i have to figure out controls on my own with games but this game ensured that everyone will know the basic mechanics of the game and how to keep up with the players online
recommended
everything you once knew about this game has changed back when all of us tried it in beta this game was only ok it did get repetitive and eventually my wife and i quit recently ive come back to what seems to be one of the most expansive changes ever this game has me completely hooked in so many ways now base building pvp void key missions new frames new weapons etc everything can be earned with enough patience no money is needed to be spent though it does speed things up quite a bit

space the final frontier these are the voyages of the starship turbo pecs its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no tenno has gone before

extremely fun game good graphics and a whole lot of things to do pros replayability wide assortment of weapons very good graphics smooth controls cons new weapons that come out are usually a tad overpowered some very odd framerate issues lots of bugs but these are usually closer to the bethesda hilarious bugs rather than bugs that ruin your experience yeah try it out

absolutely horrible game compounded by horrible development team who has no clue what they are doing and dont need to be in charge of a game and horrible community managers who have no idea how to do their jobs the fact that i spent money on this game is something i regret deeply

shooting dismembering throwing evaporizing melting to name a few this are one but many things you can do to your unlucky enemies in warframe sure the game has its flaws the main one being the netcode of the game using twice as much pc resources when you host but with the newest patches it has been alleviated by a lot still needs some polishing and refreshing content to keep you hooked but its an incredible game with better graphics than the newest aaa titles definitly worth trying out and keep up to its growing array of content

one of the deepest shooters in recent times highlights include tons of interesting weapons challenging and entertaining gameplay awesome graphics good performance even on older computers like mine a friendly and helpful community solid and robust game mechanics and a store which isnt pay to win whats not to love im at 300 hours of gameplay and there are still a thousand things on my todo list to look forward to highly recommended

i havent played this game to much but i gotta say its really good warframe is a free to play space ninja game where you play as one of a couple of differenet characters called tenno its a 3d person shooter combined with hackn slash where you do some different missions against some different enemies for example the first one the grienear think i butcherd that for being a free to play it has very nice graphics but of course it comes then with some market stuff like buying money starter packs and those kinda stuff saying that it takes a long while to level to get money and to be able to buy anything there is some customasation where you can change colors on yourself as well as your weapons you seem to be able to craft different items aswell as getting some kind of drone to follow you around but im yet to experience that to settle that its a real fun game to play with your friends but you got to have patience a real must get if you need free to plays

ive never been a fan of free to play games on steam mostly because most are pay to win or pay to play seriously what is going on with all this garbage on steam nowadays anywho warframe is the exact opposite to be honest i wouldnt mind buying this game it is worth it mostly because of all the things you can do in this game you can craft weapons you can attach mods to your weapons change color buy weapons buy warframes and all that with credits in game items that buy things developers take notes the multiplayer is great as well if a mission is too hard to accomplish call a friend over it is more fun and easier for you as well i rate this game a 910 if you dont fancy buying games play this one it is worth it

warframes a game of grinding grinding to get better weapons frames and much more but in the end the games still in beta the game is constantly evolving for the better by adding new game modes new frames new weapons and new features which are sure to keep you busy for a good while

for a free to play game i honestly didnt have much hope in this yeah it had the cliche flashy trailer with great special effects etc etc but still we all know how free to play games are theyre almost always hooked up with that paytowin crap that everyone truthfully hates i must say after playing this game once with a few of my friends i was immediately hooked and still am to this moment enjoying the games graceful fluent and loose gameplay the mixture of freerunning with combat very unique weapons and lovely little original touches truthfully made the game quite graceful to me it doesnt overdramasize everything but at the same time it isnt exactly boring everything is nice balanced and even the community is fun i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a nice freetoplay experience and even recommend it to those willing to spend money with or without putting real life currency into the game itself doesnt change the joy of playing it in my honest opinion i joyfully give this game a 910

warframe warframe you strange beast youre repetitive and obnoxious but damn i love you i love you because the implications in your universe make me want to know how people live in that setting combat is a bit choppy but well done f2p is one of the better models aside from a waittoprogress gear and a few powerful frames being locked behind absurdly hardtounlockbosses updates have been both fleshing out the content and the universe actual languages given to the inhabitants unique bosses that are less reskins and more something that actually challenges well entertains at least when i left in 2012 warframe was spaceninjas with unique powers fighting nebulous empires with blandvoiced stormtroopers when i came back i returned to a fourway galatic war between a dogmatic corporate religion a militarist legion of recursive clones transhuman assassins struggling to retain their humanity and an infestation so virulent that it makes the former three point their guns at it in unity there needs to be some frickin books made about this game

in my opinion it is the best i play the game most of the time and this shows space ninjas rule the fact that the story is straight and forward save the solar system from evil aliens the tenno are called to do the job and fight of waves of grineer etc and rescue other tenno to save our solar system spoiler alert play the game to find out more and other wounderful content it has like warframestenno weapons sentinals pets dojos remember tenno are ninja your very own ship its insanely awsome play the game and remember ninja play free

in warframe you play as a tenno a member of a species of ancient warriors that have reemerged to lay waste to the various nefarious species populating the solar system your foes include the grineer a jackbooted army of deteriorating humanoid clones the corpus a mixandmatch crew of robotic and human parts and the infestation a bunch of shambling organic creatures that vaguely resemble the flood from the halo series while your enemies are visually uninteresting a lot of the tenno suits and weapons have a great sense of style that imbues warframe with a spark of personality each species has a cursory backstory and there is some lore to be found buried in the menus but theres no narrative thrust or intrigue to speak of and so you run mission after mission moving outward from the sun as you level up your loadout and become a more proficient killerthe core combat of warframe is straightforward this is a thirdperson action game in which you wield two primary weapons and a melee weapon against foes who are largely content to come right at you you also gain suit powers that allow you to dash and slash through a bunch of enemies or stun all foes within a certain radius though these abilities can change drastically depending on what suit you equip you could unleash fiery maelstroms turn invisible create a decoy use teleportation to switch places with an enemy or manipulate your foes to fight against their allies acquiring new suits however requires a significant investment of time or moneyregardless of what powers you have equipped you can often wage effective war against your enemies by firing on them from a distance then slicing up the ones who manage to get close this tactic grows tiresome after a while however and doesnt serve you well as you take on tougher levels fortunately you can combine your ability to jump sprint and crouch into an acrobatic array of slides flips jump kicks wall runs leaping slashes and more though theres a certain rigidity to your movement your mobility is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about warframe and its fun to zip around your enemies slashing and shooting until the only ones left standing are your fellow tennoyou can run warframe missions with up to three other players and while flying solo is definitely possible in the early going or when youre grinding for experience or resources teaming up becomes necessary as you tackle tougher missions ighting your way through fiendish hordes with the help of some allies can be very satisfying especially when theres a good mix of powers in play coordinating with friends is the best way to get this kind of experience because jumping into matches or having folks join you can lead to lopsided situationsif theres a gap in player level or a mismatch with the mission challenge as often happens your cooperative missions can devolve into allout sprints as players easily cut their way through enemies they far outclassto minimize such gaps you can focus on playing only new missions since those tend to scale toward the upper bound of your capabilities to spice things up you may want to acquire a new gun a new melee weapon or a new suit warframe is free to play but you must spend either time or money to acquire new items currently new suits range roughly from $5 to $25 with new weapons falling close to the lower end of that spectrum alternatively you can purchase blueprints to craft new weapons and suits using ingame currency it takes a significant amount of time to save up the money for a new blueprint and then you must spend even more time acquiring the resources to actually craft iteven if you skip the lengthy crafting process by using realworld currency you still have to spend time leveling up your new gear jumping into a highlevel mission with a brandnew suit is a death sentence so its back to lower levels to grind for experience as your gear levels up you gain more slots to modify it using boosters picked up during combat adding abilities to suits improving the attributes of your gear and imbuing your weapon with elemental damage are just some of the things mods can do unfortunately the system to apply and improve mods is poorly laid out and barely explained leaving you on your own to figure things outsome problematic menus pale in comparison to warframes real problem a pervasive tendency toward repetition whether youre forging ahead with a highlevel suit or leveling up a new one warframe repeats enemies environments and scenarios too frequently without new challenges for your combat abilities the excitement soon dries up leaving you without a compelling reason to keep playingas it is now warframes interesting combat mechanics are too quickly overcome by the grind of repetition

playing this game is a must if you like third person shooters and parkour its just perfect in everything the developers are very nice people the game is completely balanced as a f2p game with real currencyie platinum which you can get for real money or during giveaways graphics are stunning gameplay is great ofcourse there are some bugs also theres not a single thing such as if you want to kill everyone in a few seconds buy this premium status and buy all the op guns that you can only get for real money unlike in most of the other f2p mmo games you can get every single weapon that is in the game just by playing you can suggest things to be added into the game as wellyou can do that on their forum this game is in good hands therefore it is good itself aswell i have to tell i barely ever make reviews and if i do  its either a perfectly done game or a terrible one this one was worth the time i spent typing this l

you play as a space ninja in a robot suit fighting genetically defected space nazis apples future products and zombies you have a huge arsenal of weapons to slaughter these enemies with ranging from assault rifles to chainsaw whips and even more you also have unqiue warframes classes to choose from ranging from jack sparrow to a dragon the downside to this game is that youll need to spend hours grinding for resources to build things or getting mods to help you slaughter stuff all together its a really good game if you can get around hours of grinding build times average build time is 12 hours per weapon and losing your friends overall 88 m8

been playing since the first beta heres a small review off the top of my head pros  free to play  beautiful  fast action  fun coop  friendly community  diverse missions  crafting  deep character customization  frequent new content  ability to get any weapon or warframe you want without paying real money  item trading system  space ninjas cons  repetitive combat akin to a dungeon crawler or beatemup  very grind heavy to aquire specific items summary great game and would gladly pay around $50 just for the game itself but its already free to play

who do you want to play with solo pvp public or friendsonly coop pick your poison what does the game offer a shooter with satisfying and unique ranged and melee options powers and customization how do you want to play choose from a healthy selection of customizable classes weapons and aesthetics why would you want to play cyborg parkour space ninjas with superpowers and guns i had a longing in my heart for a good new shooter until i was introduced to this still new to it and absolutely loving it cannot recommend this enough its a ton of fun solo with or against friends if nothing else convinces you to at least give it a go its free free is good

interesting nonstandard cooperative shooter
recommended
a third person action shooter with a high pace of speed at least in public games with randoms that uses gear levelling as progress as well as its endgame the game is the endgame basically the crafting system provides you with said gear while the business model allows you to skip this tedium by purchasing the items directly instead of crafting that said some of these can not be bought and in general require thorough effort to acquire the visual quality and other effects basically scream triple a while new events often keeps the playerbase interested many of these events are in fact previews to an upcoming permant feature that eventually gets added to coincide with weaponry being the only way to progress or level the developers churn out a steady stream of new weaponry and warframes at frequent intervals ready for you to directly buy acquire a blueprint of to build or research in a clan dojo lab warframes are combat suits with each one differing from the other primarily in their defensive stats as well as their four skills across this review i refer to them as weapons as well everything that can be leveled can also be modded this is done through a card system with every weapon having a limited amount of slots to have a card fitted in these range from positively boosting stats to adding elements if the element wasnt already present such as fire ice shock or poison in case of warframes these elemental additions are replaced with mod cards that represent their innate skills these need to be fitted in in order to make use of said powers these cards can be leveled using mod cores so that the stats they influence are affected more greatly but requiring more mod points in return with weapons having a mod point ceiling a mod can still be put in a slot with a fitting polarity to halven their mod point requirement these polarities can be added on a maxed weapon using forma which in return brings the weapon back to unleveled the main complaint with the game is that the developers seem to nerf and buff willynilly often noticing how a new weapon becomes insanely overpowered or turns out to be painstakingly underpowered in a way they hadnt foreseen the addition of damage 20 which makes maintaining optimal stats and damages more complicated seems to have largely alleviated this issue of balancing though it may still happen the aforementioned events are the main source of story andor lore for the game these progress the warframe story in a way that never limits the current availability of features but rather adds features such as a invasionconflict of one enemy faction invading another enemy allowing the tenno the players to support one faction and eliminate the other one on said mission node these fights are constantly tallied and balanced out in a figurative tug of war with the victorious faction taking claim of the node where future missions will involve said faction warframe mainly shines in the satisfaction in both creating and levelling your weaponry allowing you to perfect your builds using forma keeping the player interested with the occasional new weapon or event

warframe one of the best games ive ever played and its free to play baby story isnt much of one but you control a faction in the future known as the tenno you build a warframe certain type of tenno then go ahead and kill some other factions that are bad in the end you must continue fighting through the planets in the milky way earth jupiter etc and upgrade your character boy i will get kill for saying this but itsits better than mass effect i said it and i mean it graphics are amazing it is truly the future in gaming graphics collecting mods is lots of fun tailored warframes to go with your playstyle theres like 30 of them go ahead and try one out guns glorious guns engaging and fun multiplayer clans clans join your friends and become the best one out there i dont even think theres a con to this game 1010 ive never rated a game this high

i never thought i would be so satisfied with being a space ninja but warframe brings excellent content phenominal mechanics a nice community smooth graphics and extraordinary gameplay although it falls behind with the p2w mechanics and repetive aspect it is worth the time to become immersed in the games crafting system to suit your needs to become an assassin a manipulator a crowd controller or even a class that slices and bursts through a mission i find this game much more satisfying after playing for about 9 hours when equipment ablilities and gameplay clearly improves for your warframe d

fans of mass effect 3 multiplayerblinkborderlands will enjoy this game pros many different warframes to choose from different weapons customization both combative and visual coop or solo play free to play but not pay to win ingame voip join in progress missions cons blueprints can be hard to come by the amount of customization can be staggering might have to grind to get materials for the blueprints you do have as with most f2p games there is a currency which you buy with real money this game has platinum you can use platinum to buy warframesweapons without having to build them
recommended
if you like coop shooters this is really worth giving a try i loved the multiplayer in mass effect 3 and for me this is very reminiscent of that game but with more options in mission types maps and character & weapon options be warned the character progression can be a little slow at first but really opens up after you collect enough credits blueprints and resources to start crafting in earnest just keep moving along with the missions youll have an generous number of warframe and weapon blueprints after you finish the missions on the first 45 planets id recommend staying in online mode as you can move through the missions more smoothly with a group and its more fun ive only rarely run into a badabusive player as the community for this game is surprisingly good dont spend you platinum real world cash on characters or weapons save your platinum for warframeweapon slots and maybe the orikin reactorcatalyst to upgrade mod points

this game has to be the most fun i have had with a game since call of duty world at war when i first saw it i expected it to be a runofthemill sort of pvp free to play game that is attempting to mirror the style of team fortress 2 a titan of f2p but i gave it a chance and boy was i wrong this cooperative space ninja game with outofthisworld graphics blew me away and i asked my friend that surely they would charge money for this but he said free forever forever fun the customization of this is astounding from various weapons colors materials and even warframes which are utilitzed as weapons too the game designers also implemented loot rooms in the more difficult void tilesets that require you to use your warframes ability to basically do parkour to go places where you typically wouldnt think personally it feels like if mirrors edge and team fortress 2 birthed a demigod of a child that had some awesome genetic mutations i currently have logged over a hundred hours and with the release of update 11 im predicting many more my rating 1010 for superb graphics engrossing gameplay and endless customization

 review as of update 11  the game is really fun and good its free to play so you cant complain about it the game can be played in singleplayer or with other peoplemax 4 in group playing with others makes the game more fun there is no vs in the game aside from some dueling areas these are optional though the rest of the game is coop parkour your way through the levels and find the secret locations on the levels they will mostly reward you with extra credits from lockers and such there are different planets and different factions there will be some repetitive rooms here and there that you will notice but the room layouts is always random clear all the levels and upgrade your weapons and warframes craft or buy more weapons and warframes when needed upgrades are done by levelling up the weapon or warframe to max level 30 for each level you will get a mod point with a mod point you can add mods you collect during the levels each mod adds something to the weaponwarframe for example fire damage higher crit rate more health ect mods can be upgraded to a certain level once you reached the max level of a weaponwarframe you can change the add or change a symbol of one of the mod slots but this will reset the weapon level back to 0 i will leave a link at the end of the warframe wikia there is a lot of content in the game that will keep you going for a while getting craftin matarials completing levels playing hardcore levels and go to the void which are harder areas but they repay you better there are 2 different kind of ingame currency thos are credits and platium credits you will get by completing levels or selling your stuff with the credits you are able to buy blueprints and stuff from the clan you joined platium is used to buy the weapons and warframes directly without any need of crafting them with a blueprint it saves a lot of time but platium can only be obtained by buying them with real money luckely you arent able to buy the best stuff there are better weapons and warframes obtainable in the game which requires you to play its hard to go into the details of the game its better to read a guide luckely they have an ingame tutorial in the game which explains you the basics the rest you have to figure out yourself reading a bit on the warframe wikia is usefull i did this a lot and i still use it here and there i would say you should definitely try out the game its free so what do you have to lose they are updating the game pretty often mostly fixes and small things but every 23 months they will release a big update check the game out grab some friends to play with and enjoy the game warframe wikia [warframewikiacom]

unfriendly to free players very friendly to people with alot of money to spend neat movement mechanics pretty to look at in some areas interesting upgrade system once you figure it out i have no memory of this placeis what you will never say because they reuse maps so often youll wonder why the game bothers to take place in an entire solar system instead of one single room melee is absolute trash it can only be used effectively by charging it but you cannot hold a charge so theres really no point in using it this wouldnt be such a big deal but the gunplay is horrible and not at all thought out it seems to have pulled right out of a dollar bin third person shooter which reminds me the enemies lack any variety and are all pretty much just bullet tanks dispatched in massive numbers purely to make up for how utterly stupid they are the game doesnt explain itself for crap one issue i keep finding is that im getting missions with level ranges like 1120 but i have no idea what level i am there are two systems which act like leveling one for your weapons and suits one forsomething but neither are called by that name or identified as being this level the game speaks of grind grind grind you do not put grinding in an action game what the hell were they thinking of course you can skip the grind if you lay down a fat stack the sad part is that many of the games problems are not even hard to fix simply making it a pvp game where two player sides fight for territory would make the game instantly worth playing but without that its hard to recommend because youll just waste your time mindlessly shooting at equally mindless enemies while flipping and sliding around to convince yourself you can find a new experience in the game

shooting things farming til you dry and graphic depends on your taste  35  5 in general warframe is a good game but there are some issues that could annoy you not every body suffer the same fate but i am one of the sufferer 1 how it likes gameplay is simple shooting slashing smashing a typical 3rd person shooting game with some decent ninja elements such as swordplay and wall jumping basicallyyou will doing the same thing shooting stuffs or smashing them over and over again however the game offers variety by there are so many different characters we call it a frame  and so many weapons to choose and most people often refers to a space ninja game so its a ninja doing stuffs in a space 2 fun part 21 variety everybody have the different fun part as i mentioned the game is nothing more but shoot or slash so what make you happy will be what frame you use and how you modified your frame each frames have different skills and stats which mean they can kill things differently you have to find what you like however there are some frames which is a must for everyone to have but you can collect so many frames at the same time and you can switch it between mission upon your need same idea with the weapons there are ton of them so the fun part is about trying it out how you like each frames or weapons but if you dont have funs with playing with different frames this game may not for you since the rest is about shooting things nothing special 22 free to play moreover the game is free to play so you can try it out any time 3 annoying part 31 graphic options for game graphic it is about how you like it because enable every options on graphic may not be the best for you you have to adjust it basically its nice but something is too real for game like this for example the motion blur its not fun when everything around you get blur when you turn around and shooting things 32 internet speed i know this may be about me but hey  im one of the player its about internet connection speed if you play with a people on a differnt region you could suffer a lag but not so much but still it is annoyting when you have a team but you are on different region and you cant play together very well 33 game development the game is on progress project so something in the game still can change at any moment but those are for improvement which is understandable but it could annoy you 34 community features lack of nongameplay features such as community features sending in game email to player auction houses something like that the game offers a chat room and a guild and you can do something in the guild however this is a multiplayer game a community feature is vital but everyone live like this for years  its ok but i feel like missing some features that the other games commonly have 35 farming as i mentioned the game offers you a veriety of frames and weapons but these things come from framing it and trust me sometime it takes forever hoever you can buy it using a few dollor so this could be an annoyting part but you can solve it using real money the choie is yours 4 give it a try try it if you like to modifying things if you love game where you can modify things the game is for you there are tons of things to collect and modify but the game play is simple and repeatitive so as i metioned the fun part is doing the same thing a different way

optimized for all computers  gamers one or cheaper its really good game where we can fight with our friends or alone different options for each missions stealth or not its the best scifi game ever  a lot of missions  planets but some mission are using same maps with some modifications and it still fun  a lot of heroes with specials abilities for each  1010 great job

ive spent far too much time and money on this game so i can say that its one of the best free to play games out there theyve managed to make it free to play without making it pay to win so props to digital extremes for that theres a huge variety of ways to play this game and there is no single best playstyle whether you like to stay unseen and pick off your enemies from a safe distance or you just want to get in your enemies faces whether you like to play coop or solo you can do all of it and all of it very well its gameplay is an absolute blast space ninjas are ing awesome its a bit of a work in progress and de periodically releases huge updates that greatly improve it i have few complaints about this game but it does have flaws the first one is an almost absolute lack of story it has a good introduction but then it just kind of throws you out to a solar system filled with seemingly outofplace boss battles some of which just seem a too hastily thrown together it also has numerous logical fallicies such as how its always snowing on venus my last complaint is that its pure grind you spend the whole game farming resources and leveling up your stuff so you can get better stuff if youre willing to overlook its flaws and are willing to accept it as a work in progress you will have a great time with this game
recommended
this game can be a pain when first starting off but gets greater and greater when some time has been put into it like if u get put with some people with prime everything they take over and u dont get any kills to level up your weps but u still get xp for letting your friends get the kills there are also many updates on warframe as well daily 7mb updates and each month a larger one that can be very painful for people with slower internet speeds like i when it comes to trading too many people are willing to sell than buy from others witch can can be frustrating just to sell a single piece or to trade for it but when u get up to the harder missions u can just find the part that your looking for on a hard planet in conclusion if u have a spare couple of gbs u should download it for the gameplay
recommended
this game is fun and i would call it exotic only because your thrashing on monsters from other planets the game starts as you have been captured and have to escape from the enemy overall the game is amazing and is worth the free price tag that they give it

fast pace game that can be difficult to learn but it wont take to long the game is fun with friends because you can all do a mission completely silent without someone you dont know comes in and ruins it besides its ninjas who could hate this game

its a great game whoever says its pay to win lies you dont have to spend any cent on the game and tbh you can get all the items without spending a single penny i did and i can do any mission on the game without problems only problem it has is that the end game might not be that great yet but it has plenty of updates and they care about players opinion and feedback also the community is great only drawback is the bugs but hey is beta and most of the time over 95% of the time works fine it has continous updates and events and also the alert system keeps you always busy archwing next patch looks awesome this game has great pontential and they wanna be sure to explore it its an awesome game and its free hope to meet you there

normally when you write a review for a game its a one and done sort of thing warframe however has surprised me because it has proven to evolve so quickly in the space of half a year warframe has transformed so drastically it has practically become a whole new game and the changes have only been good as always the graphics are impeccible but efficient despite the fact that warframe still insists it is a beta this game has more quality then many games ive played that are not betas while it still lacks its story mode and still lacks its endgame theres more than enough content to keep anyone occupied for quite awhile as most people probably already know warframe allows you to take control of a tenno basically a space ninja and from there you face off against legions of enemies using both melee and guns with more weapons and warframes then youll be likely to know what to do with achieving warframes overarching goal of mastering them all will alone tide you over for a long time some say warframe is grindy and it can be though it is only mildly grindy and it is becoming less grindy with each passing month the primary reason warframe is somewhat grindy at the moment and was even more grindy in the past is that warframe is always growing and evolving back in closed beta there was virtually no content there was one map and 3 mission types so you can imagine how grindy it felt to level up all the gear piece by piece mission by mission doing the same missions over and over but theyve added to the warframe experience since then now theres many more missions to do many more places to go many more things to kill and many many more toys to play with by toys i mean weapons and by play withwell you get it so sure the game still revolves around killing baddies with an awesome powersuit but theres just so much to kill and so many ways to do it the developers behind this game have proven time and time again that there is nothing that they feel is beyond the reach of this game the most recent example of their ambition being the archwing expansion for warframe in which the tenno added deep space flight to their already impressive list of abilities to sum up the gameplay of warframe it is an action packed diverse and highly unique experience with a broad difficulty curve warframe also offers an admirable monetization scheme among the fairest ive seen while warframe will accept money in exchance for almost anything warframe strives to allow players who are unable or unwilling to pay cash to still be able to have everything the paid players do whether its obtained via crafting rare drops secret locations or merely trading items for platinum with you can then use to buy what you want you wont find a single paywall in warframe not even where the costumes are concerned in short warframe is a triumph of both game design and proper execution of the f2p model as it continues to grow and evolve for another year if you havent played warframe i highly recommend that you do and if you have and for whatever reason thought it unremarkable then i would suggest that you try it againyou wont recognize it

free to play scifi with mass effect style combat detailed customization the good colors require real money everything is available to be crafted the most powerful items are only obtainable by crafting so this game isnt a pay to win mostlly pve missions but there is pvp cross platform play with players on play station 4 game gets updated every month with weapons maps and warframes characters very addicting coop

when someone presents you with a game that contains mutant gunslinging cyberpunk spaceninjas you should be willing to throw some money at it when that game is free you should frantically search for the nearest download button immediately warframe puts you in the twistedspaceshoes of a tenno who are basically known for their ability to shoot andor stab anything between them and their next objective the meat of the game revolves around picking a character picking your weapons then picking an area to use them in the levels themselves are tile based  meaning each level has a random bunch of rooms put together differently each time you play it you race through the levels with up to 3 other tenno killing bad guys and collecting loot on your way to complete each objective everything you collect can be used to build new characters weapons and more between missions each weapon is unique and vary greatly from one to the next as do the different characters who each have differing base stats and special abilities of course being a freetoplay game it has a realmoney store that uses the ingame platinum currency platinum is purchased and can be used for just about everything luckily since the game is primarily cooperative this benefits everyone and only serves to make your life a little easier for those of us who dont have bottomless pockets nearly everything can be built without the need for platinum with resources collected from each level admittedly this can be a grind for some of the more pricey items but never feels unreasonable with lots of great support from digital extremes and a $0 price tag there really arent many good reasons you shouldnt try warframe out and see all it has to offer

at first i thought that this game would require me to use real money to make it worthwhilebut the more ive playedthe more i realise that we dont need to spend any money at all to have fun in this gamei recommend this to everyne who wants to have fun without spending any money

this game is the definition of addiction warframe is highly addictive dont start or do i dont care

fast paced space ninja action love it so much getting some of the resources feels like a grind but overall the gameplay is great needs more level variety but they seem to add content at a regular pace so its okay free to play looks good and plays good no reason not to try it out
recommended
yes i highly recommend it it can get a bit repetative but it can still hold its own for a free game that is not pay to win after 1000 hours i can say that i will probably never leave this game the devs really listen to what the people are saying and have taken some huge steps to ensure that our needs are met that being said gameplay is better then ever and the weapon selection is now insanely large the grind is still there though you really need to add your face to it if you want to get all the big boy toys but hey if you are complaining about a little work for a lot of profit then be lazy and sit there and not get anything done

there is a reason why this is my all time favourite free2play game it is just badass i think i never had that much fun with a f2p game the game changed alot over the past 2 years and i think there is no f2p developer that is similar to digital extremes de has a very friendly and cool staff they do lots of livestreamsdeveloper streams they answer question and actually listen to the community the economy of warframe is really fair and you dont have to pay a single cent if you dont want to you can also earn the real money currency called platin by just trading with other players and selling them parts for weapons for an example this platin is used to buy skins colors gearslots and it can also be used to buy weapons or ressources but you really dont have to because you can get nearly everything by just playing the game there are a few exceptions but those exceptions cant be bought with platin either those are things from events or from the old founders packages if you do decide to buy platin then its worth to wait a bit because you get discounts from the login rewards from time to time and they go from 20% up to 75% meaning that you can basically buy a 180 platinpack for only 45 you also get alot for your money for an example in the platinpack for 18045 you get about 4300 platin a slot for a weapon or a warframe costs around 1020 platin skins or other visual things are at around 5075 platin you might need some platin if you decide to buy reactors or catalyst which are used to enhance a weapon or warframe those can be used one time on a weapon and cost both 20 platin but there are lots of events and i think one special mission each week where you can get one depending on how motivated you are this amount of platin could be enough for a looong time and you are also able to earn more by trading with players now a bit more to the game itself warframe is a coop multiplayer game that can be played alone or up to 4 other players you are basically a space ninja called tenno you are able to use all kinds of weapons either melee or ranged or even both combined machine guns swords lasers revolvers rocket launchers scythes axes there is nearly every weapontype you can think of and new content keeps getting released you are basically able to play the game however you want even though it might be a bit hard depending on your type of enemy in the first few hours of the game you will grind yourself through different kind of missions while following a questline the tutorials are pretty new and not really good at all but at least have some kind of tutorial now before that you had a little introduction and then it was basically gl hf now go every now and then you unlock a bossfight those bosses are a special kind of enemy and can be pretty hard especially for newer players they also have the possibility to drop blueprints or parts for new weapons or warframe every weapon and warframe etc that you cant just buy straight from the market needs to be build in the foundry the blueprints you need for that can be found on the market in clan dojos and their researchingstations in bossfights or in the void i will talk about the void later to build something you need to gather ressources or other parts for it first then it takes about 24h or 3x 12h  1x 36h for warframes to finish while playing the missions you will also find mods for your gear that is used to enhance it after a while you might have gathered some decent mods to upgrade your gear as soon as you are strong enough you want to enter the void or the orokin derelicts those are a special kind of missions and they are basically the endgame the strongest weapons and warframes can be found in the void while some of the most important mods are found in the orokin derelicts those are places with pretty tough enemies and maybe even deadly traps depending on the mission you choose you can get a wide variety of rewards besides your weapons you also have to level up your account itself its used to be able to use special kinds of weapons that require a specific level before you can use them to level your account you have to level your gear most people build and gather every piece of equipment and level them up to their max level to push their own accountlevel as high as its possible thats why most people try to collect every weapon as possible to level them up to their max the main focus of the game might be the collecting of gear and mods to level up and make ones equipment as powerful as possible if you dont mind spending lots of hours into farming ressources or equipment then i would totally recommend this game to you but even if you dont like farming stuff give it a few hours like 20 or so most people i know didnt really stopped to play after they got used to it if you are still unsure look at the amount of positive reviews and the average playtime of those people

warframe this is an peculiar little game what is so strange or not usual about it is that its focused a lot on gunplay and ability usage between players across more than 200 mission map tiles i will review this game by different mechanicsparts of the game with a rating system of 10 points and i will pull the average for the game oh and before you read forget the slogan this game is not even ninjathemed because the stealth elements and the overwhelming amount of brutal killing missions implies that the tenno arent even meant to be ninjas but instead somewhat samuraibased even the lore confirms that map tiles 3 out of 10 the map tiles in the game are really original and interesting as well as have a bit of an exploration however when it comes to variation between planets theyre a massive letdown what i mean is they dont fit the planets theyre on they dont offer any diversity by planet and overall they feel somewhat strictly limited example mercury is supposed to be this superscorched planet right next to the sun however the game doesnt offer any visuals on mercurys surface or the size of the sun when you are playing on mercury gun variation 9 out of 10 possibly one of the best things this game does right is the gun variation you get dozens of different guns normal versions and prime variants and all of them are equally exciting some are very weak with base damage but offer destructive critical damage or are simply awesome in basic damage but lack in critical or status damage its shy of a 10 because some guns just fall short of their value entirely and are pretty much useless modding 10 out of 10 this part of the game is simply awesomely executed and when i mean awesome is that no other game compares to this mechanic modding features mod cards that offer different upgrades for your weapon for your warframe for your sentinel or your pet kubrow space dog your builds are heavily dependent on which mod cards you apply for any piece of your equipment and if at least one card is wrong the entire build will not work as planned you can apply only 8 mod cards per piece of equipment and there is a power limit of 30 units the power used is determined by the value of the mod card power limit can be doubled by applying an orokin reactor on warframes sentinels and kubrows also known as a gold potato or an orokin catalyst applied on weapons also known as a blue potato warframes have aura slots which grant an additional passive boost for example energy regeneration or armor decrease for enemies and offer additional power limit boost depending on the mod slots polarity or the rank of your aura card warframe variation 10 out of 10 not a single warframe feels like a copy of another and that is something ive seen rarely in any other game for example you have the volt who is an electricitybased warframe and spits out electricity with high damage or you have mesa who is a gunslinger and focuses on gunplay and buffs damage and so on this is a great feat that the developers achieved and thats why it deserves 10 points customization 5 out of 10 its not too bad but it isnt anything to be proud of either customization in this game so limited and as a matter of fact ugly with issues that it barely deserves 5 points its only saving grace is the few sets of plates and syandanas like discount capes that make your warframes appear quite good the severe lack of any good or real decorations or greaves and gauntlets and stuff also makes me quite frustrated because i cant make damn near any warframe look good with the given accessories personally i want spartanivesque armor pieces perfectly crafted to fit any warframe like armored greaves chest sections gauntlets thigh armor and arm armor as well as shoulder pads with greater variation and such but my point stands this isnt the best part of warframe yet customization also falls short because you cant customize your guns to feature scopes underbarrel attachments silencers or heavier barrels flashlights which just happen to pop out of nowhere in dark missions or laser points parkour 6 out of 10 parkour in this game is just basic with vaulting wallrunning and wallclimbing without any other really awesome feats of physical conditioning and training and such what would perfectly suit warframe would be something taken out of the latest assassins creed games  the parkour mechanics that include different vaulting animations each time as well as enhanced wallclimbing with the ability to grab on to a ledge and hold on to it say for stealth or with the ability to scale high surfaces that would otherwise be unaccessible by typical wallclimbing as well as brand new map tiles to complement the enhanced wallclimbing mechanic and additional stealth features mission variation 3 out of 10 exterminate capture rescue spy deception defense mobile defense survival sabotage hijack hive assassination excavation interception what do they have in common with one another total unoriginality murderfest sure exterminate defense rescue hive and sabotage are the ones that fit with the overall murderfest theme but not the others the developers continuously say this game is based around ninjas shinobi for those japanese speakers that dont fully understand english but where is this ninjathemed game that weve been hoping to play i kind of dont see it at all there must be a total rework of all game modes stealth mechanics 2 out of 10 for a ninjabased game stealth is severely lacking in this game there are only two warframes that can achieve absolute ninjalevel stealth in this game ash and loki coupled with bows kunai and any melee the game is out for three years in development for far longer and the most trademarked asset of this game is possibly the worst mechanic out of every one in the game you cannot hide anywhere there is a severe lack of weapons with silent fire or better yet absolutely no silencers in the game so you literally have to rely on a melee weapon or pick a weapon that you might not be good with but want to play with your favorite one quests 7 out of 10 now the quests in warframe look cheap and they come out once a month even though it would probably take precisely six days to finish one of these quests at most that is not to say they are not entertaining as in fact they provide some replay value and an interesting change from the usually silent missions and offer a slight increase in overall dialogue and thats the quest saving grace however none of these quests really offer an explanation as to why and how you were bornmade and so on and instead they act as fillers or something even though the developers probably didnt want that archwing space sections 5 out of 10 archwings are a really annoying part of the game theyre like jetpacks with korean mmostyle wings which quite doesnt seem right in an ip like this it feels out of place on a massive level most of the players dont even like archwing as a matter of fact and consider it to be a massive shortcoming of warframe the most preferable replacement for the space sections would be starfighters with actual cannons missiles and afterburners instead of this but archwings are better than nothing the final rating  6 out of 10 warframe is still a game thats under heavy development lazy development at that but its a perfect filler game while you wait for some grander releases that might dwarf warframe and its community once and for all warframe isnt bad it isnt perfect and its a pretty much slightlyaboveaverage as a game for me but you can definitely play it

i must say the game is excellent in almost every way if u enjoy scifi action but if u have time to waste as well it wuld be the perfect game for u i may not have played as long as most but ive realised that this game is just a repetitive masterpiece u spend hours trying to new equipment only to find that there is even stronger ones coming out later which of cause u will and want and spend more hours farming to get it so if u got nothing to do anymore and enjoy scifi action i would recommend because i have to admit this is a good game

as a free to play game you cannot really complain about anything from the get go it is a high action runngun third person shooter incorporating parkour maveuverability and a variety of skills in order to dispose of the mass of enemies that come between you and your objective there are also a variety of game types enemies maps weapons abilitiesmods warframe suits and bosses and each of the maps though they use similar textures and areas are randomly generated per game the missions are seemingly endless with other 200 missions across a dozen or more planets although like every game there is a few cons that go against its pros for example it can get repetitive  especially replaying certain missions in order to get certain drops from that missions or having to level up your warframe or weapons in order to be able to advance to more difficult and challenging maps  though that is not as bad as it sounds as there are plenty of weapons warframes and abilities in order to build and switch up your character to change the way you play reduce the boredom of repition and that it has an item mall where you can buy things without having to struggle or earn them or that f2p players will be at a disadvantage of inventory space which is key to keeping your favourite and more powerful equipment whilst youre using equipment that you wish to level up my overall view of this game is that it a fun and expansive free to play game with endless amount of achievements to gain such as defeating ever boss conqeuring every planet completing every mission and collecting and leveling every piece of equipment theres also a great clan system thats rather complicated i will admit but its set up in a sort of rank fashion  and clans can also level up over time in order to build up your clan dojo to gain more powerful weapons that you cannot find elsewhere as well as the dojo being fully modifiable and being created to your own tastes and liking granted you have farmed enough credits and resources to do so my score for this game is 810  its graphically beautiful it has great sound effects a nice fluent gameplay and fighting system that allows you to use the map to your advantage expansive armoury and a limitless amount of build variations and to top it all off its free so if you do not like it you are not losing out

personally i overlooked this game at first thinking it was just another trashy cashshopheavy freetoplay this is the first time ive been proven wrong on this point while the game does seem very cashshopheavy at first especially to new players all of the best equipment cannot be bought with cash and require a lot of work to earn through gameplay in addition any cash item can be earned through gameplay though many of them require the player to have access to several lategame missions the game is very teambased with most missions almost requiring a team to complete your warframe characterclass weapons and sentinel pet each lvl up individually higher lvls mean both higher stats and more upgrade points which allow you to customise your stuff with various abilitiespassive bonusesetc such as fireicelightning damage on weapons larger clips longer blades more hp better shields etc theres literally 100s of possible upgrades and you can switchswap them as many times as you want the only thing i dislike about the game is the lack of variety in missions theres a limited small number of maps which though large and randomly setup have a lot of repeated roomscorridorsvisual styles the enemy ai can surprise you sometimes but generally becomes very predictable in any given roomsituation the warframes available at the start are relatively basic and it can take excessive amounts of time to reach bosses that drop the blueprints for ones you want though the best warframe blueprints are still only available from endgame missions the availability of any other warframes in the cash shop makes you wonder if its worth spending so much time trying to earn one of the more basic ones overall the game is good a little repetitive andwhile cashbased cash is not a requirement 710

warframe was really fun for the first time and it was pretty addicting for a while however once i started constantly grinding i began to lose interest for the game and end up not being interested in it anymore from the short time ive played i ended up having 2 dreams and other stuff happening due to the tetris effect kicking in so quickly its addicting as hell for a while so i recommend it so long as you dont mind reducing a few grades

one time i tried walking through a door and it shut down on my head and i fell through the floor and out of the map

have you ever wanted to be a moin space ninja yeah i guess that was a pretty ing stupid question because of course you have this free to play has fleshed out amazingly since closed beta the game is pve focused so there is no element of pay to win and virtually everything can be earned in game without spending a dime that being said you should totally give digital extremes your money because they deserve it
recommended
one of the best free to plays ever its a third person intense coop action shooter set pretty far in the future haha amazing graphics tons of weapons and characters to play as the warframes or characters to play as are very hard to obtain the only bad thing i can think about is how much the real money currency costs oh and its still in beta so they keep adding tons of new stuff

why hello fine friends i see you have shown interest in this game by looking at its steam page and here i am right below the download button about to persuade you whether or not you should spend your ohsoprecious time and give this game a go in short do it its free and youve got nothing to lose but all of your free time and all social communication but who needs that anyway i was asked to download it by a friend of mine and here i am already with 63 hours in one week thanks to steam having an absolutely stupid character limit the full review can be viewed here httppastebincomlffin0gy final verdict tldr warframe is a ton of fun to play by yourself and with friends there is a massive progression system that requires a lot of grinding but is rewarding at the end the free to play system is fair althought waiting forever for your weapon to finish can be torture the combat isnt exactly innovative but still combines melee and gunplay nicely making every skill extremely satisfying levels are proceedurally generated factions all have unique enemies there are a ton of weapons and frames that can be awesome to downright ridiculous and the grind will make you want to keep playing however environments can be repetitive and even the combat can become stale over time from all of this the game has fairly good replay value finally while the game does have its shortcomings it has overall been an excellent experience and for the low low cost of free you owe it to yourself to play it 87510  excellent by the way this was done at 4 am so ive bound to have missed some important

i had reviewed this game way back when after i tried it the first time i didnt like it too much then but i must say even though the game is still far from complete it has come a looong way and has gotten way better than before the pvp conclave is significantly more balanced now and enjoyable finally the pve is still grindy as hell so new players may find it a bit difficult to get off on the right foot without help luckily you can start getting good stuff if you do have people to help you 3 and with many more changes made to the game hell they even added a raid mode which can have lots of tenno in at once i cannot recommend this game enough you should give it a try if you like pointless but fun grind as well as third person shooter with parkour and fling physics lol seriously flying around the map with a bo or any other staff never gets old

yes i highly recommend it it can get a bit repetative but it can still hold its own for a free game that is not pay to win after 1000 hours i can say that i will probably never leave this game the devs really listen to what the people are saying and have taken some huge steps to ensure that our needs are met that being said gameplay is better then ever and the weapon selection is now insanely large the grind is still there though you really need to add your face to it if you want to get all the big boy toys but hey if you are complaining about a little work for a lot of profit then be lazy and sit there and not get anything done

absolutely stunning one of my most favourite games ever played this game is really enjoyable to play there are so many missions you could play and i love how each mission has a different type of mode that way it doesnt get so repetative i love it when i first started the game i couldnt believe how fantastic everything was the graphics and the combat system just blew my mind great effort put into the game the game isnt too difficult yet its not too easy there are so many warframes and weapons to choose from and i cannot believe how much effort was put into making every single map this game is very addictive yet this game does glitch out a bit when attacking enemies they sometimes wouldnt take any damage at all and it really stuffs up everything other than that everything else is just absolutely flawless if these glitches were fixed up then this game would be much more better and easier fantastic job rate 910

warframe is an actionmmorpg game and a great one at that and its free to play  duh people often mislead f2p game as p2win but this one is not eitherway this is a pve game in the first place you could gather almost everything that could be bought with cash with a little extra work youre playing as tenno a space ninja well they often mention tenno as a space ninja but you could even become a warrior okay now to the review y gameplay 910 game mechanics i just mention a few of them warframe theres a lot to choose in this game each warframe have varies gameplay pick your beloved playstyle you could become a tank or master at crowd control healer or even a ninja  weapon theres a lot a lot either you like to burn your enemies to ash or freeze them or just shoot them to death sentinel  pet your comrades in the game each sentinel and pet have a diverse playstyle again pick one that suits you pet is better in stats though but you need to take care of him daily which makes its hard but still worth it y level & mod weapon warframes sentinel each of them have a level you could increase them by using them while playing in a mission well it also gains some exp even if youre not use it but only a few you could improve them by using a mod theres a lot of mod in this game again choose which one that would make your weapons more deadly a qualityquantity of the mod you could install also depends on the level of the weapon theres a lot of mission you could choose in this game like to play something along like mgs  you can play stealth mission maybe you just likes to kill something of  try survival mission exterminate or a defense mission could do you could even battle in space like gundam esque game eitherway theres a lot more to choose i just mention a few of them music 810 dun dun dun dun dun  the music is perfectly fit to the atmosphere of the game it also changed depends on the situation graphic 910 the graphic is real smooth and good you could check the screenshot the graphic customization is really detailed and welloptimized replaybility  high this game has a lot of replaybility but at the same time it could be repetitive if you grind too much take your time and enjoy it dont need to rush is it worth playing  totally and again its free its worth trying at least

coop game repetitive and grindy lots of farming however still in beta constant updates and a unique combat system with interesting mechanics pvp is there but the main focus is pve also pvp is unbalanced no pay 2 win however limiting for someone who doesnt pay money can trade for currency to buy store items limited customization for starters being limited to 3 warframes and a small pallete of colors but still fair in terms of unlocking weapons and crafting other frames warframes offer plenty of playstyles however certain playstyles like stealth are unrewarding compared to just running through the levels with someone who can blow everything up certain weapons are useless other weapons are op creating an uneven field and also making the game boring by having less variety until weapons are balanced unique movement system however can be greatly improved upon if the devs worked on it current movement has wallrunning sliding and using melee weapons to turn yourself into a helicopter due to the speed boost from swinging it despite this many viable playstyles and a decent amount of variety but again would be more variety should other weapons be balanced terrible ai the ai is very dumb some ai are just faster than others and can perform different manuevers however they still lack a logical thinking process many will run up to you headon or will hide and take cover and allow you to pick them off without thinking to move bosses have unique prospects but are still pretty stupid game currently only rewards rushing stealth is not possible and few tactical options outside of warframe abilities very few variety between missions there is defense survival and extermination along with another mission type which involves blowing up an object there is also one where you run around and capture points but that is only one one mission could use plenty more mission types
recommended
a fast paced shooter lots of maps weapons warframes the armorbody you use and endless amounts of customization for all of them high quality graphics smart ai and a excellent cover system with tight target boxes you must aim at the target to hit it not just near it parkour around the environment bounce off the walls dodging bullets to your hearts content or charge the enemy with guns blazing however the wall climbing is hard and does require a lot of practice build everything by finding the blueprints and supplies or spend money and buy them plus get rewards for improving skills and meeting goals add mods to your character and equipment to improve their abilities increasing damage shields speed and lots more want to light the badguys on fire  or freeze them solid  you can play warframe once and you wont regret it remember its free to play

this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

in warframe up to 4 players work together to complete missions such as eliminating enemies or retrieving data from terminals players wear a battlesuit called a warframe each with its own set of abilites and statistics and are equipped with 3 weaponsa primary weapon such as a rifle or shotgun a secondary weapon usually a pistol and a melee weapon like a longsword players earn affinity experience points for killing enemies and completing challenges and missions which allows them to level up their weapons and armor warframes and weaponry have access to modifications or mods that can be installed removed and upgraded between missions the higher the affinity rank of any one piece of equipment the more mods it can accommodate the camera is positioned over the shoulder for thirdperson shooting the player can jump sprint slide and roll as well as combine techniques to quickly move throughout the level and avoid enemy fire the game also allows players to utilize parkour techniques to evade enemies bypass obstacles or gain access to secret areas maps are generated procedurally with prebuilt rooms connected together so that no levels have the same layout at times the enemy faction can initiate a lockdown of the area forcing players to hack security terminals by completing a puzzle minigame within a small time limit credits ammo resources and mods can be found in set locations such as lockers and destructible containers as well as dropped by enemies new weapons warframes and equipment can be purchased in the market either the items themselves or their blueprints using either credits earned ingame or platinum purchased via microtransaction[3] blueprints can be constructed using resources found during gameplay

this game is a scifi fans dream its in space and you play as beings known as the tenno ninja like people who possess suits called warframes each suit has its own use and purpose for example nova is a aoe suit and rhino is a tank suit the maps are dynamic they change everytime you play on them adding more depth to the gameplay plus there are tons of different types of enemies from 3 other factions nonplayable corpus infested and grineer the corpus are a robotlike race the infested are well like the flood in halo they dont stop taking over lifeforms to take over more lifeforms and the grineer appear to be humans who have gone berserk and have tried to remove all other lifeforms in our solar system with a few planets extra even pluto despite it only saying ive played about 0hrs as of today 211213 ive actually played it off steam for over 200hrs thats how good it is star rating 987100 < absolutely fantastic ign sinc0ra  feel free to add me

the metascore is incredibly misleading you dont just run around killing enemies and looting from containers you train yourself to be the best ninja around the main thing that people like about warframe is that there is a nice selection of parkour techniques that make the race of the tenno just that little bit more awesome theres now operations of the mission kind which involve you deciding whether its best to assist the corpus or the grineer in each mission finally the best part feature in the game the modding modding allows you to constantly decide what upgrade you want to add to your weapon or warframe on every levelup this can either make your weapon best stronger versus a certain faction very fun to play with or very simple and sometimes very weak it can take a while to find the best mods for weapons but when you get them the whole experience changes for the better what more could you want its simply a masterpiece the game can get repetitive with the constant grinding for weapon or warframe levels but the difference everytime is that you get to try out a new type of weapon some are just basic guns others have unique firing techniques but it never gets boring if you know what your doing bottom line its worth playing if your into fpss and definately worth trying if your unsure there are a few connection bugs but its hardly noticed the grinding is fun when you fight in different missions and areas and it helps to play with friends but if you get it you wont regret it

warframe what can i say if you can see through the whole massive grind and see how great this games community is this is a game for you it has interesting story elements through lore that you learn as you play the game the farther you get into it sure when you start out its a tough grind because not all the places you need to go to farm for resources and items are unlocked but thats when you bring in friends to join with you or get a random person to taxi join a squad to the place you need to go and start farming things most of the friends who ive talked to about this game wont play past a few hours on this due to what i said the massive grind needed this game gives the massive grind for items and materials this was freaking worth it  at the end of the day sure you have to wait 1272 hours 72 hours only for building additional warframes but still its worth it in the end for the grind and yes theres stuff you can buy with ingame real money currency  but all the weapons feel balanced and you can mod them up to fit any fight you may get that also includes your warframe itself since the recent update to this game you no longer have to worry about your abilities being tied to mods to install instead they unlock as you level up your warframe i have to admit when i first started playing this game i didnt really have anyone to play it with  till recently that is i also have to say there is still a bunch of bugs in this game that hasnt been fixed yet like for me getting stuck on the mission screen and having to kill the game from task manager and then starting the game back up again its still a great game to play after all if you can make it through the massive grind youll feel really rewarded at the end of the day i give this game a 9510 because of the bugs that cause me to restart the game  kill it from task manager  making me log out of windows  still a great game id recommend it to anyone

warframe pros brilliant concept beautiful graphics loads of content free to play developer communication cons minimal story integration shameless grind terribly redundant empty and meaningless missionsmaps practically impossible single player overall rating  6510 and would recommend some more personal observations and realizations 1 its a brilliant concept ninjas in space 2 i really like the sleek and sexy look of the actual warframes but hate the ugly enemy designs while they may be unique they just look comically bad i half expect pauly shore andy richter and carrot top to be voicing the corpus and grineer bosses 3 while the story is there its integrated terribly into the game itself i dont want to have to read the wiki to find out why x faction is fighting y faction or which syndicate is the right one for my playstyle theres a lot of lore in this game and its friggin great but they way its implemented leaves one feeling directionless 4 despite thousands of players being online finding people to play with is pretty hard most 90% missions have no activity at all while the bulk of the player base is farminggrinding only in a few select locations most of which you wont be able to access as a new player i cant believe there is no available list of squads actively looking for additional players solo play and pvp still has a lot of room to improve 5 even though i have logged in over 100 hours of game time as of the writing of this review i still have barely begun to experiment with all the content this game offers however ive reached the point where i no longer really care to advance any further because the grind is just so tediously repetitive if i do manage to find the single blueprint i need to finish creating a second warframe the grind will start all over again in order to unlock a third fourth fifth ad nauseam then you have to do the same thing for your weapons mods archwing seriously the end game is what bragging rights in closing yeah i would recommend this game its a free download great concept pretty pictures and can be a whole lot of fun if you have some friends to play with

hey there tenno looks like youre interested in playing warframe maybe its sleek character designs and world aesthetics that ring equal parts japanese sentai rangertokusatsu superhero and western science fiction caught your eye or maybe the promise of an invigorating thirdperson shooter experience meshed with light rpg progression elements got your attention if you enjoy  endless grindwalls and microtransaction temptations at every meaningful gameplay decision  a vacuum of engaging content beneath those grindwalls  undocumented stealth nerfs and obfuscating excuses for these changes by developers  unfinished projects explained away by the promise that these features will be fixed at some point in the future  a lack of transparency between developers and players  a clear lack of direction for exactly what the game wants to accomplish  game developers who constantly run away from their mounting selfcreated problems then you will probably like warframe enjoy your stay if not i would suggest playing another game

i often see reviews from people that have not had enough time ingame to truley judge it this review is from a very experienced addicted member of the warframe community ingame on the forums and the wikia this game consists of a unique combat style that allows for fluid change between melee and gunplay the enemies are currently a bit dumb but as is the nature of this game that may as been mentioned by devs to most likely happen change by further improving the pathing of enemies and differenciating combat tactivs more between enemy type and faction the lore is currently hard to find though based on community smarts information attained from the codex think pokemon with some added goodies and the devoloper livestreams and posts lore will be expanded on but as the devolopers have said the game is about making your own lore with some guidelines the difference of experience between first playing having a hold on the combatmovement along with having a decent arsenal and then what is dubiously called endgame is immense starting off may feel slow with the generic assualt rifle pistol and long sword at your desposal enemy factions are slowly introduced as you progress through planets and bring a different style of play with them the grineer follow basic shooter patterns aim for head avoid hit scan weapons and some heavies the corpus is more about reaction to shots than anticipation of them while keeping on your feet as well as having a 90% resistance to damage taken to the head so for once the foot might be better than the face and the infested a pridominantly melee faction with pack mentality and zerg rush style tactics once you progress you begin to make your arsenal unique through mods extra stat cards that are dropped vis rng random number generater when you defeat an enemy weapons are not as important as getting mods to start off these mods allow you to take advantage of enemy resistances and status effects as well as pure damage increase as you complete missions real time alerts become available which is a good way to get credits basic currency and items to improve your weapons and skins and weapon that are either alert exclusive or otherwise only obtainable from the market for plat the games premium currency mods affect your weapons ability and to some extent the playstyle of that weapon but there is also a large number of unique weapons with more added almost every week that will allow you a diverse arsenal of playstyles all weapons are attainable for free throught the market under the blueprint section or from farming other areas and bosses or events at mid game the fighting starts to pick up and more avenues for play start becoming apparent at endgame your mastery will have been substaintial increased the psuedo overall player level based on number of weapons maxed your arsenal will be full you will have tried most of the warframes classes mods will not be a problem allowing minmax builds and you will be focusing on farming defence or survival missions this as the endgame gets a little tedious and at times unbearable if you can not find a good group o fplayers or even a single mate enemy level increase damage dealt able to soak up and number of enemies is really all the diffulcultty increase that there is new content is always being added so the focus on what is endgame may very well change on a slightly different note this game has its fair share of bugs 96% are no where near game breaking and refining damage models optimisation for more systems and overall increase in stabilty are always being improved although this is advertised as a coop ninja game cooperation is not a strong focus with the community lobby options such as solo private only friends can join or invite only help with getting into the game at your own pace or with a set group of friends you are chatting to trailers depict a large amount of coordination of warframe abilities but this in practice is lesser a large portion of abilities are pure damage with a few twist between playstyles and the abilities that support the team mostly do not need another ability to contribute the most that it can rushers are rampant in online public lobbies and as there are endgame players only going into missions for a single purpose they rush past everything else which as a new player can be a bip shall we say disorientating the learning curve to be able to play this game is not steep but the learning curve to master the game certainly is each enemy has their own resistances and vulnerabilities and modding for certain enemies can be the difference between life and death in this game all resistance info can be found ingame but only after scanning enemy types for information int he codex if that wall of text was too much to read then i will sum things up easier before rounding this review off with my opinion positive  uniqure combat style  a plethora of weapons and customization  warframes often feel unique but familiar enough to learn to love  damage system offers a large amount of info to get sunk into further increasing some peoples interest in the game mechanics and devoloping weapon and warframe builds  game is constantly being updated with fixes to community voiced issues gameplay performance new weapons and warframes as well as events invasions and real time alerts  everything that is not cosmetic or convienience can be attained for free  devolopers are part of our community negatives  farming gets repetitive after a while unless you change play styles  with constant updates it also brings new bugs  your personal objective may be hindered by rushers and their objective  endgame consist of two generic mission types to rank equipment in summation my personal feelings about this game are tilted towards loving it when its not throwing a devoloper induced fit and plenty of patience the experience is enjoyable and there is a lot to go indepth based on lore or gameplay mechanics the devolopers are always answering questions and taking feed back yes i have put money into this game but only the equivalent of a low budget disc game i highly recommend giving this game a try for at least 15 hours before making a final decision get to know regular players and the farming can be easily broken up with informal conversation which i consider great as the tenno are a family i have maxed almost every item in the game ahve all available mods and till have an erge to check in every day to see what smal large or passive things have changed try this game and you will never feel the same about any other game after

hello and welcome i guess to my new review of a game warframe okay so my earlier review got a really postive response so yes thank you d but now lets start with the warframe review itself so yeah the game is amazing and it has a lot of things to do in it missions are not boring but quite the opposite they are really intresting and acually have sense i acually played some games in which the missions have no sense with the game or the story but warframe as i said is amazing and a really good game if youre a supernatural fan or something about ninjas this game is 100% for you  so yeah that is a wrap of the that i hope you will like this as you did my earlier review it was batman ac have a nice day of evening depends on the which part of the day youre reading this

tldr as with each game there are tradeoffs but its free at least try it you panzy beyond its asthetically pleasing graphics and segmentally loaded maps there is much to be seen and much to be learned in warframe despite the general consensus of the game being shootyshooty ninjas in space lrn 2 parkur robot grindyfest the games in a constant state of beta so it doesnt have to monetize it for its consumers and is receiving a very steady bimonthly update speed it is constantly getting new weapons and new warframes for you to play with its a wonderful waste of time but its very intimidating to do if you dont have a good group of friends willing to assist you with goals you want to accomplish starting the game youll likely be overwhelmed by the choices and the customization every game starts like that but once you can get through that over the hump of the starter warframes everything becomes more entertaining i used this game as a breaker between tough games i was playing darksouls stalker mods and hello kitty adventures and used it as a stress relief but once i got into it i saw that they had put much more into it than i had thought the lore for this game is incredible ill just say that right now downsides though theres a lot of bugs you will experience as new content is polished between patches and there is an overwhelming sense of why am i doing any of this in the beginning [thats also a part of the lore imagine that] theres no real variation in where you want to advance through the starmap until you hit earth and theres just too many things to choose from at one time  i was lucky enough to have a grasp on the game really early but i sparsely played it and some things you might want are only obtainable through real money colours certain helmets profile pictures along with other things but there are alerts thatll give you occasional chances to find things you want helmets nightmare mods warframe parts or just more cash tldr as with each game there are tradeoffs but its free at least try it you panzy

ive played quite a while on this game and warframe isnt simply another fps you need to add to your list because its freetoplay this game offers a great opportunity to spend a great time with your friend and have fun while doing it its really addictive since you get started to it with large sets of missions including base defense survival boss fights or killing everyone in the map one thing i found a bit disturbing is the fact that level isnt much taken in account thats pretty great yeah you can queue up with anyone no matter his level but when a warframe level 60 comes in with his crowd control skills that annihilate the whole planet while i still try hard to get one headshot on that small robot that survived the apocalypse its kind of a buzzkill when i see i killed 30 while he got 300 but then again to get the most fun out of this game invite some friends and do your missions the way you want it done

this is one on the only games that ive played for a year and still continue to play i started playing during the early phases of the closed beta at first glance it may look like a version of mass effect 3s multiplayer because it kinda is in its own right but deep down it has a ton more content and playability the game might have some flak about the grinding of the game but it was a ton worse months back the company that has been developing this game digital extremes de actually cares about the communitys input on everything about the game about the warframes about the levels the grinding the weapons i said i wasnt going to put any money into the game but i have a fair amount as well one thing that is amazing about this free to play title is that you can get everything besides cosmetic items and certain event items just by playing since its a free to play title you can buy your way through some things but the game isnt buy to win there is no buy to win part of the game unless you play in the pvp areas since its a pve game

this game is one of the largest wastes of time you could invest in despite the fact that the scifi elements are intriguing and promise a feeling of exploration and satisfaction it satiates neither thirst the game instead reduces the player to hacking and slashing or firing guns blazing at hordes of faceless and uninspired 3d models that dont deserve the title of enemy they run and shoot towards you blindly almost as blindly as you attack them to an insignificant goal your rewards are next to none assuming you dont invest over 150 hours a week in which case this game may satisfy your urge for bland weaponry if you so desire either weapons or new warframe suits then you must resort to dedicating your career to this abomination or you must purchase the overpriced platinum currency for only $15 usd this single weapon could be yours is a paraphrase of their stores radio jingle if you desire a pitfall in your life then by all means sacrifice your wife and childs wellbeing to grind for that new warframe suit but if not dont subject yourself to the boredom and microtransactions

applause is in order for the developers for creating such a truly amazing game it may be quite repetitive but compared to a game like call of duty or counter strike warframe is not that repettitive the game may be a grindfest but all shooters are in some way a grindfest and most have minimal customization call of duty is nowhere near the customizational level and counter strike is static uncustomizable to the max and who wouldnt want to be a freaking space ninja however this game is highly well beta glitchy and all out hillarious or annoying when it does im in love with this game when you look in the platinum store and you see a weapon that is 150 platinum its simply the developers way of saying here be lazy if you want but itll cost you buddy there is no way that i can express the fun ive had on this game because the game itself is ever changing and ever updating and best of all forever free this game without a doubt has my seal of approval i the leader of boxes everywhere am proud to give this game a 1010 and a 5010 in betaness

if you and your mates want some fast paced coop action tons of loadout options lots of character options smooth gameplay great visuals customizations up the wazoo here is your ticket for all that entertainment this everexpanding 3rd person shooter can provide countless hours of carnage and a sick collection of characters and weapons that can be upgraded and modified to suit your gameplay styles solo is good coop is fantastic id like to see more developers take a page from this book in regards to making coop more exciting the pvp in the game could use a little work and expansion fort captures and capture the flag the biggest critisisms i could offer are that this game could use more and bigger boss battles and a little bit of ai improvements on various enemies throw in a few more types of battle formats like arena fights for instance maybe a little vehicle warfare space ninjas on hoverbikes would be the bees knees the current maps that are playable in the game make for good instances but a more open world approach would help bring more gamers to the scene without question

very in depth f2p game feels like a high speed version of mass effect 3 multiplayer with map exploration the story is not very well developed however you have a general idea what the plot line is what really shines is the game play gun action sword action and characterplayer actions are all really nice the graphics look very good smooth framerate and i havent spent a single dime to play this game without spending a single dollar you have access to 10 characters and well over 75 different weapons just need the components provided by missions to build them all i would recommend everyone give it a few hours of your time it is a fun and expansive game now and will only get better as more updatescontent keep getting added

dispite what the masses say of the amount of grind this game holds and the lackluster metascore it has [like anyone goes of that these days] warframe has been quite the experience for my friends and i the game is awesome with the seventeen billion weapons a wide range of warframes to play for no not pay for and various gametyps to play in the crafting system implemented is unique as it takes actual time to craft such weapons keys frames gear etc and if this isnt enough for you to try a free to play game out the game is still developing thats right more warframes weapons planets missions and all of the sorts are to come in the future the developers are very good with the community updating on a regular basis and fixing patches on the spot and when i say pathces i mean game breaking bugs the balance issues come after good thinking and a discussion with there design council in other words try the game out and if i were a metacritic rater id seriously consider revising that score up there this game is more than grind if youve got the will and the friends did i mention custom clan bases d

very challenging and interesting playstyle quite fun to do with other players and the entire mechanism is just extremely fun in my opinion i would reccomend this game wholeheartedly to just about anyone who has ever played a shooter

this game is so impressive especially for a freetoplay game im so invested ive spent hours just trying to get it to work cant wait to get to the title screen its been hyped so much

you sir yes you do you enjoy 3rd person games do you enjoy shooting games how about games with swords and what about games with wall running sliding flipping air kicks and all other ninja moves you enjoy those aswell do you like your games with a easy multiplayer setup and amazing clan function with a working meeting hall dojo and everything well then my good sir this game is for you there is however a heavy p2w factor involved that will have you easily spending a couple of bucks a few hours into the game if youre the kinda guy that doesnt like working for his stuff there is a supreme lack in any story in this game but the devs seem to be trying to patch that up with many new quest releases speaking of devs here we have a development crew that are actually in touch with their community actually listen to them which is refreshing in the modern society of false promises and poor delivery in gaming today all in all great game i havent paid for a single thing yet and im having a blast so the p2w doesnt bother me that much its got solid game play and is seriously pretty did i mention they added moustaches
recommended
been playin this game for a couple months now got into the closed beta and grabbed a masters founders package probably the best coop shooterhack n slash ive played in years
recommended
i laughed i cried i learned a few life lessons here and there but most of all i grinded like ing hell like this game is fun and stuff but i mean daaayuuum well besides the grinding which isnt too bad if you dont think to much on it this game is bad  why wouldnt you want to play  a cyborg space ninja in well space all in all i rate a 9 out of 10 bananas
recommended
a really good fremium game have really enjoyed the space ninja style game play with differeing level difficultly and the ability to create new warframes from just playing rather than spending is a real positive lagging is sometimes an issue with this game but happy to take that as an issue in beta would recommend to anyone

loved this game

space ninja simulator with a self coloring system
recommended
with smooth animation and semisimple controls warframe is on the right path the graphics are pretty good enough to run fluently gameplay can be a little difficult with no real levels to train it pushes you right into the game and does a good job of explaining the controls for the most part some bugs may occur but its on its way the sounds in the game are well done an atmosphere that really pulls the player into the game gameplay may be a little intense all in all warframe is a fairly good game but it could use some improvements 710

highly recommended for the long term player this game is still very much in development the core gameplay works but theyre still struggling with balancing item drops and distribution systems bosses and areas are being revamped from placeholders and major systems have not been implemented yet max rank for a player account is 30 and we do not have enough content yet to do more than barely scratch rank 15 even doing everything 02182014 theres some negativity from players joining and expecting a finished and polished game as well as from established players who mistake incomplete or placeholder systems for bad systems but if youre looking for a long term shooter game with lots of progression and variety frankly there arent many good options out there right now warframe has tons of weapons very active development regular weekly content releases and the dev team turly listens and directly adresses player feedback in regular livestreams and forum community hot topic posts so i highly recommend it for the long term player despite its struggles the community also tends to be mostly baddies who dont use cover dont aim at weakpoints and have no grasp of basic tactics sorry if jimmies are rustled but its true if you can cut it playing team survival games like killing floor or have experience with shooter games and can reliably get headshots you will find getting started in this game far easier and less grindy than people describe seriously im not even trying to say that im any good most people just treat it like its tabula rasa 2 and run around shooting stuff center mass and comparing dps all over the forums if you are into action games you will just  all over warframe try it not p2win everything is available without money except cosmetics and you can trade stuff to other players for the ingame currency they bought not pvp theres basic dueling and some little arena stuff but the game isnt balanced for it at all max players in a game is 4 dont buy game currency full price wait for a sale or login reward coupon its like $10 for a gun buying small amounts at full price
recommended
is the best game for ever and cool 3  >d<
recommended
its fun there have been a few changes that im not fond of but adapt and overcome and its really really really fun with a group of friends
recommended
this game is so addicting its a perfect example of why games dont necessarily need to have any sort of pvp to be extremely cool come and play warframe you will not regret it
recommended
if you loved dark sector youll love this game warframe takes place in a far distant future from dark sector where the solar system has been split up into multiple factions the primary factions being the grineer and corprus the grineer being cloned brutes with industrial technology and the corprus being merchants equipped with powerful weaponry and mechs one of the greatest space ninja simulators
recommended
i ing love dis game <3 i wanna marry it <3
recommended
i like this game you can grind without grind or you can sprinkle grind on your grind with a side of grind next to a heaping pile of grind while sipping on grind on ice
recommended
this is a game that has changed a lot since closed beta started its still in open beta and under heavy development they are adding new content quite often and usually have events go along with the major updates unless you are a founder they wont listen to players very much so its a game filled with crazy content sleek coding and bugs overall its fun and fast paced game to play with friends or strangers just take it for what it is and not much more
recommended
i first started playing this during the anniversrary and didnt really get into it that much my friends and i didnt know how to play and i got bored fast then i picked it back up a month or 2 ago and now have almost 200 hours logged yea its a grindfest but its a fun grindfest playing with random people or your friends this game is fun no matter what
recommended
basicaly its extremely fun only problem is that its hard to find a squad of players to help you out on a lot of missions otherwise the best 3rd person shooters ive ever played
recommended
420 out of 911 would farm again
recommended
no have eye and nose but still good d
recommended
to the new players in this game keep with it its a hard grind until you reach a certain point then itll pay off
recommended
this is by far one of the most fun and addicting games ive ever played the mission layout is fantastic and the warframe seem to develop personalities even though they dont speak warframe is very well maintained with its awesome staff team making the game fun for everyone this isnt a pay to win free to play game at all its the opposite everything you can buy can be crafted or found i highly recomend this game to anyone wanting a fun free game to play with friends
recommended
fantastic f2p game everything can be earned ingame minus things such as extra equipment slots and warframe slots ahem think of it as a 3rd person space diablo esque type game and thats warframe in a nutshell plenty of customisation is available for weapons via the mod system for both weapons and warframe with each mod being upgradeable the dojo acts as your clans guilds in warframe home base which you decide how its laid out and whats being built andor researched at any given time pvp does exist but at the moment being in beta still its not quite there yet but overall the game is always improving every patch the void is challenging survival can be extreme fun pushing yourself for those risky extra 5 minutes for another chance at that oh so rare mod and with the recent addition of the trading system this game will always be something i go back to
recommended
the guy in the picture looks like pepsi man but it isnt so 210 havent even played it
recommended
you may stop playing it for a while but when you get bored and want to play something you get draged in to the gameplay and it gets even more fun than it already was d i really recommend this amazing game to every one you dont have to be a p2w pay to win because the devs make it easy to get every thing with out paying real life money you may get mad a bit from farming things to get stuff you want but its better than having to pay real money just to get stuff you can just farn for and its not that hard d i really recommend this game to many gammers that loves fps or tps games and ninjas d now go have fun being a ninja 3
recommended
been playing this game for a long time the hours in my steam didnt sync with my warframe account idk why and its so much fun along with the community itself well this game is a grinding game which forces you to play missions over and over and over again but its so addictive the most fun part is building your warframeweapons until it overpowered or op putting the right mods and stuffs theres so much memories in this game even i cant remember them all lol game score for a coop f2p i give it 7 out of 10
recommended
the game where everything 1 hits you and it takes 500 clips of a rocket launcher to kill a gorilla thing
recommended
this game is a must my pc isnt the greatest at graphics capability but i can actually play this on high without and fps troubles basically what im saying is the game is beautiful for a free to play and i cant stress this enough this game is not and i mean not pay to win of course you can buy things to help you progress a little faster but it doesnt effect us players so who cares after all id rather grind for items thats the whole point of playing a game survival is probably the best game mode so much fun and truely addictive i can totally see myself racking up a ton of gameplay hours on this

maybe you bother to read maybe you dont maybe this review will get top rated maybe it wont maybe youll never see this maybe you will if youve seen this the last maybemaybe doesnt count for you d im writing this review at 210814 but ive stopped playing warframe because i was trying out some other games and got lured in by grinding so some stuff might be outdated when you are reading this im trying my best on english grammar and typing but it might contain some grammar spellingerrors plz no hate for those but i will try to fix asap if you say it in a post capitals have never been my thing so you wont see many is and capitals after    dots one of the most unp2w games ive ever played besides that you are able to get nearly anything from the store and you are gonna need additional weapon inventory slots which can all be bought by   platinumpremium tradable currency there arent any real boosters but there are potatoes catalysators whichll give your weapon warframe twice as much mod capacity these catalysators are also availble through lotus gift an random alert whichll give you one of those for some weapons frames youll need to increase your mastery rank which will increase by leveling up any gear every weapon warframe has to be crafted if you choose to grind all its components and not pay for it the blueprints can be bought from the store or can be found its gonna cost you from one minute to 3 days for stuff to finish weapons starting at 12h and the frames themselves high and lonely at the top all can ve rushed for guess what platinum when its finished youll have to go through the regular path of claiming it and than leveling to a max of lvl 30 why do i have to lvl it because itll get you mod capacity allowing to omptimize your gear and finetune it according to your playstyle there are starter weapons mk1 mostly regular weapons expansive regular weapons clan tech and grindy prime stuff prime components blueprints are tradable for clan tech youll obviously need a clan which has build a room allowing you to build research rooms a total of 4 in every research room you can  research stuff good guessing researching will require credits non premium currency not tradable but required to trade and a lot of time platinum once researching is done you can get the blueprint there are sentinels and kubrows to help you in your mission a sentinel is a floating thing which can be customized and modded there are multiple sentinels with multiple guns once youve made a sentinel youll also get its gun youll have to craft the sentinel for the gun but you can equip nearly any gun on any sentinel every sentinel will also come with its own special abilities same goes for kubrows but these are melee and look more like a dog theyll help you and have some awesome mods to be equipped for guns you have a primary and a secondary including bows crossbows shotguns rifles sniper rifles throwable knives and special stuff you can get 30 to 60 mod capacity on these melee you have long swords short swords dual sword daggers a glaive axe dual axe whips some hammers and more these also have 3060 mod capacity which can be upgraded by stance mods allowing you to perform combos and increasing the stamina cost warframes all have their unique powers though some powers closely resemble eachother speed hp shield armor stamina and energy warframes are equippable with aura mods whichll give a teamwide bonus they also give additional mod capacity you have tanky frames to stealth frames engineer frames and medic frames and more you cannot chance a frames gender frames will also get a little energy hp shield bonus with every lvl they gain mods as said you have a mod capacity youll gain one to two mod capacity for every level your weapon frame whatever gains melee and frames have stance polarity slots whichll increase the mod capacity even more whats that i have added so many mods and i want to max them all but i cant because ive reached the max no worries forma is here to save the day forma yeah it resembles some golden puzzle piece and is able to change that little icon you can see in the upper right corner of every modslot but forma doesnt save the day for free it wants maxed gear so it can eat every precious level away until its unranked youll do that for you dearest weapon wont you forma isnt that hard to get it will sometimes be availble through alerts and can be found in od missions o what is od its orokin derelict fight infested on an infested orokin ship bps can be bought in the store and will require a nav coordinate and any void key dont was your t3 and t4 here just use t1 or t2 if you want this game will get you grinding pretty fast stop when you start grinding the fun is gone for me look for some friends invite them to the game maybe start up your own clan with them get together in a 4 players max squad and have fun if you care my favourite weapons and frames are valkyr zephyr ogris ignis none yet jat kittag beware everything except valkyr is clan tech and zephyr requires tons of oxium i bought it 
recommended
by far the most fun you can have in coop with gorram space ninjas and crazy guns endless fun with a great community and ongoing updates that constantly expand the scope of the game and if youre a tight free2play type digital extremes have the most fair monetization system ive seen in any f2p game

cool game space ninja wars ftp like the box said  make your your way trough the missions modes exterminate sabotage defense capture interception excavation and planet boss fights all while building new framesweapons u get mod cards to power it along the way build your self a sentinels robot to cover your back and join u on your quests as of update 14 we got kubrows wolf bat cat dogs xd as a battle pet as your companion option most things all if u trade items for platinum near end game in the game are able to be obtained for free though it can be a lot of work the platinum is priced kind of high but then again the devs need to make a living somehow so get it if u like to support the devs  and u can always wait on a steam sale or login reward discount war is a grind but im having a blast while doing it ^^

[positive aspects of the game]  no real pay 2 win scheme more like pay 4 convenience  almost everything can be acquired without having to pay except for cosmeticsskins  graphics are topnotch even at lowest resolutiondetails  hellalot fun with friendscomradesinarms  many weapons  frames to choose from  passionate developers you can really see that they love to work on warframe [negative aspects of the game]  entire game is about grinding  you want a new weapon grind the resources new frame same story  massive grindwalls in some scenarios grind to grind  balancing issues somewhat remedied with damage 20 still needs tweaks  83% of the community are entitled and dense motherf  some issues which are persisting for months now still havent been addressed as minor as they may be  rng everywhere would i recommend it to be honest i love this game despite its flaws im not a collector nor do i feel like a perfectionist with a mild case of ocd obsessivecompulsive disorder though many people tend to use this anxiety disorder in the wrong context one of the main reasons however why i keep playing is the coop aspect of this game  you can solo the entire content but its more fun with a bunch of friends even the grinding becomes less of a pain if you are in tightknit community or have friends you play with on a regular basis i urge you to try this game out dont expect an epic storylore though  this game has anything but lore only bits and pieces of what one could call a story

the best 3rd person shooter online coop i`ve played  and a true free to play game thanks to ingame trading system that allows you trade for platinum  a currency gained by real money  also it can be repetitive the new events compensate it still is in beta all you have to do is playing it and you can unlock all the content

just play it i guess i played it got stuck what am i doing with my life _

so let me get this straight you took ut2k4s invasion mode added rpg elements then set that simple neat package arunnin in a completely frenetic assault mode put it in the current ut engine and then released it for free wow

this game is pretty cool and its free ok heres the rundown you are known as tenno which look like space ninjas and your job is to save the galaxy i believe its multiplayer still in beta so dont get too angry with the game but overall its fun and i will be playing it
recommended
1 youre a ninjain space 2 you have access to potential overkill weapons and abilities that you can upgrade any way you want 3 you basically become an unknown hero by saving the galaxy without a soul truly knowing 4 nothing is ever truly the same time going though the same area multiple times will show different maps and enemy layouts so each time in a mission you have to think on your toes 5 why are you still reading this and not ingame right now
recommended
even though i dont understand this game fully yet its super fun with a friend or twobut this game gets to me because you have to pay for these ingame currency silvers to get some of the weapons and stuff i could be wrong but ovoerall good game
recommended
applause is in order for the developers for creating such a truly amazing game it may be quite repetitive but compared to a game like call of duty or counter strike warframe is not that repettitive the game may be a grindfest but all shooters are in some way a grindfest and most have minimal customization call of duty is nowhere near the customizational level and counter strike is static uncustomizable to the max and who wouldnt want to be a freaking space ninja however this game is highly well beta glitchy and all out hillarious or annoying when it does im in love with this game when you look in the platinum store and you see a weapon that is 150 platinum its simply the developers way of saying here be lazy if you want but itll cost you buddy there is no way that i can express the fun ive had on this game because the game itself is ever changing and ever updating and best of all forever free this game without a doubt has my seal of approval i the leader of boxes everywhere am proud to give this game a 1010 and a 5010 in betaness

this is one of the best free games youre gonna find on the market right now the game has tons of levels diverse enemies and more weapons than you can shake 12 loosely bundled sticks at the only minor complaint i had about the game was the need to buy more backpack slots using real money but this has now been solved with the recently added ability to trade ingame items for platinum you have no reason to avoid this game try it or suffer a less delightful life

as host of warframe overview i would recomend this game to people whom like the following games mass effect deadspace ninja gaiden dark sector metal gear solid revengeance or if you like games that are like dungeon crawlers coop ninjas samurais scifi games you would love warframe its heavily based around coop and team work although you can play solo but you should bring a team along for later levels it may not have a lot of customization as far as your character looks  besides that of different helmets colours and different warframes  but it makes up for it in its mod system which is quite unique and allows you to make your warframe how you want it  provided you can find the mods in game that is  this game also has a very friendly and helpful community this game is unique in a lot of aspects as far as the controls style graphics and just overall gameplay everything in the game is actually obtainable in game provided you stick to it for a few hours you can get anything in the marketplace in game except for a few things like extra slots for weapons and warframes which is being looked into the game does force you to be p2p  peer to peer not pay to play  when playing multiplayer and can be a pain if youre not set in the correct region  im talking to you australians whom cant seem to pick the correct region causing us to lag terribly we love you guys but cmon  the game can be challenging at times but the difficulty curve can be conquered if you stick with the game a bit there is also a little bit of a learning curve to it but youll get the hang of it  [pros]  gorgeous graphics  even on low   excellent optimization  can run on almost any machine   awesome coop game  loads of mods items warframes and pets  everything is able to be obtained in game  great community  devs are friendly supportive and love to put ideas of the community in game  challenging bosses most are unique  ninjas  wall running   customer support is fast and friendly  and human   lots of language support  tons of fun [cons]  peer to peer connections no servers  yet   weapon slots and warframe slots are only obtained with platinum  but devs have said they will work on changing it   some bosses are not so unique and seem to be more of bullet sponges  difficultylearning curve might not be for everyone  but thats all i have to say if you are looking for information on warframe or just want to learn more about the game make sure you head on over to wwwwarframecom or you can check out the warframe overview channel where we talk about everything warframe wwwyoutubecomarrucard1

this parkourbased shooter has more to offer than what most review websites will lead you to think about the game ign for example have given this amazing game an average score but both reviews were only based on a few hours of gaming this is not a game you can play for four hours and judge if you are new to this type of game which many gamers will be i will tell you they missed out on so much because the game is more than run and gun and kill that enemy and complete that objective many including ign say this game is repetitive which in a sense it is but so is call of duty and that seems to always recieve high scores if you are a fan of the game star wars jedi knight jedi academy you will fall in love with this game the parkourstyle from jedi academy was something special to me allowing for many different ways of killing my foes you can wallrun vertically and horizontally opening up dramatic ways of killing your foes with a steady aimed headshot or divebomb with your preferred melee weapon to cut some aliens and robots in half yes this game has aliens and robots the tenno the warframes you can play as are speculated to be trained by jason tenno the character you play as in the game dark sector if you have played the game or watched videos at the end of the game jason tenno looks strikingly similar to the excalibur warframe in the game warframe was originally going to be dark sector 2 but the concept and idea behind it went dark later the idea for warframe surfaced and digital extremes saught a publisher to help fund the game which they were unsuccessful de took it upon themselves to make warframe and now we are able to play their vision of warframe  not a game that could have been locked down to deadlines that would ruin the vision warframe has a diablo grind so lets get that out of the way in the game you will do many missions to gain experience separately for your warframe armor weapons and overall account rank your account rank determines which weapons you are able to craft it gives you a goal each planet has different missions survival exterminate defense sabotage deception mobile defense and assassination each of these missions obviously have different goals but its up to you and the squad you are put with to decide how its accomplished which is where the fun of the game is when you have gotten your warframe armor and weapons strong enough you will be able to attempt void and derelict missions which are among the hardest missions in the game and require a team not every man for themselves the rewards for those missions range from prime warframe parts to prime weapon parts and more every warframe has different abilities and stats some offer more tanky some offer straight up damage some support but they all kick  these warframe armors can be customized with various colors and helmets currently in your arsenal theres quite a variety of weapons in the game which will suit everyones preferences and style everything from shotguns to bows they are all color customizable to match your warframe if you made it this far in the review then you are likely going to at least try the game remember the game is still in beta and is unfinished if you give this game more than a day i guarantee you it will be among your top played games list because you wont be able to stop playing sometimes the gameplay of this game is among the best in the industry by far i will not give this game a score like metracritic because i will not sellout to the lazy people who only look at scores from people who have a bad taste in games and only like call of duty this game deserves more attention than its getting its backed by a development team who are creating something unique something beautiful and something addicting no this is not some kind of new porn just go play the game

recommend this game new interesting stuff comes out every update so you have that going but the maps can get a bit repetitive sometimes and if it does go to a new planet
recommended
this is the game of 2013 for me cool action with distinctive weapons and swords beautiful sets to destroy your foes theres a dojo where you and your clan can battle in pvp mode and you can test your own build warframe with others there are monthly updates that bulk up the game time after time if you dont play this yet just download it for free and start pew pewing your way through the galaxy

there are many freetoplay games out there that use their free status to constitute shoving a reason to spend money in the players face when they dont do that they usually have very little actual gameplay that makes you feel like your progressing anywhere these are the games that are often labeled as pay to win for the need to pay money to progress anywhere warframe is the rare example of a freetoplay game done perfectly right except for one minor detail but ill get to that paying money in warframe gives you the ingame currency platinum which can buy a multitude of different weapons warframes basically armorsclasses of this game and other components used in the game while these things can all be bought though they are all achievable through regular gameplay as well in fact there are many items especially weapons that can only be aquired as you progress through the game all it requires is a little patience and if you have a group of friends you will probably be flying through the game building awesome new weapons and warframes like no tomarrow the only thing that could hold a completely new player back is the learning how the game works the game doesnt have a very well built system intoduction yet i say yet because the game is still in beta and is constantly getting new content and updates the game never pushes you to pay anything either in fact the advertising for the platinum system is almost entirely kept tucked away inside of the ingame shop which you only ever open if you want to buy something the shop contains both items that you pay platinum for or blueprints for those items which are bought using credits earned by playing the only time this rule is ever broken is when your trying to customize your character or get too many weaponswarframes the customization of your characters look in the game is relatively small but it is made even smaller by the fact that only 1 out of the 9 color pallets as well as many of the cosmetic items and skins are locked behind platinum payments this is a relatively small complaint however as cosmetics play no role in the gameplay the bigger concern is the fact that you have a limit of how many warframes and weapons you can store you can buy more slots with platinum but if you dont want to spend money then youll have to give up a weapon when a new one is finished building so far ive been talking about the payment plan of the game so you might be wondering what is the gameplay and story like well here is the answer the gameplay is amazing on the outside it looks basically like any other 3rd person shooter although the graphics are exceptionally good this game is far more complex than it looks though and has far more to give you in terms of action than a simple shooting experience before i go into the little details though let me explain some of the backround story you are a tenno basically a space ninja and you must fight a multitude of enemy factions fighting for control of the solar system alongside your fellow tenno in order to mantain balance thats the backstory and as for regular stoeyline within the game their is very little in fact the games storyline reminds me of dark souls in the way the storyline was made to be purposfully miniscule in order to get the player to fill in the gaps themselves and create their own personal story the real question after learning the story though is if your a ninja wouldnt this have far more gameplay to it than just a simple shooter experiance the answer is yes and this game provides that in the form of parkor melee weapons and best of all ninja super powers the parkor can be a lot of fun the melee is a bit lacking as of the time of this writing an update will soon be coming out that will be improving melee usage and the superpowers are amazing these powers are unique to each warframe you use each one has four powers and can range from something as simple and destuctive as throwing fireballs at enemies used by a warframe called ember to something team based and useful like healing the health of your allies trinityoberon while the powers of each warframe could decide your play style they dont have to every warframe and weapon is highly customizable with different upgrades called artifact modules more commonly called mods these are gained from fallen enemies or the completion of mission objective and adds a huge amount of depth to the game there are nearly 300 different mods in the game and more get created all the time there is a limit to modifications you can put on your weapons and warframes though so choices must be made the level up system is rather interesting and goes in a sort of imaginary pyramid on the top is the player level this unlockes the use of certain weapons and warframes in order to gain xp for yourself you must level up your weapons and warframes which go up to level 30 the higher level the item the more mods you can apply to it and the mods themselves can be leveled up by fusing mods together maximizing at different points depending on the mod the one problem i have with this entire game is map design the maps especially during the first few planets are boring and repetative to look at while the later maps get more interesting the first few hours can look really bland this could be a major problem if the game was fully released but it is as i said before still in beta and this is a problem that has been adressed and is being worked on as i right this the fact that it is in beta and is still being upgraded and added to is why i look forward to the future of this game so much its in open beta and the developers are always taking advice from the players themselves everything from weapons warframes and even story ideas are taken from the players and used to help create more for the game in this way the players and developers are working together to make this game the best that it can be while this game still could get better or worse i can only see it getting better with the kind of devotion and teamwork shown by both the players and the creators of the game so in the end after my current 200 hours of playtime in this game do i recommend it yes i do

really really really fun game to play just make sure you have people to play with

similar to dead space type much awesome such graphics so addicted  wow

what happens when you combine the parkour from mirrors edge with bullet physics mobalike powerups and melee an unplayable pulp and yes thats what warframe was for a while unplayable confusing straight up bad but this game has seen in its one and a half year of existence more attention than any other game i have ever played and it was attention from the devs and players alike its step by step evolution from unplayable to epic was a long journey one that i was a part of warframe is now closer to the final draft than ever before and in my opinion is one of the few fun and original shooters out there the current mechanics offer a great spice up to the genre and the coop focused nature of the game makes it feel like an epic rpg rather than a generic vs shooter the amazing character designs and settings the concept and the lore of the game are delivered in an amazing way they make this game pleasant without much unnecessary dialogue and cutscenes and the rangen nature of the map and enemies is a powerful tool than ensures differentiation in weapons and tactics even if you are to play the same level again you will never find the same enemies at the same place using the same gun dont let the free to play scare you away warframe is a nopaywall game you can craft everything in there through normal gameplay get the materials and build all the things or you can buy them with platinum to support the game you need platinum to buy weapons slots and cosmetics yes warframe is not a perfect game and its not a finished game it can be really frustrating at times and it lacks many things but its finally on the right path seeing a game get from unplayable to amazing doesnt happen often but what i always saw is that warframe has this sort of retrieving quality maybe its the community maybe its the huge flow of quality content maybe its just the stunning way this game looks maybe its the sheer fun this game exhales maybe its the people that i met in the game the tenno in my clan or maybe its just me i could never stop playing this game its only clear that we have a gem in our hands and that it gets brighter every day warframe you won tenno on guys ^^

great gunblade fps game once you get used to it you will be hooked
recommended
gameplay pretty good but a little poopy de sometimes changes the poopy things but not very fast still enjoyable progression very snappy compared to most mmos you can get new things very easily maxing stuff out in every possible way takes a long time but thats good because you need something to do if you do everything else graphics very nice pretty effects etc story you are a space ninja robot man so 1010 dumb  crafting important things like new warframes characters takes days irl but you can still do other stuff in the mean time and you dont need to be logged in or anything end game content is pretty poopy some tilesets get used a bit too much but they add new ones sometimes and theyre still much better than going through the exact same dungeon constantly sometimes the game bugs out but fortunately it wont ruin your session very often and if it does you can just kill yourself and let your team finish the mission for you

when it comes to discussing warframe i can say a lot of stuff i can mention a refined game system which updates even further over time i can praise the developers who obviously love the game they create and are fast to bring us the new stuff i can say that warframe is the first game that attracted me with its unique style but the thing that i love the most is the setting lore  well its scattered parts which are brought with every new update the lore is by far the most original thing in the game how about a well mixed coctail made of space adventures roman and japanese culture dont forget the feeling of waking up in a cryocapsule and realising that there are very few left of your nation if any and everyone else in the universe hates you

great developers who listen to the community and are not afraid to give us goodies very fun combat and huge variety of weapons and frames i enjoy every minute in warframe

looks good runs well on my machine and is coop freetoplay installthis playwithfriends  this was my review when i had pumped almost 6 hours into this game blinded by the depth of the crafting table resource gathering and exploring the solar system 240 hours in i can say this game is nothing but a glorified farming simulator you spend hours grinding for gear you think you need 15 min for one little resource that you need out of 5 to build your little potato so you can make your warframe more powerfull oh big whoop but imagine grinding 15 min for reasources 5x for each of your weapons and i have about 8 weapons 6 warframes and a  tonne of blue prints okay so you level up and grind untill you have such an over powerd warframe that you can take on the later levels with ease but guess what now you have access to the void on wow this game is soo indepth i never saw this coming new levels and everything the enemies get a new skin do more damage and its all pretty much the same but in these levels staying alive 20 minutes or more only gets you the good resources so you gotta keep grinding just keep swimming for the ultimate goal right what goal you allready have all you want oh but what about that one warframe that you dont have vulban who can only be unlocked by spending all your waking hours on the game to catch the 3 alert missions you need to grab all his parts they come and go randomly in the game and sometimes only last an hour without all 3 parts you cant build  and are left with no way of gaining the others untill you find and play the next super rare alert mission it took me 240 hours before i could build vulban i played with him for 4 hours yea hes pretty ing sweet but not worth it in my opinion now there is nothign more i wish to do nohting more i wish to see i have finaly escaped the grind for resources and see little else in this game 710
recommended
this game is amazing and has alot of key elements which will want you coming back for more although confusing at first if you have a friend who knows the game and can help you learn about it this game is a fantastic game for all who enjoy hash n slash shooters
recommended
i really wish there was a inbetween instead of just yes or no for recommendations this game is pretty fun but its gated fun like the game forces new players to grind an amount so large i simply cannot believe anyone can put up with said grind without the game strong arming them into throwing some dollars at it it would be so much fun if it was more accessible
recommended
its ok i guess
recommended
warframe is a really beautiful game with interesting gameplay but after time gets very repetitive lots of grinding for the itemsgearframes you want but can be truly rewarding i love this game but i wish there was more incentive to complete worlds i also wish there was a larger variety in mission type because its basically either assassinate a special dude kill all the enemies or defend a cryopod variety would make this game 1010 at this point i would still give it a 810 again its ing gorgeous on highest graphic settings would fap to

is free but fun

absolutely fantastic 3rd person shooter allowing you to build n mod your characters & weapons to your suit style of course this takes time but thats half the fun great graphics awesome teamplay and just plain addictive fun

deja vu simulator 2014 the amount of identical corridors gives a sense of mystery and the decision to keep playing or not definitely recommended for mental patients of a kind as they can relate to the repetetive and intuitive design

its a great game for what it is worth the idea of space ninjas seemed idiotic at the time until i started playing it is worth the time to play parkour guns rocket launchers who wouldnt love that
recommended
i enjoy playing this game

this game is definately a good reccomend for anyone who has the time and the paitience or money to progress in it this game is being constantly updated with new content every week some small some game changing but always progressing chances are if you played this game earlier in its beta that it is a completely new beast from whatever you lasted tasted  everything has been up for change the damage system the melee system the upgrade system the ui the hud the parkour individual warframe abilites have all been successful candidates for overhaul and have improved the game the only major gripe is that the level of content and lack of support can currently make things daunting for newer players to learn but again this is something the devs are currently working on to improve the only issue with how well youll do will depend on how quickly you join and the sooner the better its a beta youll run into glitches and hitches its just how it works youd be hard pressed to find even fully released titles that dont have bugs but itd be harder to find a dev team more dedicated to pushing this game forward than the team behind warframe this game is going places and you should definately consider joining the ride now while you have the chance to get the upper hand as soon as possible to top it all off its a game about space ninjas with superpowers honestly i dont see what else you want
recommended
i very well done and original thought game 910 the graphics and scenery are beautiful although they are repetative even when you switch planets a little work could go into variety i started playing when it was still in beta release and up to now i still find it an enjoyable game to eat the time away the game modes and the missions draw you in with the somewhat interesting storyline there are zombies in this game and what is not to like about a space sword wielding hero slicing everything up in hisher path the third person aspect is what makes this game amazing for freetoplay i recommend this game for anyone who wants to be the exterminator of the dead space plague p

mothufudgin space ninjas game is really well coded and there a very few things only cosmetic you cant earn in game also punchy

the good  good graphics and gameplay  cooperative mode at its best  last updates made the interface more friendly  most items can be crafted without the help of real money even warframes takes some time to do but its worthy  can sell items in the market finally the bad  empty servers  money takes you very far the difference between a freeplayer and a cashplayer is pretty evident  still in open beta some updates kind of f your character your upgrades sometimes dont make much sense anymore every game has a bad side cashers are a real problem in mmos but warframe can provide a good time with your friends lots of things to do and with the new steam inventory integration now is possible to sell items in the market item crafting now will be more fast and less frustrating i totally recommend this sorry for the bad english <3

excellent game excellent game play loads of fun to play with friends or randoms the huge amount of grinding in this game can get tedious but the different weapons and frames are loads of fun to collect the developers are very dedicated to the community and over the course of the game have made improvements of insaine scale with new things coming out every few weeks this game will always bring a fresh face to an awesome gameplay style

third person shooter with wallrunning and totally playable without spending money my favorite game on steam and if that isnt enough the game has tripled its contents since i started playing and is still expanding to get more variety the ups action packed good graphics good multiplayer experience constant flow of new weapons balance patches and huge additions dedicated developers suprisingly fair business model you dont have to pay a thing ever if you dont care about keeping every single weapon you totally dont have to a good amount of the guns haver their own firing mechanics and the new mod system allows for weapons to be buffed against certain enemies and purposes the downs can get grindy very very cpu intense some of you might be put off by constant changes to the balance that the game is undergoing in the last half year but thats why its a beta and it wont go on for long another prolbem at the moment is that two of the tilesets are somewhat overused but those get slowly replaced as new tilesets come along i can only recommend it its a ton of fun and its free what can you loose by trying it at least once nuff said

warframe was a very good surprise i used to play on the earlier stages of the game and it was a very good concept with great graphics but there wasnt much content at that time so i took a break from it but when i return i found a great f2p game with a lot of content and replayablity the graphics are awesome the looting the teaming up with your clanfriends you will get hooked once you understand the basics and then you want more and better the only negative is the connection problems related to the strict nat issue but im sure they will fix that and add even more content to the game 465

awesome game nice graphics and a user friendly interface highly recomended

definitely worth checking large variety of weapons and equipment i do no regret all the time put in this game

best game ever played by humans lol

a very cool game indeed i did not want to play this game at first thinking that it would not be very fun because the game is a freetoplay game however the gameplay is great and very actionpacked i really wish this game had more of a storyline because there is allot that the creators of this game could do with a single player or coop campaign other than very little story line if you like game with allot of action and killing hoards after hoards of monsters while you play as a tenno in the field to save the universe

ive been playing this game since beta about half a year ago and i cant begin to explain how aweosme this game is its a challenge and a ton of fun you have to choice to do so much creating and customizing your warframe has to be the best part just waiting for it to be done is suspenseful the game says you can be a ninja but in in my view your a god with awesome abliilties depeding on your warframe each warframe has different abilities it on depends on which one you pick or any warframe bluepring you pick up this game has changed a ton honestly so much to do you can upgrade your warframe to be more badass and your weapons too you can even have this little sential that will follow you around kill heal or hack for you there really isnt much of story line that i can remember but its a ton of fun its an online game you can switch the settings so you play with others or just rock out by yourself no one can kill you but its a ton of fun at times to play with others whp actually know what their doing this game is worth it all at the end short download and alot of detail and action download it now you wont regret a thing once you try it and get use to it
recommended
really great game for free it has amazing graphics and controls with parkour and is multiplayer one of the top free to plays on my list

fast paced scifi third person shooter focused on cooperative multiplayer you could like character and weaponry customization and star warslike or mass effectlike visuals though the game is still in beta it is relatively stable and population is growing quickly
recommended
if you can look past the grind mechanic of the game when you reach higher ranks warframe delivers innovative action gameplay set in a futuristic era where gun and blade are deadlier than before set in place where your character is part of an endangered group of warriors you must fight to keep the balance of power in the system this opens up opportunities to team up with old enemies against new threats characters or warframes can be swapped anytime and are constantly rebalanced and added upon each has its unique sets of stats and abilities that can offer varied sorts of gameplay that would suit any player the arsenal lineup is impressive many weapons have their unique abilities as well the true heart of gaining power is not in ranking up since it is mostly decorative and does not affect player progression but in modifying your warframe and arsenal with the numerous unique characteristics of your items combined with thousands of modifications gameplay can be tailorfitted to your needs
recommended
best multiplayer f2p i know of on steam great for groups of 4 especially when youre relatively close in level
recommended
dispite what the masses say of the amount of grind this game holds and the lackluster metascore it has [like anyone goes of that these days] warframe has been quite the experience for my friends and i the game is awesome with the seventeen billion weapons a wide range of warframes to play for no not pay for and various gametyps to play in the crafting system implemented is unique as it takes actual time to craft such weapons keys frames gear etc and if this isnt enough for you to try a free to play game out the game is still developing thats right more warframes weapons planets missions and all of the sorts are to come in the future the developers are very good with the community updating on a regular basis and fixing patches on the spot and when i say pathces i mean game breaking bugs the balance issues come after good thinking and a discussion with there design council in other words try the game out and if i were a metacritic rater id seriously consider revising that score up there this game is more than grind if youve got the will and the friends did i mention custom clan bases d

this game is really good the new update make it looks really cool i will definatly play it more

warframe brings a variety of classes making each one different from the other making the playing field different for anyone playing mechanics are great for a tps wall running sliding and shooting energy for specials these are things i like seeing in games cause it shows that good games can be made like warframe if more game creators could look at this game they could learn a thing or two i even run this on all low at 1280x720 and this game still looks amazing all i hope to see is some vs mode stuff like tdm and capture the flag these would make the game even better cause then everyone would be fighting people with a different play style due to what warframe they choose give this game a try and i garuntee you will like it

a fun game for those who want to spent some time as a space ninja very energetic and exciting coop multuplayer and some amazing designes on weapons and tenno unfortunately it lost my dedication later on because of the blurred questline

warframe is as you have probably heard all about the space ninjas and is a really unique experience but what really sets this game apart from the other free to play games out there is an incredibly invested dev team which is very in tune with what is going on in their community i have been playing this game for little over a year and in that time it has gone through a transformation i wouldnt have thought possible exept for the fact that i experienced it first hand when i first downloaded the game i thought that is was the prettiest game i had plaed that was under 1gb it started out as a very small and seemed to be just a curiosity to pass a couple of minutes but as time went on the devs just kept adding and adding until it really doesnt look anything like the same game anymore im not really going to go into the finer details of what the game is like because if you just look at a trailer you can get a feel for what the world is like and if you want to know more about the gameplay your best course of action is to just download the game and give it a spin the constant development and community reachout is the defining feature of this game and the best reason to get into the universe of warfame
recommended
ive been on this game for several months now and have found it addicting there was recently a large update so there are some bugs but as with any game bugs are part of the landscape i wouldnt say any of the bugs that remain are a deal breaker with this game the development team tries to fix bugs as they are reported they prove that they love and care for the game and the community behind it to me the graphics and soundscape are wonderful and easy to the eyes i have gone from a computer that was the bare minimum to run this game to a full fledged beast that can run it all on high on both ends of the spectrum this game is still gorgeous no matter what the settings are that you need to run it on give it a try and have some patience and you will find a game you will fall in love with

warframe is a nice coop third person shooter where you can join with other three players in missions around the solar system you get to pick your warframe or battle suit each with unique abilities some stealthy other more tactical or plain offensive and the weaponry varies from rifles shotguns bows swords pistols submachine guns and others when you start youll be able to pick a warframe either the excalibur volt or mag heres their abilities and the equipment you can pick right up in the start of the game httpswarframecomquickstartguide over all if you like fighting meleeing and having the chance to shoot down your targets with your friends along side you give this game a try
recommended
bloody addictive and fun co op game to play with friends i just cant stop trying to unlock all the warframes i can and max out all my guns but honestly the game is repetitive and there isnt really a story however i like this game
recommended
best free to play game after dota 2
recommended
this is my first review so please give me some constructive criticism  pros  extremely fun with friends  over 175 different weapons currently available  levels are mostly randomly generated so every mission will be at least little different  20 warframes currently to choose from  all the warframes have unique abilities and feel to them  awesome community and developers cons  the game is at its core very repetive so you might get bored easily  some weapons and mods are not available anymore they were limited time items or rewards in events  building anything takes ridiculously long weapons take 1224 hours and warframes take 3 days and 12 hours to build farming for resources  some items are imo overpriced  a color palette is 5  but to be totally honest the game is alot of fun to me warframe is nowadays a junk food game meaning that i play it always when there is a new update but i cant play a whole lot before i get bored again this is a game that everyone should atleast give a try its a free game what could you lose

you are a tenno you sprint you leap you wallrun you climb you fight you dash you have so many weapons it could be considered a war crime your arsenal of melee weapons would make the spartans blush your suit empowers you in ways that causes the bowels of your enemies to involuntarily empty themselves into space the only criticism i have for this game is the high price of ingame currency platinum but thats it if you like 3rd person overshoulder shooters with team coop superpowers ridiculous guns and nearlimitless ways to modify your weapons and stats download and play theres something coming for you its the grineer

warframe a third person shooter set in a futuristic style join me and hop into a warframe its time to explore from an ancient slumber you awaken a slumber that would only be undone by a threat wich plagues the planets and solar systems the grineer have come to take you it is time to do what you are supposed to do save everything warframe is again a third person shooter set in a futuristic style you are able to control these solid and strong husks known as warframes they range from tanks who take a lot of damage to the more stealthy types allowing you to complete missions without being seen warframe has you take on allot of farming at all times as to create weapons sentinels who act as your companion and fight allongside you or even new warframes weapons vary greatly from low magazine count twin vipers with a fast fire rate and reload speed to bows and assault rifles there is always a weapon that will interest you be it a sniper to fire from afar or a bow to get those silent kills sentinels are a great addition to the game each equipped with their own weapon from poison darts to a fully automatic assault rifle they also add a more in depth part of warframe each they come with various abilities for example  carrier has the ability to pickup loot within a specific radius of you whereas deathcube will vaporize enemies warframes are ofcourse the husks you control ranging from tanks like rhino who has massive amounts of stomping power to the more silent warframe like ash there is a warframe for each style of play so youll be sure to find a warframe to your liking the enemies   grineer  corpus  infested the grineer  the grineer are an advanced race using weapons like assault rifles machine guns cleavers and anything that would use normal bullets or slash through flesh the corpus  the corpus are an even more advanced race that use weapons which work on energy like the flux rifle and their electrified batons the infested  the infested as the name says are infected beings whom are mutated they range from exploding enemies kamikazes ancient whom can heal their allies and infested dogs whom are fast with a strong attack each enemy has their own weakness leading to some interesting encounters with boss enemies that have been put into the game whom have the ability to shield themselves with ice to a fire blast knocking you back the farming  warframe imo seems to be the game which youd love to play if you enjoy some fun sessions in farming for resources each planet comes with its own resources one better then the other all in all warframe is a great game its something you wont find everyday and is defenitly worth it to take a look at and playing it warframe will be the game for you if you enjoy the joys of farming wich come with interesting missions special bosses for each faction and the joy of brutally murdering enemies in various ways with the different warframes abilities

while it lacks in being an actual game its a great piece of distraction i recommend to look past the bugs and  balancing and note the combination of swords and space mercenaries satisfying my inner child atmosphere 710 addiction 910 difficulty no for cost 15 should be enough if you can get a 75% platinum discount this will cover all basic expenses

amazing game da best 3rd person shooter out thereawesome blend of crysis 3 and uncharted 3 multiplied by a million timesi have never loved griding more than this 2010

first off this game is free so you should just check it out right now okay with that out of the way i love this game so much if you are here for some of the best 3rd person combat shooting & melee solid coop multiplayer a fantastic levelingupgrading system that really allows for some personal custimaztion based on your playstyle and very very pretty graphics in an engine that runs incredibly well then you are here for the right reasons my biggest issue with the game used to be the lack of variety in environments but that is no longer a problem from when i started playing the game in closed beta there are now 34 times as many areas with the different mods in each area now twice as many modes and the randomly generated maps as in the style of diablo ii & iii environments are very varied of course with it a f2p game youre likely skeptical about whether or not it is pay2win or not while it isnt as fair of a model as loadout or path of exile it is probably the best model out there i logged around 200 hours before ever spending money and i only used that money to buy weapon slots and visual upgrades seeing as how its so much fun to actually earn weapons and frames in this game i would say this game is 1 part mass effect 3s multiplayer 1 part left4dead and 1 part prince of persiamirrors edge if that sounds like a great time to you i hope it does then start downloading again it is free and also the game is a pretty darn small file size 55

been playing this for quite some time now and i keep coming back an excellent game in small doses updated rather frequently as well as very frequent events would highly recommend this as a fantastic time waster albeit a bit grindy if you are the type that wants everything feel free to sign up with my referral link and get a 7 day xp boost to help you get started httpswarframecomsignupreferrerid50d384ab1a4d80b922000000 also feel free to message me if you want some coop  quality graphics funquickaddicting gameplay varied arsenal and constantly growing it is definitely well worth the download as for the free to play nature everything in the game can be earned with the exception of weapon and warframe slots and the cosmetics so for being a free to play game unless you want to only use a limited amount of warframesweapons there is going to be some level of investment for you however with a quality title like this they do deserve the support

the game has a steep learning curve if you have played other tps it will be easier to understand it took me a while to get acquainted with it and often i still learn as new things are introduced but with the variety of frames characters with all their own abilities there is a lot to discover craft mod battle pets as kubrows doglike companion pets drones like the sentinel deathcube and they are all with their own mods and customizations frames are divided in the regular frames and the prime frames the differences arent that big mostly estetic with a big bling factor and some extra modded slots this also applies to some weapons from giant mallets to throwing stars and double swords and many  many other weapons to try out to increase your mastery rank mastery rank is your level levelling up your weapons and frames doing missions defeating bosses discovering new planets will earn you experience towards your masterry rank ones your xp bar is full you will able to take a test to advance to the next rank note here that failing a test will put it on a long cooldown and you will be able to take another try the next day so be prepared because some tests will be tricky the key in this game is having patience patience is a golden virtue in gaming especially in this title the game uses an optional payment system almost all weaponry and warframes can be earned in game everything other than founderexclusive items and event retired or prime items however with platinum the grind to obtain weapon and warframe blueprints and their resources is circumvented a player can purchase weaponry from the market for credits although some weapons and all warframes require the schematic to be purchased and then crafted  you can virtually buy everything with platinum i personally advice to starting in an existing clan there are many with a lot of options also starting a clan may appear easy but there is a lot of time to be put into creating a good big working and active clan big investments are made to make those big dojos your clanhouse to a beatiful place to learn new things and its also home for your trades trades can only be done in dojos there is a big community that is willing to answer your questions in the right channels i say the right channel because if you are on the wrong channel doing your thing you get banned from chat there are gms around most of the time that keep an eye on things the people behind the game are very active in bringing hotfixes that often end in another fix to fix the hotfix but things get fixed in the end there is a good vibe and sometimes a joke is made from de events are made to offer players some festival fun and items like bunny ears event color pallets moustache and more also every day you get a login reward that can be a discount xp weapons prints and more free to play at its finest worth playing

extremely fair business model  if you pay in when you have 75% discount  countless hours of grind and repetitive mission but man its fun and cool  go read about the viable modsweaponswarframe and buy plats to trade for those things would save you lots and lots of hours into the game i really recommend you to pay i mean seriously with 50$ i was able to geared up 5 warframes to the max on two accounts  ps i was playing the game as a 2 player coop with my girlfriend who also enjoy the game immensely d ps2 this is the real game with really balanced sex representative and absolutely no sexism overtone no battle bikinis no muscle bulk than question if you even lift every time you look at your character they got different body shapes for each of the warframe take nova for an example thats as realistic and close at it gets to real world body shape cons quite steep learning curve and the depth of character customisation which is paramount in this game  my girlfriend and i wasted 24hours of game time spread over many days getting stuck in many missions _ before we knew that the mods that really matter to the game are serration and elemental damage

its a really good game visually and mechanically even though there seams to be p2w features you can earn everything through gameplay but expect a lot of grinding and pay attention when it says you are leveling upcuase not only do you level upbut your equipment does as well all on seperate occassions rather then just your main characterit gets confusing thinking my character finally reached lv 10 and notice that its still at lv 3 >> even though i cant get into this game cause i cant afford to waste little of my time everyday to grind i highly approve getting it if it helps then buy one of the starter patches cause everything aint easy peasy its a very competitive game

warframe is a game that is free to play but no payment is ever really nessicary ive actually only played the game for 100 hours and im in end game tier equipment the game is always open and though uninteresesting at first once you get some friends to play with and talk to the game is a blast dont get me wrong the game is a blast without your friends but in a coop game friends is always the best way to go the game has missions about 20 per planetmoons there are about 20 of these moons along with random levels called alerts and invaisons there are 6 or 7 mission types the levels are randomly generated but the type will always be the same for the mission you selected ive never seen the same level twice though they will pretty much always have the same aethetic these mission types really make each mission unique extermination is where you need to kill all the enemies in a level defense is like horde mode but youre defending a certain artifact you have the option to extract every 5 waves with loot getting better but enemies getting harder every wave and the potential to lose everything youre already earned moble defense is kind of like defense but rather than wave based its time based with you having to take a core around to different static posts this is the worst type of mission survival is a time based mission where you must survive duh as long as possible the enemy will cut your life support at the start of the mission so you must get life support dropped from lotus extration is where you must mine cyotic a special ore ice thing used to freeze luxury marsian jellyfish i wish i was joking the game is always intense action theres always something to do and thats why its so fun though earth and eventually mercury are kind of boring but once you get out of there the game gets so good its unimagible a great experiance deserved to be played by everyone with frequent patches and constant attention play this game

this game is basically about grinding for new cool stuff there is not much motivation to make you complete missions other than to level up and grind your gears the events are pretty fun since then there is stuff to do like a quest or a good mission other than that this game falls flat not because of the bugs or glitches but because of the lack of entertaintment unless you liek grinding alot for stuff and look cool

listen to my advise  dont play this   it might look like a pretty ninja style action game  but its actually about farming stuff repeating same things over and over and over and over again and thats it after you worthlessly spent 9000 hours of your life you can have new  to kill more enemies to gain new shinier  to kill more enemies  this game has nothing to offer to player besides farming  ive been playing this game since open beta started and some problems like stupid amount of grind you have to deal with to get stuff and lack of content were here like forever  developers stick their heads up to their asses and make some really dumb decisions that even  people would find stupid  dont expect them to listen to the feedback or something  if you care  community is bad  but not the worst  oh and add ridiculous amount of bugs and glitches to this  a lot of them werent fixed since closed beta  broken rng system  horrible balance with things being broken since closed beta  overpriced crap in store  well you can guess how competent developers are  just stay away from this abomination and dont repeat my mistakes

a paytorush game meaning if you want to be anywhere cool you may need to spend real money on platinum the game currency otherwise you can grind for days for materials to make items warframes etc it is not a paytowin game really but grinding for days dont really make it fun does it too much emphasis is placed on the markeplace and potential expenditure of platinum the gear you can acquire are really goodlooking with its own properties  but the whole mechanic is to get you ropedin spend the starting platinum and be a little bit more cool than you are when you started rest is grinding grinding grinding until you can get more gear conclusion good looking game you are etter off playing mass effect 3 multiplayer essentially the same thing just more emphasis on spending real cash for intangible data

when i first started playing this game it was really fun but once i progressed farther into the game it becaume rediculously repetative i felt like i was playing the same 5 maps over and over if there were more maps or even a different map for each level it would make the game much more amusing everything you can buy ingame is way to expensive the only point of the game is what exactly it seems all there is to do is grind to get a socalled better weapon but it sucks get another 40000 ingame credits and buy another  weapon not to mention the upgrading system

make no mistake warframe masquerades as a final product with no in development warning on steam and no mention of it still being beta anywhere but a tiny spot on the launcher back around update 7 when it launched on steam the game held quite a bit of promise for the future however digital extremes has decided its better to release a thousand new weapons and ignore many core gameplay problems than to work on creating actual content for the game they claim infinite replayability because the levels are procedurally generated each time you load one up but it settles into the same mindless grind of mid to high level diablo of go to where thing you want drops kill everything leave the game also goes from having far too much challenge before you can get the handful of core vital mods to be able to go past the first few planets and not only are there only a very small few of these mods but some are nearly impossible for new players to get to an endless stream of one shot kills on everything and its mother  and a number of warframes can clear entire rooms with skills alone with or without mods additionally digital extremes idea of a challenging boss fight is large area effect attacks and invulnerability phases as evidenced all of their revamped bosses one lephantis wasnt even particularly bad until they decided players were killing it too quickly and added damage caps to it not making the fight any more difficult just making it longer in addition the loot tables are so horribly bloated because des response to core problems nearly every enemy has a knockdown attack and its not particularly enjoyable parry is a useless gameplay mechanic is to release extremely niche new mods that compete with older infinitely more useful and versatile mods in your limited mod slots would you rather have 320% more shields do 30% more damage with your abilities have twice as much energy the games mana move 30% faster ora 95% chance to automatically block an attack with no noticible effect on incoming damage tldr its bad and i regret spending $50 on it edit 212 and now de has decided in an incredibly petty move to ban the leader of the top clan in warframe from the game entirely for forum posts made by other people i cant even think of anything to add onto that warframes community managers banned someone from the game entirely for something they personally didnt even do

i have been playing warframe off and on for years since it was in open beta  controls and gameplay that more often than not plays quickly and smoothly  the recent updates have been raising the bar in terms of visual effects and quality visually it belongs on the current gen platforms  combining gunplay melee combat and character abilities basically magic can feel very rewarding  overall the game is very simple to play and adds challenge as you progress  grind thats true for many f2p games but even with its randomly constructed levels the sense of repetition will set in very quickly grind to access the next tier of gear grind and roll on the random loot tables to get the blueprints needed for the new gear grind for the materials needed to build the gear and in some cases grind for items to sell for warframes ingame currency in order to increase the size of your inventory so that you can add the new gear while keeping your old gear as well  the rng there is no true distinction as far as rewards are concerned between a newer player and a veteran the highest level content requires the use of consumable items that are found in other missions and while a veteran player may be able to last twice as long as a new player before they are forced to end the mission and lose the consumable both the new player and veteran will be rolling on the same loot tables  bugs there are a lot of bugs and with every update that adds one new feature there is at least a week or two of bug crushing some minor repeatedly being disconnected from the main chat server to severe becoming trapped in geometry unable to fire your primary weapon or just glitched out without the option of continuing  new content adding new weapons and warframes is great but warframe encounters difficulties when making the new content balanced and most tragically of all fun the archwing missions in perticular a mode that holds many similarities to older thrid person robot shooters such as zone of the enders and slave zero is largely seen as a frustrating addition an opinion that was made more prevalent when new gear was made attainable solely through archwing missions overall warframe is a good game but it relies too heavily on cheap hooks like time gates pay gates and most of all the rnggrind gate for me to recommend it to anyone
not recommended
dont get me wrong i love warframe and i do recommend that you at least try the game but through my experience with this game i have had nothing more than trouble game play is awesome endless hours of farming and grinding it is truely an mmo players dream however the game has far too many bugs that the support team refuse to do anything about from constant log issues to frozen ui the support team always recommend you allow the game to run through firewall no matter the issue personally i find no use in firewall it does nothing but slow me down and i keep my computer clean physically and digitally so for me i have no use what so ever for firewall and it is always disabled still everytime i run into an issue while playing which i must say happens literally once or twice an hour and report it to the support team they always tell me the same thing allow the system to run through firewall but when i exclaim to them that this cannot be the problem i am met with an apology and instructions on how to allow a program through firewall its a great game with a terrible support team my enjoyment in this game would usually tell me to rate it a 10 of 10 but the constant problems prevent me from giving it any higher than a 5 of 10

its difficult to properly review a game like this as its in a constant state of flux ive been playing since june 2013 and have 1000 hours logged so it must have something going for it either that or im mentally illaddicted ill probably keep playing for the forseeable future however i have taken breaks sometimes not playing for a month or more out of boredom or just getting fed up of the grind i enjoy the general aesthetic and the controlsvisualsgunplay are very good im mixed about melee the latter has been updated but still feels like im flailing idiotically in front of enemies warframe is a freetoplay game meaning the player has three options 1 grind and farm like a monkey 2 spend an unreasonable amount of money on ingame items 3 not give a sht about the former and just play the game anyway the grind in the game is sadistically insultingly steep as with most mmos you will be expected to do the same thing over and over just to obtain whatever item it is youre after in the space of two years i have noticed a steady increase in the grindyness of the game and more and more of it is being regulated by the most weighted rng i have ever seen this may or may not be related to a chinese chicken meat company owning a majority share of developer digital extremes perfect world is in there somewhere too what do you think the business model is fair enough the ingame currency can be traded with other players for certain ingame items so you neednt spend a penny pay to win is not really a thing here as its 99% coop but as mentioned the player needs to put time in re farm and farm hard the player can craft items from blueprints found in missions or bought from the market using the nonpremium ingame currency crafting time for items varies but is generally repulsive and initially offputting for many weapons can take up to 12 to 24 hours whilst others require one or two other weapons to already be crafted as components of said weapon frames new suitscharacters have to be acquired in four parts blueprint chassis helmet and systems these drop randomly from bosses rng is a god here and the drop rates are again repulsive 15 helmet parts in a row is a fact the player will have to face at some point each part takes 12 hours each to craft and when theyre all done the suit proper can be crafted which takes 72 hours you can rush crafting using premium currency or you can turn the game off for three days this is to say nothing of the materials required to make each part again found in missions randomly and dropped by specific enemies or not depending how lucky you are with the rng there is a special area called the void that can only be accessed by using void keys the mission types are exactly the same as the regular game but the enemies are slightly tougher and ascending in difficulty tower i being the easiest and tower iv being the most difficult what makes visits to the void desirable is the chance to be awarded a prime weapon or warframe part imagine having to farm for keys of a specific mission type that drop randomly amassing a collection of which completing twenty or so missions of the same type and finding  thanks to the diluted ridiculous drop tables  only one out of four parts to construct the prime weaponframe you had your heart set on the cash shop is disgustingly expensive you can buy a full game for the price of a gun here power creep is a thing and is very poorly managed qa is very poor in fact the pc players of the game probably are the qa team there are weekend events occasionally but these have been showing a steady decrease in quality and are becoming more and more buggy repetitive dull badly designed and poorly explained as a veteran player i find myself ignoring them completely they are wretched frustrating and a waste of time developers promise to alleviate grind and improve quality of life for the player then introduce double rng sandwiches and call it an exciting new feature almost every new feature comes with more stuff to farm but thats f2p i suppose theyve made a grindfarm game and are slowly removing the tools which make grinding and farming a little more bearable in fact a number of recent nerfschanges seem outright passive aggressive towards this community subset connectiononline play is still problematic after two years warframe uses p2p which often results in trainwrecks of lagridden unplayable bugfilled matches hosted by people playing the game on hardware unable to support the game properly and seemingly connecting to the internet using a 56k modem the game isnt optimized terribly well and in my experience doesnt seem to like amd hardware very much its updated regularly though new iteration breaks something else hotfixes are released quickly and their support team is  in my experience  excellent in the end the crux of the game revolves around destroying enemies upgrading weapons destroying enemies slightly easier with upgraded weapons and doing it all over again when a new warframe or weapon comes out its shallow repetitive and getting worse so get in when you can may as well give it a try entry is free though i still cant recommend it to others

unfortunately it crumbles under its own weight numerous ways to level up turn into an extended grind game that is overwhelming the large variety of weapons turns into a double edged sword which requires an explanation of the mastery system each weapon warframe and anything else you can take with you to level up has a cap of level 30 the levels that you acquire during gameplay all contribute points towards a mastery system the mastery system caps how much progress you can make in a given day towards other aspects of the game there is a faction type system in a game called syndicates the items offered by these syndicates are generally considered extremely good and cannot be acquired any other way the problem with this syndicate system is that the points you can acquire each day is capped at a rather low number add to this problem with points that are capped universally you may have 10000 faction points you can make in that day but thats across all factions in certain syndicate themed missions you can search for insignias that you can turn in to a vendor for additional syndicate points sometimes worth more points than the mission themselves but there are at max 8 of these in a given mission and it is an exhaustive search through very large missions that can sometimes border on futility the worst part is if you decide to do these missions with other people but they decide they dont feel like searching for all of them and rush to the mission end point you will be forced to end the mission after a 1 minute timer you cannot replay these missions and if it ends early you could be out of potentially thousands of points naturally i did most of these missions solo even though the rest of the game recommends and is designed for group play i will add i also did spy missions solo as even 1 person in your group triggering an alarm can lead to the entire group failing the mission the biggest problem with the mastery system and where the game really collapses under is own weight is leveling the weapons there are so many filler weapons in this game that are commonly called mastery fodder that acquiring these mastery points becomes a chore it takes time to level weapons made all the worse by leveling weapons that are weak and not fun to use you can tell very quickly when a weapon you are using is terrible this is aggravated by the fact that you are limited to how many weapons warframes etc that you can have in your inventory unless you are willing to buy premium currency which of course costs real money you cannot increase your inventory size that has been an issue since the game came out years ago along with many other issue which i will go into later numerous weapons and warframes that you might have actually liked will be sold and discarded all because you dont have space for them unless youre willing to fork over a lot of money the game gets to the point where you might be looking at hundreds of dollars of investments if youre willing to make significant progress in this game the day and age that we live in with steam sales bundle packs and numerous other sources of price discounts for quality games makes the $50$60 retail game almost a thing of the past this game will be looking for much more money out of your pocket in addition to leveling up the weapons for mastery points you also level these weapons for mod slot points at level 30 you have 30 mod points to empower your weapon the mods also require leveling up however they dont level up from use but rather by sacrificing other mods to level them up in addition to sacrificing mods in this process you also use up credits which is the games fictional currency this can be one of the most expensive parts of the game is terms of credit use unfortunately the developers of the game seem to be aggressively cracking down on ways to farm credits which in and of themselves are still excessive time sinks leveling mods and farming credits are one of the longest processes in the game however digital extremes is all too happy to offer ways to boost your credit income or level up mods for your platinum in their premium stores i think it says enough that one of the most popular store purchases are fusion cores which help level up your mods at an extremely overpriced platinum amount i want to say it was the equivalent of $5 but i could be wrong either way it was still overpriced given the amount of other things digital extremes wants you to buy to further exacerbate this issue with leveling up guns mods and currency comes the addition of orokin catalysts and reactors these are extremely rare items in terms of acquiring them from the game itself once every 2 weeks dedigital extremes will offer a mission to acquire one of these items not one of each but just one of them and occasionally they will have some odd mission pop up that offers one but at most you are looking at a handful in a given month a reactor is needed for warframes and sentinelsa pet to double their mod point capacity and the catalysts are for weapons at max level this takes the mod points from 30 to 60 as you can imagine these are extremely important to get the most use out of a given weapon or warframe as these are extremely rare you will have your best luck acquiring them by paying platinum in the premium shop as it can be an agonizingly long time in reality to acquire one in addition once these are attached to a weapon or warframe it cannot be removed you cannot pay any type of currency to do this once attached it is gone forever you can try to contact customer service but not only are you going to be waiting multiple days there is no guarantee they will help you out the mod leveling mastery point leveling need to acquire orokin parts credit farming weapon leveling and rare resource acquisition are an extremely frustrating part of this game due to needing to dedicate significant portions of your life to farming these or pay real money i will touch on resources as these are also a significant time sink with every weapon warframe and whatever else you need you must craft it first you have a personal ship that you use to enter each mission and inside this ship are stations you can use to level up your mods buy things from the store or craft your equipment to craft anything you need credits and resources resources are acquired from killing enemies breaking open crates and chests or killing bosses the rarest resources are most easily acquired by killing bosses a rare resource is not guaranteed but it is still your best way of acquiring themor the premium shop some of the best equipment can require 10 of these rare resources or more this is in addition to waiting long periods of time for the crafting process warframes take 3 days to build not to mention the 12 hours for each component to build before you can use them in the warframe building process weapons take from 12 to 24 hours you might be excited to acquire this new piece of hardware but youll be waiting multiple days more than likelyunless you pay platinum this is a recurring trend in this game in addition to the resources requirement and credits some of the very best weapons require farming high level void missions for blueprintsparts multiple different blueprintsparts are required for a given weapon or warframe part of the problem with farming these missions is that they require keys to enter you acquire these keys by farming other missions or by purchasing them using the limited syndicate points or premium currency unfortunately i am out of room here but all i can say is stay away

this game has a horrible economy model that will sooner or later force you to either stop playing or pay real money for ingame goods the core gameplay is pretty fun and the graphics and aesthetics are close to perfect  original enemy designs excellent effects stunning tilesets wonderful ship designs  you name it the customisation is fantastic but it comes at a cost the only colours you have to paint your warframe and weapons with are dulleddown muddy colours with multiple shades of the same colour and not much inbetween you have to pay money to buy colours you get only 2 warframe slots and not nearly enough weapon slots for a varied loadout this forces you to constantly either sell old weapons [ie one of the 3 riflessecondariesmelees] to make room for a new one or go the sensible route and trade items for platinum in the universal chat what this involves is organising to meet up in either your dojo or the buyers dojo which must have a trading hub this isnt actually that bad until you consider the alternative to buying items with platinum and that is grinding crafting one warframe for example requires you first to get the blueprints for each of their parts the warframes system blueprints their chassis blueprints their helmet blueprints and their body you can often only get these blueprints from certain boss missions  but theres no guarantee you wont get a blueprint you wont already have then once you have all the blueprints you need a general warframe blueprint despite having a blueprint for each of the warframes parts you need to buy or find another one  and then it comes down to the actual crafting what this involves is roughly a 25000 credit cost to build each part  and then hundreds of each specified material at least one of which will be either an extremely rare drop [again from a boss] or something that can only be bought for platinum [read real money] not only is this expensive it is also timeconsuming  or rather it takes a given amount of realtime for each item to be crafted youre looking at 24 hours for a weapon or body part youre looking at about 3 to 5 days for a whole warframe of course the only reason this time barrier exists is so that they can shoehorn in another way for you to hand over real money  speeding the crafting process up costs yet more platinum this overall is a great game with excellent potential ruined by greedy developers ive seen too many people defending the game citing the fact that the devs have to eat too  it should not be at this cost so many other games have working economies whereby you can buy ingame items using real money but without having to  in other games it is a choice rather than a necessity

so to start off my review of this game beforehand a long time ago this game used to be one of my favorites but now with the constant hotfixupdate failing due to internet connection reset or it simply not ever downloading the updatehotfix i have grown sick of the fact that i cannot play this game during the weekdays due to the fact i actually need my sleep the update servers must be connected in some form or manner to the log in and maybe even game servers as during normal mass play times the updater simply just doesnt update the game many threads have been made and none answered by developers which pains me to say i would love for the updater to actually use my download speed over just not download at all or at painfully slow speeds until this painfully slow or nonexistent speed is fixed up it is really hard for me to want to recommend this game to any of my friends

if you want a game that you can have fun with until they apply a hotfix which breaks the game so you cant log in then this is the game for you and then when the server decides to let you in you cant chat can barely start a session and cant see any other players that you may join or join you great potential but it falls flat due to poor patches and fixes

dont play waframe for a lot of different reasons the most obvious being the fact that everything is behind a paywall you cant advance at any pace without dropping money you can buy blueprints for warframes and weapons through the market with in game earned currency but unfortunetly you will never be able to unlock them because the materials needed to make said item require a key to be bought with platinum the purchasable currency to even unlock the levels stages tiers needed to farm the item you need players with bought weapons will be stronger than you pvp is a mess its even hard to progress through the story alone because you have a limited number of everything a f2p should always follow riot games pay model pay to look cool not to have an advantage over anyone else willing to drop a little cash to be better than you period

new melee system is so bad  when this game came out it was really good imo  you can actually play with the sword and feel like you actually slash the enemy in 2 melee 20 current system is so bad  i spoke with people that still play melee and they said they have to stack all kind of effects excorrosivefirefrostelectrictyetc the more the better so that your enemy will die from damage over time  as you guys can see in the first trailer you take like 58 attacks to killno t to mention he has some quick op blades your average minion with this new 20 melee system  boring as   you spam e like a manianc 58 per minion srsly now check the second trailer minute 100  thats the old 10 melee system  strong mod on the sword > cut them down like a sword  i played this game as soon as it came out in 2013 it was really good  we had a blast  now it feels like a crap  rip warframe 2013200whatever bring 10 melee system  charge attacks back  then we can talk about this game again

i cant in good conscience reccomend this one i had fun dont get me wrong its a game with great potential a great aesthetic and overall has a lot of content for your buck even if most of that content is more or less the same they even add a large amount of content on a regular basis and to be honest thats part of the problem the developers seem more concerned about adding new and shiny things than fixing the old and shiny things that dont work properly and from a business standpoint that makes sense its like they think a good idea is enough and doesnt need to be refined and polished heres an example to get chroma a cool looking dragon frame you need a part for frost an ice frame which drops from a certain boss that boss was bugged out and got stuck in an invincibility state and never became vulnerable patch comes around boss possible to be killed again in my haste i fall off a ledge and die which you dont do normally from falling and my screen blacks out i can still move and shoot i just cant see anything heres what the patch notes said  fixed lieutenant lech kril being unkillable due to players not being able to properly hit him with ranged weapons 0 responsibility taken thats what really gets me and its not even an isolated incident not even close ive been around for like a month playing this game to death and there are forum posts from 2013 talking about the same issues in my month of casual play i could literally write a huge essay on this games problems and possible solutions but no one would pay any attention because warframe doesnt want hobbyists it wants addicts

deleted my old review which was positive and hopeful impressed with this games strong sense of tsutomu niheiesque biomechanical scifi aesthetics and john woo parkour action since then the game has maintained itself as just another terrible f2p grindmachine and perhaps even worse a constantly mutating and unfocused wreck of a game i havent invested nearly as many hours into it as some thankfully but it seems like everyone realizes at some point that its not the game you hope it will be and could be it is with a heavy heart that i admit mass effect 3s multiplayer is a far more complete and satisfying experience even if warframes aesthetics are much wilder and more exciting maybe some day theyll find some kind of focus and this will crystallize as a game worth playing
not recommended
this may be tldr but do not worry i am going to break it dowin in to category nicley note that there are good and bad things about pretty much every category gameplay for the most part the gameplay is smooth and very resoponcive as the player is given access to three weapons to take in to battle a primary weapon a pistol and a sword or duel swords the shooting mechanics are a bit ordinary hold right click to zoom in all that jazz as the sword play at first is just as ordinary with sword play advances further with combos and such like things as one furthers themselves in the game note that there is only one combo unlock per stance so it does not progress that much although a well balanced sword can out damage most weapons in game with that aside this game will take you to a lot of different planets known and unknown alike on these planets every single mission is basically on one giant map cut in to different sections as some are reused or a player is simply spawned on the oposit side thn they were before so needless to say one planet means one look that you will get tired of really fast some on top of that are built in facilitys that make the dungeouns very constrictive so do not have your hopes up for a visually pleasing level design not to mention that most maps have a horrible layout that makes it impossible to take advantage of the jumping mechanics in this game such as wall running except for in particular portions where it is needed to cross a map it makes the mechanic feel like a gimmic and it plays as one as well the jump mechanics for the most part are terrible one of the most difficult challenges in the game is jumping from one platform to a higher platform because half the time the character will run up a wall and do a back flip leaving you further away from an objective or if one is taking fire from an enemy and wishes to dispatch him it takes at least 2 seconds to get up that small ledge as proper enemies can take away a large portion of healthshield given that opertunity crafting now this is the insentive to keep you going every single weapon in this game can be crafted as well as warframes for the most part it is enjoyable to grind through missions in hopes to get that last rare matterial needed for an item that will finally progress a character the down side is if you are planning on playing for free be prepared to wait a lot there is a wait period for every item crafted which would not be too bad except the least one has to wait is 10 hours most weapons take at least a full 24 hours and warframes take a whole 3 days they claim this game is not pay to win but they sure as hell put a lot of insentive on paying players geting what they want faster for example free playergrinds for blueprints fights boss three times in hopes of getting all blueprints for warframe 2 hours max grinds for all crafing matterials as well as cash 5 hours at least begins crafting warframe pieces all at once 12 hours warframe pieces are done begin final blueprint craft for warframe not like they could just let you put them together right thn and there after all those hours 3 day wait period that is the free to play model right there coop now this game is hard to play alone but it does start you off with 12 revives and rewards players with 4 revives daily so thats a nice litte feature to keep ya going coop is a must in this game and it is 5050 the community is good and willing to help out with a lot of nice people but more often thn not if one runs with random players they are going to have a bad time there are not that many new players in this game beyond the existing community so a majority of people one will find themselves teaming up with are vets with awesome gear and way op weapons which will drain the experiance from this game drastically as one runs missions trying to hunt for matterials to build a warframe these players will treat every mission as a race and dash to the finish line leaving you in the dust if you explore and look for loot you will not get any kills simply stumble across the map seeing an endless amount of dead bodies left behind <<every time this type of gameplay does not reward you with anything if one feels the need to explore and actually look around it is best to play with a friend or go in alone but if you do not care and let them race themselves to a red light that is fine go ahead and explore just beware once they get to that red light a countdown eventually begins that will take you away from exploring and eject you from the mission on top of that every other mission has a side objective with a nice cash bonus prize usually in the form of kills get 3 kills in 10 seconds get 5 kills while sliding get 30 kills with rifle things of that nature i enjoy this idea but with random racers joining in every other match they hog kills and assume you are not trying to complete that objective nor will they ask you the so called cooperation turns in to a competitive challenge which one can say goodbye to all crafting hunts and focus on beating this random player to the kills it can be entertaining but it forces one to play at a different pace and a different playstyle thn they may be used to and happening to often that it just does not seem worth it pay to win in the grand scheme it is a little pay to win that is for sure they claim that there are items that one cannot buy but must find through drops in the world i have yet to have come across any such thing i would not say that this game is pay to win but more like an over aptitude to push payment as the best option to play if there is something in the game you get they will have an option to pay pay to get rid of wait time on crafting materials pay to bypass crafting and get the item you want now pay for more revives hell pay for rare crafting items as well pay to unlock my color options for color pallet pay to get a new warframe now without wait there is just too much micro transactions that it constantly punishes player for not paying every little feature one can buy plus the prices oh my god the prices are horrible the lower end things cost around 5 dollars but warframes and weapons are expensive as  they have warframes going for over 20 dollarsand you bet ya that those warframes are damn near impossible to get in game through drops this is what you are dealing with while going in to this game i for one like this game a lot it is creative and fun but destiny is right around the corner and is this x10 with no  micro transactions this is a good game but way too many cons and way too many things they want you to spend money on i am sorry bot i will not recommend this game for the reasons listed

note this review is not based of any new content as nothing feels new the graphics and design are great and have 4 friends can make the game a little more enjoyable however the game will get boring for you really quick as each level feels the exact same as the previous just with a different objective to complete the levels are continously recycled and there is no real sense of progression you get from other games when you level up you dont feel any stronger than you did when you previously the crafting system is very hit and miss the ui for crafting is very solid and very easy to use but getting the materials needed to create the items in question is horrorendlessly bad the rare item drops needed to craft the items drop so rarely youll be grinding the same levels over and over just to get that one item that you wont feel very accomplished after getting it youll just feel like you wasted a lot of time the gameplay and sound for the game is actually really nice the weapons sound good and impactful the sword swings are refreshing to hear as you cleave your enemies in two and the controls are solid in closing i feel that the game could be much better but as it stands i cant find it as enjoyable as other mmos like world of warcraft or final fantasy xiv a realm reborn

this game is not a bad game dont get me wrong it has cool graphics nice gameplay and good customization the problem for me is the gap between veteran players and new players such as myself i found myself running behind this veteran players while they rushed clean the whole map while all i did was collecting the xp not that much fun you can play alone sure but that becomes very hard later on and there are some modes that require 4 players to play effectively getting the resources and warframes needed to make new stuff is not that hard as long as you have 3 veteran players that take you to a advanced map to farm resourceswhile all you do is hide when the vets clean the map try doing that alone and in low lvl maps its almost impossibleto get the needed resources the payed part of the game is a bit too much for me i wanted to spend some money on this but then i saw that is was more then 15 to unlock a new warframe i didnt find it pay to win since you can get all the stuff just by playing its just the prices they ask for are too high for me this is a cool game if you have the time to grind and farm until you become a vet yourself but i cant recomend this to new players i wish i could select a neutral review for this but i cant

i purchased one of the founders packs for warframe about a year ago finding that the game had very little substance i decided to quit i started playing again yesterday 7212014 to find that they had made some major updates to the game the layout of the solar map is very pretty now but the game still lacks substance the community seems horrible as well racism runs rampant in the chat room and the game gives you very little direction on what to do or where to go the tutorial gives the impression that weapons are found lying around the map waiting to be picked up but thats not the case three weapons can be bought from the market for the ingame currency otherwise the rest need to be made by buying blueprints the blueprints take on average twelve hours to make in the foundry and you can speed up the process by spending real money i understand that this game is free to play but it feels like there is a little to no progression aside from spending money all in all i give it a 510 its borderline okay

if you had asked me if i would recommend this game before their newest combat system fighting in space with wings i would have given you two very solid thumbs up i will admit that the space combat caught my interest but after trying over a dozen and a half times on one mission to complete it i have to say this worst mistake ever there is no training for this combat the npcs do not miss ever you try and dodge as its built into the combat flight system and yet they still hit the npcs are able to capture zones faster than you can react the devs in their wisdom do not give any mods to help you even in the combat and when you do find a mod if you fail the missionsee above with how many times i failed it you dont get the mod congradulations de you took a great game and screwed it with your need to make things so over powered i will never return or spend money on your game

okay so this game is really fun i must say but there are many things that make it weigh more towards the no side the game is a third person scifi shooter where you are saving your kind from evil that are trying to kill you off and you play different levels traveling through different planets in the solar system but i found that all the levels feel the exact same over and over you have different objectives each time but it is almost always the same map layout and the same ultimate goal in the end making it feel super boring over time the game is free to play but once your in the game you are almost always butt ed by the cpu enemy because you start off with bad weapons and in order to get better weapons you basically have to pay so its free to play the game but to enjoy it you need to spend money basically but the game is fun with friends and has come a long way and still looks promising so i hope it can improve until then this game is a no for me 510

this game is wonderful in the sense you can commit hilariously epic carnage on the enemy types in warframe this game is also wonderfully frustrating because of the multiple layers of rng randomly generated rewards basically and it is a very long grind to get to the highest rank if that is your goal i would have to recommend this game to people who like dark sector and its pretty bad ai where enemies are moving to cover and stand in front of it before starting to shoot at you

this game is largely a grindfest if you care to waste away grinding for things that relys on rng random number generation clearly this is the game for you also if you prefer to just read the pro and con scroll further down i also ran out of characters to rant on things in terms of initial gameplay i was not amazed by the p2w pay to win module and how the game did the tutorial i was thrown into the game with little to no idea what exactly i was doing it wasnt even until a month or two later that i actually figured out that everyone has a stamina bar underneath their health what got me to continue playing this game were the company of friends typical how friends make friends play bad games de needs to reevaluate how they do exchange of platinum ingame currency with real currency the prices for some of these accessoriesweaponswaframes are just through the roof and also all over the place with no coherent scaling of prices with each new update more bugs and crashes happen but thats to be expected right no if you think about it the game is already out of beta phase yet it is still getting new content that completely changes how the game played each time last update i bothered playing had a 13 in it which involved mirage and limbo warframe with that 14 update they completely revamped the star chart so it was more consolefriendly and made all the menus diegetic huds similar to dead space for pc users this is a curse since it completely makes navigating menus with a mouse utter pain whats worse is the diegetic menus would occasionally hide behind your warframe or in front which the warframe blocks the view which makes it hard or impossible to access or use anything warframes each have 4 abilities that correspond to the 1  4 key on the keyboard above wasd press it it activates or channels what de failed to do though was make the abilities unique enough to not spam one ability over and over instead of using 13 a lot and using 4 as a last resort its a constant input of one particular ability one example is the nekros warframe he is all about raising the dead and fearing enemies away but one ability stands out desecrate woah is he going to touch bodies you bet he will touch them bodies real good in hopes of getting lucky with extra drops so good that it is all he will ever do another problem that warframe suffers from is the vast amount of mods in the game mods allow you to modify your weapon and add effects or damage to it some reduces damage for faster firerate or higher crit chance for less accuracy doesnt sound bad until you already have the necessary mods that most everyone else has you have a clump of mods that wont ever get used and just takes up space providing nothing of value to you even when you transmute gambling mods in hopes of getting a better mod it each update adds more mods that offers little to no change and is already among the other mods out there recent event gave players 20% damage to slashing while nice and all theres already a mod that offers 10% damage to slashing not as good but there already exists the mods of that category de is just saturating the market with mods when they should either implement another system or stop attempting to make new mods there is a stealth aspect to the game that de stated in their video about being ninjas quite the attentiongrabbing title but the real game offers little in terms of stealth in fact its even counterproductive with some of the modes in warframe to attempt stealth survival is one of those modes where you are trying to kill as many as possible in hopes of staying alive stealth doesnt work in that kinda system you get miniscule bonus credits for beating the entire mission in stealth for particular modes which is not worth the effort stealth kills are also done on multiplacative system where your weapons x stealth  damage so murdering bosses or higher level enemies with level 0 weapons will net you 1 damage making things in the foundry requires real time to complete and claim in your inventory it kinda sucks early game since you are given a bp for a weapon but you cant get any of the materials for it until like34 planets later by then you are done with the game or you already got something superior another thing that de did to alleviate peoples instant gratification is rushing the thing you are making which finishes the building process instantly for 25 platinum this rushing button applies to anything and everything in the foundry which could require only 1 minute to 3 days to make the price is exactly 25 platinum i personally never hit the rush button since i didnt mind playing the waiting game which is how i managed over 555 hours in this game when you manage to make it far enough in the game to afford a sentinel shoulder critters the most useful one by far is the carrier which vacuums up items around you for ease of collecting why bother using another sentinel to dish out damage when youre already dishing it out anyway its honestly not worth the effort to use any other sentinel than carrier in my opinion then you have the critter following behind you the kubrows good luck finding an egg of it drop rates for it are abysmal as of a month ago once you find the egg you have to purchase a incubator power core bp which will allow you to make it in the foundry so purchasing the bp is 50k credits making it in the foundry is 100k credits oh yeah you also have to maintain the dog as in keep feeding it to keep it alive you have to purchase dna stabilizers to ensure the dogs hp doesnt drop below 100% otherwise it will die you have to login every day and pet the dog otherwise it loses loyalty meter which makes it do less damage also if you want to get rid of the dog immediately you can opt to consign it to lotus female woman that likes to talk for whatever reason for 25k credits here are the pros and cons pro unique warframes with their own special abilities large variety of guns and melee weapons to choose from fastpaced combataside from bosses enemies ragdoll in the most interesting ways lots of mods to place on weapons and warframes stealth segments for those wannabe ninjas can alter color pallete of weaponswarframespets you have pets community is fairly nice more opinion here than fact cons one of four of eachs warframes abilities shines the most and thus is almost exclusively used some weapons are completely useless and never worth the effort to farmmake melee seems good initially but gets easily outclassed by ranged toward endgame some bosses has a gimmick to how you can damage them sargas ruk aka ruk the suck requires you smack 3 weakpoints one after another until he will go down hundreds of mods and only a few of them gets any use stealth is glorified and nonexistent you might as well go in guns a blazing making weapon in the foundry requires real time to make takes x amount of time to farm warframe parts and 1 day to make the parts then another 3 days to actually make the warframe from the parts color palletes requires real money unless you happen on an event that gives out a free pallete like easter cant change color palletes for all warframe some has a default color to them eg excaliburs backside is grey all day every day carrier is by far all most players would care for as a sentinel pet new update brought in dogs but the dogs require a constant maintenance have fun in the void survival games gets exponentially harder as time goes on you saw it right exponentially aside from resource farming on certain planets youll mostly be seeing the void for most of your gaming life all in all do not waste your time playing this game i couldnt even list my entire rant because it was too big for steam to handle

at best you can say its a decent third person shooter  cons repetitive it seems that you play the same level again and again and again  in game currency is useless if you want something you must buy it with real money from weapons to revivalscolours  blueprints  i would rather give 20 bucks to have an unlocked game than to spend 60$ for useless points in a game that feels that is not finished  until the devs will get some sense into themselves i wont recommend this game

warframe is like a little boys first dog you like it for the first 23 days and then it gets boring and you stop playing with it there is no ultimate goal in warframe nothing to work towards you can get to the end game in like 2 hours of starting the game and by end game i mean farming enemies that are higher level that wield the same rewards as the ones you fight when you first start the game speaking of farming the only real thing to do in warframe is farm for materials to use to make more things to farm with tldr warfarm is boring

it was supposed to be more like a stealth game and now what another clone of something else maybe ive played for 2 years almost spent countless money on it but i have no hard feelings because its freaking f2p they never force or ask you to buy anything seriously if you want to achieve or become better than others in this game you will need to pay eventually its not a big deal not at all only a few bucks a few bucks will just begin your addiction to buy and satisfy yourself and repeat ive spent approximately thousands and owned a lot of limited  noobies see it will freak out literally for example the freaking primed chamber mod developers never put a price tag on it but it got a ridiculous price i created a clan which was actually some good memories that i made a lot of friends and it was fun after so long this game became boring at some point buy the prime access double everything found the most badass weapon and go through certain best farming maps and call it a day seriously is this how games are or should be i love the design of this game but something went wrong it was supposed to be a stealth game but now we are flying in a jetpack suits some say it looks like gundam and gun blazing in the space stylish at least it was because i remembered the title ninja plays free and i dont actually think the ninjas fly in jetpacks i havent played for a long time but i waited a year to see some improvements on the game play developers designed a lot of moving method wallrun walljump climbing dodging backflip and frontflip i no longer think thats necessary any more since a grenade launcher is capable to kill anything i see warframe got a pretty high rating maybe im looking at the down sides possibly played for to long and forgot about the joy or other aspects no i still remembered what i loved i loved the design it is absolutely gorgeous and unique i literally spent hours on customization what need to mention is that the colors you put on your frames have limited pallets so if you want some fancy colors you will have to reach to your wallets anyway things like that push everything backward and annoy me pay to win thats spirit of f2p titles deny or not you dont pay or you will have a hard time and i assume you will reject me with your so promising mental endurance but who wants to play a game with unpleasant experience so in the end you go screw that just 50 bucks or something like that and start to rip your wallet pieces by pieces for the people who are not wealthy enough to go crazy will end up finding other ways to squeeze some cash into it in other words to illustrate this addiction to pay and satisfy is a druglike experience you get on it and you will have a hard time to quite it was all about glory and vanity obviously a cool dude with stunning color and limited edition  looks awesome than a person merely spent a buck on it and probably looks horrible theres no argument with that just watch when these two kind of players meet together and the cool dude will poke the  out of the noob maybe the cool guy doesnt even have to talk just simply stand beside a newbie and prove everything if you are a costumer long time ago and still loving it i admire you if you are new to warframe take me suggestion but i wont force you from trying warframe trust me f2p title is way too dangerous even a free phonegame with in game purchase will rip off your kidney no matter how confident you think you can control yourself because i failed too many times so i believe im not the only person on earth who pay in f2p the point is if you dont want to be sucked into it dont even bother click that friendly looking free to play start the game button and that goes the beautiful nightmare here are my own opinions unbalanced game play repetitive only thing that keeps you come back to the game after you tried everything the update events similar to infinite expansion contents but only its free events all have the same goals score to the highest tire get all the reward warframe has awesome customization capable for occupy you all day long graphics surprisingly nice interesting lighting effect structures and vegetation are not bad but consider it as a free to play game they did put certain amounts of efforts to it design unique and eye catching i played this game in public and gathered peoples eyes weapons are amazing but if you got tired of farming you will have to buy it every weapons are unique and explorable with the mod system mods provide different effects to both weapons and characters but mod all have potentials to be leveled up level a mod will be a pain in the  it is slow as hell and gets even slower when approaching the maximum level another item that appeared in game was orokin reactors and orokin catalyst both frames and weapons are only capable for 30 mod capacity which means possibly you can put approximately 48 mods on them using those two items will increase to 60 which gives you more capacity it means weapons and frames will become stronger they are not common thereare random mission alert missions reward and provide as blueprints acquired materials so farming again  those missions appears more frequently when holidays or anniversaries another way to obtain is to buy general i had a long term relationship with warframe i have witness warframes grown from a crappy game to a shiny title yes i had fun but i wish it wasnt a free to playit seems a onetime purchased games have average better average qualities warframe is going off from its original form personal understanding stealth content is just a extra function but i was into more developments of stealth but no its completely useless there are no rewards for accomplish a mission with full stealth and seems most people are not into it now its full gun blazing and our ninjas are flying into the space its not my game i dont make the call but i would rate 610 if you need a reference on rating im sorry im disappointed not recommended fair well warframe  i reviewed my critique honestly i am slightly ashamed of my tone i should have approached with a more professional attitude but i was emotional had too much to say it is hardly a critique because overall it is too subjective i hope i have provided a useful review necessarily all information that i mentioned is from personally experience do not be suspicious about any words seem to be insulting or sensitive i promise the reliability thank you

warframe is very playable actual shooting feel twitch pveshooter which even sounds good but theres a big but pretty much all the information imaginable is hidden from the player thats just terrible game design considering the game is built around crafting new warframes and weapons aka reward mechanics every single player will encounter following issues which arent explained anywhere in the game sure you can check some of these from wiki but even then you need to know what to search eg i was confused about fusion cores  so i searched that from the wiki too bad there was no information which was relevant nor even link to fusion which was completetly other title  and had the exp tables i was looking for affinity orbs appear every few second whats that exp exp for warframe selected weapon everything modification & fusion cores theres separate rank and max rank which isnt said anywhere vs exp vs exp requirements for leveling up  major fckup here you can get components eg reaper handle  which you cannot find any information in the game youll just have to accept the fact that its a prime component without having any idea whats a prime or what do you do with one damage types arent explained anywhere im probably going to check the game out again every now 36 months just to see if theyve managed to add the relevant information which would make the actual playing fun

this game is downright frustrating and boring the gameplay is repetative and after the prologue there is no way or indication for you to know where youre supposed to go next the only way i imagien this gam to be any fun is if you step in with your friends and start at the same time because any experienced player will just bombard you with information you dont understand thanks to the system surrounding upgrades and leveling being so confusing and not to mention my experience with random matchmaking more often than not i see two or three highlevel blips on my radar because i get to see them up close twice once on level start as they run off and once at the level exit where they wait for me when they have murdered everything that moved frustratingly complicated systems and no guidance or hint to what level mission to choose as well as the pairing with highlevel players make this game incredebly frustrating for now players all in all overly complicated game mechanics and a verry unclear dificulty curve surrounding a repetative core gameply more resembling of grinding than a fast pace shooter combine to make this a boring and frustrating game

addictive but not for the right reasons pros addictive fun through getting better weapons frames and other items cons hard to find squads teams to play with on later half of missions due to there being 30 missions per planet and 12 planetssystems when playing with others its usually a speedrun where you dont contribute much because everyones grinding for parts the games only really fun solo but if you go solo and are not playing carefully its very easy to lose the mission and have to start over or use one of your 4 daily revives on many framescharacters and its not as fun to play solo as other coop games often feel like youre being baited by a carrot on a stick with promises of better items i find myself playing to get better items rather than because i want to play a game to shoot enemies there are a lot of bugs most are not game breaking sometimes i get stuck in a wall at the start of a mission though plat out of game currency is stupid expensive 50% more than lol unlike in lol where $10 might buy 2 champions 10$ here will buy you 15 guns or frames otherwise you have to farm several hours to get the parts for the item and then spend real world money for extra slots for the item or sell one of your other items after 80 hours my record shows 60 but i have 20 on another steam account because i accidentally forgot to log out of that you get a good enough frame and weapons to beat every level you can certainly get better items than what i have they just are no longer necessary to beat missions in a meaningful amount of time i 1 shot level 25 regular troops with my rifle

a flashy grindbased game with little in the way of actual support i sure hope you like farming because thats all there really is to this game that and waiting lots and lots of waiting if you liked eve online youll feel right at home with this game everything has a craft time weapons range from twelve hours to a day and warframes take a full three days to craft of course thats after youve spent twelve hours on each of the three components of course you can use cash shop money to accelerate that if you so desire though warframe is not strictly speaking pay to win theres nothing from the cash shop that you cant acquire through grinding it may just take you a few daysweeksmonths longer to get it all than people who payed the only things that cant be acquired anywhere but the cash shop are all aesthetics scarves weapon and waframe skins ornamentation for your sentinel so thats all well and good but like i said the trade off is more time than youre liable to want to spend waiting and every day you log in you get a reward and many of those are discounts on cash shop currency ranging from 20% to 75% and that may sound too good to pass up for someone with a particularly longawaited piece of gear being crafted now i should mention that there is absolutely no thought given to balance in this game there is and always will be a best weapon or warframe which usually changes with each patch now while its true that there are dozens upon dozens of weapons to choose from 90% of them are useless the way that leveling works in this game is pretty standard level up each piece of equipment by using it in missions however your account levels up separately from your gear and this is called your mastery rank you increase your mastery by leveling up your gear the more items you level up to max the higher your mastery so many items weapons and warframes alike are there just to serve as mastery fodder to be leveled up to max for the mastery and then discarded now there are a few items that are locked until you reach a certain mastery rank but for the most part its just for having a bigger epeen than everyone else returning to the issue of balance its disheartening how often a new warframe is released only to have major performance issues that either go unaddressed or if they are addressed it wont be to any degree significant enough to fix them then a few weeks later theyll release a shiny new warframe with its own issues to make you forget about the last one they didnt bother to fix the only times de actually steps in to try and balance anything is when one warframe is so blatantly overpowered that it cant be ignored and sometimes they dont even do that much and what could i possibly say about the developers de cant seem to get anything right every time they fix something they break five more things sometimes theyre outright contemptuous of their playerbase not long ago when they released ember prime basically ember with a few gold bits stuck on they made sure to encrypt their loot tables so community data miners couldnt see the drop rate of her components now that in and of itself isnt much cause for alarm how many games hide their drop tables from their players no it was when they released their prime access a bundle that allowed people sick to death of grinding to pay for ember prime and all the primed weapons that came out with her but again not terribly out of the ordinary they have to make their money somewhere however this particular batch of prime items seemed infinitely more difficult to acquire than all those that came before of course nobody could prove anything since the loot tables werent available anymore the worst part about all this is that theres a good game in there struggling to get out warframe is fun make no mistake so fun in fact that it deserves better developers than digital extremes it should hold your attention for a few hours and if you have friends to play it with then all the better but dont use this game as anything other than a time killer for an hour or two i suppose its also worth mentioning that there are no dedicated servers so your experience will only be as good as your hosts connection which is all too often less than spectacular granted you can set a minimum ping tolerance for matchmaking and set it as low as you like but itll be something of a lonely experience or itll match you with a host with awful ping anyways which hapens more often than not for me tldr its really grindy and poorly managed

i want to be able recommend this game i really do but unfortunatly i cant the core gameplay is decent fun with the option to be stealthy or unleash your ninja skills in a full on attack however this games biggest problem lies outside of the combat getting new gear or warframes without paying requires waaay to much grinding to succesfully do and even after the days you spend grinding and finding materials you still have to wait several hours or several days before your thing is done crafting this is absolutly rediculous expecially considering how much platinum premium money costs i could buy several games with the amount of money it costs just to buy a couple warframes its just not worth the time or money to try to play this game

yknow im gonna be honest here its a fun game it really is but its a grind  its a free to play but if you want some of that cool stuff like those helmets and other unnecessary accessories for your warframe youre either going to have to grind some prime parts to sell for platinum if you just despise giving the game developers their money because that makes them greedy s sarcasm there or shell out cash because you actually support the game the first option is better i havent bought any platinum i got it all through trading you start off with 50 platinum but you cant really do much you can buy two warframe slots and something thatll cost 10 platinum 4 weapon slots and have 2 platinum left or 1 warframe slot and 2 weapon slots your call thats nice so i guess you cant complain there the issue falls on the pricing its so expensive and the exchange rate from dollars to platinum is a little funky i wont delve too deeply but hey its not mandatory to buy it at first i was like hell yeah ninjas in space this is the greatest thing ever and its free  but now that i play it more i sorta just have to look at the amount of hours i put into it and ask why you basically just do the same thing over and over you dont get to interact with any sort of npc in missions were not including relays those are hubs and if you manage to find one chances are youre just killing them because its an npc theres no real plot there for us to follow unless you spend a lot of time scanning everything and playing through all 200 missions on every isolated planet where people never really seem to go but before you bash upon those who like plot the only sorta plot im getting here is that im really the bad guy here or something like that once you do all the missions you sorta just do nothing you beat the last mission  what now wheres the final boss now for items  gotta build them or buy them already made i can understand the game makes you grind for the blueprint parts to make those nice aklex or dakra prime or that epic nyx prime instead of shelling out 100 platinum for an easily grindable gun or sword makes you feel better after waiting 12 hours for that sword or gun and 3 days for that warframe that other guy bought for like 100 bucks in a pack or something in regards to customization theres so many other colors you can choose from but you gotta pay for them even the classic colors in which they give you only one column to choose from youd think theyd give you the first palettes for free but nah just one column thats lame but yknow not really mandatory part of me wants to recommend this game to you and my friends because for a while its actually pretty fun yet the other part of me wants to say to not play this game and use your time elsewhere because its a grind grinding only lasts you for so long it just depends on the kind of games you like dont get me wrong its not a bad game its just a rather time consuming game as shown by my 200 hours if youre some achievement hunter going for achievements in this game boy do i have some news for you in the end if you dont mind the grind get it if youd rather not spend the time grinding away all your depression in this game dont get it its free either way

despite the amount of hours ive clocked in which now kind of feel like a waste to me the game has great potential but sadly its not sprouting yet i hope the game can be rather really confusing if youre new even with all the tutorials overall this games a massive grindfest to get the things that actually interest you if you dont want to spend money thatll be discussed shortly andor if youd like to reach high ends of the game such as enemies that go off your rank numbers but sadly its rather just the same enemies you fight with the only differences being them having stronger weapons and health usually theres eximus versions elementalhealthleechenergy leech of the same enemies but even that feels bland and boring if repetition doesnt bore you easily you can give it a big whirl but youll realize its rather just the same enemies on different areas and fighting enemies in outer space directly feels the same but with your accuracy being  the game continues to be updated with bonus events and to give player login rewards but what the game needs to do is make some improved ai features such as awareness and to make commonly unused weapons and mods modifications you can slide onto your weapons companions companions weapon and warframe most you get is to slide on about 9 at once and depending on their rank which goes from zero to thirty and the number on the mod card it will drain down how much more energy is in the weapon that you can be limited to it can be countered with the use of a forma or orokin catalyst in which a forma puts in a special slot that has a shape in it in which if you put a mod with its matching shape on the top left of it the energy drain is cut in half with the catalyst it doubles the energy amount ex 30 now being 60 since ive mentioned events earlier there sometimes are mini events where you get minor bonuses such as double xp double cash double resource finding and so forth theres also times where there are major events and doing a mission node a repeated amount of times allows you to obtain such materials which can vary from rare materials to a large amount of ingame cash these events allow give introductions of new warframes to obtain with their latest being mesa who looks like someone from destiny in fact you can list some similarity between the two games in terms of design but im not trying to cause any controversy here there are microtransactions in the game in which this game sells a lot of weapons slots will be talked about in the rating below cosmetics all basicissue warframes color packs to change the color of your shipcompanionsweaponswarframes companions and resources you can also trade things too which include getting premium money so if youre willing to sell your things for that good luck obtaining someones interest only mods prime parts premium money keys dna prints and certain resources can be traded forget about trading weapons the only things you cant buy directly from the market are clantech weapons in which you must build yourself where you have your clan dojo with laboratory to do research one weapon being a flamethrower and the majority of prime items there is usually a timeperiod where they have prime access to the new items that also give exclusives such as 90 day boosters a few thousand of premium ingame cash and character icons prime items are basically where your warframes companions and weapons have bling and some stat boost that make people drool all over it ridiculous on how it goes as once something gets primed people care for that and leave a lot of weapons behind that look like actual fun you get the majority of these through grindfests in an area called the void and even in here its the same enemies just reskinned to look all shiny the lore is something that needs explanation too the lore has so many theories from the community coming up here and there yet de hardly ever seems to admit the actual plot many try to relate it to this companys other game dark sectors in which you play as hayden tenno who has a suit that looks similar to one in here called excalibur his last name is the name of the race you play as the tenno owns a weapon thats 100% the same in here the glaive aka a bladed boomerang one boss from there is similar to here a giant fleshy tissue that at first was cool but is now pretty meh there are flower decals that look like the ones the lotus has as a symbol lotus is your companion and trusted leader and another character has a suit that looks similar to the one in this game nyx yet this company said all connections between dark sector and warframe are incorrect so there goes that as far as you will possibly ever know you are tenno there are other factions called grineer messed up clones that are basically conquistadors corpus futuristic merchants in which some go crazy for money infested the same virus issue from dark sector with some of the enemies being infected grineer and corpus but some being things of their own just filled with trainwrecks wildlife wild dogs and manta rays on land and corrupted reskinned enemies of every faction except wildlife there are syndicates trying to correct things in their own eyes while having alliances yet opposing opinions with others optional to be involved there grineer try to conquer everything while having a lovehate relation with corpus mainly just one guy for cloning and weaponry purposes corpus members are either trying to discover about the stuff of the past orokin which is a faction that doesnt exist anymore and building crazy security bots infested just spreading all over and all you can do is help make sure you delay the possible inevitable wildlife not caring much and void being shiny people corrupted by mind control what about tenno you guys are some crazy ninjas who can do sick moves yet youre recently up from cryostasis so you dont know jack about your past or anything about the lotus but hey go with the flow i guess in reality i like this game it has potential enemies and design are nice weapons are nice as well but apparently the companys only solution is to keep adding content over content over content to leave a majority of the players blinded by fashionpurposes while the few that have a brain start leaving 4510 if you want to take a look go for it i wouldnt recommend throwing money on it since money is needed on slots for holding your weapons warframes and companions glad resources dont have to be a part of it and im glad they give you a starter amount on the premium money tldr  game has potential devs are just adding content after content instead of fixing actual problems and game is repetitive piece of bland content

an example of a company having a cool idea and handling it terribly in the closed beta you could have more fun with breaking the game in interesting ways such as running at 500% speed and it has steadily gone down since then the company abuses power quite often on both the forum and the game while leaving the game riddled with bugs

i never recommend this game for 0 too poor server goes down so often 1 too much strong flashing lights 2 awful user interface 3 bug of blasting rearright speaker 4 bug of leaving invisible entry on steam client 5 cheap reward events at every hours 6 no hint to beat invulnerable boss 7 too many stupid impatient players 0 too poor server down so often added 20140808 it must be impossible for online game cuz all of data you made become gone not only chat logs but also rewards you earned spending some hours but in this game sever down happens so often in 1 hour maybe more than 2 times in that at least now 20140808 if you dont wanna lose rewards by struggling in this awful game never play this not only this company cannot fix it at least for some weeks maybe for months its lasting but also never even restart server soon what they can do now is to leave it down until when users report it if it was completely free game for beta i forgave that but now this game is microtransactions so letting server down so long is impossible i have never seen before such a shameless company like them 1 too much strong flashing lights in login reward dialog in battle in crafting and completing it etc even just when ur buddy does jumping attack u will be forced to see many strong lights moreover if u use kunai throwing dagger weapon it flash ur hand in every shot why need flash so manytime like that  cuz this silly developer belileves its coolbull  u will lose ur eyesight through the game and soon need eye doctor this developer maybe doesnt know even photosensitive epilepsy there are many things to study before making game but they never 2 awful user interface u will get thousands of mod cards but it cannot be piled up so u must scroll them till find what u want lotus woman warning us about enemy approaching talks over and over through game and of course u can not turn it off all can do is to reduce her voice from options you can never kick other players from ur room so u must play everytime with who u hate you can never know what icon means until put mouse cursol on it you can never know real number of players in mission progress on every planet cuz it shows data a few minute ago and ignore our setting for ping limit of course the developer doesnt give us manual refreshing button for it you can never know coop members life until open tiny window at downleft corner on screen if u were healer u may fail to heal manytimes cuz we mostly watch center not corner about amount of members manausing for abilities u can never know but only by chat though there is an ability giving mana to others u cannot know how much remains but yours who report their amount of mana by chat while playing hard action game  of course u cannot display these important info directly on their characters head the developer seems to never notice even such a basic features 3 bug of blasting rearright speaker im playing with true multichannel speakersnot virtual and a few minute later after starting game it blasts crazy big sounds from there even if choosing 2speakers enviroment from oss control pannel it still goes on of course in other games never happen such a shameless glitch the only method u avoid this is pulling out speakers plugs from rearrights 4 bug of leaving invisible entry on steam client i dont know it already fixed or not but it went on till i came to use launcherexe directly though quit this game steam client never let me shutdown itself cuz warframe still running i checked task manager but never found such entry of warframeexe or some and moreover verifying files of this game from steam client i was forced to redownload some gb files over and over i dont care which company is wrong but it was the one of most annoying thing ever on steam after using launcherexe directly it ended ps at update12 it finally crashed while updating forced me reinstall 3gb again cuz verfying data never works and showed stupid error dialog again and again they must never test even updating 5 cheap reward events at every hours u may think whats wrong with that  but this means they are luring u to game everytime through a day for few ingame credits in other words just a chum to make u use real money cuz this game is f2p do you think such company can give you fitting fun for money u paid  i never think so you should pay the company which brings us truely enough happy time and fun 6 no hint to beat invulnerable boss one of my terms of  game is no hint to progress i always use a grenade launcher and flamethrower cuz it has wide hit range but some bosses cannot take any damage of course shows no hint i checked wiki why i must see other site not official sucker  says boss has weak point but shooting there with weapon above they never take even 1hp damage and never go on to next phase to be beaten i dont know its bug or not cuz they shows no hinthahaha t 7 too many stupid impatient players its not fault of this game but cuz how fast u move is important in this game almost all of idiots leaves everyhing behind and hurry to goal they leave not only coop members but also keys and hostages need to end the mission they are truely idiots never understand even what to do and why they come there though i played this more than 100 hourssteam dont show cuz im using launcherexe directly but over 90% players were such in most case action game freaks are inferior to the other games fun in intelligence especially so in this game maybe cuz it is f2p the free gathers the stupid everytime so i suppose for above 1 give options to turn off these flashing lights developer must learn from pokmon shock 24 fix everything written in 24 5 maybe thats fate to f2p but i dont approve as game these chum looks like even add 6 show always clearly where to shoot what to do r u willing to sell something guide book later  7 give black list system can record these stupid players and avoid to meet again in matching thats all for now if u doubt just play and feel despair same with me thx

right so third person action shooter where you play a sort of biocyberninja in space sounds pretty badass doesnt it well to be perfectly honest its pretty ing average the game looks beautiful theres no doubt about that solid graphics and kick  visual designs the controls work the gameplay works leveling up works something like a collectible card game where you slot different upgrades into weapons so whats the problem there are about 6 different mission objective types spread across 4 differnt map styles spread across 50 missions oh and some missions combine multiple objectives did i mention the maps are all randomly generated yeah its pretty much the same thing over and over with no real semblance of a plot or engaging set peices its just kill kill kill like diablo its a good thing its free becuase i wouldnt drop a dime on it

seems ok at first nice and easy and fun and then theres the problems soloing is impossible since enemies are limitless they come in swarms all over the map so there is 0% chance to run away from one side of the map to the other they are just simple everywhere they fire with 100% accuracy making it impossible to dodge and the block cant do much when you have 20 guns firing at you from every direction you can only use your skills about 4 times before they run out and they last for about 5 seconds and dont do very much fighting back is pointless because there are droids that regen enemy shields at an insane rate making them unkillable cameras spot you from a mile away which spawn sentry turrets and laser wires that destroy your shield in one hit and if you think about hiding in a closet for a second to let your shield recharge they will just camp you in there and every time you respawn you will die again in seconds and multiplayer doesnt help even if you have more people the game will simply add more enemies and those enemies will sound the alarm which will spawn even more enemies and its just 0% chance to survive and a lot of people will say hey man you got to play a lot to get better stuff and sh but im saying hey man its like playing counter strike 1 vs 50 and you only get a handgun and yes you may kill about half or more but either way you will die and you wont acomplish anything if youre looking for a good game out there try borderlands 2 its also coop campaign there are way more guns better story line way more fun since its open world there are character abilities and its 100% better than this garbage

if you are looking for a game that is poorly optimized both performance and network wise as well as has a chance of killing your connection then look no further as this marvel of modern game development made by incompetent monkeys is exactly what you are looking for with amazing 4 maps copypasted as well as the most generic mission types gives you the greatest amount of replayability up to date you also have dozens of weapons to choose from all with copy paste stats animation and only different skins for making it easy to select which of them work best for your gameplay style 66610 would close the devs to the same cage with sirgay titsoff with his warzsurvivor stories and le sellout rockit with his dayz and throw the cage to the bottom of the sea

the gamestyle and scenery is amazing in this game the concept is amazing the tenos and even the grenier concept is just aweenspiring but there is one thing that seriously hinders the game and thats the gameplay itself the ranking is confusing when you go to melee someone you lunge rediculosly forward with a hard to pinpoint autolock meaning if you miss youre flailing your arms about until you actually see the enemy then you have a chance of hitting them stealth in this game is horrable your guns make a loud noise and youll have more fun sneaking around the enemies than waiting for them to be vulnerable to get an item that would be stealthy takes a lot of time to get and by then youre already at the first boss moving on to the second boss sprinting and crouching dont mix in this game at all if you feel that holding to sprint would be nice guess what you have the option but if you chose press to sprint youre flailing about at rediculose speeds reducing accuracy and precission immensly the camera shakes around and your character looks around super quickly even with the mouse speed at 25% assassinating enemies is not something like youd find in halo reach or halo 4 the enemies in warframe need to be in a state where they arent suspecting anything at all and even if you get to their precouse backside while they expect you you cant activate the assassination sequence or the assassination hitbox is the width of a hair making it relitively impossible to do while it is a free to play game you can expect long grinding seasons and if youre a lone wolf this can be extremely daunting as the bosses and missions will get repetative over time before you can even reach earth im disapointed greatly that this game had everything i expected but the controls setup along with the new hud makes it much more harder to pinpoint what the heck youre doing and there for not an enjoyable experiance at all

its fun but gets boring really fast in this game u can run around with some ppl shoot and melee enemies thats about it it not difficult at all and offers almost no cooperation i felt like the coop mode was more like a race to the finnish i can tell alot of work was put into the game and it runs smoothly it really looks like a nice game but after u play a couple levels ull find thats its kinda like the same thing over and over again i really dont mean to downvote it its not really a bad game i only down voted it because i personally dont enjoy it its kinda good for a free game its got alot of customization and main menu stuff but the actual gameplay dispite the graphics can be found in like a internet browser arcade game

probably one of the wosrt designed games ive ever seen much of the gameplay revolves around grinding and farm which is fine however getting new gear and upgrading to better weapons and items with out having somebody help you skip the normal progression that progression is a very stunted experience the game honestly expects you to go through probably over a hundred hours of gameplay with your base frame and limited weapon selection of credit purchasable guns theres some decent frames and gear blueprints early on but some of the components only drop in areas you wont be seeing for a long time or drop from bosses either case results in a lot of painful dull grind that just isnt fun i was lucky to have a friend help me skip this problem so i got access to a lot of farm i would otherwise not have access too now gaining access to areas to farm for better gearsounds easy right just do missions and progress nav points except some of the nav points that arent option to continue progression actually require multiple players and are often semidifficult missions me with my twinked gear could do these missions but virtually every attempt would fail due to allies who are using awful weapons and frame or getting allies worlds above my level and failing my own role in the level due to being so underleveled i dont mind that such a mode exists but making it a mandatory part of normal progression is just stupid on top of all that upgrading your rank which determines what youre allowed to even attempt building has a test and pass or fail there is a 24 hour cool down on doing another test so there is actually a hard locked limit on how fast you can progress some of the tests are also very specifically geared towards certain frames meaning failure in some of these tests is relatively easy if youre using one of the mostly awful base frames the game by design just encourages blind farming and goes out of its way to ruin what little fun can be found by having overall bad design choices on top of all that this inhuman farm just results in frames so outrageously overpowered it actually removes all skill aspects to the game who wants to farm for almost a thousand hours just to play the game by mashing an aoe attack button that kills 23 rooms of enemies awful game i was very shocked at just how bad this game actually is

warframe f2grind warframe is an interesting mix between a third person shooter tied in with a basic xp system and diabloesk looting the game handles and looks very well the gameplay itself is very straight forward youre given a warframe that has specific areas of expertise and play styles by playing the game you obviously earn xp which allows you to further customer your warframe weapons and even a floating companion that can aid you in various capacities warframe isnt the only game that suffers from p2begood inherently this isnt a bad thing for warframe since its very pve focused with that said it can be very discouraging for new players to feel useless and left out of a lot of the later game content should you not pay to advance yourself now obviously there are plenty of folks that did the good ol grind to the top and good for you if youre one of those players for the average gamer though i think the grind of progression is fairly steep and adds to that discouragement for new players the grind isnt even particuarlly rewarding in regards to the actual missions it almost breaks down to lets run through these missions as quickly as possible over and over again why is there that incentive in place to encourage players to buy platinum to cover up a thin or nonengaging story line youll have to be the judge for yourself bottom line for me if youre the type of player who enjoys a good solid grind for that small light at the end of the tunnel this game may be for you for those looking for some cheap thrills and a casual experience you may want to find different waters to play in

warframe  well there is not a lot to say about it after 40 hours even without discovering the depths of the game i stop i like  there are 3 different warframes from which you can choose one when you finish the tutorial  there is a tutorial  there is a kind of a story mod with missions like stealth assassination defense etc  you can play almost any mission coop  there are around 370 moods to choose from which determine your skills  your warframe can choose almost any weapon or mod what i did not like at all  my game crashes all the time after the new patch some people have same issues the game offers this solution httpswarframecomhardwarefail  the revives in missions are limited per day there are four  crafting good weapons and other stuff takes hours of game play finding blueprints and the resources  the first warframes you can choose from are really bad compared to the others my opinion  there is no lvl cap for missions so you have new players or experienced players which just solo the whole game  almost everything can be bought for real money  there are a lot of game play bugs  most players dont care about team play all in all i give warframe a 410 mostly because my game is crashing all the time but still in my opinion there is a lot of work that has to be done by the admins and the development crew your flaming ace

i really really enjoyed my first few hours with the game the action is fast and fluid and the early missions are straightforward and fun however the difficulty soon spikes to an outrageous degree and missions become a nightmare of confusing direction and deadly enemies with a mystifying ability to spawn behind you coupled with a very very slow progression scheme that is stingy with new abilities and weapons which makes it boring and a generally dark lighting scheme which makes it hard to see whats going on i am no longer having fun warframe had an amazing opportunity to be great its fundamentals are solid but it comes from the school of make people pay to advance faster school of thought rather than well make it so fun people will be happy to spend money perspective thumbs down

difficult to understand layout very unclear on any basic mission objective as the game just throws you in battle and refrains from telling you how to do anything but walk and shoot i feel like in order to be half as good at this game as anyone else i have to spend too much time on it or i have to buy everything very good movements and gameplay but i just cant see myself being a fulltime player

it started out rather excellent beautifully designed and fast paced full of interesting action very quickly this degraded to utter repetition and hours of grinding for gear that would become useless once something better came out dont get me wrong it can be fun but its not as engaging as it could have been

well this game was fun in the start but then it just starts getting boring you cannot play more than 4 hours of this without realizing that you can find alot better free2play games than this 410

i used to love this game ive been playing since it was first released and it was amazing but the 18 beta patch changed too much and screwed over the older players our amazing gear and suits lost that awesomeness and the game became paytowin all in all it is a good game but not something i would recommend

every update make the game worse and now you can buy everything in the game for cash so there is no progression you can buy anything you need form other players and its not even pvp so the progression was all the gameplay and now its gone

awesome gameplay but these guys are really greedy inless you feel like grinding the same maps for like 40hrs to get tot he next place youre not gonna be getting a new weapon or suit unless you pay atleast $20 also no one plays this game from what i can see i was waiting in a room for like 20min waiting for someone to come around but no one came the levels are designed for atleast one other person else all what happens is that you run outta ammo since the starter stuff is so scrub that it takes 110 of your ammo to put one guy down dont even try to download this guys all theyll do is nickel and dime you untill you figure out that the free running os gitchy and unrefined

i hate to say this but warframe just isnt fun to play i liked the concept at first and put a couple of hours into it but its just droll the gameplay is repetitive and the downtime between combat is mind numbingly boring i do like the exploration available within levels but the lackluster combat is a huge turn off its not exactly p2w since you arent competing against other people but the best weapons and warframes can be purchased for real money and in some cases this is the only way to get those items if the gameplay gets any better in the future i may reconsider but for now warframe doesnt get a recommendation from me

this game is a hit and miss for me i really like space themed games with thrown in syfy like the next person but this games problems lay in the fact your team mates will teleport due to latency issues the maps are kinda too big the maps i have take me 23 hours just to complete them repetition most of this game is just centered around the same enimies

so much potential for a good game right here and almost palpable but wasted by bad dev choices this game has turned in to a cashgrab artificial periodical nerfs to push new market weapons into players complete disregard of player effort to build up top tier items when new fotm stuff is introduced it is a fun game up to a point but when you start to really get into it its like opening a huge can of worms

other than the developer incompetence the endless grind the lack of endgame content [or really any fun content] and the power creep that makes magic the gathering blush and get a little moist theres not much to talk about in this game sure it looks pretty the art design is one of the few things they got right especially if you like weapons copied from each other or just given a couple gold plates and considered a whole new weapon a year ago i put a hundred dollars into warframe hoping that it would grow up and be a good game instead every time i joke about the worst move they could make they up the ante even further if you have a couple friends and you want to shoot dudes for a bit sure go ahead if you want to invest time and money there are a million other shooters out there often ones that dont hide behind its a beta while heavily monetizing every single aspect of the game

if you arent willing to dump youur entire wallet into this game i would recommend not buying this game im not saying it is impossible to buy things with in game money but it iis difficult and the gameplay is entirely not laid out well i had a fun first couple of days with it but became very monotonous with each level and i became very irritated slowly realizing that this was a pay to win game

my opinion for people seeing this game grow from start got to confusing for people geting in new to confusing to beat high level it is called demagesystem 20 and it has ruined this game for me every enemytype has its own weaknesses and resistances so far so good but you can not say greneer in general is most of the time weak against this infestet is weak against that noo near every single enemy  2 or 3 are one group  are weak against this and that but this one out of that group is resistant gainst what all others from this group are weak against wtf why did you rip the ease of this game out and pour in pure tactics not beat able by the style of the game but not enouth about 6 months ago in this game  where it was a third person shooter and a hack and slash mix  you could raid a level 32 planet solo it was tricky but possible the difficulty of the enemy has been multiplyed by 2032 a player with a tenno on level 30 you can fight enemies at level 25 if you are insane as i started playing again i thouht dont push to had start with a level 25 planet as i could defeat these with ease befor i had no chance and died all 4 times possible per day in this very first mission after not playing warframe for about 6 months because of a false ban by using nvidias 3dtv play that was right after they activated the ac i never got an apology i try it again with about 60 houres of playtime i was quite used to its nice and easy style of combat now after playing 12 missions im close to stop playing again i can not tell for every one but as starting a new is not possible in this game it is unbeatable hard i will try a little longer and change my mind if there is just a smal thing blocking me from having fun again if not reconsider playing a game changing so much to the worse

the game is shallow there is nothing more than grind to this game besides a nice production value the new player experience is horrendous due to new players being unable to obtain the items required to progress in the gamewarframe is exclusively stats over skill and it shows everywhere in the game enemies are nothing more than dumb bullet sponges that grow even more bloated as you progress through the game warframes reliance on cheap rng to extend its shallow depth is abhorrent and fills nearly every part of the game while rng in a game is understandable at times warframes over reliance sends it on a nose dive into inevitable mediocrity the best example of this abused rng is the hydroid warframe normally to get a new warframe you are required to beat a boss several times until you get their parts while this is somewhat reasonable warframes poster child of update 13 requires you to first hunt down specific enemies that rarely spawn on a specific planet these enemies have a random elemental weakness that you cannot predict and are very resistant to all other damage types defeating these enemies causes them to drop a beacon one of five types that take different amounts these beacons are than crafted into a one time use key that allows you to fight a boss once once you have beaten the boss you than get a random part of the frame but the game never takes into account the parts you already have leaving you often with a part you already havebeyond this you are now stuck farming for about one to two hours before another hour of building the key finally getting to fight a fifteen minute battle that leaves you likely with a part you already have with the introduction of tier 4 keys rng has become even worse upon its release along with a new prime warframe  the drop tables for the tier 4 missions were heavily bloated with up to twenty items being duplicated all to dilute the drop tables and ensure player take longer to get the items they want warframe lacks any compensation for player skill enemies often have instant knockdown attacks with little to no telegraphing energy leach enemies that instantly remove all of your ability energy without any warning or effect they have rare enemies with rare drops that only seem to appear when a certain faction has taken over one specific level  certain crawlers for those who are familiar  player progression through the game is merely tracked by how much the p0layer has used weapons and often this mastery rank is completely irrelevant to play new players being taxied to end game levels to get items they cannot progress through the game without orokin cells for that seer is a nice example  in closing welcome to warfarm grinding simulator 2014

slide on the floor and use super powers to fight the same three types of enemies across a solar system of narrow hallways and bright colors warframe is a mix of most every scifi shooter game from the past decade and did prove amusing in parties with friends however the amusement was short lived limited levels and enemy types accompanied by lengthy grinding caused me to burn out rather fast on the title there are also pay to win weapons thankfully the game is cooperative however this will not stop public players from joining a game and stealing all the drops note i did spend 55hours with this game and im told the developers plan to release many more things including an open world play mode

dont get me wrong here this game is fun but it is the most annoying game i ever played for starters the game developers use most of the game levels almost every time including dialogue its the most annoying repetitive nonsence ive ever listened to in a game for the past year also id like to point out the combat for starters sword combat blows so hard because when ever you tried to attack head on the enemy is like yeah right like that sword is going to hit me im gonna slap it out of yo hand complete bs id give this game 5\10 not great not horrenous

wellwarframe is all grindingthe devs arent the greatest its super repetitive the mini games are impossible the community is bad and they always have some new warframe or wepons right after you wasted your time making the older ones and its pay to winfor instance you cant just make weapons or warframes you have to wait 12 hours to 3 days for things or pay to complete it faster and they are making thing harder and harder to get so you will give up your cash and there are some things you cant even get without paying money like some exclusive stuff or special armor and before you just gathered a few recources to make the weapons but now its like you gotta make these dual pistols to make these dual pistols and to make dual pistols to make the new dual pistols you need a pistol to make 1 of the pistols and you need 2 of those pistols to make the dual pistols to make the new dual pistols its ridiculous that was confusing wasnt itwell id give the game a 410 at the most

another f2p skinner box that barely qualifies as a mmo with each major update the developers continue to dilute the drop tables nerf abilities and game mechanics that they decide doesnt fit in with their idea of good gameplay and continuously introducing new content that would be nice if it actually provided more than maybe a day at most of content to actually go through instead of addressing the problems with the content they shove into this game and expect you the player to bugtest because this game is still in beta digital extremes rather just ignore the glaring problems because there are still people dumb enough to waste money on this game for fancy accessories and the latest items so they dont have to suffer the awful rng at best you can expect this game to be a fun casual grinding experience but if you have half a brain youll likely begin to realize how flawed warframe is the more you play it

i used to enjoy this game quite a bit but not so much now the amount of time you need to put into this game is insane just to get a few parts for a weapon due to the over saturation in certain areas of the game practically everything in this game is based off of rng random number generator this includes resources enemies youll incounter mods all the way to the rewards thatll an alert will have the amount of time you will spend grinding in this game for items is not worth the reward anymore if youre looking for a game to waste time with go for it just be ready to put thousands of hours into this game if you hate games with lots of grind and farming this is the wrong game

there isnt really much that sets this apart from other games dont know why people call this a masterpiece of game design and dont know why people hyped this up so much heres what i understand about the game from the countless videos and 2 hours that i played of the game  endless grindwalls and microtransaction temptations at every meaningful gameplay decision  undocumented stealth nerfs and obfuscating excuses for these changes by developers  unfinished projects explained away by the promise that these features will be fixed at some point in the future  a lack of transparency between developers and players  a clear lack of direction for exactly what the game wants to accomplish  game developers who constantly run away from their mounting selfcreated problems overall rating 310 next game please

operation false profit is complete trash there was very obviously no quality control in this event i am not going to restate what everyone else is saying so i am just going to copy paste just4tehlulzs response so we realize nobody likes monotony hell de even says they hate having to run one mission 5 times for an invasion what do they do for the new operation makes us have to run it a minimum of like 12 times this isnt even including bugs stupid  rng which makes it not spawn and other uncontrollable factors with these taken into account the number is closer to 25 or 30 were gonna be as transparent as possible youre about as transparent as chinas water with this event de you didnt share with us that all offerings give you the same amount of points while one takes quite literally 5 times longer to do furthermore its pretty damn insulting that you guys advertised this as an event to make good amounts of money along the way but you think people who are willing to drop 100k on some stupid glitchy card and most likely not actually get compensated with due to bugs give half a  about 1120k credits that amount is laughable considering the amount this event has taken from me due to bugs finally either you guys must be trolling or your new concepts for enemies as of late has been complete trash we already hate perma cc and stupid  scoprion hooks what do you give us an enemy that makes the jackals special ability like a ing dad joke while being able to pull and drag you if the normal release of these enemies is even remotely close to what they are now it will be ing disgusting this event has been so egregious and frustrating that it is physically exhausting

i want to recommend this game i really do i just cannot in good faith recommend something that has all the right components but willfully chooses to put them together so badly that it becomes unplayable without spending enormous amounts of cash what am i complaining about free to play mentality let me start by saying this warframe can be really fun with its coop play procedurally generated levels different game modes and huge range of weaponswarframemod options it certainly possesses the qualities that one looks for in an engaging and fun game unfortunately you can and will find yourself completely unable to progress or enjoy any of the fun features unless youre willing to spend real world money and heres why what bad developers do when it comes to f2p games is carefully design the games so that they are unwinnable for players who dont spend real world cash on the game the players get hooked then frustrated and then either ragequit or spend lots of money so that they have a chance to win this strategy works but is incredibly scummy and in no way deserves to be supported warframe performs this on many levels and has definitely lost my respect because of it to begin with the game starts you off with basic storyline missions which are fairly straightforward easy fun and more or less teach you how to play thats fine in fact they even let you choose your starting weapon and warframe which is great customization right off the bat it also works great for you in the first dozen or so missions until the questline is over just enough time to get you hooked into the game then comes the stick several missions in you will learn that this innocent weaponwarframe selection is one in which you can actually make a bad choice which essentially cripples you for every mission going forward at least until you get a new warframeweapon combo see the game doesnt ramp up the difficulty it just ramps up enemy hp and damage and the annoying hacking minigames and does so completely irrespective of the levels that it claims to be designed around this quickly leads to you getting out of your league in nearly every single mission most of which are required to be completed in order to unlock the new content essentially content progression works like this want a new warframe you can buy the blueprint for an ungodly amount of credits which are essentially game currency oh wait you mean you want to play with the warframe no no you need to build all of the warframe parts first how do you do that thanks for asking the game wont tell you but youll learn from other players that you basically have to do special boss missions a million times to find the blueprints for the warframes components blueprints which by the way also have huge credit and resource costs associated with them oh the resources you farm those from planets which you unlock from doing higher level missions and beating bosses what do you mean you cant beat the higher level missions solo oh you have a terrible warframeweapon combo well get a new warframeweapon then see how it loops back in on itself youre too weak to do the missions on your own so you try to get new weapons or warframes thats when you learn that you dont have the resources to build the new weaponsframes even when you do have the huge amounts of credits required the resources require planets you dont have access to the planets require missions you cant beat theres only two ways out of this loop of stupid and the first involves spending a huge quantity of real world cash to bypass the games requirements platinum real world cash gets you basically everything in this game from rush building items that would otherwise take literal days to build to buying weapons and warframes outright without having to collect a single resource to buying all of the rare and valuable mods or whatever from other players who spent the time to actually earn them its clear the developers knew exactly what they were doing when they made the missions impossible for new players they were creating a cash trap the second way of getting resources involves piggybacking this is technically an mmofps so that means theres other players around now you can go on the main chat and beg higher level players to let you tag along on their missions which is a decent way of earning the credits and resources required for doing literally anything in the game only problem is that youre then stuck following uber players around as they play the game and you watch you literally cannot harm the high level guys they are fighting and you die in one hit so youre more or less forced to trudge through mission after mission waching other people play in the hopes that someday youll be allowed to join in this is not fun this is not gameplay this is boring and frustrating and is the equivalent of being on an olympic sports team and being asked to follow the team around with a camera instead of playing wait i hear you ask what about players who are your level well speaking from an oceania perspective those dont even exist i cant tell you how many times ive sat waiting on a mission screen for someone anyone to come join me nobody does thats because theyre all busy piggybacking with high level players since the games progression is broken and moneybased in other words forget matchmaking even if you did find people your level youd probably also find that they were too weak to help much or a hindrance in the several missions which require stealth i wont even get into the terrible mechanics of stealth here but just know that its like assassins creed 1 if your assassin was a shopping trolley and enemies possessed the eye of sauron since once they see you they will never not be able to see you the bottom line is that warframe has so many tantalizing and interesting options which it then locks away in a gilded cage and tells you that you either need to pay for them with endless hours of your life or with real world money the irony is that i was willing to actually spend money on this game until i saw how badly they mistreat their nonpaying players and i just didnt want to be a part of that kind of system so ill be keeping my money and the hours of my life id otherwise have wasted on this game and investing both in something more productive and less horrifyigly abusive to its playerbase

this game has a horrible economy model that will sooner or later force you to either stop playing or pay real money for ingame goods the core gameplay is pretty fun and the graphics and aesthetics are close to perfect  original enemy designs excellent effects stunning tilesets wonderful ship designs  you name it the customisation is fantastic but it comes at a cost the only colours you have to paint your warframe and weapons with are dulleddown muddy colours with multiple shades of the same colour and not much inbetween you have to pay money to buy colours you get only 2 warframe slots and not nearly enough weapon slots for a varied loadout this forces you to constantly either sell old weapons [ie one of the 3 riflessecondariesmelees] to make room for a new one or go the sensible route and trade items for platinum in the universal chat what this involves is organising to meet up in either your dojo or the buyers dojo which must have a trading hub this isnt actually that bad until you consider the alternative to buying items with platinum and that is grinding crafting one warframe for example requires you first to get the blueprints for each of their parts the warframes system blueprints their chassis blueprints their helmet blueprints and their body you can often only get these blueprints from certain boss missions  but theres no guarantee you wont get a blueprint you wont already have then once you have all the blueprints you need a general warframe blueprint despite having a blueprint for each of the warframes parts you need to buy or find another one  and then it comes down to the actual crafting what this involves is roughly a 25000 credit cost to build each part  and then hundreds of each specified material at least one of which will be either an extremely rare drop [again from a boss] or something that can only be bought for platinum [read real money] not only is this expensive it is also timeconsuming  or rather it takes a given amount of realtime for each item to be crafted youre looking at 24 hours for a weapon or body part youre looking at about 3 to 5 days for a whole warframe of course the only reason this time barrier exists is so that they can shoehorn in another way for you to hand over real money  speeding the crafting process up costs yet more platinum this overall is a great game with excellent potential ruined by greedy developers ive seen too many people defending the game citing the fact that the devs have to eat too  it should not be at this cost so many other games have working economies whereby you can buy ingame items using real money but without having to  in other games it is a choice rather than a necessity

so to start off my review of this game beforehand a long time ago this game used to be one of my favorites but now with the constant hotfixupdate failing due to internet connection reset or it simply not ever downloading the updatehotfix i have grown sick of the fact that i cannot play this game during the weekdays due to the fact i actually need my sleep the update servers must be connected in some form or manner to the log in and maybe even game servers as during normal mass play times the updater simply just doesnt update the game many threads have been made and none answered by developers which pains me to say i would love for the updater to actually use my download speed over just not download at all or at painfully slow speeds until this painfully slow or nonexistent speed is fixed up it is really hard for me to want to recommend this game to any of my friends

dont play waframe for a lot of different reasons the most obvious being the fact that everything is behind a paywall you cant advance at any pace without dropping money you can buy blueprints for warframes and weapons through the market with in game earned currency but unfortunetly you will never be able to unlock them because the materials needed to make said item require a key to be bought with platinum the purchasable currency to even unlock the levels stages tiers needed to farm the item you need players with bought weapons will be stronger than you pvp is a mess its even hard to progress through the story alone because you have a limited number of everything a f2p should always follow riot games pay model pay to look cool not to have an advantage over anyone else willing to drop a little cash to be better than you period

one word review disappointing more details this is a game that starts off really promising interesting controls large variety of weapons numerous ways to level up and progress seems like it has it all unfortunately it crumbles under its own weight numerous ways to level up turn into an extended grind game that is overwhelming the large variety of weapons turns into a double edged sword which requires an explanation of the mastery system each weapon warframe and anything else you can take with you to level up has a cap of level 30 the levels that you acquire during gameplay all contribute points towards a mastery system the mastery system caps how much progress you can make in a given day towards other aspects of the game there is a faction type system in a game called syndicates the items offered by these syndicates are generally considered extremely good and cannot be acquired any other way the problem with this syndicate system is that the points you can acquire each day is capped at a rather low number add to this problem with points that are capped universally you may have 10000 faction points you can make in that day but thats across all factions in certain syndicate themed missions you can search for insignias that you can turn in to a vendor for additional syndicate points sometimes worth more points than the mission themselves but there are at max 8 of these in a given mission and it is an exhaustive search through very large missions that can sometimes border on futility the worst part is if you decide to do these missions with other people but they decide they dont feel like searching for all of them and rush to the mission end point you will be forced to end the mission after a 1 minute timer you cannot replay these missions and if it ends early you could be out of potentially thousands of points naturally i did most of these missions solo even though the rest of the game recommends and is designed for group play i will add i also did spy missions solo as even 1 person in your group triggering an alarm can lead to the entire group failing the mission the biggest problem with the mastery system and where the game really collapses under is own weight is leveling the weapons there are so many filler weapons in this game that are commonly called mastery fodder that acquiring these mastery points becomes a chore it takes time to level weapons made all the worse by leveling weapons that are weak and not fun to use you can tell very quickly when a weapon you are using is terrible this is aggravated by the fact that you are limited to how many weapons warframes etc that you can have in your inventory unless you are willing to buy premium currency which of course costs real money you cannot increase your inventory size that has been an issue since the game came out years ago along with many other issue which i will go into later numerous weapons and warframes that you might have actually liked will be sold and discarded all because you dont have space for them unless youre willing to fork over a lot of money the game gets to the point where you might be looking at hundreds of dollars of investments if youre willing to make significant progress in this game the day and age that we live in with steam sales bundle packs and numerous other sources of price discounts for quality games makes the $50$60 retail game almost a thing of the past this game will be looking for much more money out of your pocket in addition to leveling up the weapons for mastery points you also level these weapons for mod slot points at level 30 you have 30 mod points to empower your weapon the mods also require leveling up however they dont level up from use but rather by sacrificing other mods to level them up in addition to sacrificing mods in this process you also use up credits which is the games fictional currency this can be one of the most expensive parts of the game is terms of credit use unfortunately the developers of the game seem to be aggressively cracking down on ways to farm credits which in and of themselves are still excessive time sinks leveling mods and farming credits are one of the longest processes in the game however digital extremes is all too happy to offer ways to boost your credit income or level up mods for your platinum in their premium stores i think it says enough that one of the most popular store purchases are fusion cores which help level up your mods at an extremely overpriced platinum amount i want to say it was the equivalent of $5 but i could be wrong either way it was still overpriced given the amount of other things digital extremes wants you to buy to further exacerbate this issue with leveling up guns mods and currency comes the addition of orokin catalysts and reactors these are extremely rare items in terms of acquiring them from the game itself once every 2 weeks dedigital extremes will offer a mission to acquire one of these items not one of each but just one of them and occasionally they will have some odd mission pop up that offers one but at most you are looking at a handful in a given month a reactor is needed for warframes and sentinelsa pet to double their mod point capacity and the catalysts are for weapons at max level this takes the mod points from 30 to 60 as you can imagine these are extremely important to get the most use out of a given weapon or warframe as these are extremely rare you will have your best luck acquiring them by paying platinum in the premium shop as it can be an agonizingly long time in reality to acquire one in addition once these are attached to a weapon or warframe it cannot be removed you cannot pay any type of currency to do this once attached it is gone forever you can try to contact customer service but not only are you going to be waiting multiple days there is no guarantee they will help you out the mod leveling mastery point leveling need to acquire orokin parts credit farming weapon leveling and rare resource acquisition are an extremely frustrating part of this game due to needing to dedicate significant portions of your life to farming these or pay real money i will touch on resources as these are also a significant time sink with every weapon warframe and whatever else you need you must craft it first you have a personal ship that you use to enter each mission and inside this ship are stations you can use to level up your mods buy things from the store or craft your equipment to craft anything you need credits and resources resources are acquired from killing enemies breaking open crates and chests or killing bosses the rarest resources are most easily acquired by killing bosses a rare resource is not guaranteed but it is still your best way of acquiring themor the premium shop some of the best equipment can require 10 of these rare resources or more this is in addition to waiting long periods of time for the crafting process warframes take 3 days to build not to mention the 12 hours for each component to build before you can use them in the warframe building process weapons take from 12 to 24 hours you might be excited to acquire this new piece of hardware but youll be waiting multiple days more than likelyunless you pay platinum this is a recurring trend in this game in addition to the resources requirement and credits some of the very best weapons require farming high level void missions for blueprintsparts multiple different blueprintsparts are required for a given weapon or warframe part of the problem with farming these missions is that they require keys to enter you acquire these keys by farming other missions or by purchasing them using the limited syndicate points or premium currency unfortunately i am out of room here but all i can say is stay away

this is a fun game the parkour is fun and imaginative the weapons look and sometimes feel really cool i personally think that playing a mission just with your weapons is good as it is and it makes you want to strafe roll find cover however my problem is as it goes into using primarily abilities i am very picky with my warframes in the sense that i do not like the cast and forget feel to most frames and the worst thing is that those ones are usually the best it takes the fun out of being skilled and always pay attention to your stats or die that being said i think my favourite warframes would be reworked excalibur ash ember volt these are out of the ones ive used i thing i love about these frames most is like apart from defence and mobile defence they are very versatile and imaginative i always had to pay attention to everything to stay alive and that just slightly made my blood pump it made me more alert it immersed me more these are some things that i like in a game to be able to enjoy it i feel that if you really wanna play the game to its fullest you must be a complentionist and 2 things really stop that 1 some things take way too long to craft for example a warframe takes 72 hours for the actual frame to craft and a further 12 hours minimum for the components not everybody has a lot of free time to be flexible and this caused extreme waits where you cant find much to do the inventory system is a bit stupid you need to spend an ingame currency called platinum to get extra slots 12 for weapons and 20 for frames you start with 50 these spent platinum never go back into the system meaning in the end your buying a 1time use item if you splash the cash on platinum which i dont think anybody would ever do in real life you might be saying well food is a 1time use well that is something we absolutely need and couldnt live without this is something for a bit on entertainment also de if ur reading this games generally benefit more economically if they dont almost force buying stuff for a game a nice system would be where spent platinum goes into random event awards or weekly quests that drag out for a couple hours in total the bosses are a bit of just really strong normal enemies they dont have too many patterns that you have to go through to defeat them you either go in die go in take ages to kill them or go in and wreck them it would be really nice if more bosses had pets or mechs like say alad v or vey hek and those mechs randomly choose an event from a list that each has a counter and every few events you get a chance to deal direct damage this would give an excuse to give bigger rewards for killing those bosses assassins like the stalker are a bit bland you wreck them or you get rekt and the chance is so low it would be better if they actually followed your node paths and slowly try to predict where you will go next making them more likely to find you however if you find him in a mission you can get the jump on him then after a couple times you can track him to his lair and have an all out boss fight and get his weapons that way maybe his boss sends henchmen after you and you must erradicate him you they are getting on ur nerves nekros prime i think the clans wars should be more indepth maybe you are doing a clan raid or something and a rival shows up everybody is confused and  and all hell breaks loose in the end i enjoy this game it just takes too long to enjoy and then you waste away the fun waaay too quickly i dont recommend this game unless you are extremely patient and dont get bored easily

this honestly is a very well made game at least i think so it mixes rpglooting elements commonly found in hack nslash games with a 3rd person shooter game like gears of war for example the problem is the lack of variety throughout the entime game youll be leveling up your gear grinding for hard to find mods and resources all to fight the same basic variety of enemies they have just 3 factions of enemies in the entire game from start to finish epic bosses they finally added one with the orokin derelict missions but other than that they are all non meaningful and easily forgotten i played this game for a while until i realized whats the point whats the point of grinding to find better gear to constantly fight the same enemies on the same levels in a world that never changes at all

this game is the biggest waste of time rip off i have ever had the misfortune to play unless you are either an idiot and like throwing money at a free game or have no life you will have no fun playing this game it is a gimmik i enjoyed it for around three hours after that i found out you need around 50  60 hours a week for farming and then when you finally have all the required parts for somethinf it takes anywhere from 12 hours to three days for it ot be complete this game is a pure waste of time i would rather gouge out my eyes with crab claws covered in salt and lemon juice then ever play this again

i started this game back in version 70 and it was amazing i spent enough time on it to make it worth spending cash on it and it didnt disappoint when update 10 came out i was a bit warry of the new ui and redone stamina system but all in all it was still great then version 11 came out they completely remade the damage system ruining many peoples builds changing the weaknesses of the enemies limiting your options dramatically melee weapons became almost useless formerly amazing guns were now junk and everything you spent money on was wasted the time and effort people put into this game when they loved it when it wasnt overcomplicated was good i loved the game but change is always makeorbreak for anything and in this case it broke me ill look back fondly on my time playing the game but that was a different time pros space ninjas graphics audio cons cash items are overpriced takes forever to craft things takes even longer to get the parts to craft them dont even get me started on neurodes damage 20 made things far more involved all the remakes of the maps are harder to navigate its now hard to distinguish enemies from friends and those from the terrain boss changes that make no sense harder to navigate the menus than it used to be your character even gets in the way now

the games repetitive and boringalso they screwed over like 90% of the pc fanbase that went to ps4 like myself by removing the transfer account option just so they could screw us out of our hard earned things in the pc version and all the money we spent alsoregarding the pc versionwhy does it not truly have full controller support you have it with your console versiona and the gui on the pc version has clearly been reworked for controllersso why do i still find myself constantly having to switch over to my mouse to use about 60% of the ui it just seems nonsensical to me also i feel like this game gets rewarded and praised for what aaa titles get cracked down for repetitive gameplay constant grind boring uninspired linear gameplay and level design you knowwhat every other pc player out there es at other shooters for also quite a bit of the game is a shade of browna last gen console thing that was constantly harassed and criticized sowhy isnt this for doing that all in all the hyposcrisy is ridiculous and so is the cash shopits give or take about 5 dollars for a new weapon and 1015 for a new warframe which is ludicrous sure you can earn them in gameby grinding out for like 30 hours hoping you get the right materialsand the right plansand have enough creditsand then to top it all off you have to wait as much as 3 days for it to be builtan even larger slap to the face and another roadblockand half the time it isnt even worth the effort its high grind lowreward is assinine and i hope this doesnt become a trend for future titles that this studio may publish

i do not like this game so far levels are confusing combat is repetative and the ui is poorly laid out i cannot figure out how to find make or otherwise equip new gear i cannot figure out where im supposed to get or equip new abilities character levels dont seem to provide any clear or obvious benefit if there are stats that level i do not know how to see them missions are lengthy and a pain in the  to finish with very unclear rewards players will randomly join and leave missions causing the difficulty to jump around during gameplay also ive been randomly forced into missions from the character and mission selection screens seemingly at random lastly the world seems completely linear i have not tried to play with my friends yet but the serial gated nature of the starting missions makes me wonder how easy that will be

i know im a harsh reviewer but some positive reviews of this game really baffles me the physics in this game have been programmed by an 8 years old your character moves and especially jumps in an horrendously wierd way like any time makes me say what and so you never know what to expect thus making it quite difficult to control and to make him do what you want to do yeah i suppose that if you play it extensively you can get accustomed to crappy physics too but why bother this makes melee combat a total joke ranged combat is not bad but its really not enough even more theres no pvp just coop

dont be fooled by my steam profile i have 400 hours on this game from before i started playing on steam the first few months were good but i left for a while because of work and computer issues when i came back the damage system was completely different and all of the maps and missions got very repetitive as my friends all left the game i noticed that the only reason that i played was because of the coop with my friends if you have no one to play with it gets pretty boring and repetitive

do you wish to grind for weeks to get one nwe item months for a warframe years for anything else well then this game is for you 3 runs of a level and you will know the other maps like the back of your hand everything looks the exact same the layouts are not really that random its grindy its repetative and there is no feeling of progression whatso ever why you ask because there is a cash shop and they want you to buy from there to get the best items and warframes and such you can the new ui causes so much frame lag that i actually had to turn everything down the old ui was better than this grabage they have now but you will never see it again the mobs they are all the same nothing special about them at all and the boss fights they are just the same mobs you have been fighting with maybe one or 2 special moves but they are still the same thing with lots of hp tho not a good game unless you feel like grinding for no joke weeks at a time to get what you need in the same map over and over and over again
not recommended
after spending 100s of hours playing this game i can verify that this game is initially extremely fun to play however once youve gotten to a certain point in the game where youve done all the missions and have certain weapons you prefer the game loses its sense of entertainment besides the fact that the game is already completely littered with irritating grinding scenarios just to be able to use a new gun or do a special mission theres no campaign nor any sign of the developers approaching a campaign any time soon another major issue is the huge lack of love for veterans in this game the games answer to dull gameplay is simply releasing more and more weapons and warframes warframes are ok but the ratio of weapons is ridiculous 1 decent late game weapon will get released to every 56 newbie weapons that get made and to a sense theres nothing wrong with that however anyone who plays games is going to know that going for late game is more important because it makes doing events and bigger more difficult missions easier its the point of becoming stronger yet this game bombards new players with too many weapons some of which are completely useless and finally the amount of involvement that whatever amount of story supposedly exists in this game is nonexistant the point of having the events and picking sides was for the players to determine the future of the games history and yet if everyone decides to side with the evil side the good side will always win or the developers try to make it a no brainer for the players by making one reward completely trash in comparison to the other sides reward i wish i could get back into this game but at this rate its almost like keeping up with a comic that you wish would move on and get to the point you check back in every month or so just to see whats changed or what hasnt happened and then you ignore it for another month or so its frustrating to say the least all in all its a well made game but the developers arent listening to the community like they said they would its a shame too

this game man ive played it a lot and in truth i cant honestly tell you why it isnt terrible no where close in fact but the developers just dont seem to want to advance it beyond anything more than a concept as a result there still is virtually no campaign to speek of the game consists solely of grinding the same missions sometimes 100s of times to get items and blueprints to build new weapons and frames and thats about it whats annoying is the fact that if the developers actually tried to make the gameplay beyond farming for farmings sake better then there is a lot of potential for a really good game here unfortunatly after having played since the middle of last year i cant really see this happening ever with each update comes more frames and weapons to grind but beyond small ui changes and fixes to bugs no progress in expanding the game is really made if you do decide to play this just bear in mind that beyond just farming for materials etc there is nothing else to keep your enjoyment a great concept let down by poor developement vision and foresight

warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play after those few enjoyable hours youll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in its combat enemies and game play the one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semifrequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the games systems new warframes and other tweaksfeatures its a good game to play casually though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding the upside to all of this is that the game is free so id recommend trying it out if youre looking for a quick fix try it out there are better games out there

warframe was fun for a while and running around as a space ninja is very cool but it ended up being very repetitive after a time having only 3 factions to fight in the same boring corridors got old very quick in addition the way the mod system is designed mean that weapon and warframe upgrading essentially becomes dependent on the games random number generator meaning that just playing for a long time does not guarantee any sort of improvement in a players stats it eventualy felt like a grind to just find the right mods and it causes players to rush through levels just to reach the end instead of having fun fighting the game is also very pushy about microtransactions by making some items completely unobtainable unless you purchase them with ingame money platinum and by making the creating of some items namely warframes very tedious to do on your own by requiring you to posess the blueprints for 3 different parts craft them each then craft the final warframe with yet another bluerpint by comparison you can purchase the completed frame along with a preinstalled catalyst an item that improves the mod capacity of a warframe for a few bucks i feel like ive had my fill of this game for now perhaps i will come back later if some serious changes are made to the progression system

i know technicaly warframe was based around the pve and all but one of the reasons i played it so long was to get better stuff and play with them in the pvp and now they have changed warframe settings so that everyone entering pvp is stuck with unrankedunmodded gear and frame so testing builds out in the pvp is no longer useful and testing out how your build holds up against others no longer works either now all that matters for the pvp is that you have the higher base stats the pve is ok but it seems like it gets a little too easy after a time with the right build and game type you coul literally endlessly destroy your enemies i use a simple valkyr with high ranked armor and a blade that drains hp for every hit with that alone i cannot be killed instantly and i can heal back everything it does to me so in a defense match i could literally just sit on the defend zone and cut up anything that comes especially if its an infestation map with only melee units atleast with ranged units you still need to dodge deflect and run around in order to cach your enemies but its pretty much the same thing for me the other pve game modes make it a bit tougher to tank and all since you have to move around quickly though a maxed rush mod fixes valkyrs weakness there and when in doubt just using ripline can get you around faster then almost anything else so i guess valkyr would be the cheapest warframe there is especialy with the hp drainin attack with the right mods you could probably make the other frames just as cheap though so its just a matter of your visual tastes on your character i guess anyway i probably wont be playing this game again unless they make a way to choose wether to have an unranked pvp or not atleast that way then if people wanna go with all unranked items its their perogative dont force unranked and unmodded items on everyone

warframe was a great game for a couple of week after that it got boring most of the map and mode are the same they just remodel the map most of the time youve going to be farming for the weaponwarframe parts the drop rate is it very good when you make a weapon or warframe it take to long like 12 hours if youve not going to rush it with real money the weapon and warframe on market can be purchased with real money like 10 to 30 dollar for it then you have you mod the weapon or warframe to make it more powerful the weapon and warframe slot are limited you have to spend real money to unlock some slot sure they give you 50 cash to buy thing but you cant use those 50 to trade with people sure you can trade with other people for the parts if you have the cash for it warframe have a lot of bugs and glitches the game have been updated quite a lot time and some old bug have not been fix yet the game keep crashing the chat log loading to long stuck in the menu while selecting a mission stuck in the loading screen engine crash server down a lot of times etc

the problem with this game is simple it never feels like youre progressing because every step you take just opens more and more meaningless grind opportunities and every update just piles more and more to it be a new frame weapon mod or resource that there are mods so essential to your progress locked behind a shit of a rng is one of the most stupid and hostile gameplay designs i have encountered add to that the gameplay changes they do every now and then nerfs that make your already  weapons completely useless changes to damage types and values new weapons that completely outclass the previous ones new resources that require more grinding etc and it all becomes meaningless and disheartening and if you want to play solo youre in for a world of hurt with so much grind rng locked content and 4 player balanced missions a lot of then required to unlock new planets and with it resources its not worth it so i stopped playing nothing changed nothing got better or made the game more fun or less of a chore quite to the contrary most of my playtime was spent trying to get the essential mods so that my weapons become useful enough to kill waves and waves of enemies quickly for me to solo through the missions and unlock new planets where i would repeat the same process while slowly gathering resources and blueprints to craft a marginally better weapon or frame that would become useless by the next update rinse and repeat ad infinitum

best free to play game out there in my opinion it takes time to build up your weapons and frames though that is the point of the game unlocking everything you can pay for items some are purely decorational some are weaponsframespets things you cant buythe best weaponsmods in the game if only every ftp game went with the no buying power model and then they changed everything and went back on about every promise they made in the days before there were more than just the excalibur prime

although the gameplay of this title is solid its also repetitive very repetitive not to mention the game suffers from bugs that its had for a long time which still havent been fixed and sometimes cant even update properly or at all and has that really annoying free to wait mechanic where you have to wait between twelve to seventytwo hours to bet an item that youre building unless you speed it up with a microtransaction

this game isnt all bad the gameplay resembles mass effect 3s multiplayer as was said multiple times though what i do need to say is that the last thing this game will do is hold your hand and tell you what to do i left the tutorial knowing how to run do some of the parkour and some of the other basics though i had no idea of mods getting materials and other things i mean most of my success was from playing mass effect and using some common sense though i feel quite helpless without my friends and i dont enjoy playing alone at all i dont expect tobe told about everything but the equipment part of the game is very confusing and very much turned me off the leveling up not affinity requires you to be put in a what i feel at least to be an extremely unnecessary and bland test you fight enemies in a computer generated landscape almost copypasted from assasins creed they dont tell you anything about it which feels quite weird the gameplay is pretty good and although my military buff side of me doesnt like the impracticality of designs for characters and weapons that is not at all a complaint because thats just opinion the core gameplay is fun but the grind and sheer scale of the game can be frustrating to overcome id give this game a 510 note this isnt gameinformer 510 is average in my books

im more so on the fence about wether or not to recomend it the game is fun no doubt but if you arnt willing to spend money its almost worthless effort you can get most items ingame without paying but you have to craft them and some parts are extremely rare colors for cutomization is very limited if you dont want to pay no alternative helmets can be obtained without paying the mastery tests that you have to beat to level up are lets face it broken they are extremely difficult if you dont want to pay next to impossible if you dont have or know what mods need to be equiped i had to beat the first test twice for it to count some missions spawn an infinite number of enemies ive been stuck on the same mission for the past 2 days because there are way too many enemies i would say wait till they fix some of this before getting it

while this game is fun and action packed it can get extremely repetative and pointless the game is fun to play with friends but it can be absolutely mindnumbing to play by yourself pros great graphics and lots of shiny environments action packed the different warframes have a few unique elements that make for some fun gameplay in theory you can build the warframes the ones you would usually have to buy cons game is super grindy environments while pretty become stale after a while you are basically in the same 4 or 5 different environments with slightly different layouts the system to level up cards to gain powers is interesting but again the grind little to nonexistant story certain warframes are completely unbalanced namely the ones you have to buy most things worth building take forever to create this was a fun game but at the end of the day i cant recommend it theres way too much grind and not enough going on behind the scenes this is a fun little coop game to play with your friends but youll quickly start to feel the repetition as you reach the 1015 hour mark there are some games that are super grindy but hide it well behind interesting gameplay a good story or a variety of builds to work towards this game is not one of them

a 3rd person overtheshoulder fps i personally didnt like the game the controls felt a little clunky whilst the graphics were nice a lot of the levels were poorly lit and it was hard to pick out the enemies teams were really hit and miss  with one person racing off to the finish leaving team mates behind the tutorial leaves you to pick from a number of planets across the solar system but the only choice is mercury  a little tip to say pick this first would have been nice

dont be fooled by my steam profile i have 400 hours on this game from before i started playing on steam the first few months were good but i left for a while because of work and computer issues when i came back the damage system was completely different and all of the maps and missions got very repetitive as my friends all left the game i noticed that the only reason that i played was because of the coop with my friends if you have no one to play with it gets pretty boring and repetitive

do you wish to grind for weeks to get one nwe item months for a warframe years for anything else well then this game is for you 3 runs of a level and you will know the other maps like the back of your hand everything looks the exact same the layouts are not really that random its grindy its repetative and there is no feeling of progression whatso ever why you ask because there is a cash shop and they want you to buy from there to get the best items and warframes and such you can the new ui causes so much frame lag that i actually had to turn everything down the old ui was better than this grabage they have now but you will never see it again the mobs they are all the same nothing special about them at all and the boss fights they are just the same mobs you have been fighting with maybe one or 2 special moves but they are still the same thing with lots of hp tho not a good game unless you feel like grinding for no joke weeks at a time to get what you need in the same map over and over and over again

after spending 100s of hours playing this game i can verify that this game is initially extremely fun to play however once youve gotten to a certain point in the game where youve done all the missions and have certain weapons you prefer the game loses its sense of entertainment besides the fact that the game is already completely littered with irritating grinding scenarios just to be able to use a new gun or do a special mission theres no campaign nor any sign of the developers approaching a campaign any time soon another major issue is the huge lack of love for veterans in this game the games answer to dull gameplay is simply releasing more and more weapons and warframes warframes are ok but the ratio of weapons is ridiculous 1 decent late game weapon will get released to every 56 newbie weapons that get made and to a sense theres nothing wrong with that however anyone who plays games is going to know that going for late game is more important because it makes doing events and bigger more difficult missions easier its the point of becoming stronger yet this game bombards new players with too many weapons some of which are completely useless and finally the amount of involvement that whatever amount of story supposedly exists in this game is nonexistant the point of having the events and picking sides was for the players to determine the future of the games history and yet if everyone decides to side with the evil side the good side will always win or the developers try to make it a no brainer for the players by making one reward completely trash in comparison to the other sides reward i wish i could get back into this game but at this rate its almost like keeping up with a comic that you wish would move on and get to the point you check back in every month or so just to see whats changed or what hasnt happened and then you ignore it for another month or so its frustrating to say the least all in all its a well made game but the developers arent listening to the community like they said they would its a shame too

this game man ive played it a lot and in truth i cant honestly tell you why it isnt terrible no where close in fact but the developers just dont seem to want to advance it beyond anything more than a concept as a result there still is virtually no campaign to speek of the game consists solely of grinding the same missions sometimes 100s of times to get items and blueprints to build new weapons and frames and thats about it whats annoying is the fact that if the developers actually tried to make the gameplay beyond farming for farmings sake better then there is a lot of potential for a really good game here unfortunatly after having played since the middle of last year i cant really see this happening ever with each update comes more frames and weapons to grind but beyond small ui changes and fixes to bugs no progress in expanding the game is really made if you do decide to play this just bear in mind that beyond just farming for materials etc there is nothing else to keep your enjoyment a great concept let down by poor developement vision and foresight

i only played for 15 minutes the intro and one mission then i was left to try and figure out where to go next and for some reason everything was locked off and i couldnt go further and tbh i couldnt care to go further if you enjoy it great but i found it to be esoteric and terse which is not a very good feeling to have by a new player maybe in the future when i feel like checking it out i will google some video tutorials on youtube but not tonight

honestly when i started i was enamored with it it looked cool frankly it looked amazing i loved the design aesthetics and how everything looked so great  but over time i grew disenchanted and began to see what the game was at its core its generic extremely generic a thirdperson shooter with all the worst elements of the freetoplay business scheme whose developers continually shaft and ignore their more reasonable users digital extremes has turned into a company of yes men with the head honcho going unquestioned by anyone because hes so extremely stubborn and they regularly stamp out anyone who calls them out on this genuine caring advice made for the sake of the future of the game is consistently ignored in favour of just cranking out another overpowered weapon or mod furthering the gamedestroying power creep instead of interesting mechanics that players would take time to explore or genuine challenges that would test players skills new content is instead hidden behind further and further layers of grind and rng grind within grind the best option is always to take the fastest route and obliterate something before it can retaliate and instead of implementing mechanics that would reward taking your time exploring or going out of your way to do something cool or gutsy cheap tricks are employed and mechanics such as invulnerability periods are introduced to bosses with no real way around them artificially extending fights challenge is introduced through the continual addition of either unblockable timeconsuming enemy attacks with no method of prediction or ridiculously highdamage area of effect power spam with a damageovertime effect that completely ignores everything and decimates your health  which by the way is nonreplenishable outside of getting lucky with a health orb off a random kill or checking every single locker and yet anything that would prevent or otherwise reduce the effects of these situations is made inefficient by the simple fact that brute forcing is always the most expedient and resourcesaving method tank characters with high shields that replenish quickly that have energy siphon and can recover energy without doing anything and are able to spam aoe damage with debilitating effects are the kings of the game and yet their response to this isnt to tweak the mechanics if the current system is encouraging a dominant playstyle but instead nerf the only suits capable of weathering the storm the only characters capable of weathering the storm without being tanks also happen to be the only characters that can simply avoid damage in its entirety 1 valkyr whose hysteria can make her totally invulnerable to all damage for a whopping one minute and change with the right minmaxing the only tradeoff is that it limits her to melee only but with recent and surprisingly not entirely disappointing buffs to melee shes still just as lethal even without her guns and seeing as hysteria is pretty much valkyrs only redeeming skill out of four maybe warcry counts there is no reason not to minmax the hell out of hysteria for maximum duration and power youll find that this is a common pattern with warframes honestly some dont even have one good skill only a mediocre one and three other terrible ones 2 loki or ash who can turn invisible and thus never ever be detected by anything they also happen to be the fastest warframes period so guess who the kings of playing solo are heck even in events lokis are pretty much all youll see because events are always either grindtastic or surviveathons it helps that his invisibility is marginally better than ashs two points brought up in that previous paragraph were the frequency of warframes having very few viable skills and then the concept of skill x but better rhino stomp an aoe skill does massive damage in a huge radius totally immobilizes enemies in aforementioned huge area for a straight eight seconds and has a second instance of damage that further damages enemies closer to rhino frost on the other hand has avalanche  an aoe skill that does similar damage within a similar range but merely staggers enemies for one maybe two seconds and has no second damage instance oh and in general the damage type employed by avalanche is worse for dealing damage to general enemies than the one adopted by rhino stomp frosts only other worthwhile skill is called snow globe a nearlyimpenetrable aoe projectile damage negation shield that happens to slow enemies to a crawl if they enter the area guess which one people use 95% of the time go on digital extremes has nearly no concept of scaling and has only been figuring out how it works fairly recently  albeit it still manages to elude their grasp many skills the bread and butter of the warframes are only viable in the very early game  a curious thing when warframes with such skills only become available towards the end of the games content their endgame is clanversusclan pvp in a game that they said would never employ pvp in any meaningful fashion anything they promise is typically several months late and many times more underwhelming than it was hyped up to be at this point im convinced that the game is kept on life support only because of an extremely loyal fanbase of yes men that basically figure that de can do no wrong its curious why would they believe that after de managed to destroy tribes ascend completely in the end warframe is just another game that starts out extremely promising and ends a swollen bloated mess of unfulfilled potential  it looks quite pretty however if you truly must play this game never pay a cent for it that was my folly and boy do i regret that it took so long for me to realize this what started out as a cool space ninja robot game with the potential for sweet parkour tricks and kills that held the potential for stealth turned into a generic cyborg space marine third person shooter with magic powers my honest suggestion is if youre truly interested in this game wait a year see if its turned into something decent by then because it sure as hell aint worth your money right now

like others here ive found warframe to be a total grindfest not only is it a grindfest digital extremes has built in a mess of frustrations just to make your experience that much more grueling postives  large and friendly group of players in the community youll find no shortage of people to grind with  good graphics  nice coop features you can play with friends in classic coop style negatives  it doesnt take long for the polish on the graphics to lose their luster as levels become tedious and repetative tilesets are randomly generated into sometimes nonsensical patterns and it doesnt take long before youve seen them all as there are few  there are few mission types and they repeat over several areas on the few tilesets so you see the same thing over and over and over and over again  grind grind grind while youre seeing the same thing over and over again you get to farm for things over and over again rinse and repeat  horrible documentation and introduction for new players get ready to have to study for a while and go to a lot of effort googling tutorials reviews of the different items reading up on all the little bits and pieces of the game on your own theres no real effort put in the game to help new players quickly get situated a lot of the player made tutorials and guides out on the web are outdated  you cant have more than 4 people in your squad so the coop features are limited however given the connectivity problems detailed below their servers and the game itself probably couldnt handle more  performance and connectivity issues their servers and their software are plagued with connectivity problems with seemingly no end in sight it becomes a problem when youre into a 40 to 60 minute run and suddenly the games chat servers go all wonky and cause the game to dump you back into the lobby theres been sporadic problems where players lag out trying to launch the game and log in you get a very definite feeling of playing at your own risk just on that alone posts are all over their forums regarding performance and connectivity so its a common issue and not just one person has seen or experienced  pointless time sink so after youve done all that farming and probably bought a few things with cash the devs will play the this is a beta card and update items in game so all that time and money that youve spent figuring out their convoluted system for gearing up properly is totally wasted as your character builds are rendered obsolete by their dev teams other thoughts they use the term beta rather loosely its a beta product on the market they accept cash and advertise specials on their micro transactions so its not really a beta its a commercial product that is unfinished and thats how it feels this makes their claims about the game being an open beta more dubious as it sounds like an excuse for shoddy execution and delivery and a get out of jail free card whenever they feel the need to overhaul update and nerf gear regardless of their promoting purchases for that same gear and build upgrades by their player base

the gameplay is entertaining and if you enjoy colecting and min maxing it is fun but the game still has many bugs and assort problems the in game market is completely inconsistant and the developers dont seem to have any intention of fixing it for example you can only trade if you are in a clan a guild of kind that bought a trading post and you are extremely limited to number of trades equal to level per day as well as a trading tax there are small bugs that have been in the game for months and are yet to be fixed as well nothing game breaking but anyoing to continue seeing heath orbs fall out of lockers and float there by far the thing that bothers me the most and in fact angers me is the in game market there are multiple game features that are basic to the game and one would assume would be apart of it that in fact you must pay real money to achive for example color and custimaztion i understand having to buy different models and complete cosmetic items but when the default color choices are not open to you unless you pay five dollars when your starting colors are one row out of many in unsaturated color options and you even have to pay five dollars to unlock the other rows in that unappealing color palet it seems a bit insane the worst thing of them all is the audacity to tell players and allow players to get items in game because yes you can buy almost all the items in the game for real money but you may also find and make them in game but what they dont make obvious at first is that you have limited storage space so if you buy a warframe or a gun with money you automaticly get the space for the item but if you were to make it yourself in game you do not get the alloted space and must buy platnium the real money in game curancy to even buy inventory space for you item over all the game is very fun but the constant need to buy things with real money and various small bugs as well as the idiot design choices for some game functions are holding the game back not to mention the game is horrible unbalanced as one can get to the point where nothing is really a chalenge

this game had promise it is too bad that it was ruined by the f2p pay model after only a few missions it forces the player into a grind session just like any other f2p game instead of focusing on game mechanics design and fun the game is about repeating the same stupid levels over and over and over just to get enough credits to upgrade an absolutely necessary mod by one degree or just to get the mod in order to advance through to the next mission i would have gladly paid $60 or even a monthly fee to play a game with real content and real fun too bad this game chose the f2p model theyll not get a cent from me

short version lots of fun sometimes but much still broken or missing community pretty much blows and solo is a lot more fun than grouping at least with pugs for several reasons i wont go into ive mostly being playing this in socalled solo mode obviously this impacts my impressions if youre mostly going to be playing with friends or we your mileage will vary significantly at its best a great game with a lot of potential however it also often degenerates into tediously repetitive shooting gallery at the time of writing lots of stuff still pretty buggybroken enemies and other objects inside walls or floors grenades and other blasttype effects that go through walls and so on enemy aipathfinding is kinda messed up too leading to enemies standing facing into corners dunce style or groups of enemies doing the twostep trying to get around each other often for long periods esp if there are more than two in the group and things like a guy running back and forth a few metres indefinitely i get the impression that the devs are more focused on expanding the game than on fixing these kinds of issues so who knows ifwhen any of this will be fixed mission difficulty and balance is all over the place particularly for a solo player  some later higher level or higher rated missions are much easier than earlierlesser ones several mission types particularly most of the ones you have to grind for various drops are just ridiculous for soloing esp when you get a bad map for example some defense mission maps have you trying to defend a target that is completely exposed on all sides against enemies coming from all directions a solo player just cant be everywhere at once this really makes me wonder why they specifically include a solo mode since they clearly cant be bothered putting in the piffling effort required to scale things andor exclude such obviously grouporiented maps from solo mode etc and dont even get me started on the stalker in solo mode hard to think of anything more stupid the crafting system is interesting but very slow eg warframe builds take 3 days real world time and thats after youve spent 1236 hours on building the parts and very few crafting options are available early on since the vast majority of items require drops from later planets obtaining certain materials is heavily grindy andor expensive finally since soloing is not a realistic option beyond the very early stages the game really needs some kind of lobby interface or lfg tool outside of just poking around the huge map looking for something interesting a clan finder would be nice too  very few clans seem to bother posting recruitment messages ingame at least at the times ive had an eye out perhaps they expect players to do this kind of thing thru websites or forums seems like a total copout to me i havent reached endgame yet but am already starting to feel kinda burnt out on this its worth a look since its free but too broken and limited for me to give it a recommendation

they should have called this warfarm instead you spend a great deal of your time running missions to rank up weapons to make them more powerful so you can run more difficult missions to potentially get more powerful weapons so you can run more missions with to make those new weapons more powerful unless you want to spend money grindy and repetative to the extreme i wish there was a way to pay money to make this game fun again after the first 20 hours of gameplay its free to play though

honestly playing this game as a beginner far from the launch wasnt too exciting while the graphics are spectacular and the combat system above average the induction to the game was poor and the storyline was horrible playing this game for 10 hours was almost a waste if not for the graphics the overall atmosphere of the game seemed like too many missions spent running through hallways to get to an objective that you cleared in the last mission most missions were just repeats and the gear availability for f2p was mediocre the last aspect that was the least developed was the makeshift crafting in the game to get new toons or warframes all in all it seems to be a game barely out of development and worth only a 55510

i was excited about it until i actually tried it it looks cool and id recommend it to people that havent played many shooting games it has cool moves the graphics are decent and you get to use different types of weapons unfortunately the ai isnt exactly smart and the character you control is a bit overpowered plus you get way too much ammo and health and power regeneration its way too easy it looks pretty its relaxing its free and the classes look nice but it didnt really manage to draw me in in all honesty i dont have much to say i got bored on my first mission and quit so maybe it gets better as you progress its not that it really is that terrible overall but i got bored too early so i do recommend it to casual gamers that just want some parkour tricks and some good old slashing and shooting of aliens but it really isnt anything special a lot of easy to kill foes and an endless pursuit of loot if youve already played a bunch of alien shooting games and have high expectations about this one spare yourself the disappointment

this is one of the worst coop mmos out there as it doesnt actualy focus on the coop but on the grind yes grind this game is nothing but a 24 hour grind with bosses the most intense moment in the entire game was when i crashed after a very important mission then again and then again this amount of crashes is unbereable not taking in that the game is extremely bugged and textures often get stuck in players and enemies but as i said this game is nothing but grind you grind to get a pet you grind enemies to get to the boss you grind the same area over and over just to obtain one more ceramics or whateverthe you need right now the weapons take immense amount of grind to actualy even get the blueprint then you need to get the required items that means yes you guessed it more grinding then finaly if the starts are right and you have enough of items and credits you can finaly wait yes wait whole whoping 12 hours for your new wepon to actualy get completed this isnt a multiplayer game this is a great grind simulator you do nothing else but grind so if you are looking for a way how to kill time and love grinding away this game is for you but if you are a noraml and social person you will probably enjoy this game only when playing with friend i would give it a 410 thus i dont recommend it to anyone that doesnt plan on playing with friends or hates grinding

just as a review of the first 60 minutes or so of gameplay ive had the worst experience with this game than i have with any other in the past few months being as it relies on internet connection the connection cut out during the tutorial not once but twice after completing the tutorial finally i was taken to a loading screen where it simply stopped loading three times and stayed at the same load point for an additional 30 minutes before i gave up and closed the game i went through the intro cutscene and tutorial stage 5 times before giving up on this game entirely as far as merits go what little gameplay i had was entertaining after adjusting the graphic settings after the lagfest of the first intro cutscene the weapons were pretty neat and the attacking felt fluid i enjoyed the aesthetic qualities of the game the design of the enemies and armor were pretty darn cool as well but thats as far as the good qualities go the only thing holding me back from reccommending this game is the constant disconnects having to do the tutorial and watch an unskippable cutscene over and over again i can practically quote half of the dialogue from the tutorial i understand that while this is not the intended experience of the game its what ive experienced after googling the issue ive tried nearly every remedy listed and nothing has worked as far as i can tell if you want to play this game dont play it over steam get it from the website where you are taken to create an account anyways

the short and sweet review an addictive game at first its pleasing graphics and myriad of missions and play options will keep you fairly entertained its myriad of bugs and issues will not this game like many of the latest pay to win mmos demands a lot of time be invested if youre only in it for the free content this means daysweeks of grinding to get that weapon you want and for most of us this is an option we can live with what we cant live with having spent the last hour or two grinding only to see the game drop connection and the reward you work so long at lost this unfortunately can happen time and again and is especially prevailent after large patches  the latest being 18gb eventually this becomes tiresome and the complete lack of storyline however means the only thing that keeps you going is the greed of growing your arsenal purchasing additional slots for weapons and warframes is something invetable expect to have to dish out your hard earned cash within as little as two to three weeks if you play often the programmers insure that somewhere along the line if you want to progress and grow your arsenal youll need to spend real money this is called a paywall some will argue you can trade items ingame to make other purchases ingame but the programmers have ensured that this platform remains simplistic to ensure that it does not affect their profits there is no market or auction house and instead there is a single spamchat window with hundreds if not more of players selling items items drop rates are also regulated to ensure that if a particular rare items drops for one person it will become only so much harder for the next person to obtain a particular weapon may also start out as being fun and overpowered only to end up on the scraphead of has been weapons with a current stream of new and improved weapons being available to purchase ingame and then eventually made available to the masses and the envitable grind required to get it eventually again its nerfed rinse repeat all in all the programmers will ensure they get their monies worth out of you and this game can quickly become as expensive as eve which can easily cost the equivalent of a new ps3xboxpc game every month if dont mind spending the cash and youre looking for nothing more than blowing off a little steam this game  when its working  can do just that for you throw into the mix a possible takeover by pwe and you can bet your sweet  you wont be happy that you did id recommend checking the reviews again in a year or so to see if the programmers have listened to their existing customers it sucks when you one promotes and supports the developers by purchasing ingame items only to find theyd rather focus on new content and making more money than resolving existing bugs this game needs another year of serious devtime

ive rewritten my review about four times now and each time has been a fairly positive review until now currently warframe isnt doing that great many players are sitting around in a state of impatience for new content and the many updates weve had still has not satisfied many players we are missing many things such as polish endgame and fixes to some current issues as much as id like warframe to succeed i cannot recommend the game to anybody looking into playing it other than the issues we have and the things we are months later than we should have them getting into the game is extremely difficult and time consuming even 200 hours in i doubt you would be even close to top tier content unless you were really good are good at studying a game wikia and had help by the time you get as far as i have you will very likely feel unsatisfied with where warframe currently is and with the lack of content to go by you will also be frustrated with digital extremes for not releasing any good content and you will hope from update in to update out that de will release something great but in the end you will be sorely disappointed i intend to change my review to a yes if they start making good releases and show that they know what they are doing but until then i intend to give a no take care xievie

pure grinding the grinding emphasis is so strong that most games are just people running through the levels ignoring all enemies to the end to finish the stage and get the rewards new players will be lost as they try to fight and actually play the game it becomes a look how fast i can run through this stage simulator graphics are cool story is cool gameplay idea is cool though everything got exploited into a weird grindy running game many people will enjoy this no doubt i didnt get hooked though and i love grindy games

i give this game 25 out of 4 stars explanation 1 star due my character getting stuck in walls just about anytime i use the run on walls skill 5 star due to difficulty setting up keybindings for use on a pc this game would be much better played with a game controller  thank goodness the game has such an option or i would have taken a whole star away instead of half the positives are excellent graphics and character detail along with an awesome story line

a good game and there is some real fun to be had however it is so buggy and unstable that it just ruins the experience it becomes really annoying when you are getting higher levels and really need to finish a level and it glitches out all the damned time so in its current state i couldnt reccomend this game

the pay to win in this game is absolute ing  if you want to play a game thats actually free to play and not free to suffer in ing agony without paying for even adequate weapons go ahead

warframe can be fun however a few things really ruin the game in the long run if you want a new weapon for instance you first have to grind credits to buy the blueprint then grind mobs just to get materials for the weapon while also grinding for credits to actualy craft the weapon and then you have to wait 12 hours just for it to be crafted sure its fun to run missions but not over and over and over again just for a small item if you want a warframe on the other hand you have to grind missions for the credits to buy the blueprint and then grind a certain mission to get all the components of the warframe and then just grind for the materials for crafting all three of the components of the warframe which then you have to wait 12 hours just to craft one of the pieces you can craft all three at once and then you have to grind missions to get enough credits to pay for the cost of combining all three pieces and wait 72 hours just for a new character new warframes have different abilities and stats but still use the same weapon so gameplay usually isnt that different if you dont heavily use abilities however if you use abilities gameplay between warframes can be highly varied and the stats do change quite a bit however if you dont want to grind for weapons and new warframes you can simply pay 2550 dollars for a warframe 25 for just the warframe and its abilities and 50 for the warframe and a few weapons added to it or just buy weapons for about 25 dollars somehow the game even manages to make boss battles a repetive grind with for instance the jackal just constantly avoiding missiles and shooting the legs or stabbing them to death if you enjoy melee and then dammaging him parkour while featured in the game is clunky and glitchy which can end in you accidently launching yourself 25 feet into the air by attempting to run up a wall and jump another interesting thing is that in the kubrow quest a glitch can happen where you have to leave and reenter the game just to instal the compoment you earned from one part of the quest just so you can actually instal it the most fun i had in this game is actually just killing minor units mowing down grineer corpus and the infected is hug amounts of fun but can easily get boring due to the repetitive grindy nature of the game i personally feel like the game is more of a money making scheme than an actual fully fledged game due to the fact that its an insane grind for weapons and warframes yet every item in the game can be bought for real money although it is highly expensive a good example of this too is the clan dojo in which you have to run missions to get one time run missions to get a chance to get a blueprint which then in turn requires a ton of materials and credits to craft and then takes forever to actually finish crafting to just add a room to your dojo note your dojo also needs energy rooms and hallways just for it to function correctly or you can just circumvent this process and buy a forma the item needed for the dojo room for ten bucks all in all this game is fun in short brief sessions and if you just do not care about having alot of items or variety but i personally do not recommend this game the weapons are fun to use though

where to start with this one well first off i like the ghrapics the gameplay and the abilities however after a couple hours of playing i noticed that the enemies started doing way more damage and i was doing roughly the same as i started out so i decided to look for a new stronger weapon i find out that you cant buy a weapon thats better using the in game credits oh no you have to buy the currency using real money in order to get a decent weapon its that or you can do the facebook style of upgrading buy the blue print play a level a half dozen times to find a resource and then hopefully after a day of grinding you have what you need did i mention the fact you cant kill the enemies even on the first level anymore because their difficulty progressed with you >> so good luck getting those resources yet another potentially great game turned to  from greed i would have much rather paid 5060 bucks for the game and the ability to progress with ingame credits that i didnt have to buy versus having to buy 20 dollars worth of game money for a single weapon really as for those of you who fell victim to that and want to hold onto that pride so to speak of this being a great game it is sure but only for about 45 minutes

warframe seemed to be an interesting space adventure filled with combat and with a new patch it even includes ships im a simple sci fi guy and it was free so i bought it the game was terrible but the controls are probably the worst way to control a charcter i have ever seen e is melee attack while left and right click are to aim while f is to swap beetween your secondary and primary the tutorial if you can even call it that places you with all of your powers depending on which class you play warrior ranger mage but as soon as you leave the room you are left with only the first power you get as i played through the game and fought the generic humanish guys i felt extremly confused due to the starting senistivity being higher than snoop and using e to attack i eventually reached the selection of my first few secondary pistols i was told nothing about these guns so i never knew the difference same with the mele weapons as you can choose a stick guantlets or a sword when i eventually got to a wall running segment i died 10 times not because of my inability to press space but because my faceless avatar would kick off the wall or even better not be able to make a jump the hacking is horrendous think about it this way would you like a timed minigame about 15 sec where you cant go back once you move a puzzle peice unless you flip the peice all over again one that tells you nothing about how to do it and then will cut down the time when you get it halfway done the answer is no by the way did i like this game in short no in long n00000000000000000000 510kill it

im sorry but once again warframe has failed me why you might ask well heres the thingsince my last review i said that it did some mayor improvements and it did but then i came back to a mayor problemgetting bored of my weaponswarframe and trying to get new stuffbut not being able to buycraft anything aka it costs way too much ingame money first you have to spit up 20000 creditswhich is one of the cheaper onesand then you need to pay another 20000 credits to craft it and all the materials arent even available yet in the beginning so you might saywell then go do some frikkin grinding and progressing so you can get those materials maybybut i dont wanna spend the first 20 hours of gameplay on grinding the phrase ninjas play free is wrongfor you to have fun in experimenting with different loadouts the best way is to just spend real money on it psthe game is laggy as  final opinionthe key moments of your game are at the startso that way you can win a gamers heart and make them keep playing the gamethis is not something these people got i am sorry but you could not win over my heart once againmayby in another year of updates whil you get it right

its a good game and the model makes sense but the biggest problem is the 24h wait time for mastery ranks i went for my first test and the game went to black screen with a big please wait circle for about 15 mins i finally shut down the game and when i came back it said i have to wait 24h the devs had no reason to add this game mechanic because its not as if you can even play cash to simply pass on the time and try again its simply there to  with you i give this game 510 for the simple fact that the devs are  very uncanadian of you

in warframe you play as a teno a space ninja of sorts the game is all about the fighting and gives you several options you can use swords and melee powers and ranged weapons the selection of the weapons is large and the powers vary depending on which warframe model you play as sadly the game isnt truly free to play id put in a lot of time to try and get a few warframes and weapons for free not including time spend getting the components only to find out that the inventory is capped that was the farewell for me still if you dont mind paying in some hard cash this is a decent game to play oh and yes the plot is inexistant

this game could be fun for those who would enjoy a good game with good mechanics and of course the online multiplayer aspect as a gamer i enjoyed this game imensely too begin with as a school student who works hard and studies after school i could not play this game everyday and this is why i dont like this game because it demands attention on a regular basis to grind for resources i don not have the time while my friends do along with the fact you need to pay for wepons slots which my friends did they poured hours off there life over 500 hours to get these elusive weapons that they refused to pay for i can no longer play with them nor will i be able to catch up unless i pay money these games suck because they require some money to have fun and can not be played by the caual gamer like me if its your thing to spend all this time then enjoy but if you dont have the time to commit then dont bother

quite fun to play but too repetitive the first few hours of playing you really enjoy it but as you get into the 50100 hour range farming becomes 75% of what you do in the game there is no such thing as a story in this game no matter how many updates try to add lore now that all the new weapons require a clan research lab the weapons before it researched the lab resources to be researched massive build times for all these items it can take literally months to get a new weapon if you have a decent amount of clan members to help not to mention that there are research weapons that are absolute trash

if you like grinding for several hundred hours for the perfect build just to have it nerfed and broken then this is the game for you patches get rolled out with a weapon here and a new frame here events have gotten pathetic with every major update they roll out 50 new problems come with it not to mention youll be lucky if the problems for the last patch have been fixed support tickets are answered with  well something must be wrong on your end they throw sparkles and pretty things at people to distract them from the honest problems game was great now its broken

warframe is a fun diversion for a few hours however there are several flaws that keep this game from becoming more than just a novelty for starters the game handles quite well combat is satisfying and the controls are responsive however very little outside of the basic game mechanics are explained things like crafting and progression are completely devoid of any meaningful explanation i spent a few hours trying to figure out how to acquire a better weapon than the starter rifle i ended up buying a blue print which appears to be completely unusable until much more progression this seems to stress the microtransaction aspect of the game as its probably just easier to buy things than try to figure out how to craft them anyways it was fun for a few hours cant say ill play again good visuals good gameplay but if you arent sold on the idea of shelling out money towards this game i can only imagine that itll be worth a few hours of your time

warframe was fun and exciting at first this soon becomes mundane a total grindfest and for what so i can play the same tilesets over and over again once you get certain weapon sets the game seems to have a non accomplisment feel to it it was very exciting at first a fresh new look at freemium but as ive said once you get in game it loses that glossy finish the very begining of the game got me going i thought yes just what i wanted a game with what seemed to be an excellent story line however after this small tutorial the storyline is none exsistant and to help matters the devs will release maybe a weapon once a month thats majorly op and makes it boring basically youll need vauban synapse the grenade launcher and a decent secondary there are many game modes but all in all end up the same kill some people or some dude in the hope of getting something good which rarely happens there is also an alliance feature which after you have had all research gathers no point what so ever no alliance matches or progress nor rewards for team work i used to really like this game and spent days on end playing but now cant even be bothered to login and see zerolittle change exciting at first swiftly changing to mundane dont bother

while a lot of effort has been put into this game and the polish is commendable the further this game hase gone into development the more and more obtuse the entire thing has become this game has all the markings of a aaa title both for good and bad except that its f2p and still technically in development which gives us gorgeous uis that actually make it difficult to do what youd like the damage system used to be fairly simply if not obfuscated but now it requires a degree of research to even come to terms with bleeding applies through your shields normal attacks have status elements with combinations the initial ambition of this project has begun to exceed itself

so if you want a freeish game with lots of missions and great graphics and dont mind if the gameplay is unvaried and at times unpolished then yes warframe is for you why do i not recommend it ah glad you asked firstly the developers have gone with quantity over quality the graphics do look great but after a few hours you start to realise that the levels are just built from the same components and the enemies are not very varied at all they just attack in large numbers at first there appear to be hundreds of missions  but you soon realise theres just a few mission types and the levels are simply rehashes of the same environments some of the mission types are very poorly put together rescuing hostages and hunting targets is just so bleh you are just playing the same missions over and over but in slightly different level configurations with slightly different enemies theres tons of it so many missions but its all so samey and therefore boring the ai can be painfully dumb but the routine they have in place is enough to initially draw you in before you realise the flaws the potential for the storyline is never quite realised as the game drip feeds you background information that doesnt really mean much the promise to go through a story with other players occurs you just run through samey levels killing samey enemies with faceless teammates and its all a little bit sterile  which is a shame because the game looks so good and has some good gameplay mechanics that are massively underused the parkhour for example theres no discovery or briefing in the levels you just follow the arrow from one point to the next the hours of gameplay on offer soon become a chore to go through to hunt the next material or get to the next stage the drops are another good example at first youll see all the bonuses to collect and be happy several thousand pick ups later and its another chore the lockers dotted around the levels are barely worth opening the majority of drops are common items but you cant know until you get them which leads on to the next complaint if you want to improve your frameloadout without paying then you are in for a long grind the only reason i made it past the grineer boss one of the more fun missions after hours fighting the same grineer droves was because a much higher ranked player was in our squad and dealt with him as me and other lesser frames alternated between reviving each other and being revived the next set of missions gets even more tedious after killing the nth 1000th crewman youll find yourself feeling a bit numb the difference between freely equipped players and paying players is so stark that sometimes [should you not spend the vast sums required to get a competitive loadout] youll just go on the defense missions and be in awe as guys level wave after wave of enemies that would wipe you out in an instant well just buy the better framesloadouts then cheapskate yes i could however the gameplay would still be the same  the repetitive missions unvaried enemies etc only i could skip the initial grind then what have to pay more to get on to the next set of boring missions and enemies welcome to freemium there is some crafting and buffs which can be combined which help boost your frame although it is also a bit rough and ready in terms of the ui and i ended up getting  you go it  a bit bored doing it all this is not helped by the many drops filling your profile with common cards which you get to combine with other cards many hundred times later you just dread the thought of dealing with it it is a shame because warframe has a lot of potential if the developers stop churning out samey content and focused on whats already there  developing the gameplay and mission modes improving the level design and story making better use of existing gameplay features that just dont matter parkhour ziplines etc then this could be a really great game also better value improvements and better balance may lead to more free players investing in the game and sticking around i might come back in a year or two but for now ive had enough tldr at first warframe looks great plays great but really bored once me when i tried to dig deeper because  despite the masses of content  the game has almost no depth at all

ill admit that its fun at first but as time went on i found the limited number of enemy and mission types to get less and less interesting and then i got bored plus the pricing schemes for purchasing weapons and frames outright are very high to the point where just earning items in game and using real money to unlock weapon and frame slots felt like a better idea to me also the community in the games official forums can be rude and fanboyish at time and if you criticize anything the developers do or offer even constructive feedback you can be trolled and flamed by people who refuse to admit that the purpose of a beta is to test and tweak and improve a product by sometimes pointing out whats wrong or can be improved

honestly playing this game as a beginner far from the launch wasnt too exciting while the graphics are spectacular and the combat system above average the induction to the game was poor and the storyline was horrible playing this game for 10 hours was almost a waste if not for the graphics the overall atmosphere of the game seemed like too many missions spent running through hallways to get to an objective that you cleared in the last mission most missions were just repeats and the gear availability for f2p was mediocre the last aspect that was the least developed was the makeshift crafting in the game to get new toons or warframes all in all it seems to be a game barely out of development and worth only a 55510
not recommended
i was excited about it until i actually tried it it looks cool and id recommend it to people that havent played many shooting games it has cool moves the graphics are decent and you get to use different types of weapons unfortunately the ai isnt exactly smart and the character you control is a bit overpowered plus you get way too much ammo and health and power regeneration its way too easy it looks pretty its relaxing its free and the classes look nice but it didnt really manage to draw me in in all honesty i dont have much to say i got bored on my first mission and quit so maybe it gets better as you progress its not that it really is that terrible overall but i got bored too early so i do recommend it to casual gamers that just want some parkour tricks and some good old slashing and shooting of aliens but it really isnt anything special a lot of easy to kill foes and an endless pursuit of loot if youve already played a bunch of alien shooting games and have high expectations about this one spare yourself the disappointment

this is one of the worst coop mmos out there as it doesnt actualy focus on the coop but on the grind yes grind this game is nothing but a 24 hour grind with bosses the most intense moment in the entire game was when i crashed after a very important mission then again and then again this amount of crashes is unbereable not taking in that the game is extremely bugged and textures often get stuck in players and enemies but as i said this game is nothing but grind you grind to get a pet you grind enemies to get to the boss you grind the same area over and over just to obtain one more ceramics or whateverthe you need right now the weapons take immense amount of grind to actualy even get the blueprint then you need to get the required items that means yes you guessed it more grinding then finaly if the starts are right and you have enough of items and credits you can finaly wait yes wait whole whoping 12 hours for your new wepon to actualy get completed this isnt a multiplayer game this is a great grind simulator you do nothing else but grind so if you are looking for a way how to kill time and love grinding away this game is for you but if you are a noraml and social person you will probably enjoy this game only when playing with friend i would give it a 410 thus i dont recommend it to anyone that doesnt plan on playing with friends or hates grinding

just as a review of the first 60 minutes or so of gameplay ive had the worst experience with this game than i have with any other in the past few months being as it relies on internet connection the connection cut out during the tutorial not once but twice after completing the tutorial finally i was taken to a loading screen where it simply stopped loading three times and stayed at the same load point for an additional 30 minutes before i gave up and closed the game i went through the intro cutscene and tutorial stage 5 times before giving up on this game entirely as far as merits go what little gameplay i had was entertaining after adjusting the graphic settings after the lagfest of the first intro cutscene the weapons were pretty neat and the attacking felt fluid i enjoyed the aesthetic qualities of the game the design of the enemies and armor were pretty darn cool as well but thats as far as the good qualities go the only thing holding me back from reccommending this game is the constant disconnects having to do the tutorial and watch an unskippable cutscene over and over again i can practically quote half of the dialogue from the tutorial i understand that while this is not the intended experience of the game its what ive experienced after googling the issue ive tried nearly every remedy listed and nothing has worked as far as i can tell if you want to play this game dont play it over steam get it from the website where you are taken to create an account anyways

fun game  but seeing first hand what it can do to those who are addicted is disheartening this game encourages nay forces you to pay if you want to keep up with the game and the prices are scary 500 later my brother realised that it was time to stop warframe no refunds are in sight either

as fun as the gameplay is the ammount of grinding that you need to do is pretty hilarious and feels unecessary sure you have groups of people playing with you but with ranking up and crafting being timegated it sometimes feel like youre grinding just for the sake of grinding it just feelsnot worth it at times

grind so you can get more equipment to grind in level design that rivals halo 1 in terms of most amount of copypasting its got better polish than your average f2p game the content is pretty expensive and also subjectively pay 2 win because path of exile or dota 2 could have done the same thing poe could have charged for uniques and dota for hero unlocks except they only charge for cosmetics path of exile is a coop pve game too in warframe you either cough up the cash or spend eternity grinding to grind some more its pretty much single player because theres no communication and most players tend to just hit the sprint  crouch button to reach the objective rather than collecting resources you are forced to chase them as they reach the only coop feature of the game where two players are need to hit a switch together to open a door here is a quick explaination of the gameplay you have an overview of our solar system you start at mercury each planet has a particular amount of missions before you proceed to the next planet planets also consist of resources which drop from killed enemies or cratesstorage in a nutshell you do coop missions which are bland grind items credit and resources purchase blueprints with the virtual credit each item requires certain resources for the sake of this review lets say i want to craft a rhino warframe it requires w x y z resources refer to the solar system map and see which planet has those resources now mercury will have z jupiter has y and pluto has w you will have to play missions even repeat them to aquire the neccessary resources once you do gather the resources you have to wait 1224 hours in real time for the foundry to craft the weapon this is nothing more than a way to nudge you reminding you that the game is free to play with inconvienience free to play really is a tainted model unless its path of exile and dota 2 and loadout where it actually works i rather cough up 2949$ to play a full experience all hostility aside the game has potential and digital extremes is a talented company considering they did ut1999 03 04 and dark sector the controls and graphics are fantastic get rid of the buy to unlock model and look at path of exiles as a blue print also for those who are complaining about wasting money on this game to only be dissapointed 2030 hours later its not the developers fault its the risk you take when you decide to invest in open betas and f2p give this game a try or try its prequel single player dark sector which was an underrated game by digital extreme

a bunch of my coworkers rave about this game to no end so i decided to hop on and try it good thing it is free to play or i would be asking for my money back though there is the option to play the game solo this is not a first person game this is an shooter mmo set in space if you want to play alone the game lets you but does not scale down the difficulty in one mission where i was supposed to prevent an artifact from being destroyed i found myself up against 30 baddies with lasers and grenades while all i had was a rifle and a pistol with no ammo needless to say i died alot and the game was ohso happy to keep track of just how often that was you are given a limited number of chances to revive the games fancy word for respawn but it does not have the decency other games have to moves you away from the mob of baddies that just killed you instead it drops you right in the middle of them only giving you control after it is done with the respawn animation but allowing the baddies to fill you with bullets as soon as the animation starts once your designated respawns have been used you cannot continue playing the game you can buy respawns however for platinum but that is currency you have to buy with real money you dont earn it the controls are a bit wonky moving the mouse moves the camera all the time and the direct your character is running about 45% of the time you only start with a rifle and a pistol though ammo for all the different weapon types drop from baddies and can be found in chests the baddies however can use what every type of weapon they want and have no problem shooting you when you are behind cover they also can stun lock you just by hitting you with the butt of their gun which leave you open to attacks that can take away all of your shield or half your health before you get a chance to run if you want more weapons you have to buy them with platinum and im not 100% certain you actually buy them i think you buy the designs to build them should you find the parts later on x is the defaut do the thing i need you to do button but the promt to do said thing either doesnt appear or appears in the smallest font the game can access i died several times because i was suppsed to access or hack or interface or something with a console and it would not let me until i stood exactly where it wanted me to stand and by then all the baddies had respawned and knocked me down to 2 hp there is also a foundry the games crafting system but you dont have any designs available to you at the start of the game that uses the materials you find in the starting missions you get mods that boost your health melee damage gun damage etc you for some reason you are only allowed to equip mods that have the same number as your level and once you do you cant equip one that when added to the values of your other mods is over your level for example you are allowed one free mod which is actually a power of your suit at level 3 i was allowed to equip a mod that increased my health by 40% at level 6 i thought i could instal another power mod so i could stop dying but i was stopped by an annoying little buzz sound as my level bar flashed the new power was for level 6 but if i wanted to use it i had to remove the level 3 mod and instal it by itself i could however install another level 3 mod but when i tried that i got buzzed again because it i could not have two mods of the same type ie two health mods active at the same time i know i am going to be told if you play with others then you wont have these problems why dont you play with others answer because i want to know what my character can do before jumping into a random matchup so as to try and avoid the ineffitable omg you are so bad at this stop playing youre ruining this for the rest of us you usually run into in mmos also if the game is meant to be an mmo i dont think they should give the player the option of playing solo because then you get players like me who think hey i can play abit by myself so when my friend come online to play i will be a better teammate becoming upset and writing bad reviews

for some initial boost in the game you can use this referral link httpswarframecomsignupreferrerid517f97771a4d809d7c000088  that will give you a 7day experience booster which will help you level up your warframe and gear faster this game is getting more and more grindy with each update and the sheer amount of grind will crush you i had high hopes for this game but with every update brings another layer of rng and grind and it just eats away all the motivation and enjoyment
