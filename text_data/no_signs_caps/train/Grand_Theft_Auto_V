well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

long story short for people who love gta and want to play singleplayer only this is for you if you want to play online you will probably get killed by hackers and guess what rockstar does nothing about it there is no simple way to report players so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers game itself 1010 gta online 310 hackers everywhere edit this is itdecided to improve my flying skills all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane i didnt press anything freezes and thats it cant move at all some sort of hack joined another session after few minutes i noticed two people with godmode on so i went passive mode but guess what they started shooting cars at me and i died about 10 times i advice you not to buy this game at all

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

great game honestly but bumping the price to 8000usd before the summer sale just to be able to say 25% off is a scum move
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful

the pc version of gta v is definitely the best version we had to wait really long but the game finally came out in a fantastic state rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the pc portversion im usually against preordering games but i made one exception this year for gta and im happy with my decision i didnt do it for the preorder bonus because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat  i did it just so i could preload all gbs in time for launch because the game is ridiculously big im running it at 6090 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on high except for the advanced options which is something you should only use if your running sli or one really good card i have a nvidia gtx 680 which is a few years old now so im very impressed with how good i can get the game to run you can also use geforce experience with gta because nividia released a update for that day before launch you can play gta in first or third person mode and simply change between them on your controller all cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person some textures are a little blurry in first person but that is something to expect in a game of this size fighting swimming walking can also be done in first person so you can just pick what you like the best if you have an ssd drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for gta because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long its one of the only complains i have with gta actually thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written you can swap between them in the open world but also in certain quests michael trevor and franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then gta ivs only character niko gta online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in i really just bought it for the singleplayer experience but after playing a few hours with my friends i have to say that gta online is actually really fun i think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run but to play freeroam with friends will never get old you also unlock heist in level 12 so that might refresh things even more i play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends ive talked to is doing the same thing i strongly recommend it at least for the driving you can enable autoaim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard or you can swap between your keyboardmouse in combat and use controller for driving when you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates which i think makes you feel more immersed in the game i tried the pc controls and i didnt like them at all for example you have to hit z to see how many players are on your server in online mode you can however rebind all keys on keyboard mouse and controller so thats really good but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid gta is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come i have already played it a lot and i feel like i have much more leveling to do in gta online much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come singleplayer was all i really needed so i will just see gta online as a plus well done rockstar this is the best pc version you have ever made and i can see that you put a lot of effort time and love into creating it strongly recommend this title to all my friends whether your the single or multiplayer guy you will have a ton of fun this will probably be one of the best games released this year

rockstar just lost a lot of respect from a large part of its playerbase uk customer i paid 3999 on release current standalone price is 5198 but a 25% discount makes it 3898 this kind of business practice is actually against asa regulations raising the price of a game and then putting it on sale to make it look like its actually reduced is not considered a fair marketing strategy in the uk with regards to the bundle with great white shark cash card at the same price of 3898 its a move that isnt really on the side of the consumer or in the spirit of past steam sales it has only been out for 2 months on pc so i dont think anyone was hoping for a big discount but putting it in a bundle and slapping a 25% discount on it really means the consumer isnt saving at all theyre getting some free ingame money which might be nice for some people but i think if most wanted the game  ingame money bundle theyd have prepurchased it when the ingame money was also free i hope people dont just see the 25% discount and think theyre getting a great deal by saving 25% beacuse theyre really not youre either getting some free ingame money or  even worse  nothing at all with the standalone discount gta v is a great game but if you were looking to save on it you wont be in this current steam sale rockstar please treat your customers with more respect

finally after numerous delays and waiting forever it has arrived rockstar did a really good job on this the delays seem to have paid off the game runs completely maxed out ultra settings @ 1920x1080 on my laptop gtx 780m 4gb sli and i get 4060 fps oh and the game is really fun too a huge improvement from gta iv i dont think i need to talk much about the game because everyone on earth knows its great already if you didnt know its great then ill tell you right now  its great  a must buy if you havent played it  huge improvement over grand theft auto iv  runs smooothly on mid range pcs  first person mode is amazing  entertaining characters and story  no glitches at all yet  coop in the story mode would have been cool  first person mode doesnt work good for most missions 910 ps make sure you download the latest drivers for your graphics cards both nvidia and amd released gta v drivers links are below nvidia httpwwwnvidiacomdownloadindexaspxlangenus amd httpsupportamdcomenusdownload for more terrible reviews gaming news and giveaways check out my curator page below httpsteamcommunitycomgroupssaintsatan

price jacked up for sale the port is good and i had thought they had redeemed themselves into the pc market since gta4 was a disaster but this cash grab is the last straw for me id request a refund if i was eligible they cant keep on taking and taking from us and giving nothing in return we the consumer are being taken for granted we shouldnt be giving our hard earned money to developers like this if you really want to spend this sort of money on a game then chuck in another couple of quid and buy witcher 3 where the developer really does care about its consumer witcher 3 is worth every single penny

really love this game happily paid $70 for it again on pc launch after playing it on ps3 really hate how rockstar is trying to incentivize sales by hiking up the price for the steam summer sale you really think you can get away with bundling the game with some virtual currency lowering the original price by $3 and then slapping a 25% off badge over it lost a lot of respect today for a publisher that i had grown to love will definitely think twice about purchasing any game from them in the future which will be hard but not as hard as it would be to support a company whose fundamental principals i disagree with i miss the studio that brought me so many fantastic titles in the past and not the corporate entity that it has become

this is the home gta v always deserved but never got until now welcome home weve all been waiting for you edit after playing for a while i can attach a more informative review will update further when enough time is spent with the story and online portion performancewise the game runs relatively well on my gtx 680 i have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size look it up on the internet aside from that the launch has been relatively smooth for me the game world is full of detail put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it its really the kind of benchmarksetting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless in my opinion the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in gta iv driving is a little bit better hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so but to me it feels more responsive shooting can feel clumsy especially in firstperson and the guns dont feel all that special but its still fun in addition to the updated graphics the other pcexclusive features include a custom radio station and the rockstar editor custom radio station is pretty simple add music files to a folder in the documents and youve got a self radio station ingame it works nothing more to add as for the rockstar editor its really simple and fun to use you mainly use markers to change cameras apply effects slow motion et cetera i tested it for a bit and the end result is this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2wsq_gyd4y4 im planning to make longer and better videos in the near future the online feature can be a little bit confusing for new players to get into first since it lacks direction but youll get it havent played it too much to comment further but its fun to play jobs with friends although the progression feels halfbaked thanks for reading my review im planning to report on narrative and more of gta online soon

rockstar greedily decided to give their customers the middle finger this summer sale and instead of putting the base game on discount they decided that it would be a good idea to charge the regular price with a crappy shark card included that gets you some gta online currency and from my experience that amount of ingame money will be gone before you know it unless youre desperate youre probably best off waiting for a proper sale or buying a key elsewhere without the microtransaction crap attached and because of the shark card being included which is a one time use consumable it will make you ineligible for a steam refund

started the game at 4 am just to see if itd run well on my rig played the game for 20 minutes before deciding to save & quit to head of to bed but when returning to franklins home i decided for some reason to see if its possible to hang on the couch which wasnt only possible i could even get high and watch some tv spent an hour hitting that joint while talking to myself untill i realized it was almost 6 in the morning went to franklins bed to save and quit the game only to proceed to do exactly what i just didstep by step without realizing it at first the future is here fellow stoners never has a game been so true to life 1010 finally a game that lets me hang on the couch & smoke a joint while talking to myself ingame while i hang on the couch and smoke a joint talking to myself irl edit day 2 after yesterdays unproductive fiasco i decided to stop getting high with frankin and do some missions did 1 mission unlocked michael as a playable character and decided to go to the nearest  mission and do that one before continueing the storyline misions20 seconds and 1 cutscene later some hippy convinced me to take a few hits from his homegrown reefer leaving me high as  to fight of aliens trying to abduct me needless to say today was yet another failure httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid425236207

great game and enjoyable single player experience multiplayer is a pile of poo in australia sure when it works its great however it seems that im spending 12 of my multiplayer experience waiting for the servers to repond or for someone else to load if youre interested in the single player experience with a multiplayer gimic pick it up single player is great if youre intrested in the multiple aspect you might have to get your fix somewhere else

had a friend who wanted this thinking it would be discounted instead rockstar ended up cheating us by adding a shark card and not actually making anything cheaper in summersale nice job rockstar you are as scum as ea
not recommended
really rockstar you jack up the price and add in a shark card which makes the game nonrefundable by the way and put it on sale for full price thats not even enough you decide to make a bundle with 2 shark cards for $30 then make it 33% off but claim it includes the full game just to make it look like your game is $20 on sale you make me sick i liked the game i loved some of your other titles but nownow youve proven that profit is more important than fans seriously  you rockstar never buying anything from you again and telling everyone i know to do the same

long story short for people who love gta and want to play singleplayer only this is for you if you want to play online you will probably get killed by hackers and guess what rockstar does nothing about it there is no simple way to report players so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers game itself 1010 gta online 310 hackers everywhere edit this is itdecided to improve my flying skills all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane i didnt press anything freezes and thats it cant move at all some sort of hack joined another session after few minutes i noticed two people with godmode on so i went passive mode but guess what they started shooting cars at me and i died about 10 times i advice you not to buy this game at all

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

love the game i cant believe it is now 80 dollars which is why i am giving this a thumbs down
not recommended
so i bought this game a day after release on pc the game ran perfectly fine in fact it ran even better than expected i didnt have any issues starting the game up however about two weeks after the release im beginning to see problems i havent even been able to play the last two days because the game crashes immediately after launch i tried safe mode other problems include long loading times and issues when connecting to other players playing heists at this point id say you should wait until the majority of the launch problems and connection issues are fixed of course theyll never be completely fixed but i expect better from rockstar a couple days ago in a patch they even said this fixed a rare issue where the steam version of the game would crash right after launching httpssupportrockstargamescomhcenusarticles204909368 like i said wait until launch and connectionserver issues are atleast partially fixed if you cant wait to buy it then good luck i will update this review as the game improves

very broken game very disapointed and rockstar doesnt give a f about it when you contact their support

the game itself is very good but suffers under the rule of a shoddy developer which only cares about money the multiplayer portion of the game is riddled with hackers and their customer support can be compared to valves

was a great game until rockstar went nuts with throwing the banhammer at singleplayer modders people using the fov mod ect the longevity of this game is already limited but without mods dont expect it to be nearly as great as the gtasa days until a third party multiplayer mod is created
not recommended
guy i love this game the online mode is addicting and its a great openworld multiplayer sandbox however rockstars move to up the price of the game during the steam summer sale to $80 shows just how much they card about profits over customer satisfaction its slowly trickling into the main game too with the pushing of shark cards microtransactions to be able to purchase the coolest and newest vehicles get your  together rockstar

you dont make pc gamers wait a year then jack the price up for the summer sale gtav is fine but rockstar sucks also their overpriced in game cash in an insult i preordered this game but this 25% summer sale markup earns my negative vote

rockstar has once again made a classic but the classic is getting muddled with company policy right now they are banning people with mods some reports of them done from single player constant patching to stop any sort of modding couldnt they just make a separate version of single player and online so the online version doesnt load anything nope then the constant issues and bad optimization crashes cant load stuck on loading screens bad support exceptionally constricting fov and attempts to make the mod invalid that makes you puke memory leaks memory leaks memory leaks memory leaks did i mention memory leaks well memory leaks lots of it since gtaiv rockstar has been a disaster on the pc scene not releasing red dead redemption to shoddy ports like this i would have assumed that they might have learned how bad gtaiv was when released due to performance issues and being a crappy port nope they didnt learn a thing delays after delays and they released another shoddy port what sort imbecile creates an fov with such restrictive options i loved the idea of the first person perspective but after throwing up twice i gave up using it the last time i had an issue with fov was with halflife 2 when they changed fov between fps and vehicle use to simulate speed i also assumed due to the extreme time it took to get this out to pc that they would at least figure out that some peripherals like a rudder or a joystick cant be used for typing but if you do own any of them especially a rudder pedal when you type your login details in the horrid idea of a social club it wont allow you to it will popup a virtual keyboard requiring you to use the rudder so it allows you to type on the keyboard not only that some textures look washed out or blurry where are the high definition textures you get in games like shadows of mordor for a classic to be sullied by bad policies like this is truly saddening this is quite likely the last time i buy any rockstar game until they figure their  out

while grand theft auto v has proved to be a fun game for me in the past when i bought it on pc i was plagued with troubles its at the point where the game just isnt playable to me ive had a rockstar support ticket open for about a month and a couple weeks and all rockstar support has done is give me the same troubleshooting tips over and over again their support system has been the worst ive ever experienced and if you decide to buy the game i hope you do not have any troubles with it because rockstar support wont help you at all because of that alone im not going to recommend this game to people when you have an issue that makes the game unplayable and the companys support team just gives you the same message over and over it becomes pretty pointless either way i wish you the best of luck if you decide to play this game

the single player is fun especially with mods that is if you can access it thanks to its online drm the multiplayer is full of hackers which can honestly be a godsend since the in game economy mirrors that of a f2p korean mmo thanks to the introduction of shart cards they are bundling this item which you wont even need thanks to the abundant hackers so they can sell the game for $60 but still claim its discounted for the summer sale rockstar is sadly heading the way of other shady exploitative video game companies

1 p2p networking with no anticheat as a result you get people modifying virtually every aspect of the game 2 p2p mesh networking introduces all sorts of problems that a dedicated server would not have such as faulty connection matchmaking it is not unusual to spend most of youre time trying to play with friends rather then actually playing on a similar note the games ram consumption is ridiculous however the sheer number of hacks that can do anything from godmode to making a shotgun act like a nuclear bomb when it comes to the force of the shot to people shooting moneybags  s  christmas trees or spawning any vehicle they want really leaves much to be desired pass over dont even consider this game until its on sale for like 75% off or if you want it purely for the singleplayer story

game is alright but its sickening to see how theyre avoiding the summer sale by making you buy the game and dlc together for the price of the base game while claiming its on sale

while the pc version of this outstanding game is new its been out long enough on consoles that i dont need to go into every single thing about the game so ill just sum up what i personally like alot and dont like not too much likes the environment an insane amount of detail has been paid to recreating parts of la ls to near perfection having been to the actual city several times i could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game the viper roorm ripleys believe it or not museum the scientology center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same when the sun sets and rises all of the lighting is accurate and at times absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around mt chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities its some of the best weather fx ive seen in a game because it feels real roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes it truly feels like a living world the satire what i feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle thats so prevalent in la across all social classes the rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way its never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto the signage and radio commercials are also perfect knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself this can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations the characters there are many who dislike the characters especially trevor and i can see why but i liked them because of how they played off of one another michael the would be retiree whos juggling family problems franklin a young man growing up in the hood doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle trevor the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey none of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but theyre all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them the voice actors do an a job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life the first person mode not only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made its also one of the best fpss in years being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes the radio stations theres nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking we built this city by starship or heartbeat by don johnson if you like pop rock country rap trance or even talk radio theres something here for anyone to like dislikes the police they seem overly aggresive and i dont know if thats a play on the lapd or not but there have been time that ive simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds also while in a car ive been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot i could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me the storefronts i just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but i also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world id be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games the sub and the helicopter for me the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode the model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few the helicopter while fun could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets thankfully rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this real time destruction again like the storefronts i know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and wed probably be lucky to get 1030 frames per second with physx cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments extra activities given the sun and sand vibe of lsla i wish that you could surf and skateboard seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth thats not to say they couldnt add these things in a dlc pack fingers crossed but i just find theior absence strange and overlooked those nitpicks aside this is still one of the best games ive played in a very long time and with so much to do ill be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time overall score 9 out of 10

hello community i have decided to wright a review about gta v first of all i love the game series sooo much and i have played them all since gta 1 so i hope that my review will be quite objectively please feel free to leave a comment or discuss issues with me after playing gta v more than 300 hours i think now its time to discuss buisness pros the singleplayer in this game is awesom  there is so much you can do that you will have fun for many hours and more the storry from singleplayer is great good redline through the game with lots of fun missions and great heists graphics on high end pc are quite nice could have been better d fantastic ambience throughout the whole world  amazing  masterpiece of soundtrack the radiostations in this game are really good and have something to offer for almost every taste of music great sarcasm and lots of eastereggs and funstuff to find or collect tv and internet  all thumbs up d cons the multiplayer i have waited sooo long to play a gta game in actual multiplayer together with friends and puplic people but it is impossible permanent laggy gamesessions connection errors all the time friends getting kicked out of invite only sessions permanently hours of loading screens im running this game on high end pc with ssd drive and still loading for hours very low payout rate of money a friend played gta v on ps3 and told me that the payouts were way better back in the days  so they nerfed the payouts down after releasing heists it takes really long to save up for something big like hydra or whatever which takes me to my next point  hackers the damn game is full with hackers  everywhere rockstar doesnt seem to do a lot against them because they are everywhere at any time jumped through 5 puplic lobbies encountered 7 hackers breaking the whole realm shooting moneybags or cars out of their weapons teleporting with godmode screwing up other peoples clients so that they get banned instead of the true hacker i`m sick of them i also am sick of  players joining the lobbies  first question asked is there a hacker here i need money wtf  such aholes should be banned too right from the moment they typed in this question dont missunderstand me here i have a 0 tolerance policy for hackers they ruin everybodys game expierience and people who abuse hacking methods for their own good are the same scum in my opinion last words i really love the game and i will continue to play it but im not sure if i will give the multiplayer another chance i will also give the game a good review because the game itself is a fantastic masterpiece of game design the multiplayer will get all thumbs down from me d rockstar please solve the hacker problem i would totally recommend gta v to everybody but be aware of the multiplayer maybe wait a year or so until it will be on a steam sale for half of the actual price you will totally not regret buying it then best regards boudewijn ijzenarm

i do not recommend this game not because the nomod or the bans as most negative reviews addressed rockstar has officially stated they do not ban singleplayer mods  and do allow mods in the singleplayer now to my review seriously i had a lot of hype and hope for gta v  but i just lost my motivations as fast as a bullet shot i admit this game has a lot of cool and fun stuffs in the singleplayer  and with mods the singleplayer can continue and replayed for a fair amount of time however gta online  the online part of gta v it is just a letoff gta online is either grief ta online or grind ta online gta online hardly can be said fun at all i can be in a lobby filled with players but not a single one bothered to join my mission  they are busy shooting each other in freemode then joined a few crews in hope for a better chance oddly  the crewmembers never accept the invitations of course one would then troll git gud and git some friends  lets just say perhaps bad timing in the end i am still solo in the freemode  cannot find anyone to join my mission when i see lots of anyone running in front of me shooting each other  facepalm then one can also troll go join other players mission  yeah i do but howbout a change for a little doing the same heists overnover with different players on different days  just the same dayyum heists i am getting bored and annoyed the only sideactivities offered in gta online are   watching players killing each other in freemode  waste the money on digital strippers and hookers  wait for simeon ordering a dayyum vehicle and try get it  wait for a target vehicle to spawn and try destroy it tldr  awesome singleplayer  boring online

yes this is one of those games that nail that sweetspot of rp [roleplaying] and the perfected multiplayer that is in gta v personally in these games i go for that and its typically hard for me to find games that are like this that my friends and i enjoy playing gta before [so gta iv] hit the perfect spot of relying on the community of mods to keep it interesting and multiplayer which was fantastic i think in these kind of reviews its important to mention its predecessors and judge them to see exactly how far they have come gta iv was fantastic but abit buggy alot of glitches to be exploited and kinda fell short in that rp aspect as i saw it pros alot more to do in the terms of role playing and in terms of multiplayer alot more for the player to strive for which is a key aspect in keeping a player immersed and infactuated with a game alot of the reason why skyrim and such are still so played  the multiplayer is done really well no ports or anything to have a server just for you and your friends to screw around in  roleplaying has that optional feature that it isnt necessary to have rely on like in skyrim there is that feeling that you can have it with friends aswell the game is what you make of it and i love it  the asthetics are supremely adjustable more than alot even most games have out there and helps catch the eye that just give you that itchy finger for screenshots  friends if you have any this is a game that can just be played for screwing around in a sandbox feel and keep the game anticipating which most games dont do  the game literally is just for  and laughs there are some many things in this game that just make fun of other things in media which keep the game hilarious and fun to play  the story mode is well done but not alot of replay value and is fun just for a story mode with good characters and voice acting that arent heard in every single game you play like troy baker as the main voice actor helps make it diverse  online and singleplayer are easy to switch to and from with easy access to players etc  the ingame recording is a nice and good feature to have that makes the game feel a complete package which helps complete that 60$ feeling to a game such as this  pc master race> console beta testing cons  public servers suck like public restrooms when you enter one you nonstop get killed and robbed etc and it seems that no matter what when you leave an activity you automatically enter one unless you set it to make your own private server  when you are in a public server when someone talks in it it goes across all the server there should be some limiting proximity to this because it is just plain mic spam when someone is talking  the damage system for cars is kind of short cars give way super fast unless you buy armor for it [in about like 100 levels] which sucks and gives the feeling of buying cars just plain dumb  killing in the game is a bit realistic and a bit stupid a combonation of both which could be easily fixed when you shoot at someone they take about awhole round in anywhere but the head  cop are extremely accurate and actually do stuff which is good in the sense never do something bad or the cops will come eat you but its done in away that if you do something like run over a headlight they chase you this drags away from the initial feel of gta in my opinion  the  loading there are so many loading screens that take awhile to through even with the game optimzation  the game is the most demanding game ive played ever which makes it hard to have fun and not worry about your fps the whole time and that sucks major cohoanez i run a 970 and still get 42 fps and some points  game invites there are so many of them and that little ding that you get when you are playing sucks  cause its so damn frequent and sucks i know there is the setting to pretty much turn it off but you cant from my experience when playing with friends with all of these pros they do outweigh the cons in the game in away that yes if you look closely at the game every second you will notice but otherwise if you play the game normally you wont most of the time this all being said i find the game to still be fun with and without friends hours and hours of gameplay in and will proly delve hundreds upons thousands of hours in the game with friends mods and gameplay enjoyment with so much to do and work toward it keeps the game perfect this is a perfect game that was worth the wait and everything is lovely and asthetic as a hot girl in the sun

single player is well and good but at this current state online is a big mess and for that its not worth the full price issues with the multiplayer which i couldnt solve but i could be wrong and didnt see the option etc are like this  cant choose a server locationnor shows you what your ping is i mean what year is this rockstar  on top of possible bad connection you cant choose the amount of players you want to play with either it might put you in a full pop server or a server with 1 person in it so fire up the find a new session button until you can find your liking   because of the possible bad connection there are server disconnectswhich puts you back into the single player   there are armored cars with bulletproof windows running around killing people and if god forbid you want to defend yourselfonly way how is blowing them up you pay for their cars repair around 6k every time  there are invisible cheaters with rocket machine guns  doings heists without 4 friends is a pain in the   you can only choose what kind of session you wanna join through single player such as private lobby theres only the option to find a new session on multiplayer which puts you in a random public server without asking you what kind of session you want at the time of writing this i couldnt find it on top of all this there is a stuttering issue with hunderds of people are having and rockstar support doesnt know how to respond with other than copy paste answers link  httpssupportrockstargamescomhccommunitiespublicquestions203473047gtavpcstutterissue all in all multiplayer and single player feel like 2 different games entirely atleast made by 2 different studios its mindboggling how a studio can make such a great single player game and make so many simple mistakes when implementing it to multiplayer

i would absolutely love to give gta v a positive review the singleplayer is great like any gta game and the multiplayer is a lot of fun if you have friends to play it with however because of rockstars extremely shady and dirty business practices regarding the summer sale i cannot in good faith give a positive review first off when the 2015 summer sale started the base game priced as $60 usd was removed from the steam store but restored later and some bundles of gta v  other things were added one was gta v  max payne 3  200000 gta online cash another was gta v  gta sa  200000 gta online cash and the third was gta v  1000000 gta online cash all of these bundles are priced at $80 usd but with a 25% off sticker slapped on leaving the game at $60 meanwhile after being restored you could buy just gta v for $60 a few days into the summer sale i see gta v under the top sellers listings priced at $20 33% off of $30 i mouse over the listing and it definitely says it is gta v i then go to the store page and lo and behold rockstar placed a bundle of gta online in game cash cards at the top of the store page causing steam to display the price of the game to be $20 a complete ing flat out lie go  yourselves rockstar i will not support these business practices especially on a game that is arguable 2 years old at the time of this writing and i ask everyone willing to listen to not support such business practices either edit additionally to my knowledge because of how steams refund work you cannot refund a game if you purchased consumable dlc such as in game money so if you bought one of the bundles of gta v  shark card you most likely cannot refund the game

long story short for people who love gta and want to play singleplayer only this is for you if you want to play online you will probably get killed by hackers and guess what rockstar does nothing about it there is no simple way to report players so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers game itself 1010 gta online 310 hackers everywhere edit this is itdecided to improve my flying skills all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane i didnt press anything freezes and thats it cant move at all some sort of hack joined another session after few minutes i noticed two people with godmode on so i went passive mode but guess what they started shooting cars at me and i died about 10 times i advice you not to buy this game at all

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

rockstar is really trying to  up the community first of all if i get into an online game the first thing i see is a hacker thats the first up next one if i want to buy the game while its on sale i just need to pay the same ing amount as before you basically get a tiger shark cash card included in this one thats all i would recommend everyone who wants to buy the game to just wait till rockstar wants to clarify their up themself if you only want to play the singleplayer and dont care about the same price in a ing sale just buy it the game itself is still one of the best multiplayer games in the last years

this game i bought it this morning and when i went eagerly to play i was presented by a myriad of hackers but thats just the tip ontop of the blatantly atrocious amount of hackers even on an online platform which requires processing to allow ingame money purchases i was ripped off r shadily keeps the 60$ price but gets that nice sale tag by bundling it with dlc but thats not the worse part ill get to that in a bit but first do not buy the bundle r have created it to exploit a loophole not only are they doing a  thing by keeping the price high for a 2 year old game but they exploited a loophole that when you buy the bundle it is the microtransaction that costs 60$ and over not the game the game is priced free so when you try to get a refund you cannot get a refund for the base game only the microtransaction the result  it is impossible to get a refund but thats not what pisses me off no do you know what pisses me off  the shark card didnt even work i cannot get a refund for a microtransaction item that technically does not exist to my account do not buy the bundle you will regret it

tldr  sp really good mp lacking and rankingmoney is stupid modding should be supported bad rockstar for trigger happy banning i enjoy the game and think it is pretty fun but it has a lot of issues whilst i would have given it a thumbs up rockstars new trigger happy stance with banning has made me think otherwise okay first the game issues the single player sp is fantastic really its deep vast and between the three consoles ive played it on i still havent seen all there is to offer there is a lot of thought and detail put into the single player and it makes it so much better for it multiplayer mp feels very two dimensional in comparison whilst it makes sense for some things not to happen in mp i think there could have been a lot added depending on server stress i find it odd that they dont include animals in mp arguments could be its wasted resources that could go into displaying pedestrians and enemies etc but a lack of a lot of these features makes mp feel boring if youre on your own the leveling and financial system in the game feels very much like rockstar making you play as long as possible through grinding if were speaking about getting to level 100 the mission variety is lacking the payout is terrible and the people you play with dont make it any better it may not be a majority but i guess itd be nice to be able to talk to someone in a lobby who hasnt claimed to have had past relations with either my mother or sister microtransactions really makes sense that the actual good vehicles are an extortionate amount and the mission payoffs are pitiful you want a fighter jet like the one shown in the mp trailer well that will be about 4060hrs of multiplayer gaming just to get to a level high enough to even think about purchasing it if you havent been saving money which you wont have been since ammunition is also a lot then you will have to do another 10hrs or so to have enough to buy it being very optimistic or pay 1199 for $3 million between university and a part time job i dont have time for that sh stuff i said stuff maybe you should have a little more dedication or patience well im sorry but as much as video gaming would be a great career im not there yet now the modding thing is what made me rate down modding was inevitable for the pc absolutely inevitable you only have to look up some gta iv gameplay on youtube to see people modding the hell out of it even on mp now there is a huge difference between gta iv and v mp which is why there will be stricter policy on modding the ranking progression in gta iv had little to no relevance and there were no microtransactions the only things i remember at least you unlocked through ranking was items of clothing in gta v ranking unlocks guns vehicles and clothes the former two being of most importance now microtransactions are involved then modding is a lot more dangerous to rockstar since people may be modding money in which is a loss for them and its a shame rockstar resort to this but ferrets i hear you cry rockstar has been banning people who have modded sp only or allowing to make graphical changes like fov what about that yes this is stupid i guess i cant know how rockstar have developed the information they receive from players is it as complex as knowing exactly what files they have changed and what to i dont know for all we know it could just be as soon as the game files have been opened a big red ban button starts flashing and someone on the other side presses it but its all stupid all of it ha you thought i was defending rockstar no way the trigger happiness of rockstar is akin to eas usage of microtransactions by the way i pay 5060 for a game i expect the full god damn game im sorry to anyone who works at rockstar dont take it personally i am sure you are all sweet and lovely people but the ban hammer attitude is a braindead move rockstar youre sticking a middle finger up your customers poop void by banning them for modding and losing any trust they had in you as developers this may not impact gta sales in a huge way but there will be more games if someone is banned for a fov mod for sp only like a scorned lover would they buy your next game i think a reset would be a little less harsh but they shouldnt have to happen in the first place rockstar is desperately trying to force people to use the broken leveling and money system they have made some people mod things that dont have any effect on those system but theyre banned them anyway right summary of an essay now the reason mods are being banned from what i can gather is rockstar are afraid of people damaging their mp system of leveling and microtransactions the solution in my opinion is an evaluation of what makes gta so much fun and why the current system is broken you know what we dont need an evaluation i can tell you right now what makes gta so much fun a lot of messing about why is the current system broken you have to level up and pay to have access to anything to mess about and the funnest things to mess about with are beyond a lot of peoples reach thats why were modding because rockstar doesnt want us to have fun paraphrasing but i wanted something dramatic for my closing sentence

honestly i dont like this game the multiplayer is ungodly imbalanced cheaters 247 hacked lobbies etcetc all that we couldve expected most of the time the fps eats the damn dirt as well so optimization isnt that improved from iv the lack of bulletproof windows makes you an easy target in almost all lobbies most weapons are either unpowered or overpwoered no balance was considered in this game whats over i still play but thats becuase im level 82 big whoop still fight hacked lobbiers who are level 8000 overall this game is one big sham my recomendation wait until the lobbies die off and then invite some friends becuase you can trust randoms with jack  heists are okay but the lack uniqueness honestly i dont like the concept where your forced to use preset clothings on the standard option i know i know immersion but it makes your character appear like a damn clone honestly the cops are op likesuper op example fire a silenced firearm in a desert where nobody can hear you about 5 times2 starsand about a 15 minute wait until that goes away out of sight even more annoying about the cops is when your trying to take a bounty or any other pvp stuff in a lobby matched and they focus on only one of you which is annoying as  i hate the concept of the multiplayer lobby having you show up as a bright dot on the map 247 i hate i hate it i hate it theres no privacy none of it yeah yeah yeah you can disabled the blip with lester but seriously when has 1 minute honestly made a ing difference nowhere my opinion only allow friendscrew to see your blip you can keep the nametags up but why the hell would you add a ing blip permanently worst concept ive ever seen in my life i can see it being only usefull on bounties friendscrew as mentioned beforehand and players with a high hostility rate otherwise its just a terrible concept even more complaints on weapon balance is that rockstar doesnt know wtf their doing their version of balancing the weapons is adding free dlc weapons which are superior to the vanilla weapons that can be unlocked at the very 1st rank example is a lock on misslethe ing thing has more damage than the rpg yet it has the ability to lock onto people welp there went balance out the window now instead of using a rank lock we might as well be giving miniguns as ing candy honestly dont pay $60 for this in its current state dont even pay $40its not worth itthe story is pretty decent but the mp is just thrown out of propertion its a failed state of deciding it wants to be call of duty with permanent uav mode on battlefield name spam 4 the sims towards customization and money gamehardlines cops and robbers and a socialness game it makes no ing senseoh not to mention in gta online you have the durability of a god damn cracker yet hacked lobby levelers can withstand about 3 shotgun blasts point blank andor more than half of a ar mag to the chest with the introduction of heists everyone is just a damn zombie instead of brains though their feeding on the most boooooooring gamemode that is now overused the heists themselves dont even give you that much rp and just mostly money even then youll fail about 90 times on just the 2nd heist unless you have level 100s meaning your better off doing missions its faster and more lucrative in the end also the game gets grindy as  later levels about 80100 youll do about 20 heists fully before you get to 100 in a way its almost like rockstar wants you to cheat just so they can ban all of their own player base oh and no mp modding disappointing but with the current situation of cheater lobbies im actrully agreeing

the world seems pretty small compared to the older games and having three main characters kind of ruins the immersion but the story is interesting even if it is based primarily around heists online play is fun to muck around on especially with friends but its hard to take seriously because of all the hackers and its very difficult to make enough cash to afford anything nice without buying $100 shark cards from the rockstar store making the whole experience seem a little gimmicky and ruining the most redeemable part of the game for most buy this game if youre well of for money but if not there are much nicer games you can get for less than a quarter of the price

i dont think anyone here can agree with the way rockstars pushes its limits with the way they handle a sale they bring out their game after years and raise the price of the game right before the well known steam summer sale so it remains the same with 25% off they justify this by giving you some free in game money which runs out within an hour of normal gameplay as its really not all that much ontop of all of this the extra in game money makes it so you can not refund the game how is this acceptable by anyones standards no matter how much of a fan of rockstar you are valve is being too lenient with this kind of behavior and shouldve frankly given rockstar a slap on the wrist if not a knife

summary positives great visuals fun multiplayer optimized well amazing world great characters and great narrative negatives poor mission design which are scriptfests that dont offer any freedom ridiculously easy a few mechanics which dumb the game down insanely grand theft auto returns in the same fashion it left off an open world action game that gives the player freedom to do as they please throughout the city inbetween completing missions given to you by various characters gta 5 is an absolute spectacle this is the first modern game that has impressed me technologically wise it looks great and plays great the world feels alive and the audio is done incredibly well it is also really well optimized my pc is fairly old and i get stable framerates on ultra settings gta 5 offers an incredibly strong narrative brilliant characters that are voiced amazingly well and a story which is similar to that of an over the top large budget action film the gameplay hasnt changed much at all besides for being able to switch between characters on the fly which makes for some pretty interesting gun fights later in the game in gta 5 there is an awesome selection of weapons to use which are also modifiable allowing you to add attachments such as silencers better scopes flashlights and upgrading the magazine capacity and accuracy staying true to the series gta v is pretty much a satire of modern america which involves stereotypes and pointing fun at different organizations and people people who get offended easily may not appreciate the humour this game offers as it is pretty remorseless the multiplayer is great fun along with tdm races etc youre able to carry out missions with other players such as heists theyre not too challenging but pretty fun when you have a team of people who know what theyre doing while gta v is generally a good game i dont think ive ever played a game as easy as it there is absolutely no challenge at all in the campaign none and any difficulty this game couldve had is taken away by constant checkpoints through missions super powers your characters possess such as being able to slow down time and your life regenerating to a point i also didnt like the way the missions played out theyre pretty much on rails unlike gta 3 and vice city which allowed you to complete lots of missions in anyway you pleased this just has some cutscene of your character clumsily walking into a combat sequence then you having to take out all the enemies steal the car etc instead of being able to use the games massive world and approach the combat situations how you please that was a massive part of what made the earlier installments of the series really fun overall this is an okay game which couldve been a whole lot better had they focussed less on cinematics and scripted events and put more effort into making clever mission design and not adding in a few mechanics which make this extremely easy ride even easier i cant recommend this as polished as the game is and how brilliant the writing is the missions are inexcusably easy and offer no freedom while a much better game than gta 4 this still comes no where near the original games

single player this game is just as good as the other gtas loads of fun once you start modding even more fun definatly worth a buy multiplayer on the other hand is a mess people leaving half way through a heist completely ends the heist and any progress you have made people leave once it gets that little bit to challenging hackers everywhere which just sucks the fun out of it so many issues joining other sessions when you eventually do get into a session with other friends it can be really fun but when no friends are online its just not worth it not recommending this purely on the fact people are being banned for having single player mods like fov or advanced graphics

this sale is an illegal business practice in canada the game is tagged at $8998 and on sale for 25% off at $6748 when the full price before the sale was $6999 google false or misleading ordinary selling price representations and look for the government of canada overview what rockstar is pulling here carries a penalty of $10000000

failed to load zlib get used to this error if you want to play more than 10 minutes at a time ive reinstalled three times and verified integrity of game cache about 8 times and still this game crashes every time i try to play ive run md5 and done checksum on each of the 20 something files and still nothing but my good ol buddy zlib i just want a refund now apparently the games industry believes its fine to sell a broken product blame the end user and then hide behind the refundproof shield of no refunds because piracy  if your product doesnt work its not my fault and i shouldnt be the one to have to try and fix it the game is good for the few minutes i could play it but its not even remotely worth the hassle and frustration that ive had to deal with trying to do that steam has handled this terribly i absolutely love how the steam support has no way to contact them about a game that is broken classy guys keep it up update the most recent patch has seemingly resolved this issue and ive been able to play without any crashing today i hate that this is the norm however it took them two weeks to fix what should have been properly tested before launch i am happy its fixed and the game is very good 4 out of 5

im going to be honest the single player is very fun obviously that being said you should not purchase this gameespecially not at full price rockstar is a disgusting company that only spits on its fans and takes every cash grab it possibly can eg a full priced pc and nextgen rerelease long after the original game came out and pulling any  possible to avoid the steam sale you should not support rockstar by purchasing this game and i actually strongly recommend torrenting it instead the multiplayer is such garbage that it isnt worth getting a legitimate copy of the game and thereby supporting such a vile company tldr single player is good but multiplayer sucks and the company does too just get it from tpb or something

so far not having a good experience with this game as much as i do like gta the pc version so far is awful as the damn game wont load up and just crashes instantly just on the social club menu ive tried searching up solutions but nothing has seemed to help or work this game is bugged and needs to be fixed unless anyone who reads this can help but so far the pc version is a no go for now until rockstar fix there game

i dont think anyone needs any introduction to this game so i will just comment on the port the game runs perfectly at 60 fps with all high settings with my gtx 970 sli the new feature of having your own custom radio station that plays your music is a really great feature just put your music files or shortcuts both work in the user music folder found usually at c\users\your username\documents\rockstar games\gta v\user music after putting the files just perform a quick scan in the ingame audio options and you are ready my only gripe with this game is that it will be tied to your social club account and in case you lose the account then you wont be able to play the game anymore

altough i played it on the ps3 and it was a very good game on that platform after a day i haven been able to get the game to start yesterday i made a rockstar support ticked nothing heard of it i find it sad because on the ps3 it was a titan of a game on the pc i expected even more so im sad that this happened i cant recommend it now form my point of view but when i can get it to work i think it would be one of the best free roam pc games right now on the pc so right know i cant recomment it sadly because of technical problems when those problems are solved and will not arise for new players based on my expirience form the ps3 version i would definetly recomend this game just not the pc version right know sorry

mine aint nothin special but it gets the job done  trevor where to begin lets start out with the hype around this game while no game can truely live up to it all this game certainly comes close the single playersorry story modeis what youd expect from a gta game these days long fun and somewhat captivating theres some silly moments in it not quite san andreas level but pretty close that keeps the more boring bits interesting and some great chase scenes while i havent even came close to completing the game at the time of this review i still feel the game was worth the 3999 i payed now gta online oh boy its hard to explain or even define but theres something about online that makes it addictive much like your skyrims youre constantly wanting to get better stuff be that cars boats helicopters jets weapons or clothes youre always after something new yes there are lobbies with much higher level players in there destroying us newer players but theyre not that frequent even when in one youll have some enjoyment getting your revenge or go into passive mode while i brought the game for the story mode im finding myself focusing more on the online play theres some issues with lobbies randomly being emptied in short you are moved into your own empty lobby due to the rockstar servers claiming your rig or connection cant handle the current lobby but you can still join jobs with others no problem in short id highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone its great fun has humour and is excellent value for money

have owned the game for 2 hours played for 30 mins and spent the next 1 hour 30 trying to get past the loading screen to no avail 40 down the drain i suppose it will probably be fixed down the line in a patch somewhere but a search on the net shows plenty of threads with people with the same issues dated 3 weeks ago but this is one of them games i doubt ill come back too at a later date i read the bad reviews before purchasing this even my spidey sense was tingling with this one and i still went a head and bought it anyway at full price too  up to you if you want to risk it and buy this game but i ignored the reviews and my own gut feeling and am now regretting the decision  from what i did see though the game looks absolutely fantastic i was itching to see what it would run like on my now middle aged gaming rig but that 780ti lurking in there still chews through most stuff with ease the game ran at what looked like fairly maxed out settings at a smooth 60fps the reflections in the cars at night i found particularly eye catching at one point i noticed some mountains in the distance so i caught some dude at the traffic lights proceeded to beat him to death in the street with my bare hands stole his motor cycle and headed for the hills after a few mins of some crazy motorcycle action on the back wheel on the wrong side of the road much like kerby lonsdale on a sunny sunday afternoon really  jk  i reached the foot of the mountains a bit worried that the sports bike would not be up to the job of an off road mountain climb i ventured fourth anyway my trusty steed held the ridge line like a mountain goat and soon i was at the summit well high up anyway about 100 yards to the right of the i think vinewood sign as you look out over the city below the view you are greeted with is nothing short of spectacular i cant wait to see some of the sunsets only when i can play  i think ill give it another half an hour of trying to get it working then im gonna go play tf2 ill update this review if i get it working in this case  no news is bad news edit  ok update time deleted the local content before i went to bed and redownloaded the game upon testing this morning the same loading screen issue  anyway i got fed up and wrote a ticket to rockstar about the problem checked back on gta and it was still stuck on the loading screen so i went and got my car from the repair shop did a bit of shopping and when i got home the game had loaded looks like i might just be looking at a 15min plus loading time it might be longer it had only been loading for 15 mins when i left the house i was gone for about an hour hope its just the game settling in the game itself is running great just completed a couple of missions the ability to switch between joypad and keyboard & mouse is superb absolutely seamless even the onscreen hint icons change on the fly dropping the joypad for the shooting sections and grabbing the mouse is brilliant ive even got the self radio working was running a mission listening to an old rave tape of mine from back in the early 90s the problem with it though is there is currently no option to set the self radio as default so every time you get into a different car you have to retune the radio there is also no way of turning off individual radio stations im sure this used to be an option ok so it might be a small irritation but it is irritating me no worries you would think this is pc  something like this will be modded in a matter of seconds sadly no rockstar in their infinite wisdom have banned modding entirely even for single player looks like they have been pretty liberal with the ban hammer too this decision is quite frankly gutting rockstar this is pc  not console i understand your decision regarding the multiplayer aspects but for single player come on  disable achievements etc and let the community mod it to death so in a show of solidarity with the modding community this review will remain negative until rockstar pull their heads out of their arses and let the community mod the game

disclaimer mixed review ahead i didnt like how rockstar took there time and planned to release during christmas 2014 which turned to delay after delay finally as of april 13th we are able to get the game the first thing we all experienced was that the launcher wasnt working for some people and online wasnt working for everyone until 2hours later preloading the game was a pain for people who had installed the game on there ssd rockstar why didnt you tell us the game was 120gb when extracted seriously please add some oceania servers as us australians new zealanders hate connecting to united states servers and experiencing bad ping other than that ive been playing for 12 hours now and i am enjoying online

so far really dissapointed lots of lag and freezingwithout these lags and freezes game runs like a charm so they did something good there but still for me its unplayable due to these freezes and lags  i even tried it on low settings but same issue my rig is above recommended  and ofcourse the cloud servers have issues saving progress once in a while  before fanbois cry this has nothing to do with my rig   and today for some reason my garage got bugged and i lost 2 of my expensive cars which were fully upgraded  i am a returning player from xbox 360  and now each time i put a car there it gets duplicated but the duplicated one does nto really exist but still takes up the garage slot to park a car if you want to play the game without issues and problems stay away from it for 1 month and then try hopefully rockstar has solved these issues

where to begin with err_gfx_d3d_init tried everything i could to solve this problem rockstar claimed they fixed it in last patch i claim otherwise bawsaq disabled because of cheaters online uses a p2p system there is no anticheat program expect it to die soon or be infested by cheaters even more than it is today optimisation the game runs great if it runs graphics game looks great by todays standart best gta in terms of gameplay but sadly i wouldnt recomend the game those issues are simply unbearale and sometimes prevent you from even playing rockstar hasnt learned anything from past games gta iv mp3 in terms of online multiplayer and its the forth title with multiplayer iv rdr mp3 v maybe next time edit 100715 ill gotten gains dlc yey free content nope another game breaking update that introduces stuttering back again thanks rockstar edit 120715 it apears that the latest update introduces a anticheat program that impacts dramatically the performance of the game while this would apear to be good news cheaters can still use scripts undected in online while regular players not using mods suffer the consequences good job rockstar

its an ok game but considering its 2 and a half years old and has been delayed multiple times for pc i dont think they put much effort into it there are things broken that would have been easy to detect if qa had been done properly such as falling through the map when you do the first multiplayer heist  forcing a restart game crashing if you disconnect from r servers midgame and you want to quit  and more pros fun to play with friends short loading screens besides for initial one  see cons although i havent played it a huge amount my friends keep telling me the campaign is great cons glitchy if you join a lobby where someone else cheating gives you money you get banned you can get banned for using graphical modsfov increaser for first person you can be banned for using sp mods initial loading screen takes forever constant disconnect from servers due to being unable to connect to one other peer 2 peer hosting constant disconnect from r servers r customer support is pretty bad so if you have any issues its hard to get a proper reply r customer support dont know what they are talking about  they said graphical mods wont get you banned they did cost of dlc items is huge to try and force you to buy their gameshark cards microtransactions for example the heist jet is $3000000 but if you want to buy that with real money it costs 32 similar with other items slow to earn money otherwise you can get a oneoff bonus from heists totalling $12000000 if you complete certain challenges easily crashes has caused me to have my pc shut down and bluescreen not from pc issues either worked fine if gta wasnt open has caused my nvidia drivers to crash on multiple occasions ingame chat is censored why its rated 18 and has plenty of swearing by the aiin the story not a huge amount to do in mp after the heists other than redo the heists or repetitive racesshort missions extremely bad and obvious screen tearing  and vsync on just makes the game look visibly worse just my thoughts on this but i wouldnt reccomend it for 40

alright so my review is not about the game but about its security i have spent a good 3040 hours in online gameplay and focused mainly one that noticing the outrageous ammount of hackers that litter the streets of this game i personally was able to find multiple easy use hacks with a simple google search the games online features are disgustingly unprotected making playing it too easy as theres people shooting millions of dollars in  with their guns yes  that give you 40k when picked up and their unbelievable use of god mode explosive ammunition weapons that arent even available in multiplayer or for their version like the rail gun the tommy gun the fireworks launcher etc what the  rockstar put some security on mp that isnt utter  that people will put out hacks for free

mixed review so has to get a thumbs down the good 1 game looks good 2 the tps elements arent bad 3 has the general gta feel the bad 1 driving is often sloppy due to character skillz  pretty huge component of a gta game could have just left this stat out altogether car handling would have been ample enough 2 characters fit typified stereotypes the ugly everything below i would consider pretty ing basic design elements for games 1 no defaults for user preference settings eg racing  no radio station  it doesnt even care to remember your previous settings 2 automatically defaults you into populated lobbies after a job if i wanted to be in a populated server i would have selected it from the start 3 single player required drm is this still working out for anyone apart from steam 4 friendlist is less than intuitive while i get they want you to manage things with your phone it would make sense to have those options that dont tie directly to your character but your account in the game over menu your element is in the wrong spot a good compromise would to have it in both locations hows about integrating it with already existing systems i dunno like friends on steam >> 5 pay2win how about um no 6 grind rank along with cash hurray other  pc launch online problems you do presales for a reason yes to pad your wallet with fat stacks of paper however it is also a good way for you to gauge launch day server load

long story short for people who love gta and want to play singleplayer only this is for you if you want to play online you will probably get killed by hackers and guess what rockstar does nothing about it there is no simple way to report players so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers game itself 1010 gta online 310 hackers everywhere edit this is itdecided to improve my flying skills all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane i didnt press anything freezes and thats it cant move at all some sort of hack joined another session after few minutes i noticed two people with godmode on so i went passive mode but guess what they started shooting cars at me and i died about 10 times i advice you not to buy this game at all

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

i purchased this game mainly for the multiplayer and it as of recently  gta online  has been a huge letdown there is no sense in joining a public lobby anymore unless youre looking forward to at least 14 people within there modding the game in some sort of way while also abusing it ive tried to ignore it and have even joined games in passive mode however mods can reach their way around that and youll still likely end up dead regardless of your settings in the early days of gta online for pc it was fairly enjoyable with hardly any modders to be seen at all now all i know is that if i want to even try to play online it has to be in a private friends only lobby which is not what i was expecting nor wanted when i preordered this game rockstar does not seem to have as great a control over their own servers as one would hope so buyerbewarned the following things listed can and mostlikely will happen to you or be seen by you at some point in the online version of this game modded events ive run into in my time spent playing online are people that shoot at you while phasing in and out of a mode that makes them unkillable  passive mode  shoot waves of cars at you which kill you eventually via impact or explosion spawnteleport behind you and kill you in some fashion explode multiple nonmodded players at will without contact spawn objects onto your player such as a tv body trash cans etc that obstruct your view while also utilizing infinite ammo modified speed on foot & in vehicles and lastly spawning on location and at will tanks armored vehicles vehicles found only in singleplayer weapons found only in singleplayer if anything get it for the singleplayer it can be pretty funny at times

crappy business practice not that im suprised to find out rockstar love money just look at the fact they managed to get people to buy the same game 3 times and get away with it business practices aside gta v is a solid game with a decent story but frankly in my opinion the online could have been better the fun people had with gta iv but i guess we have to take our online fun with our friends seriously because stock markets and houses and stuff i miss being able to do all the silly things online with people like the carmageddon mod or the lcpdfr mod where you could be police and arrest people while at first i saw the idea of gta online being cool i realised that to have fun you gotta work for it just like real life yay or you could yknow buy money i appreciate the great work behind gta v as it is in a number of ways better than gta iv with superior stability and performance as well as more to do and a bigger more varied world to mess around in no more do you find yourself trapped in nothing but a reasonably sized city now you can run over cougars or whatever else it is people do outside i found it hard to decide whether i should give this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down sadly i had to decide eventually so i felt the answer should reflect my complete opinion on the game needs more fun and interesting multiplayer if i wanted to play a semiserious and unrealistic mmo based on reallife then i shouldnt be allowed to have the things i want

all of these people commenting about the sale and the game being full price with the shark cards are not wrong though i see the reason rockstar is adding the shark cards to the game its so you cant get a steam refund double wammy right there coupled with an awful online community rampant hackers and a half  coded game i had to reset my cpus clock speed back to stock just to have this particular game run stable just this one all of the other games i own were just fine with me overclocking rockstar should just stop trying to bring there console games to pc ill admit i got a little enjoyment out of the game but there was just too much wrong with it for me to recommend it to anyone the online is nothing special its full of desyncs  horrible voice chat server issues and grinding most fun i did have is when a hacker dropped thousands of money bags on a friend of mine and i got to spend $8000000 without doing a bunch of bs if youre on the fence about buying go ahead and jump onto the side where you spend your money anywhere but here that would be a much better decision if sometime way later on down the line this game is on sale by itself no shark cards for 5$ sure go ahead and buy it but until then steer clear

good game  players and you may aswell scrub rockstars logo from the game its not theres atleast not any more the hackers own it now and there appears to be little to nothing they can do about it so if your gonna buy this game either be prepared to get screwed for atleast a month or hack yourself up like everyone else doing lately feel as though i should send hackers money after all they have provided more for the game then rockstar has dont get me wrong i hate hackers they ruin anything involving multiplayer but most other companys take 0 tolerance but when you google how to report hackers only to find like 6 pages on how to hack gta5 sites i cant help but know they have won already while also wondering wtf rockstar is doing look at google see how there doing it and fix it simple well simple if your company isnt using the hackers as a encouragement for players to buy ingame cash as to stand a chance or atleast try in vain lol lets just say iv got alpha games that do more work to stop hacking with 5% or less of the funds rockstar you are pathetic enjoy singleplayer way cheaper and less frustrating

i am having an absolute blast with this game its probably the best game that came out in the previous console generation and this is an improved version of that but i cannot recommend you give rockstar your money because of their horrible business practices rockstar has spoken out about the eula and have clarified that they are not banning for single player modifications however any modification installed even a singleplayer only one is still detected when going online and they are pretty much banning indiscriminately also players have been given two week bans for having money forced on them by modders that is unacceptable and rockstar refuses to lift their bans im changing my review to positive but tentatively if rockstar doesnt clean up their act soon this will return to a negative review and stay that way

my main reasons for not reccommending this game are these 1 loading times and how often you load in multiplayer is just ridiculous i spend far too much time staring at clouds 2 matchmaking is very poor in all my playtimei have never gotten or joined a full lobby of players for any game mode 3 fov slider is 5075 in first person mode this is disgraceful  but whats worse is if you mod the game to improve it you will be banned some are reporting being banned even if they only use mods in singleplayer 4 i run a r9 290x and i5 4670k with 32gb of ram maybe it is on my end maybe but ive had my framerate on high settings drop to 520fps when driving vehicles

when i bought this game is was kinda dissapointed because i had some issues when launching i have to do disable my video card or social club wont lauch then i have to quickly activate it again because the otherwise the game looks like  and laggs like hell but those issues aside this is the game of the year 2015 if you are looking for a game you wanne play with your friends but not sure if you want to race them shoot them help them stab them in the back and so much more then this is the game for you get your friends or join a crew get in their car and shoot your way to paradise 100% worth the money if you dont have any friends add me

for the first time in the series characters now have a set of eight skills that they can grow over time stamina strength stealth and lung capacity are joined by a meter for their special abilities these impact how long you can run and swim of course but also impact how well you handle recoil climbing speed takeoff and landing in planes and helicopters and so much more if you want to bump up your flying skills logic follows that you head to flight school similarly if youd like to have a bit more stamina then riding bikes triathlons tennis golf and other physical activities will help with that other than specialty skills simply doing more of something makes you better at it  practice makes perfect this is not an arbitrary add but one with real also graphically grand theft auto v makes the respectable presentation of its predecessor look pretty bland in comparison what a difference five and a half years makes gone is the drab and depressing color scheme giving players all the bright fauxcalifornia sun they can stand having lived in los angeles many places in the world of los santos san andreas are familiar the city itself is teeming with life and i dont just mean random pedestrians and cars roaming around people go about their daily lives traffic backs up downtown is busy vinewood is full of shopping and mansions vespucci beach has people skating and lifting weights blaine county is far more rural with rednecks and pink flamingos and wind turbines spin in the distance like the realworld san gorgonio pass wind farm the whole place feels organic looks the part and is more like a living world than ever before

i know ive player a lot of hours of this game crossing xbox 360 and pc but i still feel like the game is lacking from the upgrade the graphics are good but there are way too many things wrong with the game bugs that need to be fixed and are causing time to be wasted due to them this can include the fact that it crashes a lot for no reason and being disconnected from sessions for no known reason the second bad thing about this is the use of mods in online why cant you just play the game legit and work your way up instead having access to everything at a stupidly low level expect the level locked items and the fact that mods allow to be invunerable this neeeds to be sorted by r asap and the last bad is the new dlc that has been released illgotten gains which has insanely high prices and pretty much requires you to have money from modders or buy a lot of shark cards no way am i buying shark cards not worth it good points well like i said at first the graphics and maybe the amount that is available in online thats about it overall 410 maybe or 510 this may change if rockstar sort everything out and release a decent dlc

i preordered the game in january so this nonsense doesnt concerne me but still wow jewstar you are really doing this  this game was released 3 times xbox 360 ps3 then xbox one ps4 and then last pc and you cant put it on sale during the summer sale  what kind of person raises their game price just before sales so they cost roughly the same as before  did you throw all the money you made with this game  this is unacceptable

worst company ever such an amazing game but the company itself is slowly killing it and milking the users wallet irl the online is just a grind fest of unfun missions and no real coop or hackers if you want to compete drop $40 in cash to get millions of dollars in game ugh then they raised the price of the game before putting it on sale for summer sale at the same ing price it was before they raised price hey guys its $60 lets make it $120 and then discount it 50% hurr hurr  you rockstar last game ill buy from you]

offline is good ive been trying to get support for a corrupt cloud save since march 29 and to this day cannot get it fixed havent even get a response from rock star since may 14 game is fine untill you need support for things on their servers then forget about it so i only get half the game i paid for will never recommend a rock star title again
not recommended
rockstar simply wants your money i thought modding in the game would pick up or be more popular but it hasnt largely due to the business model of gta online cash cards
not recommended
raised the price to $85 before the steam sale to avoid actually selling at a decent price

really jack the price up right before the sale really
not recommended
online is broken buggy and filled with hackers in every server play is designed around trying to get people to buy shark cards rather than trying to maximise fun its a money grab of a game its still somewhat fun and addictive but there really isnt a lot to do and you spend most of the time grinding the same coop missions over and over
not recommended
the game gets old rather quickly and those business practises dont make me want to recommend it any more either
not recommended
its ok got to admit that while its not as big saints row 4 was a lot more fun like pure unadulterated fun as for the game this is gta so you probably know what to expect from single player as for online everything there is geared towards you buying shark cards because clearly breaking every sales record didnt make them enough money even all the new updates just add new expensive items and nerf or remove the bestpaying missions so it gets progressively harder to legitimately earn money and its deceptively priced in the summer sale i mean this is a cashgrab at every oppurtunity
not recommended
love this game i mean i seriously love it online is still rubbish but singleplayer is just awesome but you know what i dont love the  the rockstar pulls they dont give a flying  about the people who play their games they only care about the people that buy them

after 2 years of waiting for this game on pc pc gamers are greeted with a full $60 price tag on a game that is spread across 2 console genorations while many were happy with this a lot more were awaiting the oh so glorious steam summer sale to really get a deal on this game fuhrer rockstar wasnt happy with this so instead of fixing their rampant hacking problem and poor servers they decide to raise the price of gta 5 to a whopping $80 they then try to sneak into the summer sale by putting a 25% off on it even though it brings the game back down to full retail price rockstar really looks out for the consumer with this one i can only recommend this game is you love hackers in every lobby constant server crashing and poor connection rockstar you really ed up
not recommended
rockstar you dissapoint me screw you if you dont fix this greedy sale  you can say goodbye to me as a customer dont  your customers over with this kind of  or youll be nothing but another ea andor activision do not support these people until they learn that we will not accept this type of greedy business practice

there are so many reasons to dislike this game whether it be the unreliable serversmatchmaking the abundance of griefers hackers & trolls or rockstars own suspicious business practices in a world where hackers rule the online gameplay where the creators want you to spend 100% of the games value in fake money and profiles get banned when a hacker unbenownst to you s with your account or you mod the singleplayer you have to ask yourself what was rockstar thinking well if i had to guess its very similar to their sale mentality which is crazy crazy bad not crazy good btdubs or the actions of a money grubbing  have you ever heard of a sale on steam where the game stays the same price or goes up in price oh wait forgot you do get a shark card oh wait forgot shark cards are useless to any actual gamer i have an idea how about releasing the game for the actual 25% off and letting those dumb enough to pay the extra 25% get the stupid shark card or is that too much of a deal for rockstar of course it is if i had to sum up this review i would say avoid gta 5 right now not because the game as a whole sucks but because rockstar has some serious work cut out for them before the online play becomes anything but trolls and hackers although if youre in it for the singleplayer then youll have a blast that is until you try to mod your game then you could lose your copy if your not much of a modder then youll be right at home but do realize that the new eula put out by rockstar has pretty much forbidden any thirdparty modifications to the game threatening temporary to permanent bans from online disappointing when i think back on how much fun gta iv mods were but if all of that doesnt bother you if you still have a good amount of faith in rockstar i cannot deny that its a game with great potential that potential is just being directed towards shoddy business practices atm

story mode its ok online servers are really unstable modders and trainer user  just destroyed online experience rockstar doesnt give a  about cheaters i think they even love modders in online mode not touching this game again until they learn the basics of online administration which consists of a few paid admins to ban people [which will never happen] destroyed a good franchise with the most  way possible

other than the scummy attitude of the devs this game has some serious flaws 1your data could not be loaded from the rockstar cloud server try again later is a frequent screen 75% of the time i load the game this happens and i get thrown to another loading screen for a few minutes and then thrown into story mode i bought this game for the sole purpose of playing with friends and that is out of the question most of the time 2online is plagued by hackers who can blow you up form the other side of the map delete your cars delete your weapons and even your cash they freeze the game for you and make it unplayable 3online is a grind you get tiny amounts of money for missions that need to be repeated and repeated to be able to buy a car that wont leave you a sitting duck why should i have to spend days playing this to just earn what a hacker can earn in 10 seconds there is no easy way to report them either so its a live with it or dont play the game scenario rockstar are more interested in adding content that is ridiculously overpriced and encourages micro transactions in order to use than dealing with the hackers if you still decide to get the game after this then take note 90% of people will shoot you on sight you can be driving around in a trash truck trying to obey the rules of the road and someone will drive past and throw a c4 onto your truck only to detonate it as they watch from their rear view mirrors if they dont do this they will be driving a bulletproof car and spray you leaving you helpless good luck

if youre looking for solely the single player mode of this game its awesome and really enjoyable however if youre buying this game for the online experience my main reason for purchasing a copy for myself and my gf youre going to find the experience ruined by the large number of script users hackerscheatersmodders whatever you want to call them youll find that its a near 90% chance the public lobby you get tossed into will have have one your experience with the script users will vary from being blown up instantly upon respawning indefinetly to dealing with guys in god mode who youre unable to kill ocassionally there will be some that arent so antisocial and will either harrass you slightly or give you stuff unfortunetly being handed millions of in game cash ruins the longetivity of the game since most of the game is aquiring money through missions and heists to get your fancy apartments and fast cars and whatever else you wantif you want to find a lobby without a hacker youre going to spend at least 2minutes loading up a new lobby or about 5mins going into single player and starting an invite only lobby i wont talk much about the load times since youll see everyone already talking about how frustrating that is on its own

i absolutely love the game but i absolutely hate that rockstar raised the price right before the summer sale not only is it illegal in a lot of countries but the company should not be allowed to get away with that rockstar if you are listening you shouldnt have done that this is my way of boycotting your company

same old gta little to no innovation on the same dry formula unless you count the required graphics update if you played any other gta you played this one ps rockstar as a gaming company has evolved into one of the most shady and consumer unfriendly companies there are supporting them is akin to rewarding behavior that will punish all consumers and gamers around the world there are many reasons their customer service hanging up on customers as policy increasing price and forcing in game purchase right before a sale to trick consumers into appearing to be on sale removing content after purchase etc id say to avoid rockstar until they prove to have gotten their  together

for all the people complaining about ohhhhh i got banned for modding on single player its only our pc players faults for cracking gta 4 and not giving rockstar any money for their product they were hesitant about releasing gta 5 on pc for that exact reason so if they use drm to control the hacking and cracking and banning players if you want to blame someone stand in the mirror and have a good hard look at yourself personally i love playing gta 5 i only play online because i completed story mode on my 360 before it was released on pc and thats why the game gets a positive review

first impressions of gtav are very positive for me personally i played the game for about 300 hours on ps3 so i went in knowing what to expect for the most part but i was nervous of rockstars past reputation of pc ports needless to say this one feels very well done there are still places where you notice controller priority most noteably the menusui and aerial controls but most of this can either be learned realitively quickly or altered in key customization overall the game runs extremely smoothly i have a higher end pc so its hard for me to grasp optimization issues but i will say i can run on max settings with a 3 gig gtx 780 and a i5 4670k there has been the odd burp or glitch while playing with friends which did become an issue through some missions one time a friend wouldnt load in another time a friend crashed but its hard to say what targetted this and if it is a common issue i can say for myself i have not once crashed or had any sort of game breaking bug overall my experience has been extremely positive online works great single player is fun quite simply it feels like a rockstar game and one that is finally a decent port to pc i highly recommend this game if you enjoy the gta series this is definitely the best game rockstar has ever produced

a good game but the online suffer of massive cheats and dev lazyness this is a great game really good story  a nice online mode graphics are really good the open space is simply huge tons of activity  you can even creat your own and share the heists are really well done and unique problem is  there is a notable difference between solo and online in solo mode the world is more alive  with animals street animations online its poor and feels a bit too much like an apb reloaded on big map chara design isnt that bad  but well female character arent attractive at all a shame in 2015 with such a good 3d engine nice map  nice car ugly char in game  online you will experience a tons of bugs and issue  even with a good computer like stuttering  crash ect there is a lot of obvious cheaters and we have no communication about this in my opinion buy it for the solo mode but the online mode is not that good for now

this game was great the first few weeks after the pc release single player is good multiplayer is even better but the game became riddled with cheaters and as is it is pretty much unplayable todays sessions which led me to uninstall the game different sessions  someone gave me 5 million money which made the game pointless  person travelling with superspeed overcoming on foot me in a jet  several people with god mode  several instances of people instakilling everyone around the map  several instance of self exploding when in a jet or when entering the military airfield and these are just some that i knew were going on additionally  the game has great number of different modes but except for racing it is seldom possible to fill a lobby  low level players get invited to heists which they cant pull of  loading times are out of this world constant searching for lobbies returning from lobbbies etc i liked this game but knowing how the game experience turned out i would not recommend it for more than 30eur or so

i play this game for its multiplayer and at its current state i just cant recommend it the multiplayer is extremely laggy and infested with bugs and glitches youre stuck in loading times missions are bugges important npcs dont spawn you get randomly kicked from missions and sessions and the matchmaking is a horror rockstars only concern is to sell more shark cards but unfortunetaly not to fix the multiplayer to sum up gta online in one word broken its like playing a beta version and no fun at all usually i would say screw cheaters and hackers but not in this case i hope there will be even more hackers and cheaters why because they mess up rockstars shady shark card business rockstar wants to sell you ingame money for 99 dollars in return youll get a few bucks and a broken game hackers give you the money for free

rockstar needs to get a clue that mods are what sold this game on pc
not recommended
the game lacks depth in its online capabilities perhaps if there was anything worth while past 5 heists then maybe id be singing a different song that and no mods
not recommended
while rockstar made a very entertaining game they feel that it is appropriate to ban those who use mods even graphical mods in single player much like steam and their paid mods rockstar will soon learn that it isnt a good idea to  off the internet rockstar is against modding and letting those make their game more enjoyable and for that i will not be buying any rockstar games until this mess is sorted and will never be recommending another one of their games to anyone
not recommended
there are so many cheaters in this game that i have quit because of it really fun with friends though so if you have people to play with it might be worth picking up

probably wouldve sold more copies if they didnt make this stupid choice to make the game sixty while the summer sale is going on

rockstar  you what the  is the point of the sale if youre gonna jack up the price to make the sale meaningless this type of business is something to expect from activision or ea but not from you i love this game but doing this  is really hurting your credit

dont get me wrong this is a very well produced game and runs great on my machine but rockstars practices here with the summer sale are down right shameful 25% off results in the $60 price that i already paid for this game on ps3 ps4 come on how about you give a real damn sale so all of us and our friends can rejoice in the gtav gloriousness is there any wonder why people crack games when you are so willing to screw over all of your very fanbase by charging them full price for this game 4 times over it only enhances its inevitability all i know is that rockstar better have some absolutley bonkers  in mind for that 2billion that this game has probably made by now maybe they can merge with activison or better yet ea screw it why not

july 8th patch review 450hours played 010 it ran great for the first few months but the game has recently been plagued with crashes stuttering and only continues to get worse with each new update ive been a fan of rockstar and gta for decades since gta 1 on ps1 and this is indeed just quickly becoming another botched pc game from rockstar my review will not change until further game performance improvements are made i play on a $2500 computer that consists of top end parts like an i7 3770k gtx 980 16gb of ram and the game continues to run poorly on any settings at a target of 1080p@60fps i wish i could leave a positive review because the game itself is amazing but poor quality control from rockstar has once again left me agitated and feeling taken advantage of shame on rockstar for giving us this great game and then quickly stomping it into an unplayable mess after the wonderful max payne 3 and how gracefully it has aged i had really high expectations for gta v but i really was not expecting this mess just months after release seriously buy at your own risk
not recommended
would not reccomend due to performance issues the last couple updates broke the game for many users i have two 980tis in sli and i constantly get microstuttering fps drops etc etc no matter what video settings ive tried out of curiousity after purchasing this game on steam i downloaded a pirated version with an older build game ran flawlessly on the pirated version needless to say i do hope they fix this soon then i can change this review to a positive review i loved this game on consoles and would love to play it more on my pc
not recommended
price change from 56 to 75 right before sale and then 25% sale price you wanted negative review this is how to get it

waited months for this to come to pc i was so excited preordered preinstalled took the day off of work unpacked files for an hour started the game and crash this game has froze and crashed more times than a diabetic elsa at a candy factory my custom rig specs are top of the line i can run any game at max setting while streaming 14 youtube videos and playing league i dont but just to give an example i tried running in safe mode with reduced graphics nothing i went to nvidia and updated all my drivers and even got the special ready for gta5 driver and while that did fix the horrible black lines on multiplayer characters still crashes i even uninstalled and reinstalled the game still crashes i literally cant do jack  online the sec i try to go into my apt or start a match or think about maybe starting a match bam freeze and crash youd think that with the game having been out for 18 months and the pc version being delayed twice the launch wouldnt be anywhere near this bad buggy sure but not unplayable i love rockstar always have their quality and level of detail is outstanding but right now im extremely disappointed with this launch hopefully it wont take a month to fix like it did when i first got it back on ps3 launch ill change this review when i can actually enjoy the product i paid $60 for twice

shady business practice rising base price just before summer sale so its the same price as before even though it says gtav 25%  additionally by pairing the ingamedollars with the game bundle you can not get a refund for it as it is cheaper than the game on itself unaware players will buy the bundle and not be able to get a refund thats just a no go
not recommended
r are trying to screw people over in the summer sale theyre creating the appearance of a discount but jacking up the price beforehand so they dont have to drop the price at all on top of that theyve bundled in cash cards which are instantlyconsumed dlc items by doing this they ensure steams refund policy cant be invoked
not recommended
i will not buy another rockstar game until they can demonstrate they know how to support a game and deliver on their advertising promises the multiplayer is broken and unplayable the mandatory social club is annoying the false sale is insulting and the rules on mods are unreasonable and restrictive dont spend $60 on this $20 game
not recommended
rockstar games is a greedy company that doesnt give a  about its costumers the game is well optimized by the pc port crew responsible for max payne 3 but the game is full with bugs and the loading for online still takes years the armored karuma is also the dumbest overpowered thing ever created in any game never have i seen one item in a game ruin the fun of all the missions yet i still played this game for 200 hours whats wrong with me the game had so much potential to be so good but a  company ruined it

not recommended
this game is probably the first gta since gta iii that i enjoyed which makes me sad that i am giving this a negative review there are a couple reasons for this 1 i purchased this game for a first person open world experience i love games like skyrim dying light etc i love the size of the world when youre looking through it from a first person lens and to be fair this games first person is implemented well the camera moves in a way youd expect for head motion and it does it without causing any locomotion issues which can cause headaches however the field of view is absolutely garbage with my personal set up i need the fov to be about 100110 to not start getting headaches one of the most telling problems with this is when youre driving in gta 5 if you want to look to your right mirror not that the mirrors show much you have to turn your head to do that in a real car its in your peripheral vision that peripheral vision is just destroyed by the games pathetic fov 2 continued efforts to fix the fov of the game by the modding community has been leading to bans of players due to the way gta v is coded since the game so closely integrates multiplayer with single player using an injector based program to fix the fov that rockstar refused to leads to a ban since the same type of programs are used to cheat since the world of single player and multiplayer are not as separated as they could or should be this means it is difficult for rockstar to distinguish between fov fixes and real cheats in the cheat rampant gta online if gta online wasnt so closely integrated or if rockstar had the decency to offer a real fov fix for first person and if they do i will change this review then id have no more problems fov matters and as it stands i cant play this game for more than a few hours without getting massive headaches due to what seems like a 70 degree fov on my 27 inch monitor from about a foot and a half away it is really uncomfortable to play edit much of the modding hostility has disappeared but no fix for the games horrendous fov has happened this is enough of a deal breaker that i am maintaining my negative review a person shouldnt get physically sick playing a video game because of bad design

not recommended
while the game itself is actually pretty good im afraid i simply cannot agree with the attitude rockstar has towards the modding community grand theft auto iv was a success so far on from its original release on pc because of the ability to modify the game and not because of the game itself i discovered rockstar are now banning players because of modifying the game while playing offline what a disgusting way of treating thousands of loyal customers and the pc community work with your customers not against them utterly disappointed in this company and can and will promise never to buy any games from them again
not recommended
my envisionment of rockstars board meetings so other games include the ability to mod single player it greatly increases the life of their game and the replayabilities we should do the same nah  that disallow modding and ban anyone who tries to get around it not only are they banning people for mods they are banning every player who comes into contact with certain hacking players  you rockstar i will never buy another game of yours again

an overall great game brought down by the developers ridiculous stance regarding modding i cannot bring myself to recommend this otherwise great game as rockstar is punishing players for something that is and always has been an integral part of the pc gaming community and tradition rockstart changing the game eula onesidedly to enforce these decisions after countless people have puchased the game is just making things worse

mods should be allowed for a pc game i bought the software and i have the right to modify it as i wish banning people for modding is like if you by a tennis racket and use it for squash and the tennis racket company goes you can keep the racket but you wont be allowed to use strings < ps i havent modded the game myself so if i can banned for a negative promodding review i will update 
not recommended
let me start by saying the single player is great everything works very well and the story and gameplay are great but i bought the game mainly to play with friends online and the status of the online is  poor the issues i have the most trouble with are its nothing short of a hassle to assemble a game with your friends this game needs a party mode matchmaking takes ages its taken me more than 15 minutes to get 6 people together for a death match even in a full free roam game and its not rare for it to take that long at all too many loading screens why do i need to load for 2 minutes just to find out a game i tried to join is full then it boots me back to free roam which is another loading screen constant disconnecting crashing and stuttering since the last patch about a week ago either hotfix the issue or roll back for gods sake hackers everywhere its way too easy to hack in its current state this seems to be the devs main focus right now because there have been massive ban waves desync desync desync i could continue but these are my main issues this game has immense potential for the online to be the best online gaming experience around but it seems like an afterthought i will be happy to change my review it if the situation changes

update i guess for summer sales rockstar thought it would be a good idea to increase the price of the game from 60 bucks to 80 bucks and toss in some in game money which doesnt really make a difference all just so they could slap on a 25% off sticker onto it so its back down to 60 bucks feels pretty ingenuine and dishonest to me but i guess thats how they roll rockstar is banning people who use mods in singleplayer this mean if you use a silly little mod that does absolutly nothing other than change the character youre playing as trevor for example into a penguin so you can watch a hilarious little penguin going around and robbing cars and screaming profanities like trevor does thats enough for rockstar to ban you id completely understand them bannning people if they were modding things in multiplayer taking advantage invincibility cheats or something but thats not the case modding the singleplayer offline game that nobody but you gets to see and play is grounds for a ban from their multiplayer services the game is good otherwise but with draconian practices like this i cant reccomend it the ironic thing about all this is that people who are cheaters or have malintent were hiding their hacks from the start that means people who wanted to cheat hid their hacks so they can continue to play online without rockstar banning them while the rest of the good intentioned players are screwed because they decided to be honest and only mod single player and are getting banned for it

gta 5 rockstars greatest disappointment to date delayed for months on end for what only the most optimistic of people could assume was to release a functioning game but aside from the day one issues of the game not launching if you happen to have an odd pc username or integrated graphics card and you managed to get into the game you were met with loading screen after loading screen finally after 10 minutes of being juggled between single player and online mode and you finally manage to get into the same session with your friends you were cruelly separated again by multiple loading screens after completing a job but aside from the horrible way the game tosses you around from loading screen to loading screen you still have to deal with the 1000 minor annoyances in the game left behind from its console counterparts like the god awful weapon wheel perfectly fine on a controller and a must when dealing with more than 2 weapons but a ing nightmare on pc oh hey want to use your favorite pistol hold tab awkwardly move your mouse around and then scroll wheel for 5 seconds need to heal with a snack or put on some armor hit your quick menu and navigate through several submenus to get to them god forbid you give pc users who are playing on devices with more than 10 buttons the ability to bind one of those buttons to quickly heal or equip armor oh and the lovely peer to peer hosting no better way for someone from scottland to meet a couple aussies or bring an american and a bunch of europeans together on a roller coaster shouting into their mics for bonus rp you know the best part of pc gaming for game developers you dont even need to host your own game servers thousands of people will literally spend hundreds of dollars paying for their own servers that make the experience infinitely better but we were left to suffer through the atrocity that is p2p and all the fun things it brought like cheaters just as swiftly as modding came for single player cheaters came for online for weeks gta online was filled with people running around in god mode causing havoc spawning things inside of others garages and running suicide scripts on the sad participants in their lobby but rockstar did finally bring an end to the hacker madness with a huge ban wave that felt no need to discriminate for the script kiddies sprinting down the street as invincible monkeys with their explosive gatling guns received the same punishment as those who were caught in a money storm as bags of cash fell on them spawned in from another person 210 bite me

beware your gta v progress is not synchronized through cloud i just found this out the hard way after installing windows 10 i did not save my local files as i never do since i have steam with any other steam game i expected my game progress to be stored in cloud it is 2015 after all but oh boy have i ever been so wrong about rockstar after starting up the game i saw the very first mission popping up on my screen at first i thought it was just some sync issue maybe i needed to load the files explicitly through rockstar social club or something but no it is confirmed that this garbage does not save your progress in the cloud it does use cloud for storing your achievements character progress and some other static data like that but it seems that rockstar games was so ing cheap that they did not want to store a few megabytes of binary data per user thats what you get  in 2015  from a games steam release where they could simply have used steam api for cloud storage  for 60 ing  so no dont buy this game on steam if you expect this version to be better than a boxed release or any other  digital stores release it is the same just more expensive compared to some other stores this was the last time i bought a rockstar game ps also shame on steam for not enforcing game developers to either implement their own cloud sync or use steams built in features

arguments are debatable about this release because a lot of people arent able to log into the game due to crashes steam problems and ingame issues that are disrupting individuals gameplay also there are individuals playing this game without the actual requirements needed and some who have those requirements are having issues so far i have not passed the social club and dont know if there is an option to click to play or if the game runs after you login its been over 56 hours currently i wouldnt by this game yet until they fix these issues or you can and just download it and wait until everything is available in this technological era and with all the orders they received through steam their sites as well as other sites they should have been prepared and being unprepared damages the fun and hype of the game and its community currently i give this game a 510 due to their lack of communication and their lack in preparation im very patient however so i will wait until they fix these issues once im able to log into the game and see what is out there i will change my opinion on it there are other issues many individuals are reporting through the discussion boards about logins and crashes and etc those could be helpful to anyone who are interested in the release regardless of these issues i hear a lot of positive feedback about the game which is definitely worth waiting

i have been looking forward to playing gta v on the pc for some time after seeing all the rave reviews now i have the game i have been so disappointed the good point is the graphics they are stunning one of the best looking games i have played the bad point the game play is very boring and repetitive and has not evolved from any of the earlier gtas there are next to no interiors which takes away the realism of the city there is very limited interaction with other characters if you look at npcs in say skyrim they work during the day then go home in the evening or to the tavern its a neat touch to give the environment some realism but in gta the characters dont do that  they have no homes or daily routine you cant pick pocket or break in to peoples homes collect things or steal things to create your own adventures all you can do is drive and shoot and that gets very boring even the cheat codes are boring  so limited as to what you can do they could at least have made the game more interesting i hope when rockstar makes gta vi they at least look at and include the innovations that have been made in other games such as skyrim or witcher 3 to make the city an exciting vibrant and realistic sand box city to play in instead of the pretty but boring game that is gta v

keeps crashing both in story mode and online there is no support from r i opened a ticket and they sent me an email with an address so that i can check the status which leads to a page not found error and i cannot post on their support message board for the first month after creating my account i think this is intended as a nice and subtle way of saying fk you for paying come again it is highly probable that r places at the core of their bussiness model the morals of the gta characters most of the logged hours on my account were spent waiting for the game to load just so that i can see it crash afterwards after trying the myriad possible fixes that other users found none of which worked in my case when this is what the fine fellows at r were supposed to be doing buying this was a huge mistake launching it is a huge disapointment

the game is a good game for all the reasons you already know about since it is over a year old but i have 2 main issues at the time of this review all modders are getting bans even single player modders are getting ban from bots that dont know any better i could live with out the mods but the hacking i cant deal with its so bad i actively stay away from pvp even without the hacks the game cant seem to completely separate free aim users and assisted aim users you will end up playing in games with assisted aiming and you will be at a massive disadvantage with those issues affecting pvp the online gamplay really doesnt capture your attention for long sure the heists are fun and there are pve missions but it becomes very repetitive i can run most of these with my eyes closed at this point the worse part is there isnt much rockstar can do about the hacks issue since they where dumb enough to allow things like your current health to be stored client side instead of server side i want to recomend this game i really do but until they can fix my issues with pvp i just cant if you enjoy strict pve and have friends you can mess around with in free roam great game the single player is also awesome if you want to play against people move along

if i could get a refund i would the only reason i bought this for a third time was to play mods i didnt care about the graphics or anything like that i just wanted to play mods like gta 4 but of course with the last update that rockstar released they managed to ban all mods and ban me from online on all systems so all i can say is nice going rockstar wait until everyone buys your trash game to ban all the cool mods that make your game good

single player is mediocre as the characters and story are very forgettable multiplayer experience is a real chore because of loading screens for joining session picking missionheist inviting people setup etc everything takes minutes of staring at a loading screen this on top of the connectivity issues in general where you are disconnected from from friendscrew between mission regional sessions are a joke and youll find yourself in lobbies with people from halfway across the world not a bad thing in itself but with the connectivity problem only multiplied now this whole ban wave for using mods in single player mode buyer beware r have had 2 years to fix this game before the pc launch but couldnt be bothered

the game itself is fantastic and was very much worth the wait in my opinion but rockstar does not support mods and will ban you from gta online for using mods in single player i will change my review to a positive one if and when this policy changes
not recommended
it seems that rockstar is denying that anyone got banned in multiplayer from singleplayer mods i would like to trust them but there is also a lot of evidence against that anyway i would give this game a better score but it still doesnt let me have the riot mod with my friends when they release moddable servers or a different multiplayer mode that doesnt include any of that online  ill be happy in all seriousness this game was really cool for the first 2 weeks or so when the script hook came out then rockstar patched it out many people say it was so they could fix bugs and it happened to kill the script hook then i find out they are banning for singleplayer mods i was even anticipating a multiplayer release of the riot mod it was so much fun that i left gta online to play it now that i have the choice between gta online or singleplayer mods i think ill choose killing floor 2 which actively supports multiplayer modding kiss my  and money goodbye rockstar until you allow free modding

though only minor each patch is slowly making the game worse rather than making it better sure online has fewer hackers now but not being able to play due to the worsing memory leaks is another then you have people getting bans for mods graphical quality being reduced and all the other stuff another patch another drop in performance gg another patch another drop in performance seems stuttering is also getting worse guess giving gta5 an ssd doesnt work and its dead its so bad now that playing the game is near impossible great work great fing work

the game its self is fantastic well polished very indepth and very entertaining  as you would expect with rockstars flagship title however i want to talk about gta online the biggest reason i purchased this game for the pc gta online is a joke at its core its a fantastic idea r have clearly been taking note of their pc & console fanbases requests and production of mods such as mta many features that first crept in years ago with these mods have been polished and introduced to the online game im not saying there isnt room for improvement not least in further expansion for and dedicated to pc mods or dlc that fully utilise the potential of the pc however all this development polish and general effort is currently seriously undermined by rockstars frankly laughable commitment to dealing with online cheating and griefing within a week or so the first cheaters emerged and its been a rapid increase ever since make no mistake that the online freeroam mode is just about unplayable now every session seems to have these script kiddies running what they believe are just mods  mods that give them the ability to do anything kill people teleport around the map and even provide in game money the latter being the biggest problem how do rockstar seriously expect to sell these shark cards or were they just an afterthought to milk cash for the mugs who buy them these hackers are now actively sought out by many legitimate players who are perhaps either too sensible or scared to run these third party injectorsmodshacksexploits themselves but see no harm in reaping the rewards of others who do you join any online freeroam lobby at any and you will see a flurry of players asking questions like any hackers giving out money  somebody spawn me $1million plz etc any why not rockstar dont seem to be taking it seriously i was actually playing in a lobby in free roam when i was magically teleported to a roof top and shot repeatedly with money i ended up with around $12 million in my game wallet i immediately jumped through all the hoops that is gta online support they dont make it easy so you can see why most people just think sack it i gave them full details of what happened and how much money was illegitimately provided to me and the account of the guy did it as well as some screenshot evidence i receive a response within 24 hours thanking me for my report but after looking closely at my account there was no sign of any illegitimate or hacked money so its no wonder people are turning a blind eye to it in game this positive reinforcement has also been carried over to rockstars poor attempts to actually deal with those who are caught cheating for the few who actually do get caught they get the following escalating discipline  warnings  moved to temporary cheaters pool of gamers god knows when   a two week suspension  a month suspension  three month suspension ridiculous with such a wishwash disciplinary policy its no wonder gamers are not taking this seriously that combined with the target audience that is by and large going to be casual young and console background its easy to see why this game is just a joke in online mode i would recommend the game as a stand alone title but rockstar have completely disappointed on the online front as they continue to  out of taking real action to protect genuine customers who are playing legitimately customers

do not buy grand theft auto v prior to the summer sale of 2015 starting on 6112015 the full retail price of gtav was 60 usd at the outset of the summer sale of 2015 and after the newly announced refund policy of steam rockstar removed the original gta v product from the steam store and replaced it with a nonoptional bundle of gtav  a cash card set at a base retail value of 7900$ with a 25% discount pricing the game at 60 usd the steam refund policy does not allow refunds on dlc that affect game progression the forced cash card bundle exists entirely to prevent customers from requesting refunds and allows them to skirt laws related to phantom sales whereby the base retail price is raised prior to a sale offering the appearance of a sale without offering actual savings to the consumer that practice is illegal in multiple countries and several us states including canada australia new zealand the uk and california do not support this  shady horrible anticonsumer company do not buy their game i wish i didnt not the first purchase i regret making on steam but at this rate im considering ensuring that its my last by no longer purchasing titles on this platform

please note that i think the game would be great to play however i cannot play the game so i want a refund it took me 48 mins to get through the prologue want to know the reasons why 1 my computer cannot play this game 2 the graphics are not relative to my game 3 any game that is over 20 gigabytes shouldnt even be a game i should be playing in the first place  i tried refunding bought it yesterday however the refund system doesnt even work hopefully valve fixes this with that said i also want to refund my cash cards why did i even buy these cards in the first place waste of money i am sure the game is great and all but when it comes to being unable to play i do not recommend this game when it comes to when you are trying to play the game  update  just for those to know honestly if my computer could actually play this game i would love to play this game however with how my game has long loading screens the gameplay is lagged etc etc theres no possible way i can even play this and i heard that rockstar pretty much scammed us by not really making the price cheaper on us now i have another reason why i want to refund this game but its not really a valid reason my pure reason is just i cant even play the game

at the current condition of the online multiplayer  i cannot recommend this game the online multiplayer has been ruined by modders who will either flood you with unnecessary amounts of gta$ spawn useless items onnear you or kill every player on the map instantly 75% if not more of all online sessions have a modder in it rockstar has made no attempt at all to stop the massive amount of cheaters and until they do my review will remain negative besides the multiplayer modders it is actually a fun and addictive game with a very entertaining single player story mode as well with that said i still cannot recommend that anybody purchase this game at full price

dont get me wrong this game is absolutely great but online is broken by the hackers who have way too much control they have the ability to kill you in passive mode crashing your game by spawning entities on you yes this really happens spawning ingame props such as ufos and windmills everywhere making areas inaccessible delete your cars set you on fire permanently focing you to join a new game give you money breaking the ingame economy making jobs which is basically the way you earn money pointless i think i covered the online portion pretty well r really needs to get their s7 together and make an anticheat do not recommend for online unless it is private with friends story mode in 60fps is defenitly amazing at its current state i do not recommend for online

if youre considering this game for the singleplayer only then go right ahead and buy it the singleplayer experience is incredible but unless you have a group of friends to reliably play online with then forget the multiplayer aspect entirely between the absurd loading times ridiculous playertoplayer networking system server browsers and dedicated servers have been commonplace in pc gaming for almost 2 decades now grinding money unlock system arguably p2w shark cards real money for ingame currency horrible matchmaking and scummy steam pricing jacking the price up then discounting to make it remain the same price as before all of that is small potatoes compared to the rampant online hacking that is occurring as of late the most recent anticheat measures employed by rockstar protect players from nothing but hacking money into the game literally nothing else the anticheat checks if a transaction is valid and decides if a ban is necessary this now means that hackers can spam random players in any lobby with weapon unlocks and various transactions its a p2p networking system so who wouldve guessed that many clients are not trustworthy and get random players banned for invalid transactions the anticheat has now created an environment where literally only the hackers are prevented from bans i adore this game to death but until rockstar fixes the absolutely absymal multiplayer experience even in private lobbies with friends i cannot give a positive rating

this i did not expect that i really didnt this game shows r for what they truly are a company that respects their fans it shows r in a good tone theyre not just some moneygrabbing company that doesnt give a damn about their players no theyre something more and for that i respect them back as for the game theres nothing to say really its extremely well optimized and wellmade for the pc all the graphics options are there and since today you can actually change your settings however you want to even if you have a 1gb graphics card you can play on medhigh settings with 60 fps the game had a great launch though at first i thought i wouldnt be able to play because the game started for me minimized and at a crappy resolution with most of the graphics options set to normal and off the online portion of the game is great and its extremely well made you can have up to 30 players in a lobby and still have constant 60 fps which is just ground breaking for me but ofcourse what a r launch is it without fck ups right this time thank god it was nothing major people that had their windows profiles written in other languages i think it was only russian im not quite sure couldnt launchinstall or log in to the game properly thankfuly it was fixed in a couple of hours and everyone could play now i just wanted to talk about the fun aspect of the game so here we go the game is extremely fun while played with a bunch of friends you can do anything from chasing your friends in an armed helicopter across the state or rob banks stores and so on if youre a lone wolf and you dont have any friends jk not jk d you can always make some ingame with a new chat system ofcourse the voice comms are still there and if im not mistaken they have a new codec which makes the voices even clearer so we waited we waited long enough was it worth it yes it was were the delays worth it absofkinglutely here we go my final verdict is a 910 keep in mind that it wasnt a perfect launch and that the game for some people me included is almost 25 years old if i didnt play it on the console it would have been a 1010 but i just cant undo my multiple playthroughs on the console

edit 618 i just decided to start up gta online again within 1015 minutes of joining the first session which had 18 people a modder killed everyone on the server removed players weapons specifically messed with certain players and then the modder crashed my game after i called him out in chat 1010 edit in addition to all of the below the game has periodic entitlement verification drm preventing you from playing offline requiring you to sign in to rockstar social club to play i bought the pc version for the same reason as a lot of people gta online multiplayer has the potential to last you for hundreds of hours but uncontrolled modding of gta online has completely ruined the experience when i say uncontrolled i mean uncontrolled every single freeroam session of 20 eventually gets at least one modder that wants to ruin other peoples fun within 15 minutes of you joining the lobby usually less god mode explosive bullets bombing all players in session and crediting other players with the kills framing them permanent deletion of other players personal vehicles and weapons which cost serious ingame $$ to get teleportation unwanted spawning of millions of dollars on top of you ufos and ferris wheels becoming attached to you selfdeletion of cheater reports and literally anything else you can think of can be found in every gta online session with a decent amount of people in it i wish i was exaggerating but im not the reason for all of this is because rockstar decided to trust the client with everything instead of setting up any ability to use dedicated servers with some anticheat measures its all p2p with no limits no dedicated servers i have not seen any anticheat measures in fact i used to be able to put up with all the cheaters but theyve just become omnipresent before when the game was first released on pc there were some cheaters but they mostly kept to themselves and were satisfied with just god mode now all sorts of things are being done by them solely to ruin everyone elses fun i and many others simply cannot keep going along with rockstars disregard for their customers and their greed in not being able to set aside part of their billions of dollars they made off this game for dedicated servers to end the madness for these reasons i simply cannot recommend this game

it would be an awesome game if mod menus were patched out of the online mode regularly these mod menus allow other players to kill everyone on the map at once while framing someone else for it these modification menus also allow them to attach various objects to other players obstructing their view rain money upon your head rain whales and meteors which obstruct roadways use explosive ammunition for any gun and use god mode to terrorize and grief a server they can spawn kill everyone on the server and it keeps them from leaving the game they can delete reports they can edit their levels to their pleasing they can spawn vehicles into online from single player same with weapons they can make vehicles indestructable such as fighter jets attack helicopters and tanks and use them to terrorize nonmodding players they can kick plaers from servers or even as far as crashing there computer to get them off the server they can spawn vehicles in other players apartments to kill them such as running helicopters they can spawn waterspouts or fire under a players feet they can slingshot any vehicle across los santos into the ocean or any direction they please while a player is driving it they can teleport to players to kill them they can teleport players to the deepest depths of the ocean to drown them they can spawn swat officers with tazers to surround a player so the player cant move they can attatch npcs to other players some of which are not wearing any clothes do not get this

at 101 hours i think im ready to write a review the game is really good graphics are amazing the story mode is awesome and it just makes you want for it to go on forever once you have finished story mode you have side missions that you can do and of course you always have online but here is the problem online gets really boring once you reach level 50ish cars cost 500k2million heist are frustrating when your crew are a bunch of  s that quit the heist at the end to troll missions get boring and the only thing to do is  around with your friends for online r is too lazy to make more gamemodes instead of just freeroam instead of adding gamemodes like roleplay for the roleplaying community which is not that small in gta san andreas multi theft auto mod  they could also add a gamemode where everything is free and it doesnt go on to freeroam but you can get everything for free in itthat would be awesome so you can test out things and just have fun without worrying about 9 year olds throwing c4s at you thinking they are cool if you dont like grinding in online your 2nd option is to buy shark cards which is another way r is trying to make money honestly right know this game is just taking up space  you r

not worth $70 wait for price drop the single player is a fun experience with no real problems so read on okay so you are wondering if gta online would be a fun experience well it is if you can actually make it into a server without the game putting you in singleplayer for no reason my favourite is when you connect to a server but the rockstar cloud services screw up and you cant save any progress ^ whats the point of waiting for those incredibly long loading screens for something that is just stuffed [h]you run out of stuff to do eventually[h] heists become a chore or mostly unplayable if you dont have friends there races and stuff are always won by sweaty plebs that do nothing but learn each race track all day and to top it all off hackers can hack with ease and with little indication of slowing down yes they remove your guns cant be killed spawn npcs and other objects and also have the ability to blow up everyone on the server at once thus making the freeroam experience broken as hell [h]do not buy this game[h] until a price drop even if bonus gta online cash is offered you can always buy cash cards later or better yet just play the game the fact that we waited for a pc release this long and the game has just been broken after a recent patch not the first time is sad i hardly play this game anymore

best game i have ever played  seriously tons of fun  however  im a lucky guy and i dont have a ban i never used mods because i had faith and patience and thought gta5 would have steam workshop today i wanted to write my review and saw all the negative reviews  and thought what the hell well  until rockstar will accept mods for pc version until they will fix the bugs i lost my armored kuruma by getting a new house  500k down the drain until they will understand that the community matters and the community is the one that will make their product sale gta 5 doesnt deserve its price  5999 and would not recommend it stop banning people for using mods and be more open minded

one of my favorite games of the past 5 years yet sadly rockstar needs to change their stance on modding for me to reccomend this game to anyone banning people from online for modding sp is unnacceptable and trully scummy imo as for the game itself though its rock solid great story gameplay and graphics and honestly the most immersive world i have ever played in

rockstar has disappointed me lets have allow our previous gta games to be modded but because we finally built something good lets prevent other people from making it even better while we work on something else and then rockstar decides its worth the time wasted in banning accounts for modding instead of letting people be creative sorry rockstar but this new eula you put out is ignorant i bought this game speciffically to see what could be done as far as modding and you guys ruined it i understand modding not being allowed in a public lobby but private lobbies with friends is completely different if i wanted to play regular multiplayer i would just play on my xbox one currently a waste of money not allowing mods i will not support you guys any further until you change this and allow mods once again

grand theft auto v on pc is one of the best open world games to come out in recent years the world feels deeper and more alive that just about any game ive recently played even heavily modded skyrim doesnt feel as alive as this world the characters have depth and life their own motivations emotions stories and issues leading to a wonderful mix of personalities trevor is a psychotic madman michael a down and out conman feeling like hes retired too young with uncontrollable children and franklin is a man trying to simply escape the trappings of the life he was born into the storyline is detailed wonderfully varied and sends you across the whole of the map with various actions to partake in it looks gorgeous on pc and can run on a wide range of machines without many issues employing a whole host of advanced graphical effects to produce some breathtaking vistas but theres always the problems starting with mouse input the game has issues relating to mouse input and the three options give you a selection of either varying sensitivity with your framerate latency on input or possibly not working at all this has made the game feel clunkier than it should in places but not enough to kill my enjoyment of the singleplayer the big thing everyone was looking forwards to however gta online is a mess the game is actively grindy in an attempt to encourage players to buy shark cards to speed up financial progress until recently there was absolutely nothing done to kerb people using mods in multiplayer leading to other players having scripts that could literally remove every weapon from your inventory and the usual assemblage of god mode and infinite ammo users as of the last update rockstar has taken measures to kerb this onslaught of people modifying the game online with some frankly draconian measures if you say run a field of view mod for singleplayer which you are perfectly justified as the incar fov feels very narrow and difficult to drive from in firstperson you will be banned if it is still active upon entering multiplayer on some occasions people have allegedly been banned for using the mod in singleplayer closing the game disabling it then joining multiplayer with no mods even people whom have just been forcibly given money by others running modded games as weapons can be scripted to fire out money bags rather than bullets it seems have been banned due to the sudden financial gains as a single player experience gtav is one of the best games to come to pc in recent times but i would let the dust settle from rockstars current mess of a support cycle on pc as currently being banned from rockstar social club will lock you out of single player as well i will endeavour to update this review to keep it current with the state of the game as it either is taken out back and buried by rockstar or survives this onslaught from both players and developers all in all however id prefer to put this down as a maybe as the singleplayer is amazing possibly one of the best singleplayer experiences ive ever run through but the multiplayer and the current issues with bans and online prevent me from recommending the game

i was banned from online for using an fov mod gg rockstar i do not recommend this game to anyone the pc support for this game is out of the question it is sad enough that i waited over a year and a half after release on peasant consoles and now i am banned for freely using a game to its full extent for having fun with all of my friends also the game got boring due to the simple facts of me seeing so many youtube videos and there is just simply nothing to do the game is bland and dull with no real excitement to it what so ever rockstar has really messed this one up conclusion is dont buy it stick to games made for pc guys because it is clear people do not care about you having fun its all about getting as much cash to fill those pockets

i bought this game specifically to use mods and contribute to the modding community with my own creations the online mode sounded very appealing to me as well when reading about it but the actual experience of the online mode leaves much to be desired granted this is the first foray into official multiplayer for the series and as long as it mostly worked i would let it slide my favorite of this series of games is still the first two before they started forcing clichd story lines and character arcs down our throats and for the most part the online mode of gta 5 is a return to that style of gameplay ill focus more on this before describing my dereliction from rockstar altogether i couldnt jump straight into multiplayer the game forces you to complete the intro of the single player story for no apparent reason before letting you go online even though the intro doesnt segue or connect in any way to the online experience this is a poor design choice even for rookies in multiplayer after about 15 minutes of single player rushing and skipping cutscenes i was finally able to go online and create what would be my ingame persona dear god every human you can possibly create looks like an inbred mongoloid this is because you dont actually create your character youre forced by rockstar to believe in evolution and choose your parents who all look like apes wearing clothes to form what would be a genetic representation of your character after this youre given extremely limited tools to fix the disaster that is the belief in evolution and perhaps dress your character to look like some cliched persona there are plenty of fedoras by the way more evidence that rockstar wants to force its belief in atheism upon you there are no body modifications you arent allowed to gain muscle or weight originally i thought it was a default slate and they would let you alter this by working at it like in san andreas but no youre stuck being an out of shape unevolved caveman or if you choose a woman youll look like a crack addicted harlot with saggy breasts the online gameplay is pretty much a grindfest for cash race in various ways against other players that dont know how to turn off the default rubberbanding so the less skilled players get to cheat by slowing you down they havent improved the driving since the last game so you either get the car with no traction or the car with traction theres no inbetween you can also have shootout death matches with other players in a very underdeveloped battle system what to do with cash buy cars that you can steal anywhere but now youre able to paint them and add lights on the bottom if you grind enough you can upgrade the performance very slightly you can also get an apartment or condo if you save enough cash to uhh actually im not really sure what the feature is supposed to be for i guess its a place to hide from other players but you can just go offline to do that in fact the only thing worthwhile to do is watch tv which rockstar poured a ton of effort into they have full length animated shows on tv i wish they would have used those resources to put more actual content into the gameplay if rockstar wants to make tv shows they should do that instead theyve worn themselves out too thin on this game and it shows i became bored very quickly online all the players in the open world are extremely cutthroat the world feels empty even with all the pedestrians and traffic theres no depth to anything the heists are fun but the novelty wears off fast and becomes another repetitive task to earn cash i guess i was expecting more of a grand theft auto experience something like where i could start a gang with some players go steal a car out of the garage of a rival gangs leader and then challenge them to a race for it or have them perform a heist in exchange or use our gangs resources to take over a territory of the city for our drug trafficking and prostitution and try to expand it through gang wars with other players give me something risky to do let me put something at stake let me race some proctology patient for the pink slip to my pos car hell i would love permadeath in this game its not like i am very fond of the truckstop harlot i was forced to use through the abysmal character creator i was a bit disappointed by gta online but this is pc i waited about one week after release to purchase the game because i wanted to give the community some time to develop some very much needed modding tools my prayers were answered in mr alexander blades notorious scripthook v release there was so much joy to be had running around the streets of sa as a husky mauling anyone who looked at me funny or taking a swim in the ocean as a dolphin the latter conjured up ideas about a mod i would love to create based on the old ecco the dolphin games with renewed vigor i happily installed various mods including a bodyguard script which allowed me to spawn npcs to follow me around in the open world and the most fun of all the pedestrian riot mod which simulated an endoftheworld scenario in which every citizen has gone mad and gets a random weapon and kills anyone and everyone in a frenzy it is quite literally chaos and the most fun ive probably ever had in a game i can remember i made a minigame out of it by trying to survive while crossing the map i had hours of fun with this but it came to an abrupt end when rockstar pushed out a patch which broke scripthook i didnt bother loading the game back up i decided to wait for the next iteration of scripthook and give a few more days for people to release even more mods today i saw a video of a guy that made a gravity gun mod half life 2 yeah i know what youre thinking its ing awesome and also that rockstar is now banning people for using single player mods rockstar is banning people for using single player mods banning people for using single player mods kill yourselves rockstar im done i wont disseminate your company any more youve become another corrupted developerpublisher like ea activision and ubisoft welcome to the club ill never purchase another rockstar game in my life unless you reverse this and publicly apologize im also going to attempt to get a chargeback from my credit card for this purchase changing the eula after purchase should be illegal i hope everyone who works for rockstar gets their cars stolen and then run over by them do not buy grand theft auto v5 torrent this game and wait for private servers to be available if you want to check out the online experience

so when i got the game on pc it took me well over 8 tries to get it working already not a good sign after a while the prologue mission started after changing some of the graphics settings the game ran at a really smooth fps rate not much later i started getting massive fps rate issues there was not a second where the fps rate was stable at all and this is an effect from one of the games updates im a little confused shouldnt updates fix issues im certain that the update fixed some online issues but the fps rate and consistency is unreal changing the graphcs settings doesnt fix anything now ive bought the game 3 times on ps3 on ps4 and on pc when going from platform to platform i was expecting more than what the previous version had was there more yes and no yes there is exclusive content and features with the newer version of the game but to me its not enough i was really hoping for some expansion to the single player mode and its story while gta vs story did have enough to keep me going until i beat the game the story felt a little short and boring dont get me wrong the game does have some more mission variety this time around but the story could have used some more i occasionally found myself bored with the story some of the characters were there for a cutscene and maybe a couple missions and thats it and with most of the story characters they just arent interesting to me the game does have memorable moments but they are very few in terms of gameplay its pretty good until you look deep into it the guns can be fun to use and cars are fairly easy for beginners to use but its not all good at times the guns feel so bland they all have incorrect fire rates and they are not in sync with their respective firing sounds some guns have way too much accuracy there is very little bullet spread there are times where the cars in the game are just not fun to drive fully upgrading the fastest super cars in the game makes only small differences in terms of performance cars are limited to a really low speed even when fully upgraded most of the cars feel the same they dont feel special or unique theres really no special characteristics that vary from car to car and dont get me started on aircraft the fact that a huge commercial jet can recover from a stall with so much ease just annoys me and the online feature isnt that special anymore ive been playing it since it came out back in 1 october 2013 and i still play the game it honestly is just boring now the fact that the rank cap is at 8000 and the highest rank rewards unlocks at rank 135 is just confusing the much awaited heists were cool at first but now theyre just annoying if one member of the crew is down you have to start all over unlike the regular missions where you can continue despite you losing your teammates the fact that i can do a mission that involves busting a drug deal taking down professionals shooting down a plane and delivering a load of drugs to a cartel leader all by myself but i cant break a safe take out stacks of $100 bills and drive a motorcycle to a boat on my own continues to anger me and the way mods are being handled is terrible a mod to change the fov slider can get you a ban i dont see how that can harm the game graphics mods that make the game look prettier ban mod that lets you change the helmet you put on when on a bike ban changing the weather in the game with a mod ban a mod that makes you ragdoll and fall helplessly to the floor ban a mod that adds a speedometer on the side of the screen ban you see where im getting with this mods that dont harm the game grant you a ban its ridiculous and the glitches where players can clip through walls lose no health etc are still present server issues are everywhere online has more priority over single player and online is abysmal apart from a few exclusive things like cars and the video editor this was not worth $60 its more or less the exact same as the other versions of gta v and the fact that mod support and mod control is terrible i cant say much to recommend gta v

it looks beautiful but is really kind of a dreary game 1 crime is tedious i think there may be some value in this game being a good way to discourage young people from lives of crime because there is little reward great risk and you have to associate with stupid obnoxious people performing senseless unproductive and unprofitable activities like drive over here pick up a truck drive over here kill those guys get away from cops over and over 2 the characters are tedious 3 the story is tedious 4 the multiplayer is tedious you are forced to plan and execute heists with stupid obnoxious people just like real life crime summary im really suprised at how much i didnt like this game im a fan of the gta series and maybe it was the long wait but i expected more the game makes for a great tech demo though it looks terrific

the fall from grace whats truly upsetting about the tale of grand theft auto v is that if you had approached me a solid week ago regarding my opinion on the game i would have been radiant and besides myself in a ecstatic delirium for one the delays were clearly intended for optimization as even with all of the settings and antialiasing modifiers cranked to their maximum potential the game runs like a dream and infinitely better than gta iv did at launch and still does to this day the story while marginally trite is still tolerable at the worst of points and the gameplay itself is definitely a plesant salty wafer to even the palate from saints rows quadrupledecker wedding cake with sprinkles and your choice of ice cream course that was all before this week particularly today you see recent updates seem to have taken several chunks out of the marvelous game optimization and its a shame that i have to ascribe a descriptor like marvelous to competent porting since its so rare nowadays but i digress and well i suppose theres only so long i can beat around the bush before the trunk of the elephant in the room starts trumpeting too loud to ignore bans from single and multiplayer on the grounds of modification now lets clear things up if youre modding gta v to invoke impervious vehicles or character invincibility on the multiplayer side then you should expect the ban coming to you especially those utilizing the money cheat in multiplayer when rockstar has prepaid cards for the express purpose of adding more money to the mp experience which is probably what tipped off rockstar in the first place  you dont stand between a company and lucrativity without anticipating some severe blowback and possibly an agitated batallion however rockstar has been very indiscriminent with who finds themselves beneath the shadow of the banhammer for example if you like me was using the fov slider mod because the low field of vision and lack of slider in the main options was offending your eyes  especially if that usage was restricted to the singleplayer experience  then you shouldnt be the grouped together with the example cited earlier and punished equally one is a genuine offense the other is the linchpin of pc gaming longevity mods or modifications that keep the game from putrefying the latter are honest community efforts to enliven and imbue a game with its full potential and keep it consistently fresh these mods range from quality of life changes like an fov slider to silly nonsense like flying around as a pigeon with a live grenade which was something ill only be able to see in videos on youtube prior to this carpetbombing so long as antics like that are restricted to the singleplayer portion of the game no discipinary action should be incurred whatsoeverbut thats what we have here we have sweeping account lain bare and banned some potentially with an air of permanence due to the actions of a few thats just bad business though i fear it may have something to do with the rockstar club now that its always online itd probably take a few more months of code to differentiate whether someones in the singleplayer mode or connected to the multiplayer component or hey it might be as simple as setting a netcode switch as of writing i have been summarily banned from both gta online and gta v offline unable to boot the game before being terminated midloading screen ive yet to hear back from rockstar in regards to a timetable though ive heard the average allotment is two to three weeks and permanent bans are withheld for instances of multiple infractions  one of such being adding honest wholesome functionality to the part of the game that affects no one and cannot be classified as cheating id like to extend a hand of condolence to the modding communities placing the final if statements on their modifications since this fantastic game just wrote its death sentence by rebuking your support bottom line i cannot play my $60 game because of nonsense and until rockstar gets back to my ticket there are other things i can use these 67 gb for like my forays into similink work or copious amounts of porn

i love the single player think its awesome great story character devolopment and lots of stuff to do now online is a mess for me even this long after launch disconnects from lobby happens frequently when playing with a friend extremely long loading times which is a pain since if you are doing jobs you encounter a loading screen constantly also loading into a session takes forever also randomly kicks you from a session on your screen everyone leaves the session and leaves you the only player in it for no reason crashes still happens etc in the current state its in its not worth your money let rockstar fix these huge bugs before giving them your 60 euros which is alot of ing money

banning players for modding the game making it playable is wrong fov is an example the lider in the game goes no where near what is requiered to play in first person maxes as 75 my min is 90 prefer around 110 support is also horrible sent in a ticket when the game came out had issues with the character transfer got a single automated reply asking for the same information i had given including irrelevant information considering its all on their servers and has nothing to to with my system its been several weeks with me keeping the ticket alive and several weeks without any form of response a pirated version of the game would be the best bet cant be banned and you can mod and cheat all you like do not purchase unless you want to be limited and locked out the second you want to fix issues on your own other than those issues mainly with rockstar here is some about the game singleplayer is good funny but also a bit confusing there are these missions you can do where npcs you hire can level up when you use them but its pointless since you can only use them a few times and if you get the poor ones to begin with they might end up dying and not be avalible at all later or you can pick the good ones up front but then leveling them up means nothing since they are already good and wont mess up later on so there is no purpose of the entire system online is poor its boring its very limited and its slow they designed it in a way so that progress is so slow you would want to buy their ingame money for real money its like most free to play games where they allow you to earn the money slowly or just buy it well its balanced so poorly that you never really earn the big cash and the money in the store is so expensive its not worth it either because the in game items are also super expensive max you can buy is 8 million this costs $100 a plane costs 2 million or $25 of real cash yeah there is very little to do there are supposed to be things like armored trucks different kinds of vehicle targets to destroy but they rarely if ever spawn i have only seen a single of these events and have around 80 hours of online play time deathmatches suck they are unbalanced and end up as a sniper war because most of the time you are in large open areas races are ok but usually end up as destruction derby very few races have no collision turned on all other game modes are impossible to play because there are no players wanting to play them heists are silly you dont really do anything when it comes to planning its just like the normal missions you do but you do them in order most of the setup missions you do before the proper heist are boring mainly driving around and after you get an armoredbulletproof car from the first heist you can use that and nothing kan kill you from this point on the actuall heists are cool but sometimes you are limited to stupid decicions when it comes to the planning that you can not do anything about like having some silly bikes as an escape vehicle we all know thats a bad idea trying to run from a 45 star wanted level on bikes the open world has little going on no animals like in sp no random npc events the random events that happen are way to rare if someone in an armored car rolls up starting to attack you and you blow them up you are the one who gets punished by having to pay to replace their car this can be over 16 000 ingame cash thats $02 of real money for each one you blow up its missing the online stock market its been missing since launch on console its in the menus but fails to load overall if you dont want to modify the game in any way and really only want to play single player then its fine but if you want to change anything at all or thought you could have fun and have a steady and fair progression online then probably not

i very much like this game and it is fun to random things with friends but because this company decided to rise the price during the stream summer sale it is still the same price thoughout this week they raise the amount but the discount brings it back to the same amount making it appear that it is indeed on sale

as with most gta games it is simply amazing the main story is extremely short but the ability to play online with friends is where this game shines alas i would not recommend it simply because the company are low life money mongering scum raising the price of the game and pretending to discount it while having it remain at the original full price is just plain scumbag tactics i regret buying this game now and supporting such a sleezy company

tldr unless youre willing to pay 6080 bucks to horse around with your friends i cant recommend it i had a friend preorder this for him and i and i love playing it with him and my close group of friends my problem with the game is that the single player is just okay ive enjoyed all of the previous gta games progression watching your character grow and the game slowly get bigger and bigger this one is all layed out to you from the beginning i guess thats ok but theres no real sense of accomplishment for me when the city doesnt evolve with your character on top of that the character arcs were not very big pretty small actually i dont feel like anybody gained power or influence or grew much as an individual at the very end of the single player i felt like i had just finished chapter 1 of 4 as far as character development goes but all that aside unless youre playing specifically with friends multiplayer is unplayable rockstar will evidently ban you if you leave your mods on and if you dont youll be faced with constant jackassery and hacking i couldnt keep a pug together for a heist once which is sad because the heists are a huge part of the fun of the multiplayer i was really disappointed to find out that the new content didnt expandinclude this

as far as online play goes the hax are a massive problem i wont deny it but praise be to the benevolent hackers that just want to have some fun with everyone was in a game last night where hackers spawned the space jets and hyrdas at the airport we all flew around screwing around in passive and nobody got butthurt thats a oneinamillion case however and you mostly get dumb  that spawn campfires in your torso causing you to burn to death upon spawning true story actually the campaign is great really impressive story though maybe not as good as others still very well done mind you the charaters are really lovable will make your sides ache with laughter at times and other times bewilder you there are many knacks to the single player game such as the stock market and lesters assasinations that really let you squeeze some extra gubbins out of the game provided you have the knowhow however users looking to buy be warned rockstar bumped the base price up of the game during the sale or paired it with other useless trash that you dont really want and then put it on sale for the same ridiculous price for a game most of us have already purchased for our dusty consoles 60 goddamn dollars this is in violation of several laws and regulations and on top of that really shames rockstar on top of that the fact that the game is paired with these shark cards which are effectively ingame cash causes the purchase to count as a microtransaction it is therefore non refundable we know that game comapnies and buisnesses can be greedy but this takes it to a whole new level i have never before witnessed such a  sucking move by any game company no matter how greedy said company was if rockstar gets called out for this and fined shut down even i would go far as to say i would be laughing at them overall my ratings are as follows online 710 because i love chaos any sensible person who wants to enjoy it then id give it a 410 campaign 8510 some things could have been done better but a really outstading game customer service 1337420 these corperate jackasses pulled a  move bigger than the moby  himself i and three friends own this game with many more that hopefully awaited the summer sale to get this game with rockstar pulling such a greedy  move i dont see any more friends laying down 60 bucks to get this game any time soon total id give this game with everything taken into account a 37510 this game could be great but not just rockstars greed but lack of action towards hackers and other pests of the game they simply sit at their desks blankly staring at the screen  out and excrement dripping down their arms as they mindlessly program the next dlc edit since the time of writing rockstar has put the base game that is the game only and none of their extra bullcrap up for purchase at a nonsale price they could have made loads of extra money if they had just put their base game on sale but that doesnt look like it will be happening anytime soon pity the poor sods that went ahead and bought the game and packs on sale as im sure there were some who did in the long run though its rockstar that will take the hit for this as im sure not just me but a lot of valuble customers and gta veterans are thouroughly peeved by this little stunt

the single player is on spot but r is refewsing to allow modding buy banning people just because the engine is garbage and seriously unstable causing crashes constantly and needs to be patched even though an extra year was spent for this version i would like to set my fov higher but now im scared to change it in fear of getting banned from the online and what when someone creates a better graphics mod or something that fixes the constant crashing and then you get banned from online just because you had the 3rd party patch installed seriously 100 hours crashes every 1040 minutes on a high end machine

well after a metric ton of crashes im still convinced this is a great game rockstar did a good job optimizing it i can get 100 fps on a gtx 970 at like high settings so thats great however i was flooded with display driver crashes all the way up to my pc completely locking up forcing it to restart no crashdump nothing it just locks up what i did to hopefully get a stable experience  i did a full clean of my display drivers with display driver uninstaller while in safe mode  reinstalled the gta v ready drivers  display driver crashes occured every few minutes while in borderless fullscreen on 144hz so i went fullscreen and used vsync to lock fps to 144  also did a complete reinstall of gtav these steps had me playing this afternoon for 34 hours did 2 heists completely and didnt have a single hickup in frames not a sngle freeze or displaydriver crash after doing these steps i recommend everyone doing the same until rockstar finds a fix for these issues crashes occur on my specs i7 2600k 8gb ram gtx 970

1st review ever casual gamerso obviously my oppinion is of utmost importance the game is clearly not a piece of garbage but here are some things i didnt appreciate  >missing content now i finally get the heist punchline and the whole setup was genius i appreciate the satire because i do feel stupid for buying the game twice well played exactly and by the time heists are released the heist will be on them love it yeah forget the other points it all boils down to profits so i shouldnt be surprised buyer beware the people concerned about monetizing mods should also think about a money back system then amirite amirite its one thing to try and make your game appealing straight up lying is another dont like that not one bit my point is oh look better graphics i hate you guys especially you kyle

warning before buying know you can use no mods at all ever or you are banned from the entire online luckily i found that out before i purchased it good way to burn legitimate customers single player game is the good part its gta if you like that sort of thing then buy it the sp experience is rather welldone and runs okay turn off vsync if you get the laggies youll know what i mean its a shame this game defaults to vsync on why i dont know some people may like it but it causes problems if your system isnt a 3000$ system use half or off for vysnc multiplayer oh where to start huge city with 32 ppl max yeah ok coming from just cause 2 multiplayer mod this gta has absolutely nothing to compare to it except ai in it i am quite dissapointed by the cumbersome mess that is gta online and wont be spending a penny more on this thank goodness the community is making a better frontend for the multiplayer  its sorely needed while this game isnt as bad as the poor excuse for a port that iv was iv was way better when it came to finding a good race online while this is still better than ea games in terms of gfx if you have the hardware to do it the game runs well also but this machine is recent i dont care how pretty it looks i wanted a fun racer  thats why i bought it sadly i was extremely dissapointed by this game as per racing rocksforbrains cant do multiplayer to save their hide  and thats the consensus amongst many players not just myself i have to say if you want multiplayer jc2 mp mod is where its at its available on steam for free with the game go ahead and look at that one if you want the single player game this is a good game here check it out it should keep you busy for some time too much money for too little too late if youre looking for multiplayer what a mess rockstar fire the idiots who did your multiplayer have a look at just cause 2 mp mod on steam and see what you can do to make this like that youll have a real gem on your hands as a pc owner i was already butthurt over the fact that it took over 18 months to get the game on my preferred platform no excuses none get it right i am not buying a console for a game you burned a lot of customers with these delays after delays a great franchise a solid singleplayer game ruined by shoddy deft and extremely poorly executed online mode that sorely needs fixing wait for fivem to be released before purchasing seriously but if you want an annoying phone simulator i wholly recommend this game and iveflc also this is where its at or a crashhappy children racing simulator or a confusing menu mess simulator no more rocksforbrains games for me ive had it theres so much better out there that doesnt try to cover so many bases and reinvent the wheel with the menu systems and the deft multiplayer it took two days to even find races its just so frustrating trying to find a good race that its just not worth playing let me pick right from the menu multiplayer race and see what other games are available without going through loooooong loading times of a 30 seconds to a minute or more even on a ssd getting 1gbs  sec read times it is working properly sheesh edit did the story missions in multiplayer up until it told me to find cars well i can see why the game told me to find them because they arent anywhere to be found i found one by accident it told me to repair it so i did but where do i take it to theres no icon no route no nothing rubbish radios okay theres a station or two maybe three that output music a talk radio one i think and a few others that spurt out noise resembling to what the mushforbrains teenagers go down the street blasting out their cars but the music on the oldskool stations is pretty nice sound effects are where they should be i cant say anything mean about that heh graphics are nice theyre better than consoles but they cant be made use of with 2gb gfx cards or smaller the ingame environment is fun and eventful rather busy and detailed  you will have plenty of time to look at it in multiplayer [because you often spawn in the middle of no where miles from a car] the game singleplayer again was great but if youre buying this for multiplayer its going to let you down unless you pick it up on sale i cant even buy decent weaponary to compete with the people who had better stuff i just end up dying over and over and never really get anywhere in the multiplayer so i just go passive and drive around doing nothing because i cant find the cars i am tasked to look for so if you just want a game to drive around in get this maybe wait until its 20 bucks or something so yeah wait for a sale until then ill see you on just cause 2 multiplayer where ive made a stunt track of epic 10mile proportions problemsolvers freeplay server not recommended due to the mess of multiplayer dont reinvent the wheel here oh and its oftentimes a server with 23 people many days because they banned everyone just recently for any and all mods cheating isnt cool those people should be banned but people with custom visuals too glad i didnt come in until after it they banned a lot of innocent people too thanks rocksforbrains for killing one of the better games that could have been so much work so much effort how did you manage to kill the online so bad and then put salt in the wound and kill your public relations pr with the bans so many people got banned for no reason  or even just for the fov mods i can entirely without second thought understand cheaters being banned i hate that as much as anyone else this was overhyped big time i would not have bought this if any of my friends had this game but none did they bought and sold it years ago on console i think what has happened here is that this game took so long to come out that ive grown out of the gta phase of life the very demographic this is marketed to is getting old waiting for these games to come out next time i see games coming out way later for pc than on console its permanently of my list of games to purchase there are so many other games out there that if this is the way rocksforbrains wants to be i can vote with my dollar there will always be another company who will be readyandwilling to put out a product when other devs get to ritcheous and greedy i cite citiesskylines which was developed as an alternative to oftbashed simcity 5 and rightfully so as an example of just that its time to come down off your perch rockstar youre rubbing pc folks the wrong way by leaving us to beg for scraps what does this game have that other games do not hrmmm you could already run over an animal in carmageddon postal 2 has had gascan weapons for a dozen years now it does have a rather backwards mp race system that is full of crashhappy squirrels unlike anything else ive ever seen with a rediculous overpowered drafting mechanism that garuntees every single race will be a crash fest buy it for the attimescinematic singleplayer with overlyhard missions with little room to improvise since the mp is nothing new just a rehash of every other game thrown together in the most backwardsway possible plus an annoying cell phone always ringing trying to cover too many bases leaves you way open for failure and it hit home here there is one thing they got right  letting you skip missions because theyre infuriatingly rageinducing hard its nice to see the skip option after the plane that im reqd to fly and dont have a clue how has slammed directly into the riverpavementhillside in the same spot for the 10th time now okay rockstar more ideas like this please

great game horrendus policies rockstar know exactly what the pc gaming community like we like mods its one of the highlights of pc gaming when you take that away youre throwing away so much potential all we want to do is extend the lifes of our games we paid for sometimes twice would i reccomend it  of course its gta 5 but if you want to go down the modding route i would pirate it once you have bought it and mod away with that version instead its sad that i have to say that but rockstar have essensitally turned round and disrespected the whole community theyre more than likely butthurt that someone can add in a proper field of view mod when it would take them months and months to do the same thing if anything the fact that theyre blocking mods and banning people either means they still want more money from you for things like animals etc etc in the future and dont want to give them away freely well  you rockstar pirate away boys

great game with an amazing singleplayer storyline which is long and fun to play there are many side missions and things you can do if you ever get bored of the main missions you can fly planes drive boats or just go around doing whatever you want the multiplayer is so fun and there are so many challenges and different missionsheists that you can do with your friends or anyone you want there is so much to unlock and so many different vehicles to customize you can buy houses vehicles planes boats and so much more the heists which were only introduced recently are fun challenging and great to do with friends i would recommend this game to anyone especially if you have played the previous gtas this game brings together aspects from every game which you will notice the map features things like grove street and mt chiliad from sa and other gta games overall this game is very fun and great to play with friends or alone and i would recommend it to anyone

the game has been out for almost two years now r has monetized heavily off of this release of gta however theyre still money hungry sharks wanting to get more money out of this game it is not right as a consumer that you should be charging full retail price and claim it as a sale what a  marketing job to put a bundle of some ingame currency and charge the price of the full game
not recommended
idk why people are criticizing rockstar for the summer sale madness but what i dont like is that they allow so many hackers and modders to go around online without taking action as to banning or suspending them if youre a new player getting killed over and over and over can be frustrating do yourself a favor dont buy this game if having ufos ferris wheels and other sight blocking objects spawned on you is great along with infinite burning to death and exploding is fun by all means please buy this overpriced game

people are getting banned from gtao using fov mods in single player  but actual cheaters get to stay cheaters that use invinicibility hacks and  around with your stuff and generally make gtao a horrible experience rockstar continues to ignore the actual problem but bans innocent people for correcting faults in the game the fov setting is too low but if you get dizzy and have headaches because of it well  you also soon rockstar is probably going to start banning people for setting up racing wheels using xbox 360 controller emulators because rockstar was too lazy to set up joystick and racing wheel support in the first place in conclusion no mod support and if you do mod with good intentions then you get banned if you hack and cheat welcome to gtaonline  rockstar games

to be honest the game is good fantastic even however and this comes with a huge mother trucking however the game is let down horribly by rockstar support and the horrific load times in online because of the open world lobby nature of the game you leave and enter lobbies like a rabbit on heat except it takes exactly 2minutes and 37seconds with ssds samsung evo black to leave or enter a lobby you will spend your life waiting in load screens next up if you are the most honest gamer in the world go to church 7 times a week have a close relationship with your priest after church chior despite all this you will get banned the game is absolutely rife with hackers you are bound to land up in a hackers lobby  they may dump money on you or they may boost your rp against your will you will get banned their automated detection tool does not discriminate if your stats look awry its curtains for you johnny dont bother appealing support response times are in excess of two to three days unless you chase via twitter even then its about half a day and you will only be greeted with automated responses by numnuts that have about as much clue as mr plum in the library with the candlestick even then i doubt they would see the light once they have your money dont expect to get much more than the files on your computer in conclusion if you have money to burn you can expect about 23 weeks of longevity before you either get banned for doing nothing or get bored of loading screens a great game let down by horrible support and horrible online experience

not sure where to begin with this so ill begin with a little backstory if you havnt got time to read you may as well move on now  pros and cons at the bottom i was originaly hyped for gta v console version 360 when it came out only for online to be scaled back a few weeks no biggy we have got single player to have fun with fast forwad a few weeks online comes out and its a complete mess characters being deleted lag for the ages only to find out that rs said they wouldnt have enough servers a month prior to release you think someone would have thought lets install some more servers to handle the load we got a month to implement some after weeks of frustration i gave it to my mate to play and he enjoyed the single player as much as me as a sorry note for the bad servers rs gave out a free 500k to players which i never got so i packed up the game gave it to the same friend and only got it back two years later gta v pc release once again was hyped by another set of friends that gta was coming to pc i was like great and then saw the price tag of 40 i thought to myself how is this game still the same price as it was all those years ago sure new content was added but that was for console not pc and as far as im aware the story line hasnt changed which left me with two answers either rs just wants more money knowing people will still fork out 40 or the graphical improvments which a lot of people cant obtain as it is too much for thier pcs cost them a lot 19 apr @ 215am i have finished the last hesit in order while having fun with my friends servers are okay but we had a lot of drop outs along severs acting up the way but overall it was fine now for some reason i never got my reward for doing them in order as a leader have filled a ticket 06052015 but at the time wasnt to bothered about it because what i wanted wasnt expensive nor did i know where to go and fill a ticket weeks later i relise how expensive things are and that one million is a large amount of grinding time and i know how and where to file a ticket present day people are getting banned for fov fixs in singleplayer which i think is a joke missions as well as getting into free roam takes a long time about 1015% of your playing time will most likely be looking at a loading screen memory leaks need i say more armoured cars are probaly your best bet in free roam to survive the frequent brawls at city level unless your me flying in a plane collecting bounites  amd graphics card users seem to be having problems with the game due to the latests update me personaly i can last anywhere between 20 minutes too two hours before the game crashes ability to not mod this is a complicated matter which rs and the community should take into consideration modding should be allowed since it can improve a players experiance of the game an example being skyrim which was good on its own but made even better my the thousands of mods to increase the gameplay and depth of the game spoiler heists need to be improved some of the missions in my opinion were lacking such as the final heist when you rob the bank no hostage rescue or negotiations to gain more time before a swat team storms in rather than killing a few guards then getting to the door for the cops to show up i would also want mods where i can add decals to my car or game modes like demelition derby improvised on the parking lot middle island just off the motor way or jet death matches  if these are there please tell me why mods shouldnt be made obviously if they got onto online people with god mode are smgs that fire rockets are bound to pop up and ruin peoples fun or make missios to easy to earn cash therefore stopping people playing missions when a cash mod can be made with new updates coming out for the game who knows what mods will even work properly and if they will work along side other makes or will it just crash the game who knows mass modding may lead to the game being broken to its very core and stopping people being able to play with eachother pros great single player super graphics if your pc can run it very easy to start having fun and messing about with your mates online large selection of missions of varying modes free roam planes <3 cons 40 is not a suitable price tag for a game released in september 17 2013 cash shop ie micro transaction on top of the heavy 40 memory leaks rs sort your servers out already please possibilty of no mods which can improve user experiance  my opinion 321 am and i have college today god help me xd

dont bother its too expensive for a basically 2 year old game and the in game currency is worthless because its overrun with hackers that distribute free money they can also wipe out your progress on a mission cheat to beat you in a race take all your weapons teleport you into the ocean remove you from cars be invincible speed hack carpet bomb you at will force  your character in the game and many more modded things not to mention they just raised the price for this sale it was only 60 dollars for retail before
not recommended
r its on sale now $60 everyone else

the price increase before the sale is a shady business practice and i protest

no never dont buy this crap people call a fun and good game reasons  ton of lag tons of glitches that can crash and alot more they never did the price up you ing herd of idiots crashes are frequent online mode sucks online mode almost cant load story mode skips crash sometimes this games driving mechanics suck  hell even payday 2 lagging while driving is better then this heists with people who probaly killed you yeah  no

how to encourage pirating a guide by rockstar step 1 ban people for modding your singleplayer game done edit step 2 advertise your game on sale by first jacking up the normal price it may seem like petty complaints to some of you since the base game is great but dont reward them for these practices

still too many bugs to be released worked for a bit then all of a sudden on startup it would say gta 5 crashed had to completely redownload the game for it to work made a backup of gta in case it happened again as it did just today went back to backup doesnt do  rockstar social support is not helping at all this game sucks mighty balls
not recommended
i have to join the others in marking this game down it has always online drm i confirmed this by launching the game offline it wont let you launch unless you have already passed an online check within the previous 24 hours rockstar have changed their eula postsale which is illegal to not allow any modding and are threatening to ban anyone who mods even if only in the single player game the game still has numerous bugs also i find the world too artifical eg if i make a traffic jam and turn around for 2 minutes then turn back all the traffic is gone because it respawns the game doesnt keep everything in memory so if you run over lamp posts etc they will get fixed when out of view instantly likewise without mods cars you abandon disappear your own car respawns in garage etc

review part 2 elektrik boogaloo so rockstar just went ultra shaddy on their steam summer sale prices not only is it still $60 with a nice little in game currency that isnt worth it at all you cannot refund the game with this purchase why is that the reason is that if you buy the game now which comes with that in game money you now cant refund your game dont buy the game during the summer sale if youre not sure that your pc can run it at a state you want it to
not recommended
alright i cantnot recommend this game for its pure cathartic fun value and stressrelief carnage its almost the perfect summit of theraputic violence any video gamer could ask for hardcore or casual almost tldr at bottom the reason for that huge lump of salt in its entirety is the hostile npc ai and wanted level system to properly explain this first let me quickly summarize gta in its essence since the original for those in need of refresher or any new recruits to this wonderful sandbox gta has been since the beginning criminal behaviour followed by wacky antics and shootouts resulting in difficult but filmesque police chases between clueless motorists on a freeway and cars that occasionally flip start on fire and explode sometimes detonating the entire highway ultimately resulting in a grim and humbling lesson of the hardships of crime or sometimes just a dude trying to finally make it alright so the wanted level system in this game shaves off a star from what im used to the 6 star system from san andreas most recent gta i owned played a fair bit of gta4 back when it came out and oh god so much vice city where your notoriety or wanted level scale in intensity with accumulated stars this is no biggie you pick up one star for yanking a guy from his vehicle so they try to arrest you another for bumping a cop car as you flee as they start to shoot another for returning fire its pretty simple but thats not the issue here 1 star wanted level sets cops off to swarm you immediately and employ overwhelming lethal force im talkin shotguns and all that  still no big deal right this next bit is the thing that sorta breaks the deal for me and really sucks a lot of the fun out of it 2 is more or less double the numbers of 1 star with a lot more emphesis on shotguns 3 stars gets you an armed helicopter with a very large view range making it near impossible to escape police set up roadblocks and spike strips and attack en masse 4 is almost guaranteed death 5 is almost guaranteed death except with heavy swat vehicles and assault rifles that in mind here is a short list of things that can get you a 1 or 2 star wanted level from the getgo and result in lethal force  loitering walking too near a police officer standing near a police officer following the road rules punching the air punching the air in the middle of the wilderness i swear to god honking your horn using gesture animations littering keep in mind your character tosses their wrappers  bottles the second theyre done with them trash cans arent a thing driving past a police station avoiding a fight with a pedestrian jogging checking your phone crashing your vehicle away from others standing in the wrong place waiting for security to open a gate getting attacked by a pedestrian unintentionally intimidating a skiddish civilian npc getting attacked inside a store ammunations are the worst ones shoplifting asking for it defending yourself from npc aggression bonus if any of those wanted levels result in your death your vehicle is impounded you have to go near a police station full of the bastidos to retreive your vehicle even if you decide to pay the fee legally you could still end up being fired at as you leave with a wanted level even more fun police have not and from what ive seen will never use force on npcs completely ignoring any crimes or murders they may commit in some cases the police have attacked the player as the result of an npc fistfight completely unrelated and unknown to the player i really really wouldnt care normally but it just creates this awful environment where tiny things set off this infinite army of trigger happy holes where defending yourself only makes it worse and then punishes you for even trying make no mistake they dont even try to see if youre cooperating they skip tasers cuffing arresting tickets fines etc and hop straight to delivering mag after mag of hot lead if in some distant future the game devs decide to add non lethal options in for things like shoplifting or loitering i will gladly keep my mouth shut tldr  i really really want to have fun with this game i really do i have fun here and there glimpses of this wonderful game buried underneath a couple terrible stains but i cant in its current form really really hoping for an update where thats fixed it very much so begs for a non lethal setting on police officers or lower numbers or just some delay to which they go from apprehend to punch lead holes into

game is good  however there are 2 main things that make this a thumbs down 1 terrible load times even with a beast of a machine load times are horrendous 2 banned pc modding are you serious what a joke the only reason why gta iv was playable for more than a year was due to mods terrible choice rockstar terrible choice

gta 5 is simply a masterpiece presented by rockstar to the gaming industry the graphics are simply immaculate the ragdoll physics is almost fullly realistic  no more strong pushovers to pedestrians like in gta 4 the story although it has certain elements from various movies is still adrenalinepumping and the revoked combat system makes the spine chill the vehicles are love and unlike gta 4 the handling of the vehicles is realistic the damage physics is also like in real life as tyres get bust after drifting the activities hobbies and pastimes as its called are interesting and stressrelieving the sky and sea floor are quite detailed and convincing enough and the first person view is cool as the head rotates according to the situation the director mode is fun if youre not interested in doing any mission or playing with any of the protagonists sorry console peasants pcmasterrace though i did not like quite a few things in the game the ai is worse than gta 4 especially the cops who kill anyone instead of arresting them if you want to gain unwanted attention the quickest this games perfect for you as the cops can smell you from anywhere if committed a crime like anywhere the traffic ai is also poor though this reflects the reallife attitude of los angeless citizens while driving overall i rate this game 910 not recommended to kids aged below 15 if you did its a sign of bad parenting

edited review im still going to leave my original review down below here and i stand by that this game is still an amazing game but rockstar what the  i and many other people have been waiting for years for this game and have bought this game numerous times over to play it on other systems and one of the main reason i got it for pc even the third time was to be able to mod it you know its bad enough you had the audacity to wait two god damn years to release the pc version of this game and still ask for 60 bucks on top of it but now youre punishing the pc community for modding the singleplayer you knew the moment this game hit the virtual shelves on steam this game was going to be modded to the holy hell because of how long we been waited for it and youre punishing us i call bllsht and you should be a damn shame yourself were not hurting the game or ruining anyone elses experience with gta5 and you shouldnt be banning us for modding your 2 year old game you know whats really funny rockstar is that if i had pirated your game besides spending my hardearned money on it i could still technically be playing it right now with all the mods and not have to worry whatsoever about getting banned and i would still have money left over but i didnt cuz i wanted to show you my support and buy this game again thanks for showing the love to the people who actually spend their hard earn money on your game ill make sure this is the last rockstar product i actually buy until you guys get your sht together this is a great game but saddly i can no longer recommend it with whats going on original review well its finally here after almost 2 long years gta 5 is finally on pc ive played this game on both my xbox 360 and xbox one and now finally on my pc i will admit that im still a bit salty with rockstar for delaying the pc version of this game for so long after its initial console release but i gotta say they did one hell of a good job optimizing this game for pc this game runs great and has more graphic settings then alot of pc exclusive games the keyboard and mouse controls feel great and even driving on keyboard feels good i think its fair to say that this has to be rockstars best pc launch yet but on the other hand thats was to be expected with how many delays this game has gotten but anyway with that being said lets move on to the game play aspect gta v with no question has one of the most diverse open world maps ive ever seen this world is huge and it feels like a real living place ive been playing this game for almost two years now and to this day sometimes i still find new places i havent seen before in the game the gameplay has been redefined from the last gta and feels alot more natural and fluent it even has a very well done tacked on fps mode so you can experience the game in a whole different perspective in a way it makes it feel like an entirely different game the story is very fun and very compelling and can even be touchy at times and is a reflection of how messed up modern day society can be there is a ton of side ejectives to do in the singleplayer and playing gta online with friends is an absolute blast this has been said to death but ill say it again even with all the delays this game has had it is still a masterpiece i can highly recommend this game to almost anyone it just goes to show what can happen when developer put actual time and effort into their games all i got to say is rockstar games way to not f it up xd lol overall score 910 incredible 3

game has countless bugs that still havent been fixed such as awful framedrops random freezing not as in crashing it literally locks up my entire pc and the fact that modding isnt allowed rockstar killed their game with the change to their eula mods are a major reason why pc gaming is the best platform they have killed gta 5 for the pc

if youd asked me a week ago if i recommend this game i would say yeah totally but unfortunately this is no longer the case first reason is the online it seems that they fix one problem and make another 10 problems on each patch the second thing which im sure pretty much everyone heard about is modding support you get banned for modding good work following activisions footsteps and taking the fun out of your games on pc you just removed the main reason i enjoyed gta iv for as long as i played it this is the reason im starting to hate the gaming industry this is the reason why i hate major developers and publishers you wont add anything to a game unless you can make money out of it and of course why would we let people add content to our game for free when we can just make something and then charge for it and believe me its just a matter of time before paid dlc will show up i wont be surprised if the next gta will be purchasable with a season pass with a combined cost of 150$ i also wont be surprised if they will start releasing gta yearly

it is a great game for friends but due to the recent stupidity of rockstars antimodding decision i do not recommend buying this as the game will die quickly because of it edit apparently this has always been a policy of rockstar however i still dont recommend it because there is not much to do after you complete the heists it just gets repetitive and boring

great game the best open world game ever with the best character development and the best story but rockstar games you have shot yourself in the foot fo banning all modding gta iv was the game it was not because of the base game but because of the mods which were developed for it that is what kept it alive all of this time gta v will after the initial craze and story completion die because lets face it unless you bring out some really great free dlc people will not want to spend 40 on a game they cant mod that was one of the primary reasons i purchased the game in the first place in summary rockstar games are cowards  they allow people to fawk out their hard earned money then only tell them some weeks after what i find the most shocking if you didnt even release a prenote to tell everyone to remove their mods before the next update no instead you just banned people outright stupid edit while it may be true that you dont get banned for using mods in single player any more you still have to be exteremly careful not to accidentally misclick onto online or its an instaban not good r

2015 the year of consumer revolt first paid mods now banning for mods and going as far as banning people from singleplayer for mods i dont condone cheating in the slightest i really hate cheaters on csgo and i certainly didnt like them on gtao do i think they deserve single player bans of course not do i think anyone using an fov mod should be banned or an edit to remove intro videos absolutely not rockstar i have no idea why you think banning people like this as a result of your own shortcomings is a reasonable idea you delayed the pc port many times and the pc version came out nearly two years later how and why is this acceptible clearly youve made quite a bit of money from sales of gta v just from the last generation of consoles alone how is it that a triple a dev with millions put into development and marketing of gta v not have anticheat how come using cheat engine online is still a thing how come you didnt include proper field of view options at least oh and the patches regarding fixes these are the best because one patch the game will be running fine and not drop below 60fps on medium settings on a gtx 770  i5 2500k the next patch would introduce stuttering dithering on many objects and framerate drops below 60 all the way to 3040 the online experience is wonky to say the least even on an evo 850 256gb ssd loading online is a joke because most of the networking is handled clientside actually trying to join a game of gta online is a joke same goes for races deathmatches etc dont even get me started on those abysmal menus for whatever reason i also get paired with people across the world this is a game that had nearly 400000 people playing on launch day and youre telling me i have to connect to someone with the buttery smooth experience of 300ms net latency really on the topic of mods wow you literally cannot ban them i dont know what r is thinking but because they are geniuses and made a lot of hosting clientside it only means that custom multiplayer servers will come sooner great job r you tried to stop modding but you only made it easier for modders since you arent using your own servers thats hilarious for anyone curious i wouldnt bother with this game until r fixes it or modders come to save the day to create a true gta online experience

so originally this review rated the game down because of bans for single player mods now though rockstar has said that was an accident i was waiting for an additional update or announcement but i guess that was all at any rate it wouldnt really be fair to leave this review up for what ended up being a mistake so heres a more proper review i guess i could type for hours about how this game improves from gta iv or how it still has its own shortcomings but a few things really jump out at me thinking back to single player ive completed the story and am about 80% on my way to 100% completion as defined by rockstar 1 the game feels very onrails decision making in missions is restricted to choosing one of two heist setups for the major heist missions story missions have very specific waypoints and often bizarre mission failure flags i once failed a mission when i wanted to go up a hill to get a better vantage point on a train i wanted to steal and was respawned in front of the objective just so i wouldnt miss it and the admittedly fantastic character switching mechanic is often forced upon you in missions that last one is one of the most annoying cases because of how blunt the game tends to be theres an audio cue the characters face on the character switch section of the hud glows and theres often a hud message telling you to switch between characters like come on i just escaped the cops on this big heist as one character you can take the kid gloves off and let me swap on my own 2 in addition however the game doesnt feel very hard two or three of the late game firefights are a little tricky but theyre never difficult i cant really remember any sections of heists or other story missions that were hard and i certainly dont really remember any car chases that were that difficult in the single player i suppose i could do things like turn off minimap or turn off the crosshair or what have you but there isnt a formal difficulty slider while there are special criteria for completing missions that sometimes make the missions a little harder if youre trying to get those stuff like dont get the car youre driving damage those criteria arent quite the same as a straightup difficulty slider 3 the interface feels poorly adapted for pc the hud has all of the information on the far corners of the screen and often really small and the various menus of the game dont seem to be adapted for just using a mouse to navigate them with lots of pressing random buttons like space bar and enter to navigate them it almost feels like im playing a console port from ten years agonote that the game actually feels like it runs better than gta iv on lower settings and theres tons of higher settings to play around with no complaints on that end 4 besides the story missions single player feels very empty once youve cleared out that last strangers & freaks there isnt really much to do i mean sure you can shoot some cop cars and lead them on a chase and probably have fun for ten minutes or so but then what i wont blame the game too much for this because the games solution for this is online mode but the story missions themselves arent really all that overwhelming in the first place and thats all the game has theres other ups and downs but these are what i feel are the big things about single player while i was interested in the characters and the world enough to get through the story it wasnt something id consider replaying i also wouldnt really drop sixty dollars for a game with a single player whose only redeeming element is the characters so while i cant review online yet since im not very high level it is a blast with friends though i can say this if you wanted to get gta v for the single player wait until you can find it on sale

tldr review gg rockstar gg longer review while i did enjoy gta i believe it makes a great example for how flawed the steam review system is this game is not bad enough for me to dislike but in no way good enough to recommend both single player and multi player boast with a huge world filled with different activities for you to explore and especially in gta online you will find races missions and of course the heists scattered around the map yet somehow the world manages to still feel empty to me when playing a game called grand theft auto the last thing i want is all the deathmatch nonsense i find around the map most missions are too simple to be truly as good as the single player and thus they bleak in comparison the races can be fun when they are made by the community or if they generally include crazy jumps and stunts but most races especially air races will end up being won by the person that started first so what can you do in gta online the answer is simple not much while i had a lot of fun with a few of the races i spent mos of my time buying clothes modding my cars getting tattoos and of course doing the much anticipated heists that was the most fun part of the mp as they had some form of story coming with some well made cutscenes and good dialogue if you can call it that that made them compelling and even the actual gameplay the killing driving flying etc worked well in that context it was fun or it would have been but ill come to the negatives later ok we talked about the mp how was the sp though fun honestly even though i had basically no choice when it comes to customizing the characters michael trevor and franklin it didnt make the mistakes online did providing the player with a lot of fun main and side missions the story wasnt too cliche even though a lot of the gameplay seemed like it was intended as a tutorial for the mp last but not least the world sp and mp was beautiful the landscapes the night sky all of it was breathtaking so much in fact that i once went to the beach just for the sake of swimming so until now it seems like a fine game why the thumb down gta has problems major problems despite being originally released two years ago first off the lack of content i already touched on that before but again i have to say that most of the stuff you can do is kinda boring and in both sp and mp heist set up missions are basically mundane tasks speaking of heists you remember when they said that the player could choose how to proceed yup totes true in sp and lets not forget that the choices are always binary seriously the heists could be fun if you didnt have to replay every setup mission 1000x because of either bad teammates connection or some other silly thing that has nothing to do with the actual game also the stock market is a terrible feature that is tied to missions and will essentially only be of any benefit when in that context what else well the progression system is quite bad im rank 20 something and im almost done with everything i want to do in that game too bad one of those things is to get a minigun a fun weapon i have to admit that i can only get when im lvl 120 yup have fun doing only races for three months do achieve that but the worst part is the car mod progression of which some is not tied to rank as i mentioned i like tuning cars well you have to do races for that again have fun with that if you dont like racing but the greatest of all problems are still the bugs performance connectivity issues and more oh you finally found a session whoops to bad we lost connection people unable to get into cars because of sudden lag people only starting to lag when in cars with other crashing that one guy that is level 12000 and thus has four times more life than me great game mechanic that is in the same session why why dont they just have a server browser and of course the most recent bug i have experienced and also the most recent one in fact its the reason that im writing this review bias much is the one that locked me outside my account yup cant login gg rockstar well played to conclude pros great world and graphics fun even if a little dull single player in general good dialogue and filmography when they actually show it off tuning is alot of fun gameplay is overall solid cons lack of content what is there is dull bugs crashes glitches etc problematic progression systemstill somewhat rewarding to get new stuff overall the high expectations were not met a great game that is sadly dragged down by a few bad design choices and its bad bad state best treated like an early access game get it once they have actually worked on it fun but not good editstuff i forgot etc 1 turns out you can invest in the stock market and make a profit by robbing someone and investing in that stores competitors only works in sp 2 you do not make enough money in mp heists are the only thing that make a lot of money it still only allows for very little considering the work you put into them 3game crashes when accessing the gtav creator from online

a decent single player campaign that sadly does not make enough use of the brilliant heist gameplay mechanics the game really falls short in the online part though which is riddled with loading screens and based on a terrible consoley lobby system that has you spending 70% of your time outside of the open world thats supposed to make the game great sadly a lot of wasted potential here

online review first heres a note the people that get banned are those who use mods in online play if you mod in single player you have little chance to be banned as it does not effect everyone else in the game you are in those complaining about being banned are ignorant to the fact that they mess up the servers when they change their files around this isnt minecraft i dont recommend this game for online play currently with the amount of modders in the game right now the servers can get laggy not only that lots of the content cant be accessed because of the community people give up after 1 failure in a heist which means you have to look for 3 more people to do the heist with again while losing all the progress you made on ur first attempt it wouldnt be so bad if the load times werent abysmal but having to wait another 2 mins after some ahole ruins ur fun and leaves is not worth the wait i rate gtaonline a 410 its great in theory but the execution is no where close to what it should be maybe when they fix the game up a bit i might recommend people play online

gta v is an amazing game the singleplayer is an engaging and incredibly detailed piece of work which had me hooked for a long time over two platforms from firstperson dashboard panels to puns and debris scattered around the city it will impress unfortunately the online mode doesnt stack up so well as seen from extended time playing it the world feels less alive and shallow compared to singleplayer and suffers from a multitude of bugs that never should have made it past qa lobby crashes arent uncommon strange design and ui choices make it clumsy to use and the activities are fragmented into a string of waiting rooms with broken lobby mechanics it doesnt even have any wildlife making the world even more empty the game also suffers from a crime and punishment system that doesnt work want to shoot someone chasing you if you hit the explosives carried in their hand you get penalised and fined for destroying their car even if it wasnt your intention someone coming at you in an armoured car surely it makes sense to blow it up this time since its bulletproof especially for newer players but instead you get penalised again the developers expect you to shoot through a tiny vision slit to defend yourself which is heavily unbalanced against someone when they are caught out in the open by player killers giving little chance to fight back of particular note are the loading times they are utterly horrendous and unacceptable in this day and age with the game commonly getting stuck on the loading screen if you shifttab to pass the time you find the game will refuse to load and silently get stuck in an infinite loop this is especially terrible for a game two years old whats the excuse rockstar and last but not least the modding situation not too relevant to me as i dont use them but there is quite some controversy surrounding the banning of players for mods in a series that was heavily modded in past incarnations rockstars treatment of players has been brought into question update rockstar comment here httpwwwrockstargamescomnewswire overall if you havent played singleplayer id pick this up but due to the poorly performing multiplayer and bugs i wont be adding it to the recommendations list for anyone looking to go online

i already owned grand theft auto v on my ps3 i bought this game to play it in better graphics with mods the most fun thing about gaming on pc is being able to play with the mods and enjoying the modding community this mod banning thing is the stupidest decision rockstar could have made surely theyre aware of how important modding is to most pc gamers i cant believe i wasted $60 to replay the exact same game i cant believe theyre banning people from multiplayer for modding singleplayer games atrocious

hours upon hours of entertainment rockstars attention to detail is something for others to aspire to until you open up gta v online which is a complete disaster it is impossible to quickly play a single mission with random people there will be loading screens some more loading screens and then one more loading screen sometimes the game servers have a little trouble counting and end up throwing everyone out not to the lobby though to the story mode with 4 more loading screens inbetween and if you by the offchance happen to successfully end up in a mission instance one of your teammates will soon exit the match throwing everyone else out again and if someone else doesnt quit during the mission then your client is bound to crash very soon ive had the game ctd at least a dozen times now its more prevalent in online during the 30 hours ive played gtav online ive only gotten to complete a multiplayer mission once and if you thought you could get creative in the ingame stock market youre in for a big disappointment it doesnt exist in online why because money is now tied to rockstars micropayment model pay 5 bucks to get 5000 in game credits or whatever so yes rockstar axed an important gamemechanic on the altar of greed this is also the reason there are strict antimodding mechanisms in place so now that you cant make money with stocks and completing a mission takes several hours technical problems and rejoining included you dont really have many ways to make money fast rockstar has been banning players or so ive heard who have received money from other players with exploits so yeah the online mode is gimped and dysfunctional if you can get past the endless loading screens and you only play with friends then maybe theres a few fun hours there but compared to the rest of the game and to the entirety of rockstars past release history gta v online is a sad joke tldr if you want multiplayer awesomeness go ahead and skip gta v entirely the story mode is quality stuff though ps oh also rockstar has done a lot to prevent modding this game thats just ridiculous i wish i knew this before i spent my money

unless you would like a ban for using an fov mod in singleplayer do not purchase this game this is complete and utter bull i can to some minuscule extent understand banning people for using it in multiplayer even then i think banning for this exposes rockstars total retardation but when you ban people for using mods in singleplayer wow 010 like skyrim except it isnt at all worst $60 i ever spent until rockstar changes this idiotic policy i will keep this review negative seeing as i can not get a refund this unfortunately is the least i am able to do

tldr at the bottom i had the ps3 version of gta v back when it came out and i liked it a lot so i preorder gta v on pc it gets delayed but thats fine it comes out i go to play multiplayer and im prompted to make an account for social club i make one to play online little did i know that making an account is permanent and i was not able to get my level 50 character from ps3 moved over now i called rockstar support the guy on the phone said tough luck i emailed rockstar support it took them three weeks to unbind the new account so i could finally play my old character i load up gta v sign in to my old account and it works the only thing when you get this game it comes with an activation code it says i already used my one code so now i cant play online at all i submitted another ticket to rockstar support maybe in another three weeks i can play the  game all in all its just been frustrating when i was able to play online lemme tell you there was some whack connection problems heists would break all the time and get this after you finish a segment of a heist its like a mission with missions building up to the end you get put back in free roam so your lobby of four people gets split up and it takes forever just to start the next mission tldr i cant play online

last patch released by rockstar fixes my gamestart issues so now i can play it normally the game is as good as i expected and pretty well optimized in fact i can pull off impressive visuals with my rig highend gaming laptop gtav is one of my preferred games i finished it in x360 and now it feels great to revisit los santos with the first person camera and gorgeous graphics some people in this forum reports me that they still cant play it even with the patch i leave below the tricks that seem to make it work for some people hoping it helps > update your drivers > update gtav > if still it doesnt start and you are playing in a laptop try with the following trick disable your nvidiaati card from devicemanager so only the integrated card is on then click play on steam and quickly reactivate the nvidiaati card before gtavs splash screen fades out the game should start if it doesnt unfortunately i think you need to wait for another patch

where do i start other game developers must be crying in to their burritos about now gta5 is so many games in one its hard to quantify 3rd person driving shooting sandbox exploration co op survival mmo mobai could go on then when youre done quantifying it change teh prefix to 1st person and start all over again so thats the genre sorted the gameplay um are you like me in that you will pullover just short of the objective to finish listening to that song on the radio yeah you gonna be doing that again do you sometimes walk the 2 blocks to the objective or in fact just go for a walk around the city just watching yeah you gonna be doing that again too im not going to wax lyrical about stuff buts its amazing a true work of art ive been out for a walk and have been overwhelmed by the detail you really can feel the time and love people have put in to this game and that dedication makes other developers look stupid and arrogant take a car for a fast drive then get out and you will hear it pinking and ticking as it cools down on cars they are amazing no real life manufacturer is going to license this game but rockstar have blurred the lines between the cars in the game and their onvious real life counterparts they are stunning and the customization surpasses san andreas if that concerns you at all its goooooooooood so the shooting yes the shooting never really enjoyed the shooting bits in gta games i dont like auto targeting and switching between gta4 was good with it but 5 is better at that too but for those who want a true challenge and true immersion get it in 1st person amazing seamless so the story deep very deep and disturbing entertaining funny relevant and above all interesting trevor really is a screwed up as i had imagined the characters are believable and the script is as good if not better than other gta games so performance then surely this is where gta5 falls down gta4 ran like a 2 legged badger wrapped in a curtain nope runs like a champ see attached vid below for a good idea and some of my buddies are running it on less powerful machines with no issues it doesnt crash during a game in fact it doesnt crash at all not once although i have encountered a bug where if you alttab out during story mode too many times or change graphical settings too many times the game becomes unrecoverable or i get input not supported on my monitor osd if you get this go to your documents rockstar games gta5 and delete the settings file all is fixed also do not try and play gta5 with steam in offline mode as the rockstar launcher will not connect to the server and will not launch the game if you then go to steam and go online the launcher will not recognize you are back online and will not connect to server still you will have to exit steam and reopen but these arent game crashes i had no problems signing in to rockstar social club connecting to friends online can require patience at times but is always worth it so then online is that any good yes heists are not simply do a bank job there are about 4 missions to do in total 3 being set up mission and the fourth is the heist lots of fun do it with friends really amazing pvp is chaotic but fun i do think the guy you just killed should spawn a little further away from you though it invites revenge a little too much but the game runs the same as it does offline like a champ then there are plain co op missions to do which are great then theres races and horde mode survival things player created content coming out of your ears it really is game of the decade for me i dont think i can remember a game as good as this as addictive involving beautiful and downright hilarious as gta5 i am 35yrs old and my first computer was a commodre64 i have seen all aaa titles come and go i saw the birth of sonic and mario i bought virtua cop the day it came out i am a battlefield veteran 7 i own every commander and conquer on disk now i can add played gta5 to my gaming career thank you rockstar for making the greatest game to date 999999999910 my gta5 playlist all vids in 1080p 60fps httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplrda17jhlxhssrpgoqavmadmekoanon8s

after the long wait its nice to see that rockstar has managed a decent pc port of the game it works fluently without any lags  fps drops the story and characters are typically great and entertaining as much as the huge world you can explore the only negative aspect to mention is the high amount of loading times especially in online mode sometimes you have to keep waiting for ages to set up a game with friends its also not rare that people disconnect from the server for no reason if you can live with that you should get the game but i recommend to wait for a price drop since 60 are ridiculously much

awesome game once you get to play it demanding in specs if you want it to be pretty but if you gang up with your friends its a really awesome experience i killed 26hours of potential homework time for a paper just to play the hell out of this and the recovery for multiplayer was very fast for this game

the singleplayer is great the multiplayer is a large grindy deathmatch thats it racing is alright but outside of that its all just deathmatch some vehicles even allow you to be almost untouchable heck if you blow up someones vehicle which is immune to bullets and has very small holes through which you can shoot the driver you get punished you get matched with bad sports and you have to pay the owner of the vehicles insurance before this i would have said that that is the only thing disreputable about the game the company has proven now to be disreputable though theyve raised the price if the game before sales during the summersale they offered no discount for the base game and had a 25% discount for a new bundle they made the bundle the bundle is a shark card  the game the shark card only gives you 125million in game whilst making the game cost 20 dollars extra so that they can continue selling the game for the original 60 dollars 125milion is enough for one large apartment in multiplayer in singleplayer you get an easy 150million for just doing the campaign this is a huge ing scam dont bother with this trash i recomment buying it on  where you can get an actual discount instead of buying from these trashy s

lets start with single player no words its pretty amazing it didnt dissapoint me at all however im giving a negative review because of the second gamemode gta online the idea is cool its just like the old samp or mta from gta san andreas used to be with a lot of new stuff new missions etc edit fun fact mtasamps connection was so much better than gta onlines but i just cant enjoy it this gamemode has way too many issues with connection i get problems 710 times i try to join a friend and get randomly kicked to empty rooms no it is not my internet speed i have 40mb and can download up to 4mbs i can play any game without a single issue i tried to enjoy it i tried to look at the good side but there were just too many issues and problems connecting that i give up plus you get to spend the 15% of your time playing depending on how much you play in my case its the 60% watching the loading screen which by the way is a must for anything finished a mission loading wanna join a friend loading gonna switch between multiplayer and singleplayer loading oh and dont forget that if you have an accident playing single player while using mods like accidentally try to join gta online you get banned up to 2 weeks c

single player is fun online is a snoozefest the single player is exactly what you expect from a gta game better than 4 i think i didnt like nico at allthe characters here are better i think though they did skip putting content in most of the northern towns the online part of the game however is justbad unless you have 3 other friends at least always with you theres no one around and when there is someone around they just blew you up i was literally blown up within 15 minutes of starting muliplayer never even saw who did it  the person blew up 56 people all at once probably hacking which from reading online seemscommon i spend tons of time loading and waiting in queues its boring as hell if you want gta singleplayer wait for a sale if you want gta onlinewell either you know something i dont or youre in for a snoozefest im going to say no on the game since the hiests in single player are just a hook to get you into multiplayer

this review is only for gta online long loading screens even with a ssd and a unstable netcode dampen the experience severly more than once me and my friends got disconnected from the server or couldnt see each other ingame or the game turned into a slideshow for the guy on passenger seat this was especially annoying during heists and ruined most of our fun rockstar had to two years to fix this issue

is one of the best games ever but i have to put a negative rockstar is letting cheaters in online game do a hell of a party there theres no way to play the game online without guys flying throwing money everywhere and more equipped than you and imortal

the game itself is a good gamehowever how rockstar are handling it makes it not worth buying with its drm systemsrequiring a social club account and one of the worst things is that theyre selling the game with a microtransationwhich from what ive been told means that you cant get a refund for it for a very small amount less then the game then marketting it as 25% off to try and trick people into buying it as its cheaperand appears to be really cheap as its 25% off so it cant get refunded if the customer doesnt like it if rockstar make it so there isnt the drm and if they dont try to milk customers for their money id recommend this gametill then this is staying as a negative review

tldr if you dont want to support a company that has a complete lack of respect for you as a consumer dont buy this game take a trip to tpb or something if you really want to play it yeah i went there rockstar doesnt respect you so why should you respect them okay so this game is really good when you can look past the crashes terrible anti cheating system lack of proper mod support and chincy sales tactics rockstar has been using lately as you can tell from my play time i got more than my moneys worth out of it great story great graphics great multiplayer etc they did a better job of porting it compared to the steaming pile of doodoo gtaiv was for a port however i refuse to give this game a recommendation until they at least mark the price down by a good 20 or even 50 percent this game is 3 years old i regret buying this game on the principle that i supported rockstar when i could have just as easily snagged it on tpb you really st the bed on this one rockstar screw you

this game was great when first released but has since been overrun with modding cheater holes it it literally impossible to join a server with more than 4 people and not have someone who is cheating i dont know if rockstar doesnt care or is just too incompetent to ban any of the hundreds of people i have reported but they are making absolutely no apparent progress in cleaning the online community

this game was fun when it was released i mean me and my friends had somes objectives we decided to play heist to get some money to buy cars and all that but the problem is that there is so many modders in game who gives money that the game have no objective now this main problem is not with easy money it more when modders start blowing me attaching object to me or freezing me this last week i didnt joined a freemode without a hacker or modder in it please rockstargames fix the game u work so hard to develop the game and now less than 1 month the game became sht for example the punishment that u give to a modder is not enough i juggest a permant ban or at least 2 months players will appreciate more the game after getting banned for that long period of time

as a big fan of the series i own most iterations and was going to buy gta5 eventually now that i did and fell for the summer sale instead of playing it i spent about 6 hours unsuccesfully trying to fix the game crashing on startup with a generic error message i basically tried every fix i could find online within legal bounds including downloading the game three different times and setting up a different windows version ticket to rockstar is sent but i dont expect much help this is the first game i couldnt get to run on my system even gta4 vanilla worked without any problems whatsoever will try to get a refund

multiplayer is pretty crappy and rockstar has to take a place among ubisoft and ea for worst game publishers out there they claim to put the game on sale while it still costs the full price only that it includes some multiplayer cash pack which is worthless anyway since the multiplayer takes ages to load even with 10010 internet singeplayer was fine though i didnt notice any critical gameplay bugs but the screen froze for me every 2030 seconds altough less than a second each time it did interfiere in my gameplay and i got killed several times because of this bug it could be related to my gpu but every other game works fine you would think that after 3 years of porting rockstar wouldve fixed all the bugs and they should have plenty of money already from console sales why bother putting it on a fake sale and doing all that very wierd bussiness practice the game just isnt worth 60$ i would get it when it goes up on a real sale

rockstar needs to step their  up this is a good game without the shadow of a doubt but hackers are on a massive incline and it seems r is more preoccupied with dlc and banning regular modders just yesterday they began selling the game in foreign countries lo and behold its unplayable now youll get into any online lobby lets admit it thats why were all here to find 45 level 500 players typically chinese or russian all these s will do is blow you up spam your character and give themselves money in god mode i havent been in a lobby with anyone that speaks english since even if they played legit they dont their ping alone makes the game impossible if im near any of them it takes me 10 seconds to get in a car and the physics freak out massively ie hitting another car and it doesnt move for 3 seconds or so this needs a region lock or youre on a fast track to a dead multiplayer also ban waves please i like in the past how they were rather generous with the money hacking a 2 week ban slap on the wrist but ffs its obvious these people are coming here to do nothing but grief in god mode perma ban these s at this moment in time if you want to get this game for multiplayer dont

i preordered this game but only making the review as of today the 18th of june 2015 to denounce rockstars obvious greedfilled motives on taking advantage of the steam summer sales and its effects to other people who have been waiting patiently for the sales scheme moreover expect to encounter several hackers at the very least 1 in each lobby dont expect them however to get banned when you report them for exploits which is the standard recommended way of reporting hackers as per the rockstar gta online how to report a hacker guidelines i personally had to send emails to gtaonlinebanhammer@rockstargamescom and follow up for up to 2 weeks before the perpetrators finally get reprimanded of course backed with evidence be it photographic or video i strongly urge all players to take advantage of the steam screenshot feature at the very least to combat the exploiters when spotted of course there will be the cowardly cheaters that ruin everyone elses fun who will hide and not commit the acts obviously simply because they are envious of others experience

people are being banned for singleplayer modding why did you even bother releasing on pc edit rockstar jacked up the price for the summer sale to make it look like a better sale good job rockstar we can all tell how greedy you are edit what they did wasnt exactly that what they did was they made bundles with shark cards and with games that arent selling ie the downgraded port of san andreas and price them $2 cheaper than the base price of gta v the base game of gtav isnt on sale just the bundles for $2 cheaper than base price thanks rockstar thanks for the appearance of added value with no actual value

ill review both single player and online since they are pretty much different games just shipped together the single player portion of gta v is great it gave us a variety of fun missions that were enjoyable to play through lots of activites and other things to do that made it feel like a classic game single player did have a few issues for me pretty much stuttering but it wasnt a huge deal i had a lot of fun when it comes to single player however the online for gta v is bad in my opinion rockstar doesnt fix a lot of the issues that people are complaining about also there is a good amount of hackers and lag when it comes to online which is very annoying plus rockstar is pushing us to buy shark cards simply because of how much of a grind it is to earn money at times and how expensive they are making items it seems to get more and more as updates go on overall the game gets a 7510 from me it is not worth $60 for a single player experience and definitely not worth that price if you are looking for a fun online game i do wish i could get a refund for this but i sunk a good amount of time into the single player so im not able to get it
not recommended
anyone else having the same ing problem with the online after the last update i cant get in online it keeps telling me that rockstar socialclubonline services are unavailable right now or it says that your save data could not be loaded this time but its just really nice to watch friends playing it and streaming while i cant get online i get in usually really really early in the morning just be4 i need to go to work and when my friends are playing this ing text keeps showing up and doenst let me play 210

single player is a solid 4 out of 5 and if the game is actually on sale unlike the current summer shadiness its worth it for that if youre a fan of the series online is actually getting worse over time adding free dlc is nice but not fixing the base issues with the game has resulted in an awful experience huge loading times tons of lag memory leaks unstable gpu performance every race having global records set by hackers and now its all but impossible to find a public lobby without hackers in it especially infuriating is that every 3rd mission online for me fails to reconnect afterwards leading to a long exit load then a single player load then online load again taking several minutes just in loading screens given how these problems persist and in some cases are actually getting worse im doubtful r is even going to bother fixing them and instead focus on their next title for a game thats done a billion dollars in sales thats pretty disappointing

game itself is fun but you wont be doing much of that as most of the time you spend loading and hoping the game doesnt crash my game crashes very often and even more commons are the errors while loading rockstars solution to these errors are wait for 4 hours and try again doesnt sound too good right rather spend your money on some other junk

played 400 hours on ps3 it was fun then now its just rockstar trying to force you to buy shark cards pros fun with friends meet new people online do whatever you want quite long singleplayer modsdont have them installed when you go online cons rockstar forcing us to buy shark cardsingame money everything is way to expensive terrible graphicsdont think it will look nice exept if you have a quad titan z orso loads of hackers the average scumbag gta player having to drive armoured kurumainsurgent if you dont want to be in passive mode really long startup time long loading for everything wierd fps drops you can get banned for recieving money and rockstar wont give a  to high minimum requirements small chance online wont even work for you conclusion only buy it if you havent played it on lastcurrent gen and only if you have multiple friends that have it to its funsometimesjk not really 210

do not buy this game until rockstar fixes the cheating and the modding every other server if not every server has someone on there using a mod or a cheat if you intend to play this game online you will hate it and want you rmoney back the game itself is awesome but there literally are cheaters on every server in online mode i have played many hours and the game is truly fantastic but you cannot play online in its current state as literally there are cheaters on every single session this will destroy the franchise save your money until they fix the cheaters

while the game is good the service for gta online is very poor the game regularly crashes the cloud servers are unavailable and you just are blocked from playing i find that very disappointing considering how long it has been out wait a couple more months maybe and perhaps then they will ahve the online side of things sorted the single player is fun with an interesting story but trevor is uncomfortable to play

the game itself is absolutely amazing if you have a good rig you should definitely pick it up unfortunately for me it has a lot of stuttering mostly in online but i did remove some of the stuttering by removing the ingame steam overlay i have got it to work sometimes where the framerate is 70 on high with an i72600k gtx 770 & 8 gb ram in singleplayer with barely any stuttering what so ever but the game has a life of itself that i have no control of amazing game that i sadly cant run too well edit 17th of april rockstar released a patch that fixed my game so all the stuttering is gone and the game works just fine now thanks rockstar 1010

this game and what it practices its an amazing story and quite a bit of fun but all of these good times are far removed when you run into the many issues this game entitles not being able to play if you have no internet connection is major flaw and i hope no future games ever hold this as law from now on i lost my internet connection for a week in this week i had no option to play this game offline it was manditory to play online with this feature it feels like we dont even own the game its more like we are renting it under their guidelines and paying full price for the game really pisses me off i spent 3 days enjoying this game fully to 3 weeks to disliking it immesnely to all those people who agree with this periodic entitlement verification i counter you with pirates   your entitlement you greedy pigs if you must own this game do it through pirates corperations have always wanted to limit you on your ability to take care of yourself because they dont believe in you well i believe in you and your power your voice this company is so large pirating their software would not effect them that much i do not endorse pirating too much because i believe if someone worked hard for something they do deserve a piece of the cake but this is going to far this is taking all the cake for themselves and not even thinking about sharing it with anyone im really not looking forward to these business models and its up to the people to endorse these actions or remove them from power how you say humans have the amazing ability to problem solve but we rely on others to do it for us we need to believe that our actions our voice has meaning and that it carries on further than we think games that practice this type of drm i say pirate from all these corperations the games that dont use these drms support them and donate if possible games are not meant to feel like work and this game tries really hard to make you work for it because it says im a really good ing game so bow down es and we actually bow but i believe its time we get our heads out of our asses and actually see what these corperations are doing to these wonderful games we are ment to escape our reality when jumping into a game not be faced with a corperate dance that you have to sacrifice a goat to please gaming gods in order to have a fun time games are supposed to create a sense of enjoyment a sense of wonderment but with these practices in place it sucks all the life from the enjoyment you are suppose to feel it feels like corperations are sucking out the soul of gaming and replacing it with a money making model instead perhaps that was the intention of corperations all along when they start to interfere with such an amazing story telling venue it removes it from the true purpose of gaming now all they intent to do is make money by any means when i bought this game i had to wonder why there was soooo many people writing negative reviews for this game on steam now i know why and i completely agree with majority of them on many different levels the story of this game is amazing the gameplay is fluid the mechanics are beyond anything ive experienced before but all these positives are completely overshadowed by these terrible drm practices limitations of when and where you get to play your game is a travesty as i said before it feels like i paid for a game that i dont entirely own they put you on a tight lease that is chocking the life out of you and your fun and they wonder whats wrong games like this are making me question every purchase from future game holders they are losing my trust and my faith at an alarming rate gaming should bring people closer together not seprate them through entitlement please be mindful of your purchases and be sure to express yourself when concerns arise we have the ability to say to our friends what a  practice this is if your friend needs to play a certain game hook him up let people play for free for a certain time to make sure they are happy with their purchases i love gaming and i love this type of entertainment but i dont like corperations taking advantage of our loves removing the soul of the game to make profit in abundance i guess thats just what governments and corperations are best known for sucking out the soul and leaving nothing behind but an emtpy shell a ghost with no purpose all for the sake of making a quick buck thanks for creating a ghost of a shell with no heart and soul your busniess model is paving the way for many corperations that love to suck lives from everything to have a chance at sucking out your life your love and your enjoyment good game rockstar good game society to all those who took the time to read this review understand that you have value that your actions have real repercussions on the gaming community as a whole community we are in the same boat as you and all we want is more freedom to choose a better road for all of us be mindful of which corperations are pushing these types of endorsements and try your best not to support any of these actions i know its really hard not to purchase one of your favorite game titles because its very difficult for me but when these practices are taking over the gaming industry we all need to band together like a brother in arms a sisterhood and a great loving gaming community to tell these people and demonstrate through our action that these will not be tolerated such a difficult thing to combat if we dont have a community that works together that shares a similar philosophy pardon my rant and thank you for taking the time to read this i know its a lot to read and digest but its something that i feel needs to be addressed live long as prosper and may the force always be strong in you stay gold pony boy

fun game with a few bugs to say the least my biggest issue with the game at this moment is that rockstar needs to focus less on banning people for single player mods and actually ban the hackers who are in every single freemode lobby that ive been in for the past month

the single player part is just like any other gta enough said the start up splash takes forever to wait through cant skip rockstar needs you to know you are playing a rockstar game and that it is just a game even though you already knew that then the game loads pretty snappy the online part is just the worst dont buy this game for online loading takes forever my machine i7 44ghz samsung ssds gtx 980 75mbps down  15mpbs up cable there isnt a single game other than gtav that i own that i cant load up and be playing in less than 515 seconds routinely takes me 12 minutes to connect and be set to play anything you do except playing in that session requires another load cycle of 12 miutes a quick accurate account of how your time is spent online 40% of your time loading at least 35% waiting for players if you do the heists 10% dealing with mic spamming cheaters 15% actually playing the game online no joke  i just got done playing for 2 hours and only spent 15 minutes actually playing to give you an idea of how cluseless rockstar is about online gaming if you try to join a heist session that is full you wait to connect sometimes quick then it tells you it is full then you wait to load into a different openworld session yes it logs you out of your current openworld session to check if the heist session you wanted to join is full if it is not full you end up waiting 1020 minutes for the invitefind players to find anyone who even wants to do heists anymore if it is full you wait 12 minutes while you reconnect to a completely different openworld session the record times in online races that would take a minimum of a minute or more are just a few seconds to 15 seconds rockstar doesnt care 3 out of 4 openworld sessions you log into contain blatant cheaters if you kill a cheater fairly they start teleporting bombs to all the players and killing everyone in the session like a little baby or they turn on all kinds of crazy weapons and just ruin you like being able to fire rockets from cars blow you up directly etc rockstar doesnt care you will run into more frustration than fun once you give up your money for this game rockstar doesnt care

if you dont already have a group of people to play with you know you can trust dont bother buying the game 90% of the playerbase is trolls who join a job just to make it impossible for the rest of your crew to complete it personally i was asked by like 8 people to buy this game so we could do heisting together so i bought it and now they dont feel like playing so im forced to play on my own playing on solo sessions because of hacked lobbies player killers racists or just the stereotypical 12year olds who appearently is better then everyone because they did your mother last night im not pleased this is only for online though singleplayer is decent i dont like the story in michaels case i would wish i could shoot jimmy in the head and just live my own life without his  if that was the case itd probably be at least 910 im gonna say i dont recommend it because i dont recommend it to you alone if you are alone dont if in a group yes please

this is for sure the best game for pc you dont even need the best pc to be able to play this game withc good graphics but of course we shouldnt play a game just for graphics but of course they matter a bit anyway not only the graphics are very good but the story is amazing this game is pretty much hundreds of funny hours only on the story and eventually if you want to try something new there is the mp from rockstar wich is like nothing i have ever seen before they pretty much combined the story with mp and it is amazing if you have other friends that have gta v you can be sure that you will have a very good time playing this game because the missions are good the heist amazing th physics are the best and of course all the challanges that can be done around the world of los santos and blaine county altho if you dont have much freetime i dont recommend getting this game cause once you enter it the time is just gonna fly you wont even observe this kinda sucks but still best game ever

single player is fantastic online is shocking first lobby i entered and i instantly blew up in my garage so many cheaters online you have to go into passive mode what is the point where is the anti cheat
not recommended
3mb of junk code just to confuse modders and cripple performance for singleplayer modders in order to try and somehow fix the online problems thank you for this amazing patch rockstar just means that i can save the hdd space with this game since you fail to understand that modding is a kinda big thing
not recommended
newest patch killed performance to the point where i get 2030 fps instead of 40  50 the game ing halfs in framerate when i use a ing mini gun rockshit also ed people over during the summer sale rockshit also discourages single player modding meaning that single player is limited in content and i cant play online because it is a pay 2 win grinding  i reccomend pirating the non updated version instead of supporting rockshit

i have played this game for a long time obviously i bought this game for the racing experience i thought it was interesting and it turned out to be amazing long before i bought the game for pc i was watching gun1t123 racing on youtube and that looked very cool i loved racing so far in this game but with every patch rockstar decreased the performance of gta v at least on my pc at first it used to work flawlessly the best performance i have ever seen on my pc slowly with patches i began to see my game locking at times when it was loading things from my hdd i thought that is normal and to be expected of a 5400 rpm hdd so i worked hard to fix that and i have so here we are now illgotten gains part 2 i cant do anything in the game because of the crippling lag theres no way to fix it hopelessly waiting for rockstar who probably knew they were doing this if they didnt they are stupid because they should qa every update if at any time before the illgotten gains part 2 update i would have wrote a review i would have recommended this game but right now no dont buy this piece of crap

hello ladies and gentlemen you would be expecting me to write a really positive review of this game of how glorious how fun and great trevor is this is all true but only in the single player game for the multiplayeri will just be blunt about it it is a waste of time and a pain to all players here is why the game is full of hackers on every server you go on you are nearly 100% guarentee to have a hacker who will just kill players with god mode on aiming assitance and also to change your characters model and spawn random models into the world they can also kill everyone in the world at once regardless of you being in a garage or your homeappartment nowhere is safe from these guys some of them are kind and will spawn you money but this ruins the online game as you want to earn that money fairly from the heist mode the servers are not monitored or moderated by rockstar at all it would be highly safe to assume that rockstar have no intent of monitoring or moderate their servers of hackers i will change my view and recommendation of this game when they have sorted out their failuring problem of hackers in the online game it has gotten to the point that i would want a refund of the game as it is unplayable with these people ruining our games with hacks

wow so people are getting banned for modding now well done rockstar one of the reasons i got this on pc considering i had it on ps4 was for mods and to have fun in singleplayer to be honest i want my money back and anyone else who has wasted 40 on this should demand a refund as like me youve most likely spent money on the console versions this is despicable i can understand banning mods in online but singleplayer wtf

i cannot recommend this game in its current state as you cannot play the single player campaign when steam runs in in offline mode i was able to play yesterday when when social club had server issues and switched to offline mode while steam ran in online mode but when steam is in offline mode gta v always refuses to launch as it cannot be verified by social club wether this was intended or not a feature that is identical to an aways online drm is never a good idea this needs to be adressed as the drm was preseted in several news articles before launch as only needing to be sometimes on

dont buy this game have fear to start the game becouse i use sweetfx to enhance graphics and correct bad performance aa of gta5 fstar bans players that use a computer to play you know pcs are magic they can do sit so we should ban everyone for having one  and knows how to use them to make their game better online mode  should be called sck our dck  mode because it shows that porting a game without using any intelligent oppurtunities to decrease loading times they make 70% of your online play time you load when you start for 35 minutes you load if you go somewhere 35 minutes you load if you want to start something 510 minutes  ow what you couldnt start a game because of some derp connection and derp matchmaking ow we sry you know what yep  here you have 10 minutes of loading  for not moving even one foot from the first 2 loading times till the third one bans players for accidentally getting in contact with other modders updates without any kind of patchnotes so you can only decide if you want to update by checking if someone else already whined about new crashes online mode  does not work matchmaking was programmed in cuba 1970 just stay alone forever no one can or want to help you online mode  you cant collect things you buy for you character like the eyelens you have want to try diffrent color  puffff  money away pay again 50 hours of loading times and band matchmaking to buy something that was your already

i was very happy when gta v came out i preordered it and was very excited to play heists with friends this didnt end up happening because of server issues but that wasnt the breaking point for me the big issue is that rockstar has been doing their very best to crack down on mods that only affect single player i do understand that rockstar wants to keep moddinghacking out of online mostly so they can sell shark cards curse you microtransactions but trying to limit modding on single player which is also a big part of why i bought it for pc is unacceptable if i could i would refund this the normal single player is good enough and sure online very fun but with rockstars crusade on modding also looking at you valve and the tremendous server issues ive encountered i cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone

wow wow and wow what can i say theres so many things this game has done right just spoton perfectly right its almost impossible for me to describe how good this game is however i want to focus on some of the flaws you can lash out at me if you want but im speaking in the perspective of convenience first of all the weapon wheel its perfect dont get me wrong i know the saying you can never have too much weapons but i personally find myself using the ap pistol more often than i do any other pistols  smgs the issue is this id much rather sell the weapons i dont need they take up quite a bit of time espicially online just to switch to sometimes if youre uncareful you might skip your weapon the same can be said while onfoot dont try to tell me that you should just switch to it before you do anything else ive heard it a million times if you want to argue about that then my argument is simply gta4 offers one weapon for each category one weapon is sometimes significantly better than the other in this case the mp5 gta4 vs micro smg youre going to pick up the mp5 over the micro smg you cant lie to me there the same can be said in gta5 for the ap pistol over the micro smg its all for the sake of convenience while this doesnt alter the gameplay for me to a big extent ive heard that people who have tasers  flareguns switch to that automatically in their car wat  think of it in online play i could care less about it in single player another thing id like to point out is a more slightly longerlarger fov slider the current fov doesnt make me nauseous but id like to tweak it there is a mod you can use but it changes the memory of the game and you can risk a ban from rockstar so lets not do that overall this game deserves your money dont let what i say make a difference to you its honestly not such a big deal its a very fast switch i just prefer the convenience to sell my unneeded weapons or select a preferred weapon heres hoping rockstar can deliver to that oh i forgot why cant i go into fast food restaurants anymore 1010 though really

im done with rockstar the game could be fun that is of course if you could play it online without dealing with hackers and cheaters no kidding every single server has people hacking its ridiculous especially when players can spend real money for ingame money but cant even play without constant hackers and cheaters dont spend a dime just play in a server and eventually youll probably have a hacker dumping thousands of money bags all over the place or nuking everyone on the server its a real shame because it could be a great game to top it off rockstar pulls this shady move with the summer sale that just shows me a lack of integrity sure a company can make profits but when youre one of the biggest releases and you increase the price so you can put it on sale and still get full retail for it thats disgraceful not only to the gaming fans who want to like the game but also to the human race in general

been gaming for 30 years and let me say if you ever get this masterpeice of a game on your computer make sure you get your coffee soda or tea before you do this game would even make goarge lucas creme in his pants this is by far one of the very best games ive ever played in the last 3 years im surprised how good this game is rockstar really put a lot of time and work into this game and it shows with the amount of things you can do in the game the customizations the outfits cloths aesthetic things you can do with your character and cars the races heists tennis biking piloting deathmatch teamdeath match gang wars player housing player garages  the list goes for on for n ever lol this is way better and more indepth then all the grand theft auto games ive ever played the online aspect is really really well done as well its very very rare that i ever find any good games these days because they seem like dumbed down simplfied kiddy game crap but this game is a masterpeice just like skyrim is is it worth what i paid 70$ canadian no no game is worth that but it certainly is worth the normal full price of most pc aaa games that are 50  60$ if you ever get this game on sale you will be laughing yourself all the way to the bank because this is probably one of the best games ever released this year so far no joke if you dont see the beauty in this game then you must need a psychiatrist because this game will be rated highly by angryjoe and all those other reveiwers as well 8510

grand theft auto enter the job as of 6212015 i can heartily recommend the singleplayer the multiplayer is not worth it however let me preface by saying i usually am very forgiving of buggy games i have braved skyrim oblivion and morrowinds bugs as if they are no issue i take great fun in many of them the caliber of gtao right now is akin to downloading 100 skyrim mods without reading anything before installing ignoring load order et all then trying to play the game let me also preface by saying that i have been on rockstars side for waiting on the game and for its overall good attempt i figure with its unique engine that it is impossible to flesh out the expanse of a game without some serious bug fixing however whether im on rockstars side or not ive come to a collected agreement that this game feels more like a job than a game 1 the hacking situation what do most people do in open world games but kill one another open world no need for any dayz need for survival have at ye except how many of these games do i get to kill someone before they retaliate through hacking or im already in a server with a beloved hacker since the update particularly the situation is so bad that there is a surplus of beggers ingame asking for the hackers to drop money theres been points where missiles are falling a split second behind each player in the game to where it feels like youre in fallujah im sure someone has a grand explanation for this im not entirely sure why rockstar isnt using valve anticheat i heard rockstar state that they would separate hackers whom were caught so that they could only play in rooms amongst one another the problem peaked that any sort of posting photographs and whatever is implemented is not working furthermore modders for single player are getting banned 2 drm the social club is a nightmare i see why its there since you can communicate crossplatform transfer characters etcetera it still has way too many hiccups ending up as something more clunky than steams inbrowser setup  by a long shot frequently and i mean every hour one of my friends ends up showing offline through the social club mind you these players showing up offline are all in the same house as me im sending invite after invite when my friends are showing up online did you get the text message nope i always resort to using steam for sending out invites 3 cell phone matchmaking short and sweet its a joke unless you have 3 or more friends playing consistently its unplayable to consistently find good games without a crew i dont know anyone that even listens to the text messages sent to other peoples phones its like looking at spam ive spent hours waiting for a player to join for a heist overall its a very unsociable game im sure this is different on consoles since more trolls are willing to use their microphones in short i dont blame rockstar for that however the difficulty of finding a good group for having people to screw around with in the open world back you up sorting a heist takes serious effort from the user in organizing despite all the waiting i heartily recommend people not playing without friends a crew or a canon of charisma and networking ability i have spent a significant quantity of time jaded by this one experience until i started going out to reddit forums google etcetera in finding good groups and crews im ranting here but everyone else i play with that communicates at all is all just on the job just like me the combination of waiting here and the joblike set up really interferes with the whole open world mentality toward approaching the game 4 disconnects crashes and loading and stuttering not sure where to start here id say a disconnect happens between 3 of us every 30 minutes a crash happens about every hour loading takes about 2 minutes average when starting up 1 minute joining to a new server sitting through matchmaking or worse hosting while no one joins because of a connection bug stuttering has become a more recent issue anyways do the math and see how it adds up as a note since initially playing i have changed around every component on my pc reinstalled gta v reinstalled windows checked every driver on my pc tried setting up alternate connections through lan wifi to the same results its sunday night and i have spent 12 of my game waiting debugging avoiding hackers among other things this includes friends computers to have patience with the game is a massive understatement its not one issue bringing the game down its the fact that im spending my day resetting my connection avoiding hackers dealing with the wait time from disconnects rejoining from crashes sitting through loading screens failed loading screens returning me toward single player resetting games anticipating different results like a job the game has become obstacle management at the moment im using 16gb of ram a 970 and an intel i7 from the last year since the beginning i see grand theft auto throwing money at players yet i cant help feeling like im at my cubicle spending every day contemplating quitting my job im looking over at the dirt bags whom dont work cheating hacking their way as if surfing upon the economical carpet floor im looking at the door for a while now i can just walk out the door but there is nothing like this game my friends need me here i sit around i toast in the air conditioned oven hours of waiting moments of fun hours of waiting i walk to the door and a million dollars is coming my way oh this will go toward retirement would not work for again

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
now first off this game was great to play on the pc it was well optimised had good graphics and was fun to play but a game published by a company that tries to exploit their players by claiming its on sale by making it more expensive should not even be rated above 50% rage intensifies you rockstar i used to like this game please make this the worst rated game on steam yes even worse than airport simulator rage ceases
not recommended
so how do i start hackers holy sheet there is a lot of hackers get ready to be teleported blown up along the entire session by a furious god watch you vehicle being blown up by someone using the power of his mind to fight immortal people to have a cow pig ufo and shark stuck in your head or body to lose all your weapons  to have all the weapons in game to be blown up again and last but not less important to watch a incredible guy shooting money bags on his machine gun or even start sheeting money on players all over the map cloud simulator 2015 youll love these long awesome loading screens single player mode the single player in the game feature the best game ever the story is rich gameplay is awesome very complete game a master piece the map is big and gorgeous there are so many things to do many to explore gta online extremely fun if playing with friends you can have fun playing with random people too but get ready for some very hostile encounters as you hear kids saying that they flocked your mother several times there are so many things to do so much laugh and frustration to take out of this game i would completely recommend this game to a friend apart of hackers and the rotten personality of most people who play this its one of the most awesome games out there

rockstar patched this game beyond broken not what i payed for when this game was released now you cant get a refund they added so much anticheat bs to the code it is unplayable they care more about selling shark cards  microtransactions than this game running well do not waste your money cracked retail release runs amazing though funny

first i used to have a gtx560ti and had to play the game on the smallest resolution with minimal settings it worked but after 2 hours of playing the game would stutter like mad decided to upgrade to a gtx970 and no matter what i play it on the game will stutter like crazy after 10 minutes my pc is clean temps are good theres no pointless  running in the background yet the game refuses to stay smooth after 10 minutes of playing every other demanding game can run almost maxed out still hard to recommend when a minority group like me suffers from this issue second is rockstars really strict anti modding stance i can understand mods would ruin multiplayer but how about just greying out the multiplayer option when someone mods the game in case the game files conflict or actually having proper mod support for singleplayer im honestly not really interested in the singleplayer and rather play online with friends but i do find it unfair some have to suffer being banned for it rockstar dont seem to be very fond of communicating with their playerbase

so this is what we waited 1 year for huh things like online connectivity issues hackers in online given a temporary ban only unbanned after 2 weeks among other things and worst of all arguably the best thing about gta v for pc is absolutely ruined if you use mods in single player only youre gonna get banned is this what we waited so long for online issues that shouldve been fixed already hackers only given a temporary ban and even going as far as getting banned for modding in single player and no not just the trainers even things as simple and harmless as fov mods in ing single player will get you banned and that is not even touching the other issues gta v has i expected gta v for pc to be glorious but instead we get a huge middlefinger from tar which is no real surprise since they do that alot to pc players but gta v has been the best example of that so far if tar doesnt fix this they wont get a single penny from me anymore and i will really enjoy pirating all their games from here on out
not recommended
starting off with cons because there are so many  rockstar banning people in gta online for using mods in singleplayer  bad optimization random fps  loads of gta online bugs there are so many i dont even want to type them all but they include computer bluescreens  not being able to tab back into the game  crashes  and many more  the devs are horrible they basically released us a game that could be considered in beta and charged 60$ for it  rockstar cares more about money than how good the game is finally for the pros i am 100% sure that i didnt cover all of the bad about gta v but i think i summed most of it up if i remember more i will add them in  big world with a lot to do in sp and mp  gta online is extremely fun when it isnt crashing and it can provide a lot of gameplay with a decent amount of replayability  the single player campaign is a nice playthrough that will last for about 12 hours of gameplay give or take depending on how fast you are and when you finish all the main missions you can still find other neat things to do  modding is going to be the best part about this game once modders start releasing new content for us and can provide gameplay almost infinitely but modding right now is kind of on hold for anyone who doesnt want to be banned for adding more fun to their game or fixing bugs that rockstar cant seem to do  single player random events one of the things i really love about this game is the random events that occur when just roaming around in sp overall i wouldnt recommend this game to someone until rockstar stops banning people for using mods once they fix that you still have to gamvble your money to see if the game runs well people with gtx 980s should tread carefully with this game because it seems rockstar has not tested their game on almost any video card and its pathetic thanks for reading

this game is absolutely fantastic its exactly what you might expect from a grand theft auto game and this pc version is certainly the best version the solo story is interesting and complex the inclusion of multiple characters adds depth both to the story and gameplay and there is plenty of side tracking to do in the new open world they provide but the online is a bit of a disappointment everything in the online experience is very expensive and gaining levels is a chore youll find yourself spending days upon days of finding shortcuts and exploits both to leveling and making money in a word its a grind but even if you dont want to take the time to advance in level and unlock more stuff for your character you can be content with just playing in the open servers or with your friends just messing around with the world around you but be warned the online community is crass and overwhelmed by a troll population the fun players with microphones are few and far between but even with all of the butthurt that comes your way playing this game at least there are mods the mods are what make the pc version worth buying as seen with gta 4  wait what they ban modders regardless of what type of mod they use well what about singleplayer mods  they ban those users too  well based on the fact that theyve limited the best part of having a game on the pc 310 would not buy twice again

my review is largely predicated on online since thats touted as the major feature of this game i will say that if you want to pick this game up solely on the strengths of sp you should by all means do so since i havent had this much fun with a gta since san andreas or vice city its certainly a far better port than iv was indeed if im just talking about single player it is a fantastic game each character has a great deal of personality and watching them interact with each other throughout the course of the story is amazing roaming around the city even after the story is complete is still enjoyable because there are all the fun sidequests or strangers and freaks as theyre known ingame collectibles and other things to get ahold of i will say that its irksome that its so difficult to get income particularly compared to san andreas where i was able to amass a nice fortune through silly horse betting but once you have money on hand its great to just tear around the city i wish online was anything like this fun but sadly the desire to monetize online with the shark cards means it will never be that way that being said online in and of itself is a wonderful concept i say this with a pinch of salt mostly because the times ive found it wonderful were when i was playing it alone  with no one else on the server as it is youre almost always relegated to playing it with other people which is terrible griefers abound whose sole purpose in life seems to be existing just to kill you blow up your vehicles and generally make themselves a complete ing inconvenience this is somehow less awful than when they start a heist with you because at least if they kill you you respawn if they play through almost an entire heist or setup only to quit 30 seconds from the ending with nary but a have fun doing this again just before they leave and force you to lose all your progress because you have to have every last ing slot full to play a heist for god knows what ing reason  you lose all your faith in humanity it is events like that that make you understand why god is dead god is dead because he killed himself because he realized what he thought were his finest creations were largely composed of the very worst examples of evil you could ever imagine were there the opportunity to simply do all of the content alone or with a carefully curated selection of my friends and nobody else online would be amazing as it is its a terrible festival of the very worst of humanity and it is only the fact that i really want to get through to pacific standard that keeps me returning to the game despite the fact that you cannot find a public group worth a damn because they fail given the slightest opportunity and when you do find said group invariably one of them will mock you and quit before the end sartre was right hell is other people and they all run around in los santos

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

great game honestly but bumping the price to 8000usd before the summer sale just to be able to say 25% off is a scum move

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

when the situation changes i will update this review accordingly modding is a big part of the pc experience gta 4 anyone and changing your policy post launch after you have all your sales is a practice i cannot reccomend apart from that the game is good fun and well optimised rating unfortunately has to stay negative due to the price hike right before the steam summer sale in an attempt to hoodwink customers cmon rockstar your game is good id have loved to give it a positive review

the fact that you dont have to listen to roman asking you to go bowling every few minutes should already be a good sign provided that you have a decent enough computer you should be able to run it quite nicely when the graphics are turned all the way up the game can really look amazing the controls can be a little wonky but youre free to rebind them to whatever key you want caps lock was the characters special ability button which was super annoying to reach but in terms of how it runs on pc i havent seen many glitches which is a really nice comparison to their 2008 release of gta iv

gta v yes i know i have given gta v a bad review but hear me out dont get me wrong i have enjoyed parts of this game but i believe the cons far outweigh the pros of this game pros lets start positive extremely enjoyable with friends wide array of things to do huge range of vehicles exciting missions and heists good creation system cons loading screens take forever everything online is far too expensive heists cost tons to set up and pay out little police in game are s civilians in game are s players are s n wods if you dont likenot good at racing you are screwed races ps&qs dont fully heal you p hydra are op npc phone calls creator never works blocks on enjoyment last 30 mins  1 hour joining servers stepping outside making money takes ages people rockstar dont give two $h1ts if the game is broken or not they literally do not care what anyone thinks about the game therefore there are many bugs and errors that are never fixed game is far too expensive basically the game is not worth the amount you pay i will continue to update this review with any other things i think about

i bought this game because i knew there will be tons of cool modslike in every gta too bad mods are banned i am furious right now i wont recommend to any of my friends because of that and for anyone who got the pc version and the console version should have their money back reverse engineer decompile disassemble display perform prepare derivative works based on or otherwise modify the software in whole or in part remove or modify any proprietary notices marks or labels contained on or within the software at short if you use mods you can be banned

voting down until r remove their heads from up their own  very unlikely but theres always hope that voting in numbers changes the minds in someway gta has allways had a thriving community for moding and this is what made waiting for the pc release fully worth it the ultimate experience where we can do what we want offline and not get banned for it speaking of online the service is awful laggy and at most times unplayable with more than 15 players because of network errors so please dont try sell us some  add ons to fill your pockets let the community have fun with your game there are thousands of games with steam workshop content look how great they are its the reason half life is still playable today if you want the game to last the test of time without having to release a new game every 5 mins heres the answer nobody wants to pay you for shark cards to buy stuff they would have gotten for free out of the kindness of the communities heart other than that the sp story is 910 if thats what you buy for thanks skyler

stay far away from this turd until its patched im running a decently strong rig i7 slied gtx 770s 16 gigs of ram ssd boot drive decently beefy however despite all this even on the lowest settings this piece of garbage that rockstar calls a game cant run for more than 10 minuetes any more without crashing it worked well for a while long enough for me to play through the campain at least but all of a sudden it crashes more than it runs theres already known issues with alttabbing causing memory leaks but im not even alttabbing when this happens the actuall game when it decides to play nice is fantastic but as it stands that doesnt matter if i cant play it because its such garbage as far as stability is concerned

this is a multiplayer review clearly hence the shark card comments the selling point of this game for me was the past examples of gta which allowed full modifications to the world cars pedestrians etc i even told friends whom purchased the game with me how it was so great and fun to do such things go figure they ban people now for even downloading one simple fix or modification i find the shark cards online storepurchases ranging from $500 to $10000 a bit intrusive on my gaming experience i want to buy a few cars upgrade them crash them roll them over do some stunts blow them up have fun with friends not run out of money midway through the game having fun and then have to be forced to purchase $5 worth of money from your store for a game i just paid $60 to purchase thats ridiculous i can see why people modified and ran cash drops ban in multiplayer for mods fine but single player too this purchase is the last rockstar product i made ill watch youtube videos to experience every other future release im done giving this company my money

its good but has some problems hate me if you wish while i was initially excited to get a chance to play gta v i will honestly admit that i met with some skepticism over the whole experience i will try to split this review into the singleplayer and multiplayer experience although there is some things that fall under both so i will put them in their own spot singleplayer gta games have always had a relatively decent story and this one is pretty good other than that it does fall to a lot clich characters and moments while the 3 main characters are colorful in their own right they all fall under a very distinctive stereotype whereas a lot of the story is extremely predictable i dont blame it on bad writing just over using clichs michael is your rich guy who is an alcoholic heavy smoker a crap husband and an even crappier dad franklin is the run of the mill black street gangster who enjoys all the typical stereotypical things like smoking weed running drugs stealing cars and speaking illiterately then you have trevor who is a psychotic meth head he has a sexual fetish with just about everything enjoys sporadically flipping his personalitydemeanor and likes to kill everyone over stupid stuff while trevor was an enjoyable character purely for his insanity factor it got old after the first few times he was on screen while the characters do interact well together and it has a neat mechanic of switching between them freely it is hard to look past their glaring stereotypes multiplayer the one thing gta iv became famous for and gta v tries to expand on it while the whole concept and sheer amount of things you can do is pretty great it doesnt matter if you cant connect or suffer from bugs at least 1 out of every 5 missions it seems to bug in some manner making it unfinishable there has been quite a few instances where my character is stuck and i cant even open the main menu to quit forcing me to altf4 to top it off i get a bad sport for quitting well i wouldnt have had to quit if it worked there has been quite a few instances where i was stuck connecting or loading into the world as well once again forcing me to altf4 and restart the game the load times feel like they are extremely long i do understand this is a large game but i do have a decent rig and i am only running it on medium which by all respects i should be able to run it on high i also have the game on a solid state drive regardless of that it still takes in the upwards of 2 minutes to load the world sometimes and yes i timed it raising your stats is great and gives a feeling of progression however in the free mode this can add a lot of imbalance people at higher levels have more health and access to much better equipment my first online session there was a wanted guy driving around in a tank killing everyone in typical gta fashion however there is a nice addition of the passive mode which lets you turn off pvp so other players cant hurt you you cant use your own weapons but it is worthy addition for those wanting to just hang around with friends without some jagoff blowing them up while they play golf heists are supposed to be the bread and butter of gta 5 online but i find them to be a real pain they feel more like a mmo raid where everyone expects you to brush up and know the entire thing before you even join the lobby this is partly due to the fact the game does a very very poor job of explaining the heist the ai is too busy blabbing nonsense over my cellphone and not explaining what i am supposed to be doing it is extremely frustrating and it ruins the fun of the game when you have to look up a guide of what to do because the game doesnt explain it some good things however  there is a lot of activities to do with your friends like tennis golf go to the movies street race play some darts etc you can get an apartment and a garage then invite your friends over to check it out its a pretty fun experience in the social aspect of things character creator is pretty fun as well while it is not as indepth as some games it is still varied enough to give you a chance to be unique this is due in part to all the clothing and outfits other stuff i will commend the gun play it feels really nice i do however find the weapon switching to be tedious as all heck you have to hold tab then move your mouse wheel around then if you have more than one type of that weapon you have to scroll the mouse wheel to cycle through them while continuing to hold the mouse in the direction of the weapon and holding tab it leads to a lot of frustration in the heat of a battle of course you can use the number keys but if you have more than one type of the weapon you have to do it the hard way this becomes a big problem when you get higher tiers of the guns because the lower tiers stay in your inventory which is extremely counterintuitive in my opinion one minor complaint is i have music turned off in the options but the radio still plays even though i have the default station set to off i generally do not like to listen to music while gaming so it irks me somewhat driving feels nice it is a gta game after all there is a lot of customizations on vehicles to boot so it shines there and is worth a mention closing while it is a fun game it has a lot of glaring issues to me that i feel need addressed it is like a guilty pleasure it keeps me wanting to play for sake that i might get some enjoyment but more often than not i am gritting my teeth and giving myself a migraine maybe once some of the broke multiplayer problems are fixed i can flip my thumb up but right now i cant too bad there isnt a neutral vote the main reason i give it a thumbs down is because the multiplayer is the big thing that keeps you playing and it is one of the main selling points i can overlook the clich characters and story mode as well as some of the other minor flaws i cant however overlook a haphazard network fiasco that wont let me play most of the time

this game while beautifully crafted and having a pretty great pc port i cannot reccommend due to the recent change in the eula that bans players regardless of if they are in singleplayer or multiplayer if they use mods if anything i would say that them changing the eula after they got so much money was probably on purpose and that is super shifty and if i could i would want a refund on the game

what an unbelievable piece of  really cool game cool cars cool weapons and rally nice quests and heist only problem is absolutely nothing works cant join friends cant play online for more than a couple of minutes before the sessions crash cant play heists or quests cause the gta online connection is lost every 5 mins a normal day of playing gta v with a friend consists of spending half an hour to just get in the same session and then in the same quest lobby then we start a quest and after 510mins i get booted from the session and have to waste another half an hour to back online if he invites me to a heist most of the time ill get a message that the session is full and that ill be sent back to the previous session which never happens instead i get a timeout and get thrown out of the online part ergo back to spending half an hour getting back in i honestly cant remember ever having played a game where the online part was more faulty that this my recommendation is do not buy the pc version of this game now this might sound as an angry rant but 5mins on the rockstar forums will show that hundreds if not thousands of players have the same problems and rockstar is doing  about it

firstly if i could give this game a neutral review i would i dont dislike the game enough to give it a negative but these are my views i bought this game in the hope that it would be amazing seeing as it took rockstar fck knows how many years to release it i was wrong it is good with friends however seeing as it is quite graphically thirsty many of my friends cannot get it as of now the game is heavily customizable when it comes to the graphics but youre going to need at least a 2gb card to even have a shot at getting any good frames and quality i run everything on ultra exept the terriagn quality which is on high yet i am getting like 30fps which isnt great and if i drop the quality anymore i may as well be playing the 360 its okay definately not worth the 40 price tag and all the hype however

its an amazing game yet it needs some patching once in every two or three hours i and my friends are heaving a memory leak and game freezes like 01 fps until restart i am using a laptop with two videocards so each time i start launcher it crashes unless i turn one of videocards off while it loads it is rather annoying optimization itself is pretty fine i wasnt sure that my laptop will handle this game but it does and speaking about actual game aside of these memory leaks and various issues with starting up the game  its grate i had little faith in gta series after iv being a boring trash but gtav learned on the mistakes of the previous chapter characters are more original and charismatic unlike in gtaiv where you had to do 5 missions between every story mission each task in gtav makes sense and does not feel boring at all downsides in gta online dozens of glitches and bugs that are both annoying and even game breaking but what is most important and frustrating is loading times and amount of these said loading times after almost every action you have to stare at the loading screen from 15 to 60 seconds example 1 remember like i said  each loading is bout 30 seconds join online > loading > failed to connect > loading > join online > loading > joined but friends are in another world > first option join friends > loading > a lot of players in here do you want to wait in queue > no > loading second option join friends > do you want to wait in queue > ok fine > loading > you spawn in some game world that is different from your first one for a duration of queue > loading > joined friends example 2 join heist > loading > joined heist lobby leader is starting the heist in 10 seconds > one of party members left the lobby > disconnecting > loading example 3 join random heistjob > loading > you dont want to do that particualr thing > leave > loading

man this awesome i already had excepted that i had to play this game on lowmedium settings on my gaming laptop but this game runs smooth as f$ on pretty much high settings just once in a while while driving it gets stuttery because of loading i guess and probably my rigs fault this is surely the best gta version out there seems like i will have to call in sick for the next few months d

i knew rockstar would  this up somehow banned for using singleplayer mods edit apparently they fixed the mods for singleplayer i would tread lightly though
not recommended
honestly i cant really recommend this as it crashes far to often whenever you try to do a job or when it tries to load something
not recommended
this is a ridiculously good port enough said the game runs at a buttery smooth 60 fps with high settings on my 15 year old laptop with a relatively outdated gt750m sli graphics configuration i never even hoped that it would run well on high settings the game looks astonishing and the frame rate is very stable unlike many other ports such as gta iv and far cry3 i dont get the people who are claiming that this is a bad port nb make sure to get the nvidia gta v driver update before playing this dramatically increases the fps especially for sli configurations
recommended
yes 60 fps and better graphicsmind you they are barely anything better than ps4 graphics but the main  reason i bought this game was for mods when you already have completed a game dont you just want to just become an immortal pig and cause mass chaos well with mods you could but nooooo that hurts rockstar too mutch to be able to use a game the way you want to  you rockstar
not recommended
do not buy unless you want to risk getting banned if you somehow and inadvertantly edit or modify any of the gamefiles rockstar will ban you for an unspecified time the game is great but the risk of getting banned for any shady reason is not worth 60

the online game you know half of the 60 dollars you paid for is just not worth it its very void of things to do in the open world so you have to do terrible minigames on the side that are just annoying to play singleplayer is the better aspect of the game and its all i play it for anymore

not recommended
well it is a great game lots of time and effort has been put into it the main issue is the fact that i was banned from playing multiplayer because i used mods in singleplayer i pay full price for a game that i already own on a console just so i could play with mods many others bought this game a second or even third time for mods and we are being punished for paying rockstar seriously rockstar mods have been the biggest selling point for pc games for years get dont discourage people who are making mods which ends up on youtube with thousands of views thats gonna get you more sales right kind of a waste of money for me i have 60gb worth of a game and i can use about 40gb of it

i tired so hard to like this game but i dont the graphics are the only thing good about this game it crashes all the timetried on multiple pcs with good high end hardware the community of people that play this game sucks the combat is so horrible hiding behind objects usually takes 5 seconds of running in circles before you actually take cover the default keybidnings are terrbile you will need to change them the racing is horribe rather all the match making all together is terrrible the care control like crap and is more like bumper cars rather than a race furthermore if you are trying to get any upgrades on your car expect it to take you a very very long time you need to win races of that class out of 830 people and even if you get 2nd place it will not count towards an upgrade at all terrible system also the heists suck you and several players are put on a heist but you arent in the world you are put in an instance same with the races and everything else the only purpose the open world serves is to be a  overall

this game is in full color im not even kidding not just the base colors but every combination of color you would expect were talking everything from dark slate gray to hot pink folks as if color wasnt enough these geniuses found a way to include sound like a lot of sounds ever wanted to hear a footstep the sound of glass bottle nudged by someone walking by now you can hear it all color and sound this would be enough to make any game a winner but they didnt stop there this game uses the alphabet and numbers thats right every letter your used to seeing in upper and lower case numbers and even punctuation the amount of type in this game is stunning and youll spend all day reading to your hearts content i think its pretty clear that we have the building blocks for an amazing game here so expect to be blown away by the experience

gta five is a game in which you can do things that mimic real life for instance you can play tennis or ride a bike or drive a car the game heavily encourages players to partake in a number of criminal activities such as gang turf wars and robbing convenience stores however i have found it personally rewarding making my money legally like winning car and parachute races no matter what kind of lifestyle you choose gta five has got you covered 1010 avoid this game at all costs if you dont like wonderful things

this game is great i enjoyed the story and the truely accurate portrayal of a typical canadian gentlemen the multiplayer is great as well a few hiccups but nothing game breaking multiplayer and singleplayer all run great good frames per second the only complaint i have is that joysticks are not supported gamepads are though definitely buy this game its fun multiplayer and the singleplayer is hilarious system specs amd fxtm8350 eightcore processor 400 ghz 16 gigs ram 2 gig 660 ti geforce 1000 watt power supply western digital 2 terabye hybrid drive win 7 64bit black edition some other crap game runs great

hands down the best online interaction ever think of all the gta combined apb reloaded dayz free roam ranking leveling upgrading payday 2 arcade style need for speed racing and much more freeroam you kill other actual players but doing so will give you a bad rep and stick you in bad rep games like low priority in dota 2 an rpg of all criminals this game is the best there is currently

very well optimized even for old toaster setups 1680x1050 with a gtx 660ti and a i7 920 cpu at the stock 26ghz has no issues maintaining 5060fps in every area ive been to so far most settings medium to high there was some pretty glaring stutter at the auto graphics settings but reducing soft shadow quality fixed it population density is still nearly maxed out and the world feels alive because of it rockstar was wise to take their time with the pc release they definitely didnt want a rehash of the gta 4 release fiasco so if your specs are greater than mine listed above you should have no issues running the game at high settings its just as fun as it was the day i brought it home on the 360  only this time its even better

ive already played this game on console so the hours played are not correct with that said the game is way different from console i mean it is the same game but it feels and plays much better i max out the game and rarely get below 60 fps if i ever do i get like 55 fps not a big deal so rockstar did a great job porting the game it seems people are having issues logging in to the social club i never had that problem my friend did though his steam name had a dot at the end name once he removed that dot he was able to log in it has something to do with the social club not working with certain symbols the game the story is crazy and filled with even crazier people the longer you get through the game the more fun it becomes i love the characters though i think rockstar did a much better job in red dead redemption when it comes to personalities the world is filled with stuff to do so you will never be bored if you somehow get bored theres always the multiplayer ive not tried it yet on pc but i can say the console version had a ton of variety in community made maps and game modes i am sure the creativity of the pc gamers will outdo what has already been done

is it optimized yes does it run at 60fps yes does mouse and keyboard work well with it yes does it look good yes does it look better then console version yes i played it on xbox one earlier today and i notice the difference in some areas moreso then others does it look 10x better then console does it look better overall indeed it does did rockstar have enough servers to make gta 5 playable online at launch no kinda didnt surprise me anyways was it worth the wait for the pc version if you already owned a xbox one or ps4 version thats up for debate im undecided i dont write reviews often games cause i suck at writing them anyways if you havent owned gta 5 its a must have to own especially on pc if you dont have a very good gaming pc but already own a xbox one and or ps4 but are thinking about trying the pc version you can if you want but it wont be worth it in my opinion benchmarks will follow specs i5 4670k 34ghx oc to 44 ghz 16gb of corsair ddr3 1600mhz gtx 970 g1 gamining edition anyways theres the most important specs i maxxed out the game at 1080p using very high and ultra settings when possible with 8x msaa then theres the option of 4xmsaa with txaa i tried both the second option used a little less gpu ram and looked same as first option in my opinion and ran the benchmark mimumum fps was 26 max was 60 vsync was on and it uses 3764mb of the 4096 mb of availible video ram mind you thats everything up even in advanced settings so heres the wrap up 60fps nice its very well optimized mouse and keyboard are great and work good even for driving its a definite graphical improvement sometimes more noticeable then others but dont expect it to be mind blowing difference if you played ps4 or xbox one overall 910 hype made it lose one point same with gta online not workingwhich was partially expected disclaimer i am candian and trevor doesnt represent canadians lol ps this is my opinion your milage with the game may vary edited alot of people are having widespread issues with game not working from what i heard people that have it threw steam are having no issues for the most part people who got it threw rockstar warehouse are having issues for the most part so i hope there issues get fixed and whoever buys it doesnt have those issues just a warning

this is a good game but i find it difficult to play it for many hours due to me already playing on xbox 360 when it was originally released for the console its very similar to the xbox one and ps4 release apart from obviously 60 fps frames per second and better graphics i can tell a difference in the graphics and the game looks incredible and isnt very demanding which is good the game suffers from a large about of bugs due to the new and recent release but nothing that cant be fixed it honestly sucks that we had to wait just under 2 years for the pc port and its still full of irritating and game breaking bugs which effect the overall game experience but putting that aside  by the far the best gta in the series imo and a good port apart from the bugs i recommend this game to any gta fan and anybody who wants to experience an unrealistic machine gun town 3rd person1st person shooter

rockstar did a great job i wouldnt even call this a port from consoles just an entirely new version of the game i am able to run it with a 3770k  gtx780 at 4k and get 5060fps maxed out i enabled sli for my second gtx 780 and i am running at over 100fps 90144 with both cards the first person mode  drunk is amazing when driving because you actually get the holy  im about to  up moment but overall i have only crashed one time due to driver issues but so far so good r is one of the few game developers who still actually give a crap about pc and the optimization in this game running at 4k is amazing all other game developers should feel shamed

i want to first say well done rockstar what a great game you have made for pc everything about gta v for pc is amazing the graphics the story and support for widescreen displays as im using a nvidia surround setup it really is very well optimized i have not had an issue as many other people have which is fortunate hopefully that will be fixed soon again thank you for making a great pc release and not a reproduction of what gta iv was

an utterly fantastic and monumental achievement  a huge landscape that faithfully recreates and improves on gta san andreas and scope characters and gameplay that outdo every game beforehand ive found it to be a great pc port although there are some that have had some issues starting the game but once youre in it plays very well all things considered make no mistake though theyve made this game customisable for all rigs and running this on absolute max settings requires a beast of a computer in order to get a steady 60fps you will have to tinker with the many many graphics options as well as perhaps sacrifice quality in some areas in order to get a relatively steady frame rate and hitching and dropped frames are common if your settings are too high given that there are so many diverse areas with many different levels of complex objects to render but that being said in my opinion its by far the best of the gta games and it seems the most suited to pc in terms of the quality of the upgrade from console to pc versions and the sheer amount of options regarding visual fidelity available the attention to detail is stunning and finding little things like where to shoot a vehicle to make it leak gas is so much fun on top of this gta online is wellpopulated and balanced and really really fun when you get a good team of people working together an absolute mustown

 singleplayer review  i have played gta 5 for 15 years now on ps3 since its release on ps3 i had to wait a while before we could go on gta online so in the meantime i finished singleplayer in the first 23 days so far its the best most enjoyable crazy wack insane overthetop mindblowing and most importantly most fun i have ever had playing singleplayer once it came out on nextgen consoles i was jealous of the advantages they had but now that i have played about half of the story so far on pc my jealousy was all for nothing it feels like im playing a completely different game again from the start while ive started singleplayer over about 6 times and finished it 2 times its everything i mentioned before times 10 keep in mind i play with vsync on and get around 5060 fps with 1920x1080 and on directx10 after upgrading my pc who knows what this game will be like even thinking about that gives me chills and makes me wanna work harder to earn money faster to upgrade my pc but till then i am already experiencing bliss over and over again everytime i start this game up and play the story again while typing this im cracking the biggest smile and chills are running down my spine so enough of typing and off to playing 1010

gta five is a game in which you can do things that mimic real life for instance you can play tennis or ride a bike or drive a car the game heavily encourages players to partake in a number of criminal activities such as gang turf wars and robbing convenience stores however i have found it personally rewarding making my money legally like winning car and parachute races no matter what kind of lifestyle you choose gta five has got you covered 1010 avoid this game at all costs if you dont like wonderful things

i delayed my review because i didnt want to review a game which i had only played for a few hours this is all my opinion and experiences with the game others may differ 1 performance in my 40 hours of playing the game at max settings with a evga geforce gtx 980 sc i have been able to run at 60 fps with drops to 50 every once in a while when either in the middle of the city or around some parts of trevors area if i were to lower some settings which i have tested i would have a constant 60 fps however the drops dont bother me that much other people have had issues with performance with the game and to my knowledge it seems to be random and not a certain combination between hardware the only problem i have had with the games performance was crashing now and then which has since been fixed for me in the latest patch 2 graphics the game is beautiful the detail in the game is amazing in my opinion i have had issues with textures loading slowly roads becoming invisible and textures popping in but this will hopefully be fixed in future patches and luckily it doesnt happen that often for me to get frustrated with it overall the graphics are great and this is how gta should look 3 controls this game has amazing kbm optimization since it was launched on tuesday i have had my xbox 360 controller plugged in and next to my keyboard and since then i have picked it up once and that was when i was doing a mission where i had to fly and i didnt have time to learn the controls since then i have learnt all of the controls for flying driving and walking and they feel great people are complaining with the controls for flying with the numpad but i think it works great yeah its not as good as games like battlefield but it is playable and there is always the option to have the xbox controller plugged in and you can pick it up and start using it without having to change any settings 4 online this is probably where most people will get gametime out of after completing the singleplayer there is so much to do in the online that gives even more hours the online is great there is text and voice chat for in the lobbies and when youre doing missions and heists i didnt play gta iv online so i dont know if that had this but the sound quality for voice chat is very good and you can change settings which lowers the game volume when someone speaks which is very helpful missions and heists are in my opinion the best part of online the heists are fun yet hard there are many elite challenges to complete to get bonus cash from heists which gives a lot of replayability rockstar have implemented the singleplayer characters you meet into online to give you missions to do for cash and rp exp there are so many things to buy online that it would probably take quite a while to build up the cash to buy them all the bonus cash for preordering was definitely a big help for me overall i think online is probably the most appealing part of gta v for some people and i would personally spend 40 just for gta online 5 singleplayer i will update this when i have fully complete the singleplayer in my opinion gta v on pc is the way it is meant to be played 60 fps great graphics great kbm support and mods in the future if you are on the fence of buying this i recommend it many friends have asked me if it is worth it and i have said  if you are someone who buys one game a year this should be that one game 1010

its gta 5 on pc do i have to say much more the port is for the most part very solid even though some users seem to have crashing issues at the moment the only thing that may keep you from buying this game may be the incredibly high pricetag of 60 it is a very good pc port and a really really good game aswell so much so that i would consider it goty its still a lot for a 2 year old game a new radio station an editor better framerate and slightly improved graphics but if that doesnt stop you and you havent yet played it go right ahead
recommended
from a person who havent played gta 5 on any console this is a lovely game single player 20% into the story and its lovely the story is really fun interesting and the gameplay feels very smooth i have had some bugs in the game  that some gaming mechanics is bad for eg jumping over obstacle climb ladders the graphic is really the biggest imrovement from the prev game and its a joy to shoot drive or just observe the game multiplayer you start of with a lot of features getting appartments garage vehicles etc which is great however after a few hours of gaming i realise that only heist freeroam races seems to be the most popular modes i miss the cops and crooks more fun modes please the loadingconnection in multiplayer is quite rubbish biggest downside i never think any game deserve 1010 but some are close to gta 5 well the single player is really good 910 so far multiplayer couldve been better a lot of loading time and not many crazy fun modes as i had expected 610

this is a great pc game its not a port rockstar actually made gta for the pc thats why it took so long first person mode da best

grand theft auto 5 well first of all its a brilliant game even for being two years old on the consoles its definatley worth the purchase if you have a couple of friends too this game becomes too fun i have spent too many hours laughing really hard that my jaw starts to ache so yes i highly recommend this game so the downsides to gta v on the pc that i have found so far unexpected game crashes  yes i have the latest drivers random fps drops that could be just me but for some reason my game runs at a nice and steady framerate then all of a sudden drops to 13 for like 4 seconds and then straight back to normal final bad point that i can think of the servers even though a couple of my mates and myself have a decent connection we still find that they are bouncing all over the roads when doing races the same for ai traffic too overall i rate this game a 810 and would highly recommend buying this game
recommended
even though this game still beholds many issues that i cannot even begin to explain which is as atleast more optimized than the pre  beta version on xbox and ps3 which of course the problems must be fixed i just have to say the most helpful statement ever it was worth the weight

theres always been this kind of unspoken respect and liking of rockstar as a company not just a game producer i was never on the bandwagon however i did rely on them in the back of my mind to keep being this awesome friendly respectable and unique company who appreciated their community and wanted them to be happy however after releasing the game fdor pc over a year late they do not allow pc players to play the game at a higher quality than console  they nurf the graphics and scope of the game they offer us less content than there is on consoles and yet still ask for full price on top of this they proceed to take one of the few last advantages which players who go out there and buy good pcs expecting to get more out of their gaming experiece rely on  modding  then proceed to try their hardest to stamp it out of both single player and online pc gamers are not console gamers we will not stand for this no matter how much rockstar attempts to change the code and lock us out  we will get in on top of that considering rockstar seems too ignorant to see the longerlife and increased sales that mods earn their games  notably gta iv which earneed years of extra life and purchases due to the great modding scene  thjey make the shortsighted decisions to try and block players from creating and sharing their own content for thae game  no doubt so they are forced to buy it from rockstar since rockstar seems to have decided to take a stance of ignorance and insulting policy  banning people from content they have purchased i know that i along with hundreds of thousands of others will never purchase another rockstar game unless these policices and attitutes cease we shall procede to pirate all copies of future rockstar content and play them for free to leave this corportation  which is abandoning the fans that turned it from a worthless pimple on the gaming scene into a giant  out of pocket it is a shame but as i said pc gamers are not console gamers we will not accept rockstar acting like ea if you have not yet purchased this game and are reading my review out of the thousands of negative ones i urge you  do not buy this game pirate it pirate every game this company makes rockstar this will never be forgotten your image shall forever be stained by your greed and ignorance

after 60 hours of playing through the single player campaign and the multiplayer i would recommend getting this game on pc and here is why perfomance and optimization firstly im gonna talk about performance and optimization for this game i remember picking up a copy of gta iv when it was finally released for pc good luck trying to get that to run higher than medium at the time on a decent rig after numerous patches they kinda fixed the framerate issues to that game this time around rockstar actually learned their lesson from gta iv and hired a team of people dedicated to working on the pc version of their games it really shows with gta v the current rig im playing this game on is a gtx 770 2gb vram and i can run everything at highultra at 1080p 60fps rockstar added a ton of graphical options to the graphics settings that you can tweak around with to get the game to look great and run nicely on your rig and if you have no idea if a certain setting will impact the perfomance of the game they do have a video memory slider that shows how much memory the game is going to use of your graphics card if you are clueless at all about how to optimize your game if you are running an older rig i would look at this video it actually goes into detail about what each setting does and which settings you should adjust and why click here one thing i do want to mention is the loading times those are a kind of a turn off especially when you are trying to load the multiplayer they take quite a long time and i have no idea if they are ever going to fix that but its quite annoying when you load into multiplayer boot up a heist with friends then load the heist do said heist then have to sit in a loading screen to load back into the multiplayer again loading times on average take about a minute and a half and thats the multiplayer the single players loading times for me seem to load a bit faster than the multiplayers single player campaign no spoilers i actually held off on playing this game on console because i wanted to experience everything the game had to offer on the pc the story features 3 characters that you can switch through to do story missions or whatever you want i mean it is an open world sandbox game the story was interesting and trevor and michael were fantastic seeing the struggles they both go through with each other or with family and friends kept me interested and the voice acting was top notch you may ask well you never mentioned franklin what about him honestly unless i was super tired when playing the game as franklin his character was a little lackluster he also had very few story missions compared to trevor and michael that made me not have a stronger connection to his character and when i did do the missions he just didnt seem that interesting to me overall the story between the 3 characters is really well done and very interesting multiplayergrand theft auto online multiplayer is a giant open world sandbox where you can pretty much do anything you want with random people online or friends you can go do team deathmatch or racing or parachuting or even golfing now after a while these do get boring really quickly and repetitive rockstar added heists to the multiplayer which actually spice up the game quite a bit think payday 2 but where its actually a lot better and more fun than payday 2 ive only played 4 heists in the game so far with friends but i will say that it will keep you entertained and test your friendship especially if you put the difficulty setting to hard and you only have one chance otherwise if you die you have to start all over again the multiplayer has that huge grindfest where if you want to be a certain level you need to do a ton of grinding in deathmatchracingetc since they added heists to this game those actually give you a pretty big boost in xp but still tons of grinding now i should mention that there are a ton of bugsglitches in the multiplayer one of the biggest ones i can think of is when you are doing a heist and you fail the mission and the game reloads the mission you are stuck looking at your character and the screen is frozen but you can hear the game still going on in the background and if you move your mouse you can even see the map rotating but the rest of the screen is frozen the fix to this is altenter twice to put the game in fullscreen then back to borderless windowed mode myself and a lot of my friends have had this problem and it gets kind of annoying everytime you have to do that fix rockstar editor now ive read a lot of steam reviews for this game and even looked online and nobody has given a detailed description or even a review of the editor that rockstar added to the game i messed around with it for about 20 minutes and it was enough to understand how it works and what my pros and cons with it are at first i couldnt even find the damn editor but basically you need to go into the single player first then go to the pause screen scroll all the way to the right until you get to the editor once in you find that you can edit clips taken in game and a director mode where you choose any characteranimal you want to be you can change the the time of day the weather if you want to be invincible whether you can get a wanted rating or not if you can fly there are a ton of settings here that you can adjust so you can load into the single player world with said characteranimal of your choice and start making a movie now i kinda had a different idea of how the editor was going to work i thought it was going to be a more user friendly source film maker but i was wrong you just either record a clip in single playermultiplayer or the director mode i was really hoping you could add multiple actors to one scene and make a movie or some kind of machinima thing now someone can correct me if im wrong keep in mind i did only dabble with the editor for about 20 minutes and it was just to make a quick video to get the achievement in the game what i did do with the editor is go into single player load up michael went to the airport stole a plane while the cops were chasing me and flew it away i told the game to record my clip and the game splits each clip into about 1 minute segments once you feel you have good footage you stop recording then go to the rockstar editor in the editor there are options to add a clip from the clips the game recorded for you add music add text to a scene save the work you have done and export the video so you can upload it to youtube when you add a clip you can edit the clip by manipulating the camera now with the camera you cant have the camera too far away from your character which kind of sucks so in my clip i edited i just had the camera kind of rotate around the plane i was flying what i really wanted was to show the cop cars chasing me but the editor kind of freaks out and goes back to following the player actor now you can add music to your clip and off course my first thought was im flying in a plane from the cops of course im gonna use danger zone even if im not in a jet nope i dont know if its a copyright thing but they dont have every single song from the radio in the editor when you go to the rock station that you hear danger zone on in the games radio it only had about 6 songs and danger zone was not in the list which kind of disappointed me overall id say the editor is a decent tool for people who want to make movies or just some kind of machinima looking video but dont expect something super detailed and in depth also if youre looking to add a song that you liked from the game dont get your hopes up yet as to how they dont have every song added heres the clip i made

grand theft auto v is the ingaround simulator of 2013 theres a lot of ingaround simulators set in sandboxes but theres none quite with the same hallowed recognition and flair that grand theft auto possesses its unevenly designed see the ing ui re it being garbage beyond figuring out waypoints padded as  to fill out a 40hour game time thats only if you do the main missions and little else in between and the game itself feels welldetailed and alive and somehow at the same time feeling like computer people existing in a computer environment now that its 2015 its finally out on the pc and it has new content for its multiplayer platform unfortunately for rockstar i dont give a  about grand theft autos multiplayer mode if i wanted to play a multiplayer grand theft auto id just buy a box of surplus grenades from my local neonazi and huck them at passing cars during rush hour despite the tonguelashing i gave the game i like grand theft auto 5 i like it a  of a lot more than i liked grand theft auto 4 which managed to tap me out through a combination of awful writing ancillary  and not being able to shoot roman in the face when he begs me to take him bowling oh dont worry  there is so much ing around you can do here from golf to taxi driving to underwater deep sea diving to fighting with other s on the steam discussion forums on whether claude speed is still canon in gta or not but if you want to just dig deep into the miserable lives of three s looking for scratch so you can get into all the awesome multistage heists to pull off for sweet dollars and sweeter gamer cred you can do that too and ignore everything else now that ive validated your opinion on this video game i am going to say mean things about the writing if you dont care about the writing of grand theft auto please do not reveal the spoiler tag pretend im talking about cheeseburgers or something i think the writing of gta 5 is highly uneven sure rockstar are taking bold leaps forward by having three main characters with wildly different lifestyles and circles of friends and that is something to applaud i want to see rockstar do some wiretype  with many main characters but they have to overcome their hurdles first i think largely i was tired of gta 5s satirization because i know what theyre getting at i just dont find it funny anymore and it think it has more to do with haha lol political satire rofl topical humor  and  rofl than it has to do with the lack of attempt of actual satirization the game is kind of really misogynist and i dont know whether thats an intentional choice or whether it escaped the glaucomaridden panopticon of satire that the writers tried to create im betting on the latter the torture mission sucked and i told the game to go  itself when it was over the main characters are fun and occasionally have actual human emotional moments but their characters kind of fall apart towards the middle part of the game and are driven by the overwritten 80s action movie plot that you can either wrap up neatly or not its all shoddy writing masked by excellent world detail and voice acting performances and i hope rockstar ups their writing game for the next time around anyway bacon cheddar burgers are delicious you should go buy one

great game better than console thats for sure

havent crashed the game works perfectly and its purely awesome
recommended
at the point of this writing i have put over 32 hours into this game so far i have only completed about 3032% of the single player and i havent touched the multi player as of yet the game is so much fun its insane the music and talk programs grab my attention so much that all i do is ride around on motorcycles and listen to them they are a few minor issues like random frame drops but they are more annoying than game breaking this is a great port i highly recommend buying this game 810 ps give my bro trevor some love too just like franklin
recommended
if you had the grand theft auto v launcher has stopped working bug a recent patch has fixed it game works for me now good pc port if youre hoping for a decent online community though you wont find it here people will shoot at you randomly and run over you and call you racial slurs but you can turn on passive mode to prevent them from doing that the first two things anyway theyll still call you racial slurs but whenever you have passive mode on you cant even pull out your guns to rob stores and theres not much to do in the game besides heists but the core designs of the heists are really  your team only has one life if two people die in the heist ever you have to restart and for all the heists after the first one you need four people so unless you have three friends who must be good at the game mind you or else youll keep failing youre stuck with pubbies that will usually screw up badly

ive already completed the story and reached level 67 online on xbox360 what i can tell you now is that the pc is a definate improvement ill be updating this review as i see fit but for now here are some reasons you shouldshouldnt buy the game pros  excellent optimisation dont listen to the other guys with low fps and crashing i have exceptionally low specs and run 60fps  looks amazing like best graphics ive seen for real  cool story  fun gameplay  endless playability  gta online is the center of some of my best gaming memories  custom radio stations omg  you can plug xbox wired controllers or wireless if you have an adapter in on the fly no restarts no settings it just happens perfect for getting in a car pushing the usb in and not getting a scratch because you can actually drive the bloody thing  first person is pretty cool cons  this game is huge 591gb to download if you cant handle it dont do it  some of the online players are s to say the least  dlc is pretty hefty  terrible driving without a controller but what did you expect  first person while it is cool gets old dont spend money on the pc version just for the first person feature especially if you own it on ps3 or xbox360 already you will be dissapointed  ill admit the launch wasnt fantastic

this is exactly what ive been waiting for for the past 2 years ever since gta v was released for console back in 2013 this game is well optimized feels responsive and runs like butter im currently playing on a 3 year old gaming desktop with a gtx570 6gbs of ram and an intel i7 quadcore 960 on a 144hz monitor with vsync turned on and its locked and runs constantly on that framerate with the exception that it dips down a little bit when theres a bit to much happening on the screen at once currently running the game on normalhigh and it feels great the 60fps is exactly what i needed after playing this game on xbox360ps3ps4 for so long in 30fps and sometimes dipping below because its console yknow ^ gta v is the ultimate open world game and it feels like the best one yet from rockstar gta iv had its moments but you reached the limits to the game once you beat the game on a 100% the fifth installment has it all and it even has gta online that expands upon the newly added heists mode that you can do with friends and other cool stuff to do such as jobs various competetive gamemodes and the rockstar editor that gives you the ability to craft your own gamemodes and etc but the best thing about the game for me personally is the singleplayer the singleplayer adds a new twist to the storymode giving you the ability to play as 3 characters instead of one all with their different and unique playstyles the voice acting animations and enviroment makes it all pretty immersive and realistic the satyrical reimaging of modern day california is both hilarious and true at the same time the best feature rockstar has added has to be the 1st person mode that builds upon traditional fps controls and at the same time has the same button layout as normal gta controls for me gta v is probably one of the best games i have ever played this is the 3rd time i bought it but it was worth it im really happy with what rockstar did and i really appreciate the time and effort they put into making and giving us the best gta experience possible so please buy this game buy it d

do you like being randomly killed all the time by nothing do you like wating in a lobby for 30mins trying to get a heist going only to have everyone leave do you enjoy never unlocking any car parts since the requirement is to win races and no one ever races or see above question then youll absolutely love this piece of  game if you have been living under a rock and havent played the singleplayer then it is worth it however the online portion of this game is completely broke do not buy

the game is great and rightfully so but the developers practiced a scam on the sales to claim more money not only that but recently i was banned from multiplayer from a   anti cheat system that is in place it doesnt protect players that play the game right but in fact just bans players with abnormalities regardless if they were placed by the player or not meaning that hackers basically can force you to kill everyone in the session or get rid of everyones guns and weapons minipulate bank accounts and anything inbetween this leaves players like me vulnerable to being banned without even doing a damn thing hackersscripters can simply change things on you and get you banned rockstar doesnt give a flying  if you did it or not i have argued with the company and they wont releave my ban i would not recommend the mulitplayer or shark loan with the way this is being handled

would be a good game if online wasnt completely ruined by modders it isnt possible to find a session with more than maybe 10 people that doesnt have at least one modder being a  rockstar may publicly state that they are doing something about it but i havent seen any results so theres really no reason to believe they arent lying

why when i play gta v story and turn to gta v online why my gta always crash can someone help me about how to fix this pleaseee
not recommended
well it is not possible do not love gta it is incredible game but there is a big bug in this new editionespecially for the online game experience waiting time loading time online experience can be very frustrating start an heist that last 6 minutes of game might require 10 minute of waiting that someone is joining often happen that people join the room start the mission and then they call themselves out ruining the experience to all other users i would like that rockstar put focus on reducing waiting time  loading time find a way to contain the non professional players that ruin the game experience to all other 3 players in the heist

if you want to play single player i highly recommend it if like me however and you decide you want to purchase this game for online play do not buy online is using p2p services to run the online play and it is awful loads of people are having serious connection problems and timing out all the time after a few minutes there are fixes but it is seriously annoying that rockstar cant get there ducks in order to fix it another huge problem is the amount of hackers online i have played loads of games in the last 20 years and i got to say this is the worse game for hacking i have ever seen its worse then counter strick or dayz when they both first came out there is literally hackers in nearly every server or at least in every 12 servers it is awful and they do everything from taking all your money and weapons to other stuff i have met one hacker them seemed friendly and started shooting cats out of his minigun but most of them are out to grief people as they know rockstar wont do nothing to them like i said if you want single player go ahead but stay away from online the online gameplay is broken

lots of thing to say on this game but will only go for the fact people buy it for mods and or online online is good without mods but people use them way too much too many godmod kid that teleport inside your car make you leave your own car lock your door explode you and your car for sure theres a passive mod where you cant attack and cant be attacked but hackers or modders also found a way to explode you while you are in passive they can also simulate a bounty on your head so you cant be in passive anymore this game was amazing before those people come in and destroy everyone online theres also an other huge problem with this and its those money giver one mod make your weapon throw money where you shoot at so some modder go in teleport to people throw some millions before going away the problem with this is that is killing the mission and heist part of the game people were doing mission to get money and buy those amazing car but now everyone can buy everything even that golden plane at 10million seems like everyone got it already so sad and rockstar that banned hacker once more then a month ago was saying at this stage that they were gonna ban for ever any one attempting to hack again online is any one been banned no  sorry but dont waste money your gonna be so much annoyed just like people are with rust

as fun as the multiplayer is it is ridden with hackers because rockstar games hates pc and is too cheap to use any anticheat software thank you rockstar for screwing pc gamers again youll probably blame all pc gamers for the hackers and never release red dead 2 for pc because you are afraid of spending money

really enjoyed the game on xbox on release and pc on release had some errors crashing but other than that a good experience youve made a bad decision rockstar and if you want the support of the internet community that is steam you had better start listening to us this isnt like console peasants who dont come together and shutdown corporate greed by nullifying this sale youve essentially made yourself the bad guy

the game is great and rightfully so but the developers practiced a scam on the sales to claim more money not only that but recently i was banned from multiplayer from a   anti cheat system that is in place it doesnt protect players that play the game right but in fact just bans players with abnormalities regardless if they were placed by the player or not meaning that hackers basically can force you to kill everyone in the session or get rid of everyones guns and weapons minipulate bank accounts and anything inbetween this leaves players like me vulnerable to being banned without even doing a damn thing hackersscripters can simply change things on you and get you banned rockstar doesnt give a flying  if you did it or not i have argued with the company and they wont releave my ban i would not recommend the mulitplayer or shark loan with the way this is being handled

garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

pros overall a great game for the pc if you are used to how this game looks on the console you will be blown away by the graphical improvements and the gta experience at over 30 frames per second there are a rediculous amount of settings so you can customize the game to your liking the controller support is also amazing since gta v provides a seemless transition from keyboard to controller i personally use a controller for flying and keyboard and mouse for everything else the game as a whole seems so smooth driving especially cons you have to start nitpicking in order to find something about this game that isnt up to par the obvious for me was the excessive time spent on loading screens finding a gta online game is a pain since loading screens can sometimes take up a substancial chunk of time joining jobs and heists also have the loading screens in the end i couldnt recommend this game enough the game itself is among the funnest ive ever played with the graphical improvements over the console version making it even better

after playing 100 hours in the past two weeks i can safely say this game is great and looks wonderful the pc release of gta v has its issues now and then online but singleplayer seems to be perfectly fine i highly recomend playing through the singleplayer campain at least once before going online i had played through it at least 5 times on console and it was worth it now with the pc version there are mods allthough they are not as impressive as gta iv mods yet this is only the beginning also i must note the game is optimized great as you can see in various other reviews it runs smooth i rarely have problems with my fps even though i have a mid range pc i am currently using intel i5 4590 with a amd 280 3gb and 8gb of kingston hyper x ram the load times could be improved as a 60gb game would take up alot of space on a cheap ssd so im still question buying an ssd just for this and my os maybe i will maybe i wont now back to online about 80% of my game time is probably online i have not finished the singleplayer as of yet on pc but i plan to 100% the game later on online is great with the $1000000 cash bonus rockstar had given me for preordering the game early i had been able to buy a new apartment fill up half my 10 car garage with customized vehicles and get a decent inventory of weapons heist are a great way to make money and rank up as you can replay the 6 heist with freinds i would belive rockstar will release more heist aa ther is such a high demand hopefully in a dlc later this year now to finish of this review if you want a game to play around with mods in singleplayer only hint no one likes online cheaters maybe you should wait for a wider variety of mods or you could get it now mods are really starting to pick up even if you dont mod right now no rush their is still plenty of thing to do while you wait in the the world of los santos if you want a game to play online level up online get this best stuff im sure online will keep you busy for a while personlly i say to buy shark cards to get everything allthough i got $1000000 online for preordering 20$ is a bit to much for $1250000 ingame and $5 for $250000 is kinda of waste as that can be easily achieved through a heist or two even if you were to get the game just to play online with freinds well i say get it i have been playing online with freinds for awhile now and by the gods its fun sometimes we have lag issues here and there but that shall be fixed later and for now we can deal with it im going to rate this game a 98 out of ten because nothing is perfect but this is near perfect with my online issues being some lag online

first of all i think this game should have 2 reviews not one first review for storyline mode and the second review for the online mode now my experience might be brief with online but pretty revealing and my singleplayer experience so far has been a dream before i begin i must point out kudos to rockstar for this port on my current machine gtaiv barely could run at minimal now i am running gtav at medium at it works like a charm this is how you do a console port storyline mode  good story > it really kept me interested in what was happening i didnt skip phone conversations or dialog since i was actually curious what was being said and i wanted to learn more nice use of the phone for this as well to deliver bits and pieces of story that makes you understand more about those around you  great and diverse characters > the three main charcters are unique with their own motivations personalities wants and desires i must say michael for me got me really invested into the game great character  good graphics > everything looks very good in this game and running it at medium i didnt feel at any moment as if this was just a game everything looks way to good  overwhelming number of activities > so there is literally a ton of things you can do in game excluding story missions not to mention activities like meeting strange people who always make you do strange and entertaining things you wont get bored easily believe me you can even play and train your freaking dog in this game  optimized for pc > i know a lot of people cannot start the game because of problems with windows user thingy and rockstar club but once you get it started the game is surprisingly optimized for pc gtaiv couldnt run on my laptop previously but gtav really runs smoothly i barely have stutter and that is only when everything on the screen gets chaotic due to too many explosions but that is the exception i cant find anything optimization wise to complain about  customization > alright there are a lot of ways to customize your characters with a very diverse number of clothing options and you can also customize your cars like in a need for speed game i have no cons for the storyline mode so far maybe after i get even deeper into the game but so far i am really satisfied personally this is the gta game i have been waiting for online mode  good graphics > what this applies to online mode too game looks great either way no mater what mode you play  overwhelming number of activities > online mode also has its overwhelming number of activities to perform however most of these do range from singleplayer types to multiplayer types like racing deathmatches heists and a lot more where you and other players can burn away the hours of the day  optimized for pc > this one i must add again since really given that the map you play on is populated with other players this should normally lead to frame drops stutter and lag well i cant say i have experienced that so far for me playing online with other people has caused no problem  customization > the level of detail you can go into to in order to create your online character is astounding this is a proper character customization tool upon creating your first character and i must say i am very impressed especially with the lineage part  multiplayer ready > there are a lot of multiplayer only features designed to fit the game for online play which feel welcomed like the ability to deposit your money at an atm so other players cant steal it from you  players > well surprisingly enough the biggest con of online mode is the players themselves this is not like the gta sand andreas roleplay servers where everyone tries to fit in the online world and enjoy this is just people trying to enjoy the online world with others and the rest who just wanna troll like any open pvp online game ever in existence there is no shortage of trolls and sadly you spend most of your time in online mode playing the hunger games the enjoyment is kind of drained from this overall gtav is worth its praise it certainly is the best game rockstar has made to date and if you ever enjoyed any of the gta games in the past 2 decades then you will certainly enjoy this one too

tldrperformance is great but crashes a lot and loading times suck online is filled with people slaughtering you not worth $60 its a great game in many aspects but it fails in others ill try my best to explain why perfromance the game runs great on all of the systems ive tested these include a sli 760 build a 970 build and a 940m laptop all were playable with tweaks but the game dips like crazy one area i would be getting 110 fps another im lucky to get 30 the only way i could fix this was by adding an additional 8gb of ram to my pc16gb currently but it also crashes way to much the last time i played it i couldnt move without it crashing so i had to reboot my pc and sit through the 6 hour loading screeni have a pretty good ssd and i understand that theres going to be long loading times the game is 60gb but again i have a sandisc extreme pro ssd online pretty much just a cesspool of random people slaughterring eachother and every advancement is locked behind doing races or killing other players which in turn encourages people to slaughter each other the heists are cool with friends but almost impossible with random players becuase they require so much team work overall its a good game for single player and once you get about 4 or 5 players with you online is kinda fun but for a 4 year old game i cant recomend it for $60 theres no way

you know ive wanted to like this game so much since its release but i honestly just cant recommend it to just about anyone at this point with constant errors hindering me in singleplayer and online hackers in every lobby a hostile community and the summer sale fiasco i find it extremely difficult to recommend i want to give this game a good review but with all this i find it hard to even enjoy the game if all the hackers and glitches and whatnot were to dissapear tomorrow id give it an 810 but given that these things still havent been fixed 610 a great game ruined by poor business practices glitches and hackers everywhere making it merely above average in my eyes

i have had so much fun with this game playing it with my friends doing heists  and missions and just plain running around being crazy however i cant recommend the game after the last patch ill gotten gains part 2 it has actually broken the game players are now experiencing fps drops when firing the minigun fps drops when trying to buy weapons or armor in ammunation fps drops when police are around screen tearing cars missing from garages and to make it worse apparently cheaters are apparently able to spam unlocks on other players and get them banned by the new cheat system when these problems are fixed i will change this review to a positive one not happy that i have paid my own money for an expensive game that is now broken

rockstars most recent patch has put game performance before multiplayer in an attempt to confuse modders which has contradicted rockstars statement of supporting single player modding not only that but the way they are trying to rid of mods is ridiculous inwhich they infected the game with junk code that has caused severe fps drops for everyone alike all of this for some pricey digital car that rockstar wants you to spend shark cards on the game itself is fantasic nontheless but the poor attempts to salvage the crappy mulitplayer and prevent modding which makes the game whole leaves me with this negative review

the game in single player is fun but r is now just getting greedy and one of the only reason i bought this game is because i want to mod it but now thanks to the new updates almost nobody can mod it will only be a matter of time before r completely removes mod support r really doesnt trust the community because they are doing everything that the community doesnt want to happen so if you want to buy gta 5 to mod it then dont buy it at all

 really fun game when it works  hours played  game price ratio is really great  a lot of people having session disconnect issues  r seems to only care for shark cards each patch objective consist in trying to block the money hacks  each patch breaks the game even more  session left oh wait i think i said that before  hackers  session left wait  loading time  session left humm  p2p lobbies  session left so for the moment i wont re session left

the games great to review it simply the game is outstanding the my performance is incredible only just reaching min  recommended requirements however still on next gen graphical settings single player feels better than ever first person mode is one thing then you get the story mode on top the single player missions are worth $70 but then you get the 100% checklist which is incredibly imersive and almost acts as a second dimension you touch every corner of the map and witness every rock to every cave hidden or exposed in the vast wilderness and metropolis grand theft auto online personally shouldnt be reviewed completely as it a constant stream of new content but the base expansion works perfectly as it should interactive support is great playing with friends is incredibly easy but dont be fooled by the heist hype the game expansions match making is currently in a state where it would be considered broken and until a patch can solve or implement a new strategy to fix heist match making the game mode is purely for those who want to play with friends and not those who want to solo queue

i waited several months post release to buy this game because i wanted to be sure the pc port is solid and it was and i paid $60 and i got my solid 60fps and all was great and then several weeks later rockstar released patch 128 and now performance is  and the entire point of buying the pc port has gone moot for me how they managed to screw that up is beyond me i miss the time when i could choose which patch i wanted to install oh wait i still can by buying on gogcom

garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
great game honestly but bumping the price to 8000usd before the summer sale just to be able to say 25% off is a scum move

sure the single player is fine  but if you intend to buy this game for the multiplayer  dont its full of hackers and cheaters and rockstar doesnt seem to want to do anything about it not recommended

i really want to recommend this game but i just wasnt ever able to really experience the game how it was intended on my system i5 2500k stock speed 8 gigs of ram and r9 280x i was cautious before preordering it but i only preordered it because the recommended specs were very very reasonable right after launch they did change the recommended processor from a q6600 to a higher end i5 however the game and story itself is amazing but the consant stuttering annoyances really make me feel crummy when im trying to get immersed into the game honestly they should have made the system requirements way higher to be honest with people but hey i know its a jumbled mess with people with worse rigs that can atleast keep a constant 60 constant 60 is it really that bloody hard to just give me a fluid working game its been a flocking minuet since the game came out too ill change the review once i can play enjoyably and how it should be working i should not have to dump more money into my system just to get this playing smoothly or pc gaming is a flooking scam m8

to all of those who cant get this game running i feel sorry for you and wish you could play this game its awesome and it sucks that most of you lost 40 for a game that doesnt work for you there is people out there who can help you rockstar and steam support are there for you if you want a refund or want help to fix the game now for the actual game gta v is a visual masterpiece and pretty much a hd remake of san andreas my fav gta game before this the story mode is fantastic instead of playing 1 character you get 3 franklin who is from the rough part of town michael who used to be a professional heister and faked his death to start a new life and is now in a mid life crisis and trevor who was michaels best friend back when he was heisting and thought michael had died trevor is now looking for michael after discovering he might be still alive all 3 characters feel really fleshed out and are really fun to play as and listen they feel like genuine people and i want to help them win in the end they are easily the best main protagonists in any gta game with carl johnson just behind the trio sorry carl but these 3 take the cake the island is huge its a monster and full of life los santos is easily the best city in any game los santos county is beautiful and has a large range of wildlife and the large blaine county is so much fun to cause chaos as trevor missions are still fun as usual and the fun protagonists make the missions even more fun and crazy none of the missions feel forced or a waste of time like in san andreas where you have a mission to get a haircut and rob a pizza place 1110 weapons can now be customized and its a welcome change you can add a larger magazine to weapons change the colour add flashlights and a lot more plus you can hold every single weapon in the game all at once now now thats a change we all wanted for a long time car customization is back and is awesome as fck its awesome and i can make a shtty car into a monsterous hotrod i missed the sht out of this feature and im glad its back from the ps4 and xbox one version we got the firstperson mode its a nice edition to the gta franchise and is a welcome change which i hope stays however if you dont enjoy it you can always change it to the classic thirdperson view the only complaint i have is the load times however in storymode you only encounter 1 long loadtime and thats booting the game up after that no loading screens thats awesome now this game sounds awesome right what about gta online oh boy what a mess it is the connect times are ridiculous here you need to connect to a game then your in want to join a job connecting then the lobby 50 seconds of playtime and now you play again or disconnecting and reconnecting these connecting and disconnecting times take way too long it can take 4 minutes to connect to a game and 1 minute to join a job yes i know gta v is big and some people might have bad connection but still it would be nice to have quick connections and disconnections gta iv was fast as sht when it came to connecting also gta iv did a better job with servers in gta iv you disconnect and chose the game you want in gta v you disconnect wait ages and connect to a random game i would love the option to choose which game i wanted not roll the dice and see what i get missions are too short online some can last from 2 minuites to 50 seconds plus the connection times i mentioned dont make this any fun the commuinty is a mess some games i have s just shoot me for no reason guys having s on a mic children screeching and more muting is a btch because you have to manually choose everyone wheres the mute all button level ranks are bs while it gives more reason to play the game having armour locked behind it is unfair i get one shotted all the time because i have nothing to help buff me up plus getting rp takes forever and encourages grinding so you can be up with your friends plus car parts are locked behind ranks too online only though while in singleplayer they are obtained by playing through the game gta heists are awful and i cant really explain in enough detail in just text please watch the video below as i share the exact same thoughts as this youtuber httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2mqgoxj0gnu to me if you want a good heisting experience get payday 2 its much more fun and polished then gta heists theres also microtransactions in this game however its only for ingame currency and its optional i dont personally recommend using this at all because making money is easy online save your money for other games overall gta v is an awesome game the storymode is amazing however online is rather hit and miss for me mostly because the connection times but hey if you can get around them its a blast

great sp with story and gameplay variety mp is meh the only thing i enjoyed to do was joyriding stealing cars and pimping cars i already played sp on the consoles so i thought i would buy it on pc for the mods to play as an actual cop and do police tasks in the sp but rockstar dropped the bannhammer on everyone that uses mods in gta v so there is no way of playing the game in sp with mods without getting banned the most shady thing about this is that it happened after they got their cash on the pc platform shame on devs like this another great example why indie devs are so much better than aaa devs

gta 5 is a pretty awesome game but sadly it lacks where it matters the most there are a gazillion little features that either dont work as intended or are simply left out even thou they where a vital part of gta 4 for example  gta 5 is all about heisting and being a criminal keeping this in mind you would expect to be able to leave your engine running when you leave a car to make a quick getaway but you cant do so without using a rather annoying and complicated glitch thanks rockstar so mutch for delivering the best gta experience possible i cant call it anything else but lazy since this issue has been reported numerous times by xbox and ps users and still a year after those reports and nothing has been done to fix it and this is jut one of many examples as good as gta 5 is i cant give it a positive recommendation with this kind of laziness on the developers part

while i am still annoyed with rockstar and their numerous delays this really is a fantastic game and worth the purchase great dialog great missions the city is fantastic and the amount of stuff you can do is great and i look forward to trying online my only real complaint is first person does not seem worth it the guns do not work with iron sights and i do not see a distinct advantage to playing fp over 3rd person for much of anything except if you want more realistic pov for driving

the game itself is fantastic amazing story and great much improved online experiencedespite a few crashes and disconnections but rockstar has officially banned mods from being used which was what kept gta4 alive for a long time people today are still playing gta4 because of the mods now that you are banned if you mod that utterly destroyed the longevity of the game it makes it even worse by the fact rockstar withheld this information until the game was released and they got their money rockstar is very shady and just a very poor company until mods are free again i will have to add on to the negative review pile tddr amazing online and offline experience though being banned for mods completely destroyed the longevity of the game

it really pains me to say this rockstar and i believe that the game deserves a near perfect review because of the fantastic singleplayer storyline great & unique characters and the voice actors are superb the open world of san andreas is amazing the multiplayer is pretty good albeit glitchy the game is great but seriously rockstar no mods mods are the lifeblood of pc gaming and if you take that away it harms the longevity of the product and limits the fun the players can have its ridiculous that you dont allow mods in singleplayer i thought that you would embrace the modding community this time because of all the great things that the modders did with the s port of gta 4 and often created mods that made the game more stable and mods like lcfr that gave a unique view of playing the game through a cops eyes overall rockstar i love the game ive loved ever single gta but how could you disgrace your pc consumers by delaying the port almost 2 years after release and now banning mods

ive always been a fan of the grand theft auto games but have to admit that i got into them from the first 3d game for the playstation 2 grand theft auto iii my first encounter with a gta game was the first classic gta on the playstation let me just start by saying that grand theft auto v has a ton of content to offer every gamer and just the single player side of the game took me around 80 hours to finish i have spent a further 25 hours in the single player after completing the final mission completing the final loose ends such as the collectibles stunt jumps and strangers and freaks missions im the type of gamer who likes to get the most out of all the games i play even if those games are terrible this being excellent though because you spend a lot of hard earned money on games and you should get make the most of them otherwise it would be a waste of money after 106 hours of gameplay time at the time of this review i have still got quite a bit to do in the single player such as hundred percenting the game and a few other bits and bobs not to mention spending time in the online side of the game the sheer amount of content is well worth the money i just cannot stipulate enough how well made this game really is and in my opinion it ranks as the best gta game so far and i feel it is a greater improvement from grand theft auto iv the way the game is executed is exciting and innovative with the player being able to play as three different and unique characters each with their own stories and how their lives all come intersecting with each other as the story progresses the main characters franklin michael and trevor are all likeable and in some way relatable the world of san andreas with just los santos and blaine county to explore is huge diverse and vibrant which just creates the best experience for gta players to lose themselves in and find something interesting to do there are vehicles that are featured in this game which were in grand theft auto iv and they have all been touched up graphically to look and feel even more stunning to drive the pc version has a first person perspective to it which is not featured in the console versions of the game i really like this touch as you are able to view the car from inside the cockpit and see the speedometer and other speed instruments increase and decrease which adds a great deal of realism to the game the radio stations offer a variety of different music with my favourite station being nonstop pop as well as the song convoy by cw mccall describing the amount of diversity and content would result in me writing an entire book but everything that made the previous gta games great are present in this game as well as a ton of new features ive heard people moaning and giving negative reviews for the game because of rockstar banning them for modding either the single player or the online counterpart of the game as a pc gamer for around two years i have to admit that i have never really delved in any modding of games so i dont share the same feelings as these players however the game out of its box is still fantastic and wouldnt really require any form of modification for you to really enjoy it i would thoroughly recommend playing this brilliant masterpiece

simply amazing i am currently replaying the storymode i finished it once on xbox and i had a blast i feel like its more interesting now on pc with the amazing graphics and the surroudings if you have a computer that can handle this game you should definetly buy it

to give a short summary of the online heists you will experience true anger as either a crew member or the leader as your team is killed off in the most bizzare ways such as parachuting into a wall drowning on the beach tripping and falling off a mountain severe head trauma from a train you will also fail because someones internet died someone crashed someone killed themself on the way to the objective makes completing it worth the 3 hours online  10010 oh and the story is good too 1010

i was so excited for this game that the day before i was released i lost sleep it was worth it after the massive faulure of the gta iv pc port which my gtx 970 struggles to run gta v runs the game almost perfectly the first cutscene i ddnt realise that they were the actual games graphics and was blown away by them the gameplay itself is perfect that includes car handling movement gunplay my only problem is that the flying is very difficult numpad controls on my previous laptop there were no numpad controls so i wouldnt be able to play the game from then on i am currently 25% through the game and im enjoying every second of it a must buy 1412  jamez

warning playing online will most likely lead to you running into s > in every lobby < who like to hack the game to a teleport you into the air then into the form of a shark and watch you fall to the ground and die all while being in a passive safe mode yes this actually happened to me b teleport you to their current location and then blow you up passive mode or not c kill everyone in the lobby with the click of a button multiple times d are running around with a god mode hack on challenging people to a random deathmatch the only reason i purchased this game a second time was to play gta online do not buy this game if you plan on enjoying yourself online this is a total hackfest now and rockstar isnt going to do  because they cant but if your into modding and enjoy a good single player game then check this game out gta is a game like none other unfortunately its been destroyed on the pc platform by online hackers who have a hard time killing people the normal way

ive changed my initial review from positive to negative due to most likely one of the most shifty sales tactics ive seen on steam in the last three years you cannot say your game is 25% off when your keeping the price the same but generating some numbers that are automatically applied to your account for gta dollars the game isnt on sale but it is simply coming with a free online booster pack tldr shifty sale tactics means the game is a mislabbeled as a sale but is only a bundle to make you hand over money hand in fist ing rockstar jesus christ comeon simple  here your meant to be a good comapny not ea what the  honestly

this is inevitably one of many bad reviews placed only in protest of rockstars blatantly  system of banning players for using mods to rockstar the pc gaming community is unstoppable if you do not put an end to these draconian policies regarding modding then not only will you see worsening review and increasing anger from the community but the harder you push the harder we push back i am in good faith that the pc gamers wil do absolutely anything to stop you from jewing us out and putting an end to the one feature which truly makes gta superior on pc i repeat we are unstoppable

with all the hackers and cheaters online this is a singleplayer game thus not worth the full price game is great graphics worlds very detailed and amazing but without decent mp it gets boring very quick dont bother playing it online unless you feel like dealing with mostly invincible cheaters or meteors hitting your cars as the game is overun with cheaters so be prepared for a repetetive simple sp game that takes place in a great looking world and for those who say hey just play with your freinds well some dont like waiting around all day for when a couple people on your freinds list are online to go fight ai it is like a ip\lan only game then which is not always the most exciting thing to wait around to play if they were able to get rid of most of the hackers i would give it a thumbs up either that or add a billion things to sp to make it interesting one or the other as it is now though this game has no replay value

this game is so much fun and i have enjoyed it a lot unfortunately it has some crashing issues that need to be worked out ive played for 50 hours and have updated drivers and waited for game updates but neither have helped the game always crashes due to one of two things either a failed initialization or i need to sign into social club again this problem is not occasional either it seems to be able to happen anywhere from game startup to at most three hours of gameplay before i have to make multiple attempts to counter the problem however this does not ruin the game for me since this is simply a bug that can be fixed the storyline is fun and being able to switch characters adds to the experience each have their own perks that make them fun to use my favorite is trevor because of how similar he is to a friend of mine the speech that michael gives to him shortly after you meet trevor makes the game for me the vastness and diversity bring it to a new level of open world gaming yes much like the other games the cars are all very different depending on the region you are in and some can be found customized already but what impresses me is that no two npcs in the world are alike as long as your pc has the specs for this setting i dont care too much for the first person view something doesnt seem right about it but there are the occasional times where i enjoy it i would definitely recommend this game to anyone it is plenty of fun and can easily keep you entertained just like many of the previous gtas i only hope that the problem with the game crashing gets worked out specs cpu 4770k ocd to 4000 mhz gpu gtx780 dcii ocd to 1333 mhz ram 16gb 2133 ocd to 2400mhz mobo maximus vi impact psu 860i platinum c 128gb ssd d 2tb hd

grand theft auto five is hands down one of the best sandbox games ever first off ignore all the thumbs down for banning mods the games developer stated you will only get banned from using mods online the best thing in my opinion is the optimization even on my low end pc it runs really well about 3040 frames per second this was not possible for games like the witcher 2 that came out years before the second best thing is the editor currently exclusive for pc think the theater mode for halo the rest of the game is just like the current gen consoles if you are satisfied with your ps4 and xbone experience and dont mind much for editors then you might stay with those versions the keyboard controls are pretty good for on foot and driving but as far as aircraft its pretty bad the planes fly with the numpad on the right by default and i think the helicopters use the mouse the other bad thing about this game is the drain on my cpu again my computer isnt very good at running this game in the first place but skyping with more than one other person will break either gta or skype so watch out

right so i was just like any pc gamer excited about the pc port id waited past the past gen release and the next gen release a total of 2 bloody years to get my hands on it 2 years if you counted the time between the first trailer and the initial release so here i was on the 14th of april excited as hell id preloaded the game the week before and was quietly waiting for the game to unpack game started okay bubbling with excitement then it crashed i initially shoved it off as a release day problem cool fine ill bear with it i paid 80 ing bucks already might as well give them a chance to deliver may still crashing like hell the servers didnt help either constantly disconnecting and isolating players fine illl wait it out and let it blow over june holidays i have lots of time to play at this point the hope i had for the game is badly eroded i couldnt trust it to run for more than an hour before either the server crashes or the game crashes they had released patches to fix it but honestly it only made it worse now seriously r almost three ing months millions of copies sold at eighty bucks mind you and you still cant fix the server game crashes fine ive tried programming its a pain to debug 50 lines let alone a gazillion lines of code but you cant even use the ing money to get a better server machine  you

i have been playing this game since its original launch i went to the midnight release for the 360 and powered through story modesingle player and all it had to offer it for nearly a week i played online mode the minute it was released suffering through the crippling server issues that it had with all of the problems during its launch aside i had an amazing experience i felt this was really the first next gen game that i had the chance to play the ps4 had launched shortly after in november and i awaited its release again i played this game religiously on the ps4 during its debut with all of the being said i preordered this game for the pc the third time for me and patiently awaited its release thus far i am having an amazing time the game is polished great fun and runs flawlessly on my setup the heists are amazing and social club is integrated nicely into the game my only complaint would be that i wish there would have been a small tutorial or side note stating how to access the social club menu and that friendscrews can be modified only via the social club menu a note for the people giving it negative reviews for the people who cannot run this due to your hardware not being able to handle the game plain and simple you should have read the requirements this game is graphics intensive and requires a pc that can handle it i personally would not try to run this game on laptop unless i was running an i7 with dedicated video cards for the people who are complaining about the crappy community this is gta if you are looking for a peaceful handholding experience there are many casual and teamoriented games on steam that might suit you better you can also trigger online soloplay via the single player online options for the people who simply cannot play this game due to crashes and other things that are beyond your control i can understand your frustration and hope that the game will be able to be ran for you in the future it really is a great experience and it would be shame that a rocky launch would sully the potential experience thank you rockstar for another great game in a franchise that has kept me entertained since 2001 gta 3

game is now broken and unplayable my system is well above recommended specs it used to work fine but the updates ruined the game steam will not issue a refund the game no longer runs well on my system yet steam will not help really dissapointed steam cannot refund a game that is now broken whats the point of buying through steam and paying a premium shame on rockstar to ruin the game for paying customers i dont care about the hackers or modders i do neither and now i cannot play the game i paid for smoothly

this game used to be great but in one of the updates in the past few months they added some sort of anticheat drm system that kills game performance and causes constant stuttering no matter how powerful your pc or how low your settings are

its still in beta very bad optimization shameful money grabbing game with shameful money grabbing in its ingame store game is in beta  ive beta tested games that have very few bugs but this game has a ton of bugs npcs can enter safezones where combat is disabled and kill you sometimes when you summon your vehicles they will spawn on top of places where you cannot get to optimization  i have a nvidia 970 with a whopping 6gb vram12gb ram i7 and the game is on my ssd my computer is only a few months old i play all kinds of games on full ultra settings and my load times are about 5 seconds in this game i will take a shower during the loading screen and come back to see it still loading if you want to queue up for a mission the game just throws you into  you cant choose to be host or join someone else there is no premade groupingyou have to start the mission and hope you are host if you are host you need to invite your friends quickly before rockstar puts pugs into your lobby when you complete a mission it lets your group vote on the next mission but usually after 1 or 2 people vote the game chooses the mission for you the worst part is that it loads the new session before the group is made when you queue up for something you have to load a bunch of  before you can even see the game lobby sometimes after loading all that  it will send you to a full lobby then say game full go back to gta online and now you have to load a bunch of  again its funny when you play single player and then try to start online play during server downtime first it closes out your single player game and loads a multiplayer session then 5 minutes later the loading screen goes away and you get a message couldnt connect to rockstar then it loads another single player sessionbut not the session you were playing you start out at a random location and you will lose game progresseven if you saved the game you lose progress saving doesnt always work i just sat through 3 loading screens and lost progress in single player mode just for the game to tell me that online mode isnt available at the momentif i cant connect to rockstar online servers why would i need to load anything at all why cant i just continue playing single player shameful money grabbing  rock star lies about the top speed of expensive vehicles i bought the entity because the top speed was quite faster than the zentorno only to find that the store lies once both cars were in my garage i could look at their stats to see that the zentorno is faster even though the store says its not you have to do online research and watch lots of youtube videos to find out which car has the top speedif you go by the top speed listed in the game store you will never find a good carand you will waste millions of dollars and hours and hours of game time you spent getting that money also rock star sells ingame cash for real cash yet there are hackers all over the place who can give millions upon millions of ingame cash to anyone you will find hackers using miniguns that dont shoot bulletsthey shoot money sacks with 40000 grand in it so everyone in the game already owns everything worth buying also all the guns in the shop with rank requirements are inferior to the noobnorankrequired guns in the shop except for the mini gun in lots of situations the game uses primitive methodsthere are no cops in the open world they just spawn out of sight when you do something to  them off during a cop chase you can look at your map and see cops spawning just a block away in the direction you are traveling so you cannot escape them by driving straight no matter how fast your car is during a defend your guy while he does something scenario thugs spawn outside a building and run inor sometimes thugs spawn inside a garage i have seen thugs spawn right in the same room as me and they instantly shoot me in the head i have hid far away and used a maxed out sniper rifle to attempt to kill a guy hiding behind a boxonly to have this guy stick his arm out and head shot me using a pistol and using a blind shotblind shot means your head and entire body are still behind cover only your hand and forearm is exposed because you arent aiming the gunblind shooting is meant for providing cover firenot actually killing someoneand certainly not pulling off impossible miracle head shots with a gun that can only out range a shotgunlet alone a sniper rifle with a 10x zoom scope i completed all the heists in order and with the same group of people however only half of my group got the two 1 million dollar bonuses the other 2 people didnt get the bonuses because the game is badand the 3rd guy only got one 1 million dollar bonusthis is because the game is still bad i am a fool for buying this game i bought gta 4 years ago and it failed to run on 3 separate gaming computerswhy would i be so stupid to buy gta 5 having said all of this i am still addictedthe driving is incredibly realistic and the missions are fun i enjoy customizing my cars outfits and guns if the bugs were fixed this could be a fantastic game but rockstar released this game years ago on consoles so they had plenty of time to beta test their product there is no excuse for such a bad and primitive game in todays gaming world please die rockstar

grand theft auto five is hands down one of the best sandbox games ever first off ignore all the thumbs down for banning mods the games developer stated you will only get banned from using mods online the best thing in my opinion is the optimization even on my low end pc it runs really well about 3040 frames per second this was not possible for games like the witcher 2 that came out years before the second best thing is the editor currently exclusive for pc think the theater mode for halo the rest of the game is just like the current gen consoles if you are satisfied with your ps4 and xbone experience and dont mind much for editors then you might stay with those versions the keyboard controls are pretty good for on foot and driving but as far as aircraft its pretty bad the planes fly with the numpad on the right by default and i think the helicopters use the mouse the other bad thing about this game is the drain on my cpu again my computer isnt very good at running this game in the first place but skyping with more than one other person will break either gta or skype so watch out

best storyline in any gta game finally this makes some kinda sense and the plot is serious tar proves gta gets better and better why tar gta online natural selection at its best if you wanna have fun in this game and be able to hold your ground you will have to reach level 120 when youll unlock the minigun otherwise youre just gonna get bullied by kids who wanna get a revenge for a c in school note for those of you who omplain about miserable payouts for heists i will be gentle enough to explain q how does rockstar keep the game running a shark cards q why do heists have crappy payouts a cause if they will give you $200 mil for 1 heist there will be no need for shark cards q so what a rockstar gon be fckin poor and you wont get a next gta game in a longer time

the big one gta v an instant classic story jokes and jests about reallife everywhere high octane action along side topnotch visuals sound and acting cars to steal guns to shoot crazy people to collect some celebs panties for less crazy people to massacre in the street its gta what did you expect what this one does above and beyond compared to the previous titles is the atmosphere liberty city was great but los santos is so detailed and vibrant you can go for a drive and look at sunsets for 6 hours straight gta online all of the above minus the voiceacting a character creation thats onpar but after while leaves you wanting tho the abundance of clothes and such to find your characters style helps a lot same goes for the cars free content updates shoot people with friends or shoot your friends as well fail heists in dumb ways thanks to random people who are at an all time high of cluelessness menues and ui are probably the only bad part about it all their layouts is not changed in any way since the console version and thus they are heavily influenced to be navigated with a controller the attention to detail in visuals physics and practical little things is so above and beyond that you will still be surprised after hundreds of hours what was missing in gta iv is now here with some green wilderness character creation and full customization of vehicles remember to stop shooting people and go for a slow cruise a walk on the beach or a bikeride in the sun theres always something to look at final score 98  100 do you like shooting things buy it do you like cars buy it do you like the sims buy it do you like photography buy it do you have this game allready buy it  for a friend

well what can i say about gta v the graphics every one moans on about graphics and i would like to put this as plainly as possible on what was a medium rig when i bought it in january 2014 i can run the game at medium texture detail this does look better than gta v on the pisspoor and the xbone presumably has no better the aesthetics are good but watch dogs was better even before the patches that got the e3 bloom working some games go for more realistic but if you have seen a car in gta v you will know they went for shiny not alienating just could have been better the singleplayer this is the same as the consoles so nothing new to those who have played or seen it i find it boring i dont like the character development i find the writing as polished as my last turd some people like it simple minded or easily amused people or those who dont take games too seriously this is too subjective to settle in a paragraph the multiplayer unfortunately rockstar took the activision aproach of everyone loves multiplayer put all of the money into it and while it is amazing it is bittersweet the singleplayer suffered from lacking what i liked about gta san andreas which is hard to put into words but the multiplayer can be endless fun if you have the right amount of friends unfortunately my group of friends is 5 strong and everything is based around multiples of 2 unless you are going for records on races to settle this as i implied earlier i take games quite seriously so i killed one of them over it the missions are well thought out but i can see myself playing nerdcubeds missions for 90% of the time when the custom missions are fixed controls my friend told me that the way that driving was programmed it would be near impossible without a controller from what he had read prior to release but i use a keyboard and mouse for everything aiming is not overpowered as with a controller aim assist means one only has to tap the left trigger to have a headshot lined up from the otherside of one of the deathmatch arenas because of this you dont get queued with controller users if you are on a keyboard and mouse luckily flying a helicopter is designed to be awkward expecting it to be similar to just cause 2 the grand master of open world third person shooters until jc3 is released i was horrifically shocked but i still found using the numpad and wasd to be better than controller and mouse is only good if precision isnt required overall i love this game but there are so many things i would change if i made it but that is the basic economic problem it isnt possible to satisfy all human wants so i leave this game with a reluctantly high 911 distasteful joke

you dont need me to tell you how good this game is but i can say that the pc version is the best version of the game with its extensive array of settings fully bindable keys ability to have own radio station of your favourite songs and ofcourse the ability to transfer old characters from previous versions 1010 buy this if you can run it

so lets get this out of the way at launch there are unresolved bugs and issues with the game i as of my 13 hours of playing the game so far have experienced about 3 to 4 crashes each time being pretty awful also make sure you upgrade your ram i have 8gb of 1600mhz corsair and i had chrome open in the background and this was causing my game to stutter that aside i find the world of los angeles simulator to be very fun to explore being a resident of the area makes it even better i especially love the santa monica pier in this game i was able to accurately point out places on the pier before i saw them and they were actually there like the taco bell and pizza hut being one of the first things you see before going on the roller coaster or ferris wheel running the game using gefore experience optimal settings with a gtx970 the game ran very well at 1080p with most of the settings being at very high smooth beautiful gameplay and i would say if you arent being harassed by problems of launching then this is a very good port obviously more patches will indeed be put out because rockstar seems to care about their updates and im hopeful that all the issues will be addressed for an enjoyable experience

ive played a ton of the ps3 and ps4 versions before pc so consider this a sortof comparison thing if youre thinking about switching if youre new to gta v then you might want to look at other reviews because this might not help you so much i havent touched the singleplayer game beyond the mandatory prologue before getting straight into online the key reasons i wanted gta v pc even though ive already played it a lot were graphics controls and so i could play with pcplaying friends the configurability of the graphics is pretty crazy there are a lot of options here  its not like the average port where youre lucky if you can change the resolution the game properly supports multi ive tested triple 1080p monitor setups as in theyve actually put some thought into how itll look so you dont get any crazy gui mess like you do in other games it even fades the peripheral monitors in and out if it needs to ive got a fairly ok rig an i5 2500k and a gtx 680 and it runs great at 1080p but obviously its nowhere near the max settings but it still looks a lot better than the console versions there is the odd hiccup in the frame rate but on the whole it is a night and day difference coming from even the ps4 version i havent seen any particularly alarming bugs or artifacts either maybe the odd lod transition that takes longer than it should even though its running from an ssd but nothing you wouldnt expect really the default keyboard controls are awful they use pretty much the entire keyboard  even the numpad the default flying controls are wasd for throttle and rudder num 2468 for pitch and roll and the mouse does the camera i dont have three hands admittedly its not all that common to need the camera but im going to eventually try to come up with a better configuration for all that it would be nice if you could turn off camera autocenter for vehicles but i dont think you can there are other weird things too like cycling prevnext weapon in vehicles mouse wheel up or tab to go to the next weapon or [ to go to the previous what so thats left hand or mouse for next weapon take your hand off the mouse and look for the [ key that no one ever uses in games to avoid having to cycle all the way back around to the weapon before the one you were on still you can remap that so thats ok lack of analogue control over vehicles is a big deal offroading is terrible because you just wheelspin all the time it could really do with a slow modifier maybe it has one i didnt spend much time looking at the car control binds im not sure about directinput controller support it definitely supports 360 controllers though so you could have one on your lap to switch to for vehicles however for all thats bad about the keyboard and mouse controls it has one massive massive plus mouse aim this is the biggest game changer for me i can actually hit stuff with my first shot when firing from vehicles now and the marksman rifle is actually useful i think it would be worth hacking some sort of onehanded driving controller together just to be able to use a mouse to aim while i drive its so good i might even use first person mode for more than just messing around now finally being able to play with friends it seems like almost everyone i regularly talk to has now bought gta v and everyone else is on the fence but holding off because its expensive so for now at least theres no shortage of people to join the social club crews feature means i can be a member of a variety of different er social clubs ie a group of irl friends a group of one gaming site a group of another etc and play with anyone from any of them at any time without much trouble except i did have one problem last night in that the ingame friends list was saying a friend i was talking to was offline but thats also ok because the game supports the steam join game feature and you can also invite people through the rockstar social club overlay theres also ingame voice chat with push to talk no more being assaulted by people breathing down their mics or coughing but it wasnt working when i tried it three hours after the launch and globalteam text chat in addition to text messages  communicating is therefore much easier which is extremely handy in a game where communication during jobs is so important yes online still has the long load times and flaky servers the console versions have but you can massively reduce the wait by installing the game on an ssd so theres that at least otherwise the game is pretty much the same same cars same guns same map etc snapmatic does have a meme text feature now and there is of course the replay editor but i havent touched that yet and i dont know if i will apparently the buffer isnt very long oh and theres the custom radio station which i havent set up yet thatll be handy i was getting a bit sick of cant hardly stand it

for once this is the first pc port i have ever bought for $60 to say that it was well worth the full price game runs smoothly and i havent run into any major glitches so far on launch day however if you have a crappy pc dont expect it to run well whatsoever ive noticed this with some reviewers complaining that the game had limited video settings and bad lag just because their video card didnt have enough vram or their processor wasnt good enough to handle the load aside from the windows user account name bug the game is great tldr game is shiny and smooth 55 would delay again

dont get me wrong the game itself is great i would happily recommend it if the publishers changed their behavior and stopped beingwell shady the first thing i noticed was preorder bonuses right so they keep pushing the date deadline back and back and back until the deadline was the day of release might sound generous to some until you realize that was more of a tactic to get as many people to preorder as they could that strikes me as flat out dishonest and intolerable the second thingwhich other people have already made very clear is how rockstar is going banhappy and basically taking a very antimodding stancea stance which was not made clear before release i might add im all for evening the playing field thats fine but banning people for mods in single player banning people for being on the receiving end of another persons mods the infamous money gun and the bans on people who were hit by it and of course none of this began to come to light until preorders and all the initial release sales were done and final im sorry but hell no yeah the game is great and single player is fun to mess around in especially with mods but the issue is the publisher doesnt deserve your money until they learn they cant treat their paying customers this way they cant moan about pirating and everyone waiting for the big steam sales then treat the people who do pay like dirt and expect us to be ok with it

if you have your graphics driver updated to the latest version no serioulsy nvidia has actually released a driver update specifically for gta just before it was released and the settings at a level your computer can handle then youre in for a fun ride of stealing stuff injecting marijuanas and really messed up stuff not for prude or squeamish people at all pc version is optomised really well which is really rare for a huge game of this caliber and it even includes settings for future graphics cards and i get a smooth 60fps at all times thats until you start playing gta online then you start getting conectivity issues and joining your friends or trying to make a private session is a nightmare but youre still likely to have an great10 time with the online mode just dont be a complete  to the other players and they wont start beating your  down for being said  thats untill you get to the online heists then youll start praying for patches to save you from the crashes and the bugs that can never let you win a mission sometimes and the automatic mission failures for the game disconnecting another team member and the freezing of the screen thats sometimes fixed by pressing altenter twice but not really and the prison heist thats an absolute long boring drawl that builts itself up as a squeaking mission but is just rambo guns blazing at the end without telling you and leaving one of your teammates with a  pistol in the middle of a high security prison and the even worse connectivity issues and the issues where enemies can spontaniously go invisible and jesus christ i just wanted to have fun fun is dead

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
long story short for people who love gta and want to play singleplayer only this is for you if you want to play online you will probably get killed by hackers and guess what rockstar does nothing about it there is no simple way to report players so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers game itself 1010 gta online 310 hackers everywhere edit this is itdecided to improve my flying skills all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane i didnt press anything freezes and thats it cant move at all some sort of hack joined another session after few minutes i noticed two people with godmode on so i went passive mode but guess what they started shooting cars at me and i died about 10 times i advice you not to buy this game at all
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

the game is fantastic and runs great compared to gta 4 when it was released and gta4 deserved those rating bombs until they finally patched it this game however does not pros fantastic graphics and environment great textures and other important graphical details lighting modules etc well designed and beautiful landscape big and fun cities to drive and explore wonderful fantastic performance on all max graphics 60 fps constant little to no lag cpu and gpu performance does not have to crank at all to run the game gta online servers are not as  at launch compared to the console release thank you gameplay single player uber awesome its just wow great characters fun story and side quests a living city wonderful gameplay multiplayer uber uber awesome i love it driving around with your friends killing poor innocent players that are new to the game like myself that are at a low level while my friends are like level 80 as they played the hell out of the console version and transferred their character lol the jobs are super fun but are more fun with friends the heists well designed fun with four people can very challenging but awesome payout and really fun with good teamwork housing and garages many to choose from around town you can buy them invite friends into them most if not all have garages can store a max for the most expensive 10 vehicles fun to mess around and get high ingame with your friends in your apartment vehicles planes and cars they are awesome easy to drive look wonderful able to have much variety and steal most cars put them in your garage they become yours for essentially forever if you dont blow those up vehicles you buy are more or less permanent with the insurance ability playing with friends in freemode drive around the vast city encounter other players almost at random and have huge firefights to either kill each other or play together to control the server cons only 32 players in one server what server connection issues they are not as bad as release on console but wow i have had some issues myself and so have my friends when it comes to staying connected with the server during free mode or heists it sucks even more when doing a heist and your friend disconnects social club damn it game devs you got to stop it with this  uplay battlelog and now this again it can be a hassle its was terrible in gta4 and thankfully its much improved but is something that is forced on to the player why not just integrate steams community system the invite system is much better the crews could be related to steam groups and it would provide us no need to create a external account to just play the damn games online ability i honestly dont hate it as much as its not to bad in this gta but this sets an example for other devs it just provides another roadblock in playing the damn game i still give this game a 10 out of 10 as the cons are not a serious issue in the major factor to the games ability to be played or enjoyed 32 players is suitable but i wish there were more server connection issues are almost resolved at this point and social club is honestly not that bad for someone who is using it for the first time as they will have no issues creating and loggingin its a fantastic game and is totally worth the 5060 dollars on steam the preorder bonus was really nice with the 1000000 dollars you get for franklin in the single player and your gta online character its a big helping boost without being detrimental its so fun to play with friends or by yourself get it

mah mothers mah sister quick summary buy it bit more detail after 2 years of postponement after postponement gta v is finally available to the pc master race simply put it was worth waiting for my main concern about this game prerelease was that my laptop wouldnt be able to run it 8gb ram i7 geforce 650m however since release i have run this game at 720p with almost all other settings on high or ultrahigh and have not experienced framerate drops it seems building the pc version from scratch really worked this time around and therefore the 2 year delay was time well spent whilst its difficult not to know what youre getting yourself in for with a gta game these days  such is the success and longevity of the series  it is easy to underestimate the quality of rockstars work that is until youve played gta v nothing that i say can accurately describe the scale of this game right down to the level of detail i have played on much larger maps in other games and found less than a thousandth of the things to do this truly is a monster game singleplayer as you would expect of a gta game is incredibly fun i have clocked around 100 hours on the first play through and im still enjoying it the replay value is also massive due to the variety in the missions and the chance to earn more and more money the next time round by tailoring the order of certain stock market missions for larger payouts etc i really dont want to give too much away about the singleplayer in this game or any of the missions in particular as this game is on a par with some great films when it comes to voice acting and story telling and you will be whooping with excitement at points i should however point out that driving has been vastly improved since gta iv and this has really added to the enjoyment of it all the real magnum opus of this game however is gta online gta online is essentially a stand alone game which takes the game we have known and loved since gta iii added a ridiculous level of detail and made it into an mmo game there are very occasionally teething problems with connecting to friends due to the lack of a true party system however this has improved immeasurably since the game was released and i fully expect this trend to continue in the coming weeks and months within gta online is the usual freemode wandering buying and customising cars visiting ammunation killing randoms etc akin to single player mode along with a wide variety of jobs accessible from your phone and the start menu these jobs include landseaair races heists parachuting survival modes missions darts golf tennis and deathmatches to name but a few and serve both as the primary way of making money and levelling up with so much variety available it is feasibly possible to sit for 14 straight hours without realising it trust me the craziest thing is that each of these jobs could feasibly be sold as a separate game  the golf is better than the most recent tiger woods offering from ea the racing is more fun than anything ive played since burnout and the heists are literally what every gta fan has been waiting for since that mission in gta iv overall it is way too early for me to say that this is my favourite game ever but without a shadow of a doubt i think it is the best made 1010

unless you have a group of friends to play this consistently with dont buy this game the matchmaking in gta online is horrendous itll take you 20 minutes to form a party and if someone decides they want to leave or 99% of the time they probably crashed instead of just inviting another player to fill the role the game forces you to reform the entire party there are so many people who quit preheist too unless they get a role they want so more waiting loading screen after loading screen if you want to get in a filled server youll have to turn aim assist on game crashes regularly and youll have to pray to a higher power that it doesnt happen during a heist or job the reputationtime and moneytime ratio is horrible until youre past level 75 i played two hours just trying to level up and i was only able to finish one heist setup that awarded me 2k rep if i had just grinded criminal records i would have easily 3036k rep in two hours this means the game is actively encouraging you to glitch and grind the same mission over and over again because its more rewarding than actually playing the game there are plenty of hackers too youre guaranteed to have one hacker in your server unless youre playing in a private session and for some reason the game has a large hispanic and russian playerbase no idea what thats about but no one speaks english single player is fine

let say it short the game in itself is great now playing it is another thing and thats why i dont give it a positive review first the loading times they are longer than star citizens one they can take up to 8 minutes or even more you also tend to see the loading clouds very very often second the crashes the game is crashing very often mainly when you almost finish a heist mission apparently because it have eaten all the ram available and that makes the graphic drivers crash it get from 3 gb of ram used after 5 minutes of gameplay to around 56 gb after some times it is obviously leaking memory somewhere third getting other players to play an online heist is a nightmare matchmaking times up to half a hour are not uncommon and the people you get matched with are mostly dumbasses which cant help but prevent you from completing the mission viewed from the point of view of someone that have completed multiple heist missions with 3 afkwaiting players also with the crash rates of the game actually completing this missions even with a decent squad is pretty hardcore to put this in perspective it took me an entire night to complete 2 heist missions youll tell me why are you not playing with your friend then most havent bought the game because it is expensive also there are a bunch of details that are really annoying its eating half of my processors cores at full power when alttabbed i75820k mind you the r social club is an annoying piece of  that eat an amazing amount of ram for what it is doing it is even beating skype at this the physic wonkiness in multiplayer is sometimes annoying the controls are hit or miss depending on the thing controlled and sometimes get really wonky random afk kick times which kick you in unexpected situations etc now for the positive sides the game is beautiful the customization options are wonderful and the possibilities are enormous the gameplay is also more tactic than previous iterations of the serie which is both pleasant and unpleasant it has some good sides and some bad sides you get killed more easily but the game is more tense and interesting and trade this for fun the online is a great addition to the serie as well and the way it is handled excepting the issues mentionned earlier is well thought also it is fun to play mostly when not caught in earlierly cited situations

to be clear i have never played more than 4 hours in any other single gta game or saints row game they never hooked me coming off as giant sandboxes with nothing to do that was interesting aside from blowing things up gta v is easily on my top 25 games of all time list its everything all the previous gta and sr games lacked for me plot perspective and scope if you enjoy heist movies at all this is the game for you  by having three main characters it feels like youre observing this grand plot rather than being the silent protagonist that most games put you in the role of which is part of the reason i disliked previous gta games it also allows for great variations in side quests and how you view the main quest  the size of the game is amazing not just in map size but in how it spans the areas of the map and the plot points between them  again if you like heist movies books or anything else this delivers on all points the setup the execution the overthetop scenarios this is without even mentioning that the first person perspective makes it so much easier for folks who enjoy fpss to play the game at least the shooty parts the ability to mod it how freaking beautiful it looks maxed out the fact the vorpx mod makes it feel amazing in vr etc just buy the game already

by far the best gta so far singleplayer has a great story line from what i have played and a lot of features that arent in the multiplayer but the multiplayer also has features the singleplayer doesnt so it balances itself at almost the 100 hr mark ive spent i would say about 80% of it in online it has got to be my favorite the heists are great if you can get 4 decent people together and i havent encountered many trolls except in races buying 10 car garages and filling them with custom cars is my hobby there are a lot of cars all with different mods and some more than others some have to be stolen and some have to be bought grinding money can be tedious if you cant get 4 people together the regular jobs and knocking off corner stores dont pay that much and doing them alone can be risky sometimes all in all the multiplayer is great if you got people to play with as for singleplayer i cant really say too much about it since i havent really played much of it i do recommend the game to anyone looking for fun online for sure though
recommended
in order to play this game you need to have rockstar club running while your game is running or it will just quit abruptly this also means that if you are getting the game from a library share you cant actually use it without borrowing your friends account no thanks ill just stick to the ps4 version

what else to say awesome singleplayer lackluster vanilla multiplayer as usual with gta games though this time tar is shoving their  up of the asses of anyone who makes or uses mods in sp or mp theyve made mods near impossible to make and even harder to use without a banhammer coming their way rockstar is only so enforcing because they want people to a grind their asses off for money in repetitive game modes and the same heist over and over which leads many to people to b buy their con artist f2p market inspired money cards i stopped playing gta mp originally because of the grind which is up there with many f2p games of course f2p games its tolerable because its free i expected more from oh wait i really didnt expect anything from the delay and ovehrype masters despite it all i would pay 60 dollars just in interest of getting the excellent mods that even now are leaking through rockstars  little dam but of course i cant play with my friends if i get even the sp only mods for now this game is a 410 because the repetitive grind that does not belong in this game franchise and their awful stance on modding

truly fantastic game i think this is due to the fact that ive completely ignored the online mode it passes my $1 an hour test ive played the same hours as the price i paid so i reckon it was worth the $60  im also ignoring the shady summer sale pricing here as well indepth review pros fantastic graphics  definitely moments that make you go ahh and stop for a bit to enjoy the scenery awesome acting  i can say im a fan of the story mode huge map full of fun stuff to do single player is plenty enough to keep you occupied another great entry into the gta series[endlist] cons dialogue a little cliched  i guess that was probably what they were going forbut still quite intensive on the systemdefinitely need a decent rig to run on full online  ive heard bad things but cant really comment since i generally avoid multiplayer loading times  frustrating i guess but it helps that its just the initial startup and then its smooth sailing sp notable extras i love the fact that the cars are recognisable and have a wide variety  there are supercars gt40s audi r8s veyrons muscle cars mustangs chargers tuners ae86s crxs and more smart cars westfalias attention to detail  stuff like the characters sleep patterns being different peoples reactions to you based on who you play and one occasion where i as trevor threw a bomb at franklin off mission and killed himthen promptly got a message from franklin telling me hed appreciate it if i paid for it the next time i put him in the hospital dog

firstly i have been waiting for this game since console release and swore to only play it on pc as im not a console fan i preordered the game in january with much anticipation and excitement although the game was pushed back a couple times due to technical issues i didnt mind as i wanted gta v to run correctly on my system i mean who wants a broken game secondly as soon as i launched the game when it became live i fell in love with it it is all i had hoped for and im incredibly impressed with the way it has been optimized unfortunately nothing is ever perfect and neither is this game day 2 after release and i can no longer continue with the game as it crashes with every mission i begin now as disappointing as this is im not angry like a lot of people are you need to allow the game a couple of weeks to allow rockstar to iron out the game breaking bugs even though i havent played as much storyline as i had hoped at this point i highly recommend it to any rockstar fanboyfangirl as it is one of the best games i have played in a very long time visually and performance wise well done rockstar on an amazing game

gta v isnt that bad of a game there are few games like it which makes it quite unique its well put together great quality trust me it looks amazing something you can enjoy playing on your free time the storymode takes place not too long after the events in gta onlineand the rest you can figure out yourself the story was better than i expected allowing you to play 3 characters trevor michael and franklin getting to know their background and how it combines to oneanother exploring los santosblaine county through their perspective of course you can customize vehicles and pick out your clothing lets talk about online now im not gonna lie to you yes the online session has some issues like modders cheaters whatever the hell people call them and maybe a few bugs from here and there but come on when isnt there a multiplayeractionopenworld game that doesnt deal with these issues im sure the company is coming up with an idea to improve the online sessionsyeah most lobbies contain people who want to kill but this game do have guns kind of selfexplanatory once you think about it i enjoy playing online very much its allowing you to experience los santos with your character and interacting with others as you go along buying houses & customizing your own vehicles just like in single player to playing fun missions heisting with your friends & going around blowing  up in a tank or hydra whatever your call theres a lot to do public lobby invite private whatever theres stuff to do in my opinion play with friends it makes online 10x better though give public a go and make some new friendsor enemies most people would talk about the loading time their opinions on the updates more and more about the modders the summer sale issue connection issues and having to buy the shark cash cards for their use to me i have no problem with those issues whats so ever you see it all over the review section trust me its all over sc too and here are my thoughts about it loading time on the day of release i was very impatient now eh i can wait plus it did improve opinion on the updates eh updates are updates like most gamesnot all of them can go your way modders can be a pain but they arent killing my vibe trust me i would love for them to go away but writing it on reviews over and over while giving the game a bad reputation isnt gonna solve it seen the news once you see them all just report and go if theyre bugging you dont want to let r attempt to help and do you summer sale issue i preordered the game so thats no problem though not really seeing the picture here is it about the game with the white shark cash card if so youre basically getting the deal similar to the preorder during the 2015 summer sale since the card is 20 bucks in general i can be wrong hopefully someone can help me out with this connection issue most of the time its the internet connection or the settings in the advance graphic section but again i can be wrong cash cards the game isnt forcing you to buy the cards if you dont want to spend money on this game then keep playing missionsracesetc to earn your money a lot of games nowadays will do that like with dlcs nothing new hopefully my review helps sorry if i seem bummed out if anything i said concerns you please dont cause a flame war or something im just giving my thoughts my rating for this game eh9210 nothing can be perfect anyway thanks for reading last updated june 18th 2015

great game as we all know it by now playing on consoles before i only played it on 360 just for the sake of finishing it and then waited for pc release the game came with some issues for some people such as the username having special characters however mine is my microsoft account with my email in there it didnt seem to caused any issues in launching the game i did have some issue launching it at start as i would click on the play button and it would show for couple second on steam that im ingame but then itd go away for no reason the fix for that i found that you need to manually install the installers from installers and _commonredist folder if you had an issue like mine where it didnt auto installed it i am having another issue now the game crashing it only crashed twice so far in my almost 2hr of game play but still is annoying i am hoping for it to be working fine with couple updates so once youre past that and can launch the game successfully its a gorgeous looking one to say the least in my opinion pc port is better than max payne 3 for me im playing it on 4k with 5060 fps constantly in closed locaitons or while fighting and 4550 while driving at everything max on 970 sli setup its doing rather well and youll get steady fps with something like this setup all in all  the game is totally worth its price i didnt like these launch issues that i had which were minor but the game crashing and saying gta v has stopped working is making me mad to say the least and others are still facing some other issues maybe  wait a while until they fix it at least theyre not ubisoft and i have high hopes from rockstar to fix their mistakes launch issues aside game is very well optimized and well worth the price

just due to the face that modding sp is against the rules i have to give a thumbs down  sorry fanboys but this is pc not the console it does not hurt anyone modding singleplayer i am very displeased knowing how crappy rockstar is becoming i could not wait for lspdfr mod and knowing now that i will be banned for using it in singleplayer will result in a ban just straight out sucks i do not recommend this game to anyone who supports the modding community

grand theft auto v is a meticulously crafted openworld sandbox title by rockstar games the constant delays and hype of the pc version was laid to rest when it finally saw its release on the 14th of april as for the review i shall be brief so as to be as less time consuming as possible gta v offers vibrant visuals a modern yet enjoyable plot consisting of a mixture of reality and satire it also offers replayability due to its vast counterpart gta online and a living breathing environment in the streets of los santos and blaine county aside from the main plot the game maintains its entertainment standard by offering its players with a variety of tasks missions random quests and activities pc users that may not be as up to date can also try this as the game itself is optimized in a way to deliver utmost performance while maintaining its graphical fidelity i must say this is pretty much the only aaa game that deserves a praise in the recent scenario as minimal bugs have been found and those discovered are being eliminated by rockstar as said before ive been brief  very brief in fact it doesnt matter as to what kind of games you like this is a must buy and shall remain one for years to come 1010 indeed

like everyone expected a complete launch failure clear example of greed and stupidity why in hell do i have to have a rockstar social account if i want to play alone single player sure if i wanted to socialize and shoot some other players sing me up but i dont dont force us to get things we dont want or need consumers hate that how could you possibly ever mess this up people gave you 2 billion dollars upfront you had pushed the release date further and further yet on the release date people who paid for it only got frustrated and  rockstar is a greedy sack of useless chicken guano
not recommended
100% worth buying  best game in my library to date no more delays or any stupid bs just endless hours of picking up hookers and playing golf gta v is filled with things to do that will keep you entertained for well over 1000 hours and is without a doubt worth the 3999 as long as you like open world multi and single player firstthird person shooter games that involves driving flying and shooting then this is the game for you

oh my god why was this even on consoles honestly if you thought the game was good on the 360 or ps4 youre gonna love this  holy hell like r way to make me think your game is  for two and a half years before showing me the truth of this masterpiece

grand theft auto v where do i begin it is the exact same thing as gta iv or gta iii were  but with better graphics and no mods rockstar has gone out of their way just so they could prevent mods that was singleplayer in a nutshell now about online got money ban cheated in sp ban negative review ban and the online game is boring as fk you need to grind money or you can spend a 100$ just so you could have fun for 10 minutes before a radnom dude comes in and blwos everything up aswell as the fact that due to the grinding the game loses its fun and unless you have friends that are the same elvel as you and are ready to paly at any point dont even go to multiplayer it sucks big time

banning people because we cant use mods in singleplayer that was what at least 60% or more bought the game for now removing our ability to mod the game and not allowing mods to be played in single player they may end up making people pay for mods now so if you are thinking about getting this game for playing mods like the popular lcpdfr for gtaiv dont they will just ban you and if not ban you they may make you pay to mod the game

grand theft auto v broke my heart it was 1130 in the morning or maybe it was night i dont remember the time of my tragedy i was liesurely cruising through los santos in my army jeep when behold i found another player she was friendly and shot me in the foot so being friendly back i shot her in the foot after having a laugh about it we got together and did missions we spent countless hours together having fun and bonding this girl was amazing finally i invited her back to my place she accepted and we spent the night drinking together smoking weed and dancing by running around the couch after enough was enough she asked to back to her apartment we were both wasted off our asses but our love shone through it all like a lighthouse through fog getting into my car i got my bearings and pulled out of my garage she gave me a waypoint to her house and i quick took off for it we got good speed going but then because of all the drinking and smoking the game took control of the wheel from my hands and gave it to jesus and he promptly smashed my car into a light pole i survived with very little health but my female friend was killed on impact i tried to shake her body but the game took it as me wanting to shove her body out of my car which is what happened her body then promptly was run over by several suvs killing her further into death unable to bear with having killed my friend i quickly jumped off an overpass into oncoming traffic and got run over by a firetruck but even in death we could not be together as she was tired and disconnected before i could add her tldr i missed a chance to score due to drunk driving best game ever 1010

why did i move to pc i guess it was the graphics or the ah i dont know that thing that fps you see it on the consoles i wanted to retire from all that lag you know from that that 720p play at high res for once at high fps so i bought a big pc play more with my feet up and i thought it would be awesome like all the other pc games the graphics would be like crysis 3 wed play at high fps no rage because of lag but well you know the release date
recommended
its worth the full price but the sales they implement shows heavily on their greedy sales tactics worth the price compared to other aaa titles but a slippery slope for an otherwise good company

i just bought this game and im almost regreting it not quite but almost let me preface what im here to say with this i love this game so far story is great best gta stories so far maybe second to san andreas the gameplay is great the graphics are pretty awesome as well i fully intend to play this game a lot and as i dont intend to use mods the whole banning people for mods thing though stupid doesnt affect me there is however one major problem that makes the game almost unplayable the graphics are great until i get in a car at high speeds or car accidents they become choppy no matter what i set the graphics to it will be fine one second then it practically becomes a powerpoint presentation for a moment then catches up with itself this makes literally any time you drive a horrible experience given how much driving there is in this game thats a problem steam will say you have played 5 hours of the game in reality its been more like 3 hours of gameplay and 2 hours of intermitent tinkering with setting to try and fix the problem i figured maybe my computer just sucked but i looked online and i am apparently not the only one having this problem even people with ultra high end pcs built for smooth gaming are having this problem until they fix it i would not recommend anyone buy this game once the problem is gone yeah even for $60 the game would be worth it

i wasnt sure if it will be a good versionnot port because of the delays and rs past in pc games but hell i got one of the pc gameby pc game i mean optimization in the last 2 years gta v is full of graphical options with free key rebind but without gta games best element mods  the story is interesting and longafter 22hours i am still not done with it while some missions are boring but the graphics the optimization and the voice acting are all awesome the controls are great but the helicopters are not realy but i dont care about it the game got lot of mini gamestennis golf cycle reaces running races etc with a huge variety of cars and car customization items and a good amount of customizable weapons the online is also good but sometimes realy unfair due to the character transfer from consoles and i had to fight in a tdm as a lv 5 character against some lv 5060 guys and that was unfair online got a bad sport system what is not the best at this point because i dont wanted to become one but i realy wanted to leve the match because it was full of well idiots heists and other game modes are awesome just like the character customization sadly in single player the amount of clothes and hair styles are low so i hope soon we will get more from modders if they find a way to mod the game pros story gameplay optimization characters lenght content voice acting online cons low amount of clothes and hair styles no mod support final 95 love it and you should buy it

great game with great single player story around 30ish hours long with all the side missions strangers & freaks tons of other activites to do in single player like collectables & other less meaningful missions in the single player multiplayer has its downs but overall good their servers are a bit half  which is a nice way of saying theyre rubbish for the most parts fun experience nonetheless trust no one do i however think its worth 60 when i can buy fallout 3&nv for 5 nah overpriced also this whole setting the price to 75 and then discounting back to its original price is disgusting by rockstar still recommended though and is probably the best open world nonrpg out there
recommended
continues the gta legacy of being epic in terms of scale and story gta online could do with more frequency content updates though eg new heists and missions the lobby system needs to be revamped as well  a lot of time is wasted between loading screens

grand theft auto v is a truly magnificent work of art the city of los santos has an astonishing amount of detail and life to it rockstar has truly made one of the best games ever there is so much to do in the game wether you would like to do missions or go online and play with your friends it is clear that a lot of hard work and effort was made to deliver this masterpiece the graphics are beautiful especially at night when it is raining and you see the reflections on the puddles the story is very well written and witty the gameplay is fluid wether you are playing first or third person for pc gamers that have had to wait 15 years to play this it was worth the wait 1010

grand theft auto v is a solid game but it could be so much better if rockstar fully supported its community mods are a huge part of the pc gaming experience and by opposing them rockstar is only hurting itself edit when i originally wrote this review rockstar had just updated the game and broke modding completely since then they havent really done anything to intentionally hinder the modding communitythough they certainly havent supported it all however my reveiw is still negative due to how poorly rockstar has handled many other areas of the game since launch online is full of hackers and the people who only mod in singleplayer are just as likely to get banned as those who cheat in multiplayer every patch somehow decreases performance and introduces new issues that werent previously in the game others have already mentioned the summer sale fiasco so i wont bother going into detail about how greedy rockstar is overall i would not recommend this game until it is significanly improvedunlikely or heavily discountedeven more unlikely

ive played gta 5 from the console release to the next gen release now finally and most importantly i have begun to play the pc release the differences were subtle from console to console but to go from that to the pc those differences are now striking with almost every graphical option any pc gamer would hope for and a framerate to boot what is old is new again whether you are a new comer or an old one this installment of 5 will no doubt impress

gtav is a game which involves reddit users bang wagoning and making good use of the steam review function for anyone who is wondering this is what people have been complaining about getting banned for using mods online people online using mods and cheating increased the price of the game right before the summer sale except for thats a lie because they didnt increase the price the base game just never went on sale 1110 would look for excuses to complain about everything and anything again

its a great game but rockstars ridiculous policies regarding the modding of the single player game there is no reason to ban people for using mods in the single player side of the game but thats exactly what rockstar is doing the modding was basically one of the main reasons people bought the pc version and now its gone

finallypc release no review needed this game is ing gold nothing more i have to say after edit  1 understood that all people who dont like my review and posting their own not recommended reviews on this game all of them just pointing on rockstar money trick with price b4 summer sale so let me remind you here we have  game review suppose you going to post your review on game not on the game price tere is nothing about game costs and purchase issues looking more than strange while speaking abt  20 usd or euro and all whine and pathetic price posts i see 2 ive almost done with this game on story mode or online online is overflowed by cheatershackers scumbags that is the only negative thing i have to mentioned abt this game hope that rockstar will do some massban patch for all multiusers im just making video screenshots and reporting this  to support from my side works 4 times so far and im more than happy that 4 s using cheats in another game

this game is optimized amazingly well i can max out easily at 1080p with steady 60 fps ive got a 7970 6gb ghz edition with a 4670k now i will say that all of my friends with amd are running this game with absolutely no issues at all however my friends with nvidia are having issues so if youre one of these kids with nvidia running around crying that the game is bad wait until nvidia releases some proper drivers first then see how it runs for you 1010 must buy

i have to tell you that i was really looking forward to this game but seeing a company with 900 employees like rockstar ing up so badly deserves a medal when the game launched it was playable and fun but with every new patch rockstar made the performance worse and worse until it became utterly unplayable for me the memory issues of this game became so terrible that i have to close and reopen the game after every mission because its unbearable to drive around the city with the game freezing every second when it has to load a new building on the horizon people in the forums start arguing over each other that its a problem with the computer and not the game but rockstar confirmed there are memory issues in the game and i have never seen a game perform this badly on my computer before this is a big company at its lowest and its so unnecessary because rockstar generally make good games and i dont consider gta v a bad game but rockstar completely and utterly ruined it this time from the technical side of things they introduced a memory issue with a day1 patch that makes it utterly unbearable to drive around the city and after that they leave this mess for 2 weeks now without a word of when they will fix it no support nothing you know what rockstar you done ed it up the online lobbies are getting more and more empty not only because of people that cant stand playing with the performance issues anymore but also rockstar are banning people for various reasons one of them is getting money thrown at by a supposed hacker so even not hacking can get you banned from online which is pretty scary last night i was looking at my money only to second guess where i got it and if i should report something before i get banned and why are rockstar more concerned about hackers than fixing their own game because if you can cheat money in the game you wont buy their precious shark cards that give you gta money in game for actual real money that you spend is this a mobile game do rockstar really hurt so much for money its a shame look at the recommendations for this game  at the time of this review only 80% would recommend it wouldnt you think a game as groundbreaking as gta v would get a higher score dont give rockstar your money until they get their  together and fix this mess for shame rockstar for shame

recommended
i am having an absolute blast with this game its probably the best game that came out in the previous console generation and this is an improved version of that but i cannot recommend you give rockstar your money because of their horrible business practices rockstar has spoken out about the eula and have clarified that they are not banning for single player modifications however any modification installed even a singleplayer only one is still detected when going online and they are pretty much banning indiscriminately also players have been given two week bans for having money forced on them by modders that is unacceptable and rockstar refuses to lift their bans im changing my review to positive but tentatively if rockstar doesnt clean up their act soon this will return to a negative review and stay that way
recommended
i was apprehensive at first but the launch went more smoothly than any other ive seen preloading worked great even that small issue at the start with people not being able to play the game with them having strange characters wasnt an issue for me the space in my username did not trigger any abnormalities i can say as far as i am concerned that rockstar delivered what was promised ive had an impeccable initial experience and i preloaded and waited for launch everything worked as promised happy to have spent the money even though rockstar kept us the pc master race out of the loop until now id say the wait was worth it

after 2 year gta v has finnaly come to the pc can i reccomend it  yes on the gameplay alone however the story was some what weak and the ending is dull and leaves you wanting more but like i said the gameplay is enough for me to reccomend it i have enjoyed my 33 hours of gameplay and i havent even touched the mp yet

do i recommend this game to my fellow gamers a resounding yes my love for gta fell away after gta4 and sr releases i wasnt expecting to get this so soon but it was gifted to me to play gta online and its completely reinvigorated my love for the franchise between gtao and the director mod this game comes packed to the teeth with tons to just putt around the massive open world this version of san andreas has set a new standard in fully realized sanbox worlds theres some familiar sites from the game of the same moniker but now they are dripping in detail the controls are tight the driving controls are a little floaty for your character but you have stats to level and as you do the  it progresses runstamina swim under waterlung capacity shootingshooting etc so there are rpg elements in that sense in the world the music is awesome i usually listen to my own music in these games but the low down is bringin it from the music to the dj mama g pam grier i find myself driving around in delight listening to the games own music i havent done this since gtasa even saints row never brought the musicradio personality like that online has been cool i ran around and got used to the game in a game full of people and no one messed with me then today i loaded in and got shot down 5 secs into spawning in awesome this was definitely the coolest game ever gifted to me as i feel transported back to the days when gta felt fresh

i dont really need to tell you how good this game is as im sure you know how good it is by now just reading through all the reviews available one thing i can tell you though this is by far the best version out there played it on console for a bit and can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that the pc version absolutely destroys the console version in all aspects ultimately it comes down to this do you like huge open world chaos with amazing game play and amazing graphics and atmosphere then get this you will not regret it the only issue i have with the game is the loading times when leaving an online event during online play it sometimes takes forever

first i needed to wait 1 hour for allocating & extracting and that was painful after playing this game 1 hou i can say that this is 2015s best pc game 1010 would allocate and extract again even if it would take 1 day

its simply awesome ive played through whole gta series and i think that the last one is pretty cool picture is fine even on midrange pcs story is rich and funny sometimes music is various and wellpicked online mode is ok but a bit odd  maybe because of the consoleway but still  highly recommended for everyone and especially for gta fans
recommended
worth the weight
recommended

great game well optimized and runs very smoothly there is simply no argument to be had the pc release of gta v is by far the very best version of the very best grand theft auto game to date
recommended
coming from the ps3 to the master race this is a huge upgrade this game is a must buy and youll never regret your choice this is by far my favorite gta ever since san andreas and vice city pros graphic updates all past dlc included even the collectors edition exclusive vehicles emmersive story great characters first person mode works great smooth 60 fps huge selection of vehicles land and air never gets boring great online that has you playing countless missions to level up and get money gta online transfer system works great for all returning players from consoles online heists cons in gta online it can be hard to get money for everything you want unless you play heists more freaks and geeks can be added the ones already in the game are great
recommended
forget the idiots who perma linked the wrong account this game is bae
recommended
truly amazing the wait was worth it
recommended
1010 would bang easly worth 100 eu so 60ish is a bargain
recommended
i have forgiven r for all the delays if you look the word perfection up in a dictionary itll read grand theft auto v
recommended
the wait to purchase this game on pc was totally worth it the graphics are great but that also means it needs a good pc to run if you havent played this game on the consoles yet this is a no brainer
recommended

bought this game 3 time ps4 xbox360 pc so what do you think
recommended
went into a lobby people being nice in the room asked if we wanted to make an airport party so 5 of us met up and we drove around screwed around and pretty much had a good time so then we got into a plane and flew to the desert we jumped and parachuted down then we proceeded to dirt bike the desert and into the mountain not a single person pulled a gun on me 1010
recommended
it runs like a dream the graphics are a dream its well optimized and is one of the best pc ports rockstar has done in a long  time if you own the xbone and or ps4 version i really dont see a need to pick this up however if you were holding out until the pc version well let me tell you all of your patience paid off

the gta is keeping crashing grand theft auto v has stopped working i want my money back because i cant play it anymore please help me 
recommended
i havent fully played a grand theft auto game since vice city my friends have been raving about grand theft auto 5 and i was on the fence about it because i outgrew the game and wasnt my cup of tea anymore i was wrong i took a chance and bought it and wow i do not regret my purchase one bit d the world looks beautiful granted if you have a decent pc rig to play it the game mechanics are pretty fluid missions are creative and the story is fantastic i was never really interested in the story much for the past gta ive played but this one has gotten me hooked the characters are very memorable and well developed you can easily connect with them at all times i havent ran into many bugs yet in the main story mode the online experience so far is soso the open world and missions that you do are pretty fun against other players although it gets really laggy and glitchy often whenever i play with some friends not sure why this happens but it does kill the mood a little bit overall though its decent but if youre in it for just the online multiplayer portion then i would probably wait a little bit until things get fixed and optimized again thats just my experience i would do a little more research about online experiences from others before purchasing honestly with that little negative asside i could go on and on about how awesome this game is but that would turn this mini review into a book if you dont mind the violence lots of swear words drugs etc then this is a game for you and a must buy d
recommended
one of the best launches i have experienced the game is very well optimized and runs extremely well once you get past the social club stuff its incredible
recommended
definitely a great game  but no more than they had already been previous chapters 
recommended
this game is a masterpiece
recommended
best gta yet i havnt experienced any issues as yet the intertwining storylines and playable charachters are well done and it runs better than watchdogsnuff said  have not tried the multiplayer yet but coop hiests look interesting feedback welcome like the first person view is nice secially while driving and the in care view is more impressive than grid autosport p its a good idea in theory cos you can play it like an fps if you like it but i prefer on foot in 3rd person but rather enjoy driving in 1st the level of customisation for cars is bigger on this which is nice and i have to ask is the rival gang dressed in purple supposed to be a shot at sr my view best gta ever thanks rockstar for bringing this to pc any chance of red dead redemtion
recommended
i use the director mode to crush cars with a flying humpback whale 1010 would whale again
recommended
endless fun gta is back and better than ever do i really need to say anymore
recommended
game is fantastic and welloptimized only issues stem from the community and the lack of a more solid groupparty system for freemode and heists
recommended
delay simulator coming 2014erm 15 1010 would delay again
recommended
amazing port very fun i played they story mode on ps3 a while back and that was fun i have only been playing online on pc and i love all the updates the first person is great and its really fun to play with friends or do a pick up mission and play with randoms hoping they have mics all and all very worth it
recommended
i would like to thank all the console gamers who betatested for the pc version of gta v
recommended
so i will make a quick review of what rockstar gave us edit everything works now so i changed my review from negative to positive
recommended
top 5 pc game of 2015 a must buy 
recommended
i was kind of shocked when i played this game i was expecting a lot more crashes issues with graphics and visuals but i was actually really impressed with rockstar i mean it does crash every now and then but every game in the world crashes it cant be 100% crash free if you have ever played gta iv with all the crashes and the bad textures well then you will love how good rockstar have done with the port to pc its like a peasant game but with heavy graphic mods that dont knock your fps i mean i get around 4090fps on the max settingsvery highultra i can go with these specs  amd fx6300 ocd 41ghz  nvidia gtx 750ti 2gb  8gb 1600mhz ram which i mean this setup above ^^ got me 30 fps on ultra in gta iv and would crash like every 20 minutes i really recommend this game it is sexy and amazing  recommended 
recommended
best game on steam

why are you reading this when you could be playing gtav
recommended
game looks and plays so much better than the console versions of the game
recommended
great game runs great looks great dont listen to the trolls who talk crap about it they are full of it and dont understand half the graphic settings in the first place
recommended
the game is amazing the optimization is great and over all is just the definitive version of gta v i have a video of fps with gtx 760 and fx8320 @ 42 if your curious about how it runs on a mid range system httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo1thol1gta

recommended
holy  this doesnt even feel like a port but a whole new game itself rockstar outdid themselves this time and i can finally forgive them for the crappy gtaiv launch <3
recommended
do you recommend this game i must say yes for the great game
recommended
very good port the story starts dragging a bit after a while imo didnt play the console version so the story is new to me but the heist missions are fun im having way more fun playing gta online though
recommended
if you are an introvert and can sit and play a game for hours on end alone this is the game for you if you are sociable and like playing games with friends this is the game for you if you enjoy going on pointless yet extremely fun rampages this is the game for you this game is nothing less than a masterpiece buy this game
recommended
well we all know the gta franchise is a good one and the game has been out on consoles for about 2 years or more so everyone knows the game is fantastic but finaly it has come to the master platform the platform with the gamers who demand quality and boy did we get it not only does it run at a solid 60 frames but the games over all graphics quality has been improved and very well optimised plus the addition of the rockstar editor which adds an additional layer of creativity and can eat away at your time just as much as playing the game solo or online now if youll all excuse me i have some sports cars to boost and some ballas to obliterate
recommended
this game is simply amazing and addicting the amount of things you can do watch tv make your own radio station play tennis play golf go swimming or diving driving with many car selection bikes aircrafts watercrafts parachuting many game modes and etc the scenery and everything is amazing one of the best games i ever played never spent this many hours on a game in a long time must buy 1010
recommended
im able to play at 27 frames per second max  a true cinematic expirience literrally
recommended
its gta v lol whats there not to love
recommended
outstanding the game features an incredible storyline an outstanding experience and amazing graphics what more could you ask for the game has you take a role of three different criminals each trying to score big you have franklin the hood boy who thinks hes surrounded by idiots michael excriminal legend and traitor to his friends trevor  the insane one absolutely 1010  would recommend anyone to get it unless they hate violence
recommended
great port looks and plays amazingly i highly recommend it
recommended
i saw a dog in the game then i saw mine dog the dog from game was more realistic than mine ___ 1110
recommended
it is beautiful
recommended
even at 1525 fps on low settings i love it heres to everyone with crappy pcs who bought the game anyways
recommended
i picked up gta 5 first on ps3 i gotta say this ones alot better theres more cars more guns better textures higher framerate better shooting and a tiny eensy weensy bit more mature of a community not alot though maybe ive just been getting lucky this is a really great game to let your shiney new high end video cards stretch their legs at the time of writing this i have a gtx770 and i usually get 58fps at high but have chugging issues on ultra when speeding down a congested highway other than that the game runs fantastic controlling the game is a bit odd especially in first person youre going to expect it to control like a halflife or any other fps but you have to remember youre still controlling a 3d models animations from a different perspective so it does take some getting used to driving on a keyboard is a chore but plug in your favorite controller and its as smooth as silk car density is way up car variety too no longer will only mesas spawn till you hike through the woods now dlc cars such as the panto the alpine look alike and the cheetah r spawn traffic is now more erratic though they will constantly juke to stay in your way and ive had on multiple occasions oncoming dive into my lane across double yellows to hit me enemy ai aim seems to of spikes violently too as of the first week of launch online is more or less as good if not a little worse than the ps3 version i had one match where everything was stuttering around but the others have been alright there have been some freezing issues the mod community as of right now is in its infancy and learning to walk all over again i do however fear that installing mods in the future will get your online account banned but only time will tell so no super super fun mods just yet like we had for gta 4 all in all i gotta recommend this game it
recommended
very good game
recommended
this is the best game ever
recommended
i would sacrifice every alpaca in my farm to play this one more time

i would sacrifice every alpaca in my farm to play this one more time

i usually dont write reviews but i am writing this for my friends who might see it this game is a must buy  simple as that
recommended
i previously owned this game on the xbox 360 platform and i have to say is simply wow now rockstar has really out done themselves with a ton of graphical and other technical improvements from the first generation and e3 consoles with the amazing attention to detail this game is an amazing all around experience with thousands of game play material ahead of you if you are experiencing grand theft auto v for the first time and are some how on the fence of buying this game let me just tell you up and front scrape up $60 and buy this amazing game honestly i cannot overstate enough how beautiful this game looks the water texture and not to mention the rain and general overall physics of the game with over a hundred cars and many exciting and unique planes along with the free dlcs added on this game will keep you busy for many years to come now lets not forget the story mode the story mode quite frankly is only 69 missions now we you think of it in the context to the previous grand theft auto games it may seem a little short when in reality every mission is carefully crated and weaves all the characters perfectly into an amazing story line that seems to keep pulling you in deeper as you advance farther along into the story the heists are amazing fast paced adrenaline rushing and creative since you get to plan the heists yourself the only down side to this yet i cant blame rockstar is how limited your planning can go into creating your custom heist with a plan and mostly guided missions and heists in reality you have very little decision making to do except for the end with that out of the way grand theft auto v still tops all of rockstars previous grand theft auto games now on to grand theft auto online now personally im not the hugest fan of gta o and i have not invested myself in the online community just because i dont play it that much doesnt take the fact away that gta o is well crafted and has a friendly interface and overall setup you can do anything from playing fun senseless deathmatches to planning and executing heists with your friends buying apartments and super cars is fulfilling and satisfying when you look over that skyline of los santos now im not saying gta o will be a joywalk with level 150s shooting at you with their heavy snipers blowing up anything they spot it can be frusturating but that should even heighten your drive to gain levels and rp reaching the top of the food chain in los santos this game is amazing and i there are no major problems or criticisms i have this game was masterfully crated and has a well thoughtout map and infrastructure yet the one thing that i really ties the whole game together is the attention to detail by rockstar every graffti mark crack ditch texture blade of grass has been strategically placed there just for your enjoyment i give this game a 9710 because i want to give rockstar that 03 to improve on and give them an incentive to make an even better grand theft auto predecessor
recommended
what an awesome game definitely worth the long wait
recommended
810 without bugs and  mouse acceleration it would be 910 gameplay 710 graphics 810 detailsfinish 1010 loading time 510 replayability 910 playing with friends 910 you are disconnected from each other all the time otherwise 1010 my first game >25 and without any hesitation i can say money well spend
recommended
im still waiting for rockstar support to get back to me
recommended
yep here it is  after half a year of waiting its finally on pc and it was worth it why  well let me explain to you   the pc port is amazing  the graphics are gorgeous and very well optimised  i dont have a beast as a computer but my game run with pretty high graphics with 60 fps  custom radio  online working fine with every single extensions  the fps mode is not to bad but unfortunately the community is still the same so expect a lot of people killing and trolling you for no reason thats why you need friends to play this game
recommended
if you love the grand theft auto series this one lives up to the name and has a great story i have only played for a few hours but i love what i see
recommended
1 its gta 2 its incredibly well optimised 3 graphics are immense 4 lots of options to customise graphics settings 5 in addition to single player gta online is pretty damn fun 6 it runs at 60 fps like they said 7 i want to kick the  out of a 90 year old granny sometimes this game allows me to do just that
recommended
runs perfectly fine smooth as  and i cant put my controller down detailed review coming when ive had enough time with the game to be able to write one that does it justice
recommended
i had it for the xbox and it was like jesus and the pc is zeus
recommended
it runs surprisingly well and has yet to ever drop below 30 fps i generally hang in the 5060 fps region on highultra i only have an 8230 oc to 42 and a r9 270 so you could say this game is very well made and it has many more updates to come
recommended
the best of the best great graphics with great gameplay you will never be bored while playing this game and as a bonus  it grants 100% chance of a mother screaming get of the computer at you
recommended
nothing better then gta games but this is awesome
recommended
amazing game couple glitches but it is still the first week i bet it will be patched
recommended
the singleplayer story is an exhilarating series of increasingly fun missions and if you have the muscle to run it at max settings the visual fidelity is astonishing driving through the city at night in a storm neon signs reflecting in the puddles and on the rainslicked hood of your car it almost looks photorealistic and it all takes place in one of the richest densest most skillfully constructed game worlds ever built the sense of place these details evoke is lightyears ahead of other openworld games and the fact you can share it with other players makes it all the more exciting gta online is a game in itself mixing gtas sandbox chaos with elements of mmorpg 1010
recommended
its pretty good but where can you buy the online cash rockstar come on
recommended
as a person who has never played gta before this is all i could ask for the controls are great and easy to get used to so many ways to customize your character from clothing to tatoos to facepaint you can play alone or with friends online for more fun and points my only complaint is that there is only one location to play on even so this is the golf game pc gamers have been waiting for and deserve hole in one10
recommended
overall gta v online is beautiful but the community not so much when it comes to british & aussy people the second you speak in voice chat they insult you and tell you to shut up like youre not allowed to speak its like these britishaussy kids thinks they own the game ing ridiculous oh and when i meant kids i literally meant it theyre 20 over and theyre still being immature also russians are the ing best when we speak with them they speak kindly to us and its just wonderful british & australian players in this community is by far the worst but in anyway theres only a limited amount of nicer britain aussy players if you want to voice chat freely and not get insulted dont play with aussies or british people unless you know theyre kind people the reason why i said this is because i came up voice chatting with people asking about heist and stuff and this aussy  came on voice chat and told me to shut up like wtf if you dont wanna hear me or even listen to voice chat then get out of pc ing s americans & russians are one of the kindest people in the gta online community
recommended
very impressed by this pc port had low expectations for aaa titles but this didnt let me down
recommended
amazing amazing and amazing best game of the century thank you
recommended
awesome game i lost my job because all i do is play gta v thumbs up
recommended
i really hope they fix itand i cant wait to upgrade my pc and play it

i run out of a truck jump onto a bus from a bridge i grab my grenade launcher i fire it into a helicopter then i jump off the bus i run like a madman for the last copy of gta v on the release date i jump onto a train and escape the military 1010 would blow up a poodle that would cause the army to come

the best game  goodbye life
recommended
this is one of the best games i have played in a very long time the graphics are absolutely stunning the story is engaging and online is great fun the characters are all unique and interesting the missions are crazy and over the top like the very best of action movies there is so much detail packed in and it is a massive improvment over the last gen it is so full of things to do and places to explore also the soundtrack is very good this game is a very well ported very shiny and all up a fantastic polished masterpice 1010 if you have the hardware buy the game
recommended
been playing nonstop ever since this baby dropped the pc port is absolutley stunning its so obvious how they made sure the game was absolutley optomized before release as the game runs smooth as butter even on my low end rig 1110
recommended
realy good
recommended
its a fact that rockstar games is the main reason of some white hairs in our head they delay and then go silent and then delay and then delaybut the thing is that they do it for a reassonand that is why i think that rockstar games are one of the best game publishers out there because they are picky and dont send buggy content this game is the ultimate example for that it took us an eterity to see it on the pc but it was worthed great graphics running smoothly as  great story the name says allgrand theft auto who doesnt like that
recommended
better then the hype p
recommended
i am very disapointed that i purchased this game and i cannot play it i really hope they fix the issue
recommended
ive been a fan of grand theft auto for many years solely playing on the playstation platforms since vice city stories rockstar has fallen short on pc ports everytime especially with gta iv however this time around is a different story rockstar developed this game partially in parallel with the console versions rather than sloppily porting the game from the console version over to pc they did a phenomonal job performance i have a gtx 970 i5 4690k and 16gbs of ram i am able to max basically all graphical options while achieving a solid 60fps this excludes high res shadows extended distance detailing and whatever else is included in the advanced graphics page these options eat up performance for little value in return if you have a lower end system that meets minimum specs you will have no trouble running this game as long as you do not mind turning some settings down things to note  the pc version seamlessly integrates gamepad play so you can use your keyboad for shooting and your controller for driving and find no issues switching over while you play  you can add your own music to a custom radio station which is traditional for pc versions of gta im glad they carried this over however many people are running into performance issues such as texture popins and major framerate decreases when listening to the custom station deemed self radio i have not ran into any of these issues all in all this is with no contest the definitive version of grand theft auto v
recommended
i think this game is awesome i had cople of issues now their gone and now im playing it all time when i can
recommended
welcome to los santos where your fellow players are hostile  that will either murder you or murder your chances of completing a heist also the multiplayer loading times are ing ridiculous and the chance of getting your crew of 4 together to play is lower than winning the ing lottery however this game is ridiculously fun and lets you go on a rampage and kill rednecks and you cant beat that 1010

runs very smoothly for a first day release unlike gta 4 when it came out like like max payne 3 rockstars released this one optimized even though i had my doubts due to the much larger sandbox nature of the game as a sort of fwi the waits were partially due to rockstar being payed off by microsoft and sony to keep the game exclusive to consolesfor a peroid of time can run all on very highultra settings on my rig  i7 4790k 8gb ram amd 280x 65 85 fps dont know how much it compares to current gen consoles still visually better i would guess but this definately looks generations better from the 360 version i bought back in 2013 gta has some neat new features like editor for recording your most epic moments and a first person mode as a bonus story modes great and of course theres lots of fun to have in gta online heists is something i had been looking forward too preordering the game plus delays gave additonal gta online cash plus transferring my existing caharcter from xbox  pc was a quick and easy process so its great i dont have to start from scratch with the pc version for players who havent yet played console version of gta  gta 5 will be a fantastic experience and i would think more enjoyable in short there are guns cars airplanes vehicles of all sorts loads of explosions epic chases epic heists paydays gonna be collecting dust for a bit a great storyline with some comedic parts for comic relief ironical situations 3 characters in single player online mode and plenty of action whats not to like about the game
recommended
runs better than minecraft 1110  tons of fun  a lot of entertaining missions  many unique vehicles  after main story missions there is still a lot of stuff to do  you can either play in first or third person  full of easter eggs and secrets new ones are still being found  amazing graphics  not even a single person wanted me to go bowling with them and i could go on  very long loading time  textures popping up  i can start online and go make a coffee when i return the game will still be loading  i had to return to an older version of the game because the new one did not start but when i joined online i got banned  terrible fov in first person its a good game i dont regret spending my 60 on it and i recommend it to everyone who can run it
recommended
unlike gta iv this is surprisingly well optimized
recommended
played this on my ps4 decided to buy it to play on my pc no regrets what so ever game runs like a charm averaging about 6575 fps with most settings at ultra on an i7 4770k @ 41ghz 16gb crucial ballistix tactical 1866mhz and 2x evga gtx770s sli brilliant game glad i bought it on pc

gta v is really stunning game with an easy to follow plot and the gameplay is pretty open and variedpretty much what youd expect from a varied and open world gaming experience the soundtrack is great the sound effects are great the gameplay is great the multiplayers u c k s b a l l s every five seconds a new loading screen wants to dominate the experience i dont know what it is with rockstar that they have to insist on longa s s e d intros and for whatever reason it aint just the multiplayer loading screens that are an annoyance loading in general is an annoyance  for whatever reason its just too damn long then in an ultra  move rockstar appear to not be willing to support mods on this one it was fine with gta 4 why the  not gta v generally im pretty  that at close to forty quid which is far more in bucks once again it feels like were left with the worst level of butthurt and screw youedness ok game  developers though
recommended
such a different experience on pc that it was on console even with the xbone controller but whatever the change is it is profound and the game feels epic

no point in writing a review about a game everyone already knows everything about its a ing brilliant game and it plays wonderfully on pc buy it now

awesome game whether online or in story mode only thing that annoys me is the loading times within online play other than that if you dont own the game and have faintly concidered it go buy it already
recommended
this is indeed the ultimate edition obviously d i didnt spend all that much time on the xbox one with gta v i did manage to complete the storyline and get to level 60 in multiplayer but that was about it i found the game fun but i was a heavy pc gamer and the graphicsperformance was not up to par for me at all which i expected of course but i was desperate for the game i made a few friends i would play with just about daily weekly then i just quit because it just didnt quite do it for me that is until now the pc version of the game has finally released and honestly this release has impressed me greatly i had absolutely no problems joining the singleplayer then the multiplayer and finally transferring my character which was flawless i managed to encounter just one error which prevented me from joining multiplayer games with people but that was due to me network software special to my mobo had the priority of the game too high once i lowered it i was golden had this same issue with arma 3 where server list wouldnt load and cause game to freeze when attempting to load it now how does the game feel it feel quite good it does have the slight input delay that weve experienced before with the last gta iv but not nearly as bad and it actually works pretty well the performance of the game is pretty well i am sure it will improve over time with some patches but it is very well playable i am getting around 8095fps on a mix of highvery high settings the flying controls are not the greatest but they will do for now need to try reconfiguring the keybindings and see if i cant make it better or now default uses combination of asdw keys and your 4865 keypad keys not really ideal for me but it works in closing this is what i have been waiting for they did a lot of great work on the pc version of this game and i have no problem recommending it to people

when an automatic sniper rifle is more powerful than an assault rifle at close range there are balance issues when the hand held lock on rocket launcher can be free fired locked onto cars and insta kills choppers and planes with the choppers having a very low chance of avoiding and the lock on missile launcher is available at level one while it is more powerful than the rocket launchers on any of the military vehicles including planes and choppers there are balance issues still a fun game bust stuff like that is incredibly annoying to sum it up the dlc weapons are op and ruin game balance remove them

i never cared for the previous gta titles but this one is a winner awesome story mode wonderful graphics and sound detailed immersive gameplay and the online mode is fantastic with friends the cons are the matchmaking issues that plauge this game very adult oriented which is great except i often hear childrens voices while playing multiplayer
recommended
same as xbox 360 just with better fps all in all still a great game
recommended
the best game ever 1010  thank you rockstar youre the best game in da world
recommended
best game ever it looks amazing and it runs so good on my gtx970 at 1440p maxed
recommended
so far so good im running win81 a 4790k sli gtx 780s and 16gb of ram the game is installed on a 7200rpm hdd i realize some people are having technical issues and i understand that can be very frustrating but trust me when i say its worth it these are probably some of the nicest lighting effects ive seen in a game i have every setting maxed out except for msaa txaa and the high detail shadows my vram is my bottleneck unfortunately so adding any of those options puts me into the 3040fps region i am running the game at 1440p so this is a pretty demanding setup in the city im sitting in the 6080fps region and in the country areas its 4050fps or so i do notice that when driving very fast across the map i hit moments of 30fps and im not sure if this is because of the game loading the next section of the map or if its because my settings are too high theres a ton of vegetation in the country areas so one way or the other ill even out some settings to get 60fps constant if possible as for the story and gameplay its gta i played through the entire game on the xb360 version so i have less motivation to play the main story currently but i assume its basically just the same and the main story was awesome on xb360 so i cant see why it wouldnt be just as good here one thing i really noticed is that the cutscenes are actually enjoyable to watch now the console cutscenes ran so slow and choppy it was hard to even pay attention to the story but so long as your settings are done correctly they will run at a nice 60hz and it becomes much easier to get sucked into the story just understand what youre buying its still gta just like the console version but with a lot of great new visuals and online features if youre looking for a game to really tax your system this is it

entertaining polished and decently optimized game the game has much less issues than gta iv and has an array of options and satisfactory hardware scaling both the campaign and multiplayer are good the campaign revolves around 3 people working together to perform crimes you switch control between them throughout the story you have a cell phone that is essentially a menu in the online mode you are in the same location as the campaign minus all of the missions replaced with a selection of online activities including multiplayer heists and races the cell phone is also used to accept or invite random or known people to activities negatives  walking indoors is painfully slow  npcs also walk annoyingly slow  when joining an online activity the game will exit servers to join one even if it is full while understandable switching servers takes about 30 seconds causing you to take a really long time to end up in an activity that is not full though you can queue to join it as it empties this can be fixed by implementing something to check if the server is full before trying to join  maybe this isnt much of a negative but traffic lights take a long time to change if you plan on playing that way
recommended
perfect port of the game so far only issue i ever ran into was a single instance of the game freezing so i had to altf4 it most likely caused by network issues with gta online during launch day im not seeing any framerate drops or issues with startup at all and ive launched the game at least a dozen times now highly recommend

not a console port with grand theft auto 5 finally released on pc and me putting over 25 hours of gmeplaye tied in with single and online multiplayer it is safe to say that this game is nothing like a port if anything this game feels like it was made for pc this game is really optimized with me having a gt750m and a quad i7 i can run the game smoothly with graphics that are a mix with current and next gen consoles graphicsdoing anything you can think of grand theft auto 5 really is a masterpiece everything from driving to shooting feels fluided and natural to the player and you wont think twice about ever going back to grand theft auto 4 new city new fun grand theft auto 5 takes place in the updated san andreas giving the city new life you can do almost anything in this city from golf tennis hunting scuba diving gasstation holdups and more the property management is making a return from grand theft auto san andreas with an updated system for it you can buy docks along with bussiness and make money on the side also added as the addition of first person mode which you look through the eyes of the person you are playing as also if you are in a car in first person mode you will find that the speedometer and the gear changer works just fine giving you accurate information about what gear you are in as well as how fast you are going also lets not forget the rockstar editor which allows you to make your own videos and movies in grand theft auto the fun never ends if you thought that grand theft auto 5 could not get no better than you have not seen online yet you can do even more stuff online as well as meet some new and current people through out your adventure in grand theft auto online it is amazing the stuff you can do online from buying your own house to leveling up and buying new weapons and items the fun really never ends online review this game is a one of a kind that does not feel like a port along with first person mode and the rockstar editor going back to grand theft auto 4 is a no if you have anything above a gt9800 you should get this game you wont regreate it and you will become attacheted to grand theft auto 5 never wanting to let it go i give grand theft auto 5 a 55 star rating
recommended
this game is amazing fun all the interactible actives and coustumizable cars and weapons and clothes this game is amazing rockstar put so much detail into there game to make it feel like a real city one issue why does my account have to be locked up if i cant read the security code please remove this
recommended
i like the gta serie but always wonder why controls must be that complicated the story is nice and you have so much happening around you which makes it interesting to just watch what is going on the graphic looks very good to me but even with good hardware i wouldnt set everything to ultra to get stable high fps i keep rockstars settings when you start the game the first time they are already very good and give me stable 100 fps what i dislike is the complicated way to team up with your friends there seem to be no real group feature like in most other pc multiplayer games or i didnt find it yet this is a must have if you want to play with friends you should be able to create a group invite your friends and then do missions when ever you want or drive around in the city the way it is at the moment you have to create a session invite your friends and as soon as you start a mission you again have to invite them before the party is full after the mission finished you often end up in another random session and again have to invite your friends sorry but like this it is just to complicated another thing i hope they will add is the possibility to change the video record folder i use an extern hdd for video editing but they force you to keep free space on your windows partition because the recorded videos are saved there and you cant change that without setting your whole windows documents folder to another hdd you get in trouble if you use an extern hdd for documents folder since you dont always have it pluged please change it except those few things i am realy enjoying the game and i hope rockstar listens and change some things to make it even better

its grand theft auto 5 my favorite gta game on pc this game already kicks  on consoles but this is by far the best version of grand theft auto 5 i have played the ps3 xbox 360 and ps4 versions and the pc version tops them all better frame rate better graphics supporting resolutions above 1080p directx 11 features and higher resolution textures and by opinion better controls mouse & keyboard if you have not purchased this game yet what the hell are you waiting for go and hit that add to cart button and buy this game already i will see you online
recommended
i logged over 100 hours in less than a week i hate to admit it but that was after hours upon hours were played on my xbox one and before that my 360 this game is addictive in ways that even world of warcraft cannot fathom the joy the pure unadulterated joy of unloading a clip into an unsuspecting players face and seeing the screen flash white indicating youve ended his life is uncomparable in almost any video game hearing the anger through the surprisingly decent ingame voip from the poor  you just decimated just adds to that joy everything about this game is perfect the visuals are stunning the sounds are on point  gunshots are crisp and clear vehicles sound like actual cars  planes  boats and not lawn mowers moments in the singleplayer game have an eery sounding backdrop that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck at one point during the story i switched to trevor trevor is a psycopathic businessman to put that kindly upon switching trevor woke up i had no clue where in the world i was but the game made it feel as if it was extremely cold and windy looking around i found myself atop a mountain with a few dirt trails leading in different directions i thought to myself damn this guy really got himself in a pinch here i had no clue that it was about to get much much worse trevor was wearing nothing but hiking boots and a frilly dress with flowers on it the dress was rather soiled but id rather not speculate as to why i decided to start heading down one of the trails that seemed to lead back towards civilization and stumbled falling facefirst down the trail my health depleting i gathered myself at the bottom of my 5050 facegrind and trevor dusted himself off i took a little bit more caution this time going it a bit slower but albeit not losing the little bit of health i had left on the side of a cliff two elk elk whitetail deer gazelle i dont know what they are ran past me in what seemed to be a hurry i was wondering if maybe i had spooked them when falling but soon realized that it was not me at all that had spooked them i heard the whine cry growl of the mountain lion before it was upon me i jumped in my computer chair as the mountain lion leapt i died 1010 would play with wildlife again

i just love this game the heists the missions everything 1010 and its running smooth at 60 fps  pros running smooth hours of fun cons taking a long time to join gta online sometimes
recommended
having played the older version on ps3 this is a huge upgrade new customzation options better framerate first person is a sweet addition and fun to play with especially driving for me the launch for online was not as bad as i expected it to be when the game first came it it was beyond horendous and even when heists came it it was bad but so far i havent had much problems online
recommended
its pretty good
recommended
its gta what else you need to know yeah its a good port just buy this game its woth it bye i am going to the stripclub in 60fps
recommended
this game has  10 out of 10
recommended
could play at launch only had one unexplained crash story mode is alright multiplayer needs a bit of stability improvement but graphics and average fps are topnotch this is how pc games should be released instead of bullspit deadlines and moronic overhype just wish it would have come out sooner than waiting so long for two generations of consoles to betatest
recommended
is the game $60 have you played it before on a console no then yes i would say its worth $60 if you have played it before did you like it no then stop reading this and dont buy it yes you played enjoyed it and now you want it in all the eyecandy glorry  yes assuming you have a good system as for myself even at the $60 price point ive clocked over 60 hours of play so a i have too my time on my hands i dont but this game is addicting and b its a $1hr just on the single player mode  making this a good buy on entertainment per dollarhour ratio factor dont have a great system but want the pc glory wait for sale youve enjoyed the meat of the content already and you might be disapointed watching all the flaws of your system nock the game down notch by notch dont have a top of the line system but never played the game conservate side in me says wait for a steam sale and have a blast with it being discounted in price however as mentioned before i broke the dollarhr barrier with just single player mode very pretty game in 4k resolution & high textures driving around at night durring a thunder storm was pretty all in all i love the questionable life lessonsdialog from fictional psycotics while indulging in so much eyecandy it gives my optic nerve fibers diabetes if this game ever gets on linux platform i would consider this a must buy aaa title then again linux graphics drivers still have a long way to go so gta on linux is a pipe dream
recommended
much better than console versions
recommended
ok i edited my review because after the new patch everything seems to work fine it really sucks that when the launcher was crashing and i was unable to play everybody just assumed that my system iwas  and i didnt know anything about computers when it was rockstars problem steam support community doesnt exist we should help each other not critize everyone pcs what a bunch of 10 years old rockstar fanboys saying that the game is awesome and you should buy it right now but you already knew that

well i wasnt expecting such a wonderfull job from rockstar its defenitelly one of the best ports and optimizations ever made nvidia 860m mid end mobile graphic card runs it on 1080p all settings on at 30 60 fps ill post some updates later on the core of the game so far one of the best gta from all series thank you and congratulations to a r for a well done job 100% worth the money
recommended
easily one of the best games i have ever played in my life a great game that becomes legendary when cruising los santos with your crew of friends killing other players and enemies alike both the singleplayer campaign and the gta online aspect are amazingly well done and offer  at least  hundreds of potential hours of gameplay owning property a fleet of cars aircraft an armada of vessels  and an arms cache that rivals a us military surplus in an online environment beautifully crafted by a masterful developer such as rockstar  running at glorious 1080p 60fps seriously whats not to love
recommended
its a good port and an amazing game
recommended
unbelievable the coders from r have been porting the game for almost 2 years but they didnt think about the owners of the modern laptops with 2 gpus im not even able to launch the game upd ive managed to run the game by disabling my second gpu and then enabling it but i hope the devs will fix this as soon as possible the game is gorgeous no doubt about that upd 2 i should make a huge remark the game optimization is just outstanding r did a great job here everythings running smoothly on my 3yearold multimedia laptop with high details in 1080p just amazing

gta v  pc an amazing masterpiece perfectly developed to pc performance wise itself its a majestic creation the freedom of tweaking any graphical setup is just amazing the game itself maximizes the potential every single aspect of your gpu & resources unlike other games that play horribly even when you have an overkill rig im talking to you cod aw >> gta offers graphical optimization to its finest no problems with launching or first time set ups if you read the negative reviews youll see how its mostly people complaining about launching problems or whatsoever ask them about their rigs and you will know their problem so make sure you meet the necessary requirements before you purchase the game or else you will have a bad time this is a really spec critical game and if you have the minimal or recommended sepcs be sure you know that only applies to lowmedium range settings and dont expect to be able to max everything out gameplay wise day 2 so far the game runs flawlessly no glitches no stuttering no controls or any kind of issue found smooth 60 fps environment insanely gorgeous people & animals look and feel natural everything is so vivid movement isnt as sloppy as the consoles versions random events that happen all over los santos just pop out of nowhere it is definitely worth the upgrade from xb1ps4 you can feel the huge difference in performance & limitations that consoles had compared to pc it is a whole new gta experience in conclusion gta v pc what gta v was meant to be it is definitely the definitive edition and more 2010  im happy rockstar took all the time they needed to make of this game a masterpiece that it should have been in consoles
recommended
did the countdown from 10 mins before the release and actually started to tear up then i manned the  up and played the first mission and almost cryed again i had to stop because if a game can do that to me i probably need to get a girlfriend oh wait gta v is out aint nobody got no time no more
recommended
looks amazing when i finally managed to stop it from crashing every 5 minutes didnt seem to have any problems from r social club either like i said it looks incredible i can nearly max it out with an amd r9 270x make sure you download the updated drivers pushing the textures detail up too high seems to make it a bit twitchy but still looks lovely 1010 would develop another stomach ulcer due to stress from figuring out why it kept crashing and thinking id just wasted 3999 on an unplayable 60gb parasite again
recommended
i think i have played this game too much since it came out continues to play  damn this is fun
recommended
amazing definately my favourite game in the last 2 year would pay every penny for it and would recommend it to anyone 1010
recommended
couldnt run people over much more easily  1010
recommended
it looks like rockstar managed to get pc versions done properly  first max payne 3 and now this masterpiece though it was annoyingly late to release well done rockstar keep it up for gta6 and ill be able to forget gta4s horrible pc port now all i need are those reallifecar mods
recommended
i tried this game out on my bothers xbos didnt like it just couldnt hit anything but now ive got a mouse and keyboard im like the terminator doing 4 man missions alone and i like i have the chance to this i also like the phone interface it looks alot like the internet where the cursor always gives you the middle finger the game is fun the driving which i normally dislike is quite good the shooting even without the auto aim crap is easy and it feels nice to get lots of money at the end of a big heist one thing i really dont likeis the player base i know youre supposed to be some sychotic mass murderer but come on i was going to ammunation i had a grand total of 0 bullets in my only gun the vintage pistol and yet someone shot me in the back if you want to kill another insane guy map shows how trigger happy someone is by giving them a scale of red on their blob on the map go at it hes probably been annoying alot of people if youve successfully stolen a tank or jet blow up all you want its literally all you can do with it  alot of players want to take the challange of beating a tank
recommended
one of my favorite games of all time after nearly 2 years of waiting finally hits the pc this is a musthave game for all pc gamers even if your computer cant run the game on max settings the game is beautiful and runs at a decent framerate this is one of the best pc ports i have ever played and is probably the best one rockstar has ever released definitely better than gta ivs travesty of a port the games launcher can be wonky at first social club isnt particularly great and certain new features arent fully fleshed out such as the first person mode overall this is a must have definitely one of the best games to come to pc and definitely one of the greatest games of all time buy this game

most people got their game running and a few dont its maybe on their side not the game first time i installed it on launch day its smooth and running maxxed everything out and i am happy with the result from 90120 fps on high and 6080 fps on ultravery high over all i am happy with the game been playing it since it launched on the 360 money well spent recommended to all of gamers out there not for kids tho
recommended
it didnt work and i had to disable my graphics card and reenable for it to launch but i could care less because this is one of the best games ive ever played best in class at everything smooth as butter runs better than gta iv on my computer single player is worth it alone gta online is worth it alone
recommended
gta plays well @60fps now thats all you need to hear folks

great game but wait its not 100% fine with my pc ^ing large map that i spent 20 hrs in game and still explored 40% of it ^the graphics look great i thought watch_dogs gonna win this game about the graphics but no unfortunately the game is running fine with my gtx970 maxed settings but its unplayable stuttering when i drive fast or hit the lamb postin max settings ^singleplayer story provides tons of activities to do ^player with controller always win in bike online racing trevors ability  god mode i give this game 910 if r fix the stuttering problem ill give it 99910 for those who getting stuttering follow these settings distance scaling  almost 0 grass quality  normal particle  normal vsync  on turn off everything in advanced graphics i dont know if this works for everyone but it works for me even still getting micro stuttering but the game is playable now

awesome game runs smooth as silk on my evga gtx 970 ftw edition game loads up fairly quiker then on consol game never drops below 7080 frams and stays in around 90120 on very high settings driving is awesome same with the flying but you need to get used to the flying a bit all i can say is that it was worth the wait 1010 only down side is that there are a few bugs in the game when doing hiests  missions when you freeze up on one screen also i get maybe a few lag spikes ever 510 minutes which is no biggy and can be imporved in future patches
recommended
its gud m8 buy now
recommended
its finally here and i can say it is well worth the wait the game looks great and runs very well with max settings rockstar did a great job on this
recommended
game works for me looks great runs great but here is a little food for thought for everyone who pre ordered and is ing you are the problem stop pre ordering this day in age you can follow tons of youtubers whos job it is to give you a review and they could tell you to hold onto your 70$ till this game gets patched you will  and cry all day and demand your money back but you wontit will get patchedand you will end up pre ordering gta 6 or any other game that offers you a pre order with a special bundle you all fuel this kind of shoddy work and guess what as long as these companies still get pre order money they are obliged to launch a game on the date they stated instead of doing what they did back in the day and delay the launchrelease i will say from looking at all the reviews negitive and positive this game might not be for everyone just until you can play the game without sorting through files and going through the steps that game devs get paid for also for anyone who wants to know i did not pre order to clarify i recommend this game but from 14k of total users who wrote comments it looks as though 20ish% cant play this game without a hassle so if you like to gamble go for it but dont  you have been warned

recommended
this is the clearest smoothest sharpest mind boggling piece of eye candy on steam as of 4142015 i would recommend this game to anyone who has the money and the time to work towards an adder or a sultan rs the game play is very soft and very attracting within the first five minutes of me playing this game i zoned out of the outside world when i played gta v online this game is amazing on the master race of gaming the pc if you play the game long enough i promise you will get your moneys worth out of it it may be expensive but let me tell you that this game is worth every cent
recommended
this is one of the most if not the most optimized pc port i have ever played it was worth waiting the many delays please note that ive already played 50% on the xbone i got the pc version because it was a bit too hard to control on the xbone the game runs very well even though i meet the minimum specs there are a ton of options that you can control to increase the graphical fidelity the game even has a monitor to show how much video memory you are using up with the game i have never seen that before and its really nice if you have an outofdate gpu im not going to spoil any of the game for those who havent played this masterpiece but what i will say is that it is beautifully done pros extensive options menu excellent story amazing voice acting fluid gameplay gunplay is really fun and rewarding tons of missions and side missions plenty of activities like golf and tennis characters are wellwritten graphical fidelity is amazing if you have a good gpu environments are welldetailed the director mode is an amazing pconly feature i cant think of any more this game is awesome go buy it if you can spare the money cons you need a really powerful gpu to get the most out of this game shooting a gun while driving is really difficult although that can be changed in the options

garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
long story short for people who love gta and want to play singleplayer only this is for you if you want to play online you will probably get killed by hackers and guess what rockstar does nothing about it there is no simple way to report players so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers game itself 1010 gta online 310 hackers everywhere edit this is itdecided to improve my flying skills all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane i didnt press anything freezes and thats it cant move at all some sort of hack joined another session after few minutes i noticed two people with godmode on so i went passive mode but guess what they started shooting cars at me and i died about 10 times i advice you not to buy this game at all
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
great game honestly but bumping the price to 8000usd before the summer sale just to be able to say 25% off is a scum move
not recommended
does not work for me work arounds do not work will not update or give a good review untill this is fixed update after learning i have to disable my graphics card and renable it after launch i got the game working there are some bugs with random disconnects in heists that are halting my progress where people re disconnected from the session randomly there is alo a glitch that makes your character look at itself and you cannot see what your character is doing untill someone kills themselves to restart teh mission other than those glitches the game is good and i enjoy playing it i have binge played it for a couple days now
recommended
the game itself is great played it on xbox with no problem however there are issues with the pc version settings dont save  i have to set to dimensions and full screen every time storyline wont load  ive completed repossession but complications wont start if i tab out of the game i cant open it again  i have to close it and run it again game 1010 game transfer 010

i played gta 5 for the first time on my ps4 and i was amazed at the quality of the graphics and the quality of the story after finally building my gaming pc and gta 5 finally being released on pc i thought that the graphics would just improve a little but i was totally wrong after installing gta and running it for the first time i could definitely tell the increase in graphics i would totally recommend you to go and get this game if you have already played it either on a 360 or the current consoles i would totally recommend getting it again if your pc can handle it of course
recommended
first time i ran this game i tried the benchmark and failed 10 would fail benchmark again
recommended
this was well worth the wait
recommended
holy  its better optimized than gta4 initial impressions the huge load time that commences when youre installing the game even after preloading it was kind of a turnoff for me but simply the option to preload it was enough when i started the game i honestly didnt know what to do at first was i going to spend more time on this than just doing the story mode in gta4 which took 74 hours i knew that i would this would take me at least a year or two to get tired of and that lovely framerate obviously since my pc rig is what most people would call standard for gaming but definetely not a beast i indeed have to run it in windowed mode with some reduced settings and such but it never felt intrusive i know how demanding this game is on any system but being able to run at 53 fps is good enough for me even on these high not ultra settings 1920x1200 is no longer my native resolution but i wish it was its now 2560x1440 and windowed mode can be distracting at certain points but never when im extremely focused on the game this proves that rockstar gets the message optimization is key to making a good port of such a big game like this gfwl go  yourself speaking of which i still find the harmless drm social club to be mildly unsatisfying simply drm in general when it comes to a pc game im looking at you gfwl and uplay is unnecessary and breaks the pace of certain games like the classic gta4 and its sad excuse for playability with games for windows live always watching even though i got around these drm issues in the past and it was really difficult making a microsoft account in a pc and having to find a working clone of the gfwl marketplace install it in the correct location where gta4 will read it and then enter the code and then make a social club account gta4 itself was just horrendously optimized for the pc as a whole even without gfwl however since ive faced these issues before in other games in gtav it was so much easier all you have to do is enter you friggin username and password for social club press agree about 7 times each in a different page and then you can play gtav no problem while i was hoping for no drm this while still drm was nowhere near as y as games for windows live securom and social club combined im proud to say that this social club is finally fully optimized for this game as well as the game itself being fully optimized for the pc my pc while not the best still manages to pull off above 50fps with medium to high settings the only major negative i have to this is that sigh rockstar is still using social club as a means to play multiplayer for s sake rockstar just use steam willingly all multiplayer aside though it still manages to run better than gta4 and with all of these delays waiting and stress that rockstar probably had releasing this game thats all that really matters i just hope that in the future i dont know gta episodes from los santos that multiplayer is 100% dependent on steam and not social club i can forgive the console versions for this but this game is too good for the pc as a whole that i dont care too much for the multiplayer and social club it runs and thats all that matters i personally have never played gtav on the console because simply put i dont have one i have a wii and wii u but nothing else and you know why because i have a pc ive only seen some mild gameplay footage of this game on the console and really nothing else because i knew the pc version would be the better one i cant say for certain what i think about gtav yet especially since its been released for less than 48 hours as of these impressions but i can say that the future is not looking bleak

love this game few bugs here and there but this game coming out on pc has been amazing for those who have been thinking about getting it seriously do  great with friends  pvp is amazing and actually quite fun with a bit of an challenge   heist is abit buggy  gta online is abit buggy too  only notice servers lag for 10 seconds every 4 hours my experience so far

this game had more bugs and problems then i thought it would have do not buy it now if youre afraid you wont be able to play it the minute youve finished the download it says i got 13 hours gameplay  not much  but 2 hours of those 13 is from infinite loading screens that have never ended im still searching for a solution but havent found any and right now it feels like ive just thrown away 60 for nothing if you feel lucky then buy it its ing awesome once you can play

took long enough but worth the wait the game runs smooth and looks great on pc ive never had this much fun on gta v since the game first released
recommended
i have bought this game on three diffrent systems xbox 360 ps4 and now pc as expected pc is better than both even though i had already completed the story missions twice before i didnt feel bored completing it for a third and final time the story is great it provides great entertainment and hours worth of fun you can play as three main chracters each with hugely diffrent personalities this helps to keep the story intresting you also have side missons called strangers and freaks missions for each chracter even without the story the singleplayer still provides plenty to do such as exploring the beautiful city and the breath taking surrounding area you wont run out of things to do on gta v gta v also comes with gta online which allows you to play with your friends or complete strangers this adds extra hours of entertainment the online is much better than gta ivs gta online uses a seperate chracter for online activities obviously and this chracter can do missons for various chracters to gain exp and level up now gta online includes heists which are amazing to play but require a team of 4 to completebar the first mission which requires 2 these heists help add even more hours of entertainment to the game now to the graphics i play the game on high at about a median of 50fps i would say the game the game is well optimized and doesnt provide too much of a challenge to run if intrested or if you want to compare my specs are amd fx8320 nvidia geforce gtx 760 8gb ddr3 ram1600mhz even for returning players gta v introduces director mode and rockstar editor this allows you to film and edit your own movies a great addition to the pc version httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqhkky1pitu0  example of director mode here please dont mind the self promotion  tldr amazing game with great graphic a must buy ps feel free to add me on gta onlinesteam rs social club name wiggazfiggaz

1010 easily goty also a great loading screen simulator
recommended
i keep it short i will list the good and bad things about this game good  open world with a lot of stuff to do  first person view  many options for video and controls etc  wide variety of vehicles bad  too many things force you into cutscenes or scripted events  no full customization in single player mode  long loading times during activities in online mode  no fluent transition between sandbox play and doing activities everything will force you into menus and loading screens  main story characters switch to their default clothes every time you switch character  unreliable system to store vehicles vehicles might disappear and its impossible to buy bicycles even when having an empty garage  forced to play with story characters you might not like and having to sit trough every degenerate thing they say and do is painful it could learn a thing or two from the saints row games when it comes to customization and fluent game play but its still a decent game overall i would rate it a 710
recommended
great game

1010 would wait 4 years again

the experience on pc is simply amazing with my gtx 970 i get an average of 5565fps in the cities at highultra x2 msaa the mouse and keyboard works flawlessly and the gamepad too gamepad for driving mouse shooting i have a adata 256gb ssd but my game still take an average of 45 to 60 seconds to fully load the game the first person fov is horrible it gives me headaches after a while when you die in a heist you screen freeze on your characters instead of going in the sky even on a ssd and visibility at max objectspedestrians and cars still pops out of no where i recommend this game even if you already have it on console
recommended
its a really good game nice graphics the graphics amaze me but i have been getting random fps drops to the point where the game is unplayable is anyone else getting those too or is it just me i do have a somewhat pretty good computer but even with the graphics down as low as it can get i get around 5070 fps but random drops to around 2040 fps maybe its just me i dont know anyway excellent game as always rockstar defiantly worth the wait the computer is also an amd i dont know if thats also a problem
recommended
the pc port for gta iv was a disaster so im glad that they didnt  this release up works perfectly with everything maxed out and youll stay above 60fps 99% of the time atleast with a gtx 980 4gb card if youre not mentaly handicaped or have parents from hell then i see no reason for why you havent gotten this yet hell you should have gotten it back in 2013  game looks amazing but the sound effects for the guns are terrible unfortunatly

its finally out have played much of the online and its amazing totally worth the delays perfect game all the way hands donw heists are beautiful the game its self is too and it runs much smoother than i thought it would love the game so much <3 id rate 1010

recommended
entertaining polished and decently optimized game the game has much less issues than gta iv and has an array of options and satisfactory hardware scaling both the campaign and multiplayer are good the campaign revolves around 3 people working together to perform crimes you switch control between them throughout the story you have a cell phone that is essentially a menu in the online mode you are in the same location as the campaign minus all of the missions replaced with a selection of online activities including multiplayer heists and races the cell phone is also used to accept or invite random or known people to activities negatives  walking indoors is painfully slow  npcs also walk annoyingly slow  when joining an online activity the game will exit servers to join one even if it is full while understandable switching servers takes about 30 seconds causing you to take a really long time to end up in an activity that is not full though you can queue to join it as it empties this can be fixed by implementing something to check if the server is full before trying to join  maybe this isnt much of a negative but traffic lights take a long time to change if you plan on playing that way
recommended
perfect port of the game so far only issue i ever ran into was a single instance of the game freezing so i had to altf4 it most likely caused by network issues with gta online during launch day im not seeing any framerate drops or issues with startup at all and ive launched the game at least a dozen times now highly recommend

gta has been a favorite series of mine since the first game in those days it was very convenient for party play pop in some cheats and hand off to the next person when you died nobody did the missions except if you were the only one playing this trend continued on into 2 and 3 where multiplayer either did not exist or on pc couldnt get it to work easily or didnt matter the real first experience with multiplayer i had was multi theft auto for vice city from that moment on the dream of multiplayer gta meant stupid impossible feats san andreas reached that peak in singleplayer but lacked multiplayer beyond coop sad gta has many capacities for gta v you have to take the game as two seperate parts delineated on borders of functionality gta online is to a lesser degree an excellent game however the reason one would play gta online is because singleplayer after finishing the story becomes a dull boring affair with little of the emergent content present in gtao that emergent content however is dull too once youve become accustomed to it if you have imagination gta any gta can be enjoyable i will discuss both gtao and gta v in each facet to help you determine whether this game is a heap of dog crap or a brilliant postmodern mockery of sandbox games first of all gtao has microtransactions and it is stupid it goes against everything imaginable for a decent company like rockstar to engage in this nonsense microtransactions are a nuisance and a microeconomy of fake money injected into games using your real money it is unscrupulous and unethical and i think this personally that it is a great albeit evil business model gtao might be preying on stupid casual or lazy players who suck at gta are 12 and have moms credit card or weary marriedtooyoung males who work a lot and just buy their way to success in p2w games still endorsing a dave and busters style microeconomy of optional pay walls to content is tantamount to encouraging it even if you plan to gain marginal sales on their shark cards they made a lot of money actually gtao and singelplayer suffer from the same gameplay issues that every gta eventually runs into gtao makes up for lack of minigames and activities by always adding more content over time as of yet singleplayer is dead due to no new content injection a major change to the gameplay is the quality of graphics and the new viewpoint the firstperson view adds immense icing on the cake of new graphical fidelity which puts the game far ahead of any competitor even when textures look like runny jpeg slosh the aftereffects and great breadth of options mean that even without texture modding the game will look fine for quite a while gta iv is still getting new leases on life because both games leave a lot of room for personal taste for modders to eventually exploit and manipulate to get more intensive graphics yet to be seen but the game just came out the lowest generation versions ps3 and 360 were quite bad looking washy textures and terrible aliasing abounding but the games still had excellent visionary quality for that generations horribly gimped graphical power its quite an achievement that even on low settings the game is functional functional is the least i can say for games since the last big sandbox games i played a lot black flag and watchdogs were pretty pretty  they were functional messes at their best and glitchy contorted eppileptic siezures at worst gta v on pc still has glitches though i have had few popin issues and crashing but its far more stable than many multiconsole portmishmash games ive been uncomfortable playing a major issue i have with these games that is gta vs various versions is that as updates and content have been implemented there is a major difference between singleplayer and multiplayer drivinghandling configurations cars go slow or faster depending on the patch and theres awful discrepencies even in online alone between the lag you experience when i do normal missions in full servers on this pc version i rarely experience floating cars and popin now in every heistrelated mission there is lag popin invisible cars and fgloating cars dropping in on me consistent with ps3 my previous generation version rockstar expends a lot of energy issuing small oneday patches that clear up exploits and glitches but not ones that functionally break the game no they focus on exploits and hacking related to people griefing or making money taking away from their shark card revenue or duplicating cars this goes handinhand with contentious still approaches to bad sports i have never even been fully on bad sport lobbies but i hate that you cannot avoid it accidental car destructiuon happens constantly gta iv had many of the greater qualities that made fancreated multiplayer especially samp so much fun in other words we need to stop having draconian rules about personalvehicles implement a server list so people can implement rules like no cops or no personal vehicle insurance claims being able to ban or give tanks to players outside of missions would be a plus more control of the lobbylike free mode would make this game immensely better gta iv multiplayer was enjoyable yet i do not want to give up new ideas like persitant weapons or personal vehicles but insurance and whatnot is so superfluous and pointless that i cannot stand it i get it rockstar sticky bombing peoples cars in a game about robbery and murder is a bully behavior from the guys who made a great game called bully the soundtrack is excellent though a lot of wierdness comes from the ambient soundtrack i just wish there was a seperate soundbar for just that ambient music the roster of artists is very good varied large one feature i wish would one day be added is updates with new music after launch a pipedream i know but gtao is being built on a longterm profit and update model as for the sound effects they are superb the game has a quality more like gta iv where i dont hear a lot of the sam pedestrian dialogue but it also falls in line with an overly serious tone the game takes no quotable dumb pedestrian lines as for story and this is my final topic i can only be brief theres many elements to the characterizations and the cast that makes the game a compelling game and not some cinematic experience there are definitely moments where it goes over into that territory but often this is temporary and is pointed out we are not given characters that fall down under examination or have no criticism from the world beyond police and an antagonist there is selfdeprecation and there is deprecation from these characters families and friends as for the preachy leftwingrightwing saoccer momsocial justice warrior critiques of this games treatment of lgbt topics this game is incredibly fair and kind to everyone involved major themes critique the protaganists their society and the enemies that motivate the main characters youre going to feel sorry for things you do i dont know how this is any less a story about reluctant criminals than the previous in 3 its forced revenge to deal with a romantic betrayal in vice city its forced independence to escape your betrayers in san andreas its forced everything by everyone often because of their crimes and weakness gta iv was about an immigrant dealing with america forced to flee his past now we have three protaganists fitting these previous games franklin and cj michael and vercetti trevor and claude in closing i give it a number out of a number gta is still hectic even if you dont like the hd era its a ing parody of its own meaningless plagiarized movie plots online is fine and good even when it disappoints youll still play it and wheres the coop r where

tldr game is a masterpiece after 18 months of delay after delay gta v is finally here and i can firmly say that it was worth the wait the game is the best version to have come out the game has delivered on everything that was promised and it runs like a dream pros 1 amazing gameplay gun play is perfect and very fluid playing in 1st person mode is incredible and the mouse aiming is as good as it was max payne 3 driving in the game is fantastic i use the mk the whole time even when driving since i play in 1st person mode completely i find that driving with a keyboard works really well plus the cars are heavy and well balanced so your car doesnt swerve all over the place like some do when you use a keyboard 2 optimization ive put many hours into the game so far and apart from some early fps drops i havent had any major issues i run the game almost completely maxed out with msaa turned off and advanced graphics turned off the game offers you up one of the most detailed settings menu ive ever seen from your standard graphics options all the way to the number of people that appear on the screen they took their time and truly did a wonderful job 3 story one of the biggest issues i had with gta 4 was the boring story and protagonist luckily r fixed this by adding three playable characters all with their own unique skills and missions the game combines the three quite well so you never feel like is less significant than the other even though the game centers around michaels life and problems the story very naturally intertwines the other two in there perfectly 4 gta online i havent spent much time in this but from what ive been able to do it seems pretty good this is the weakest part of the game imo but thats mostly because im not a big fan of mp i havent done the heist yet but from what ive seen it seems like it was worth the wait cons 1 cant think of anything major tbh not saying the game is flawless but there is nothing major that ive come across that i would put as a con while this game isnt perfect and i wouldnt put it in my top 5 it is still a masterpiece of a game that will appeal to just about everyone while the game had a rocky launch it seems to be running well for almost everyone now so please dont listen to those people who gave it a negative review on day 1 because they couldnt get on i understand their pain but the game runs and plays like a dream so dont deny yourself this amazing experience just because a few people drew the short straw for me this game is a solid 1010

coming from the ps3 to the master race this is a huge upgrade this game is a must buy and youll never regret your choice this is by far my favorite gta ever since san andreas and vice city pros graphic updates all past dlc included even the collectors edition exclusive vehicles emmersive story great characters first person mode works great smooth 60 fps huge selection of vehicles land and air never gets boring great online that has you playing countless missions to level up and get money gta online transfer system works great for all returning players from consoles online heists cons in gta online it can be hard to get money for everything you want unless you play heists more freaks and geeks can be added the ones already in the game are great

do you like dags the joke fell on deaf ears i turned to corey and exclaimed there are a lot of different types of dogs in this game seriously pugs rotts shepards i have never played a game that took the time to actually render several different breeds of dogs rather than a lame color swap the word immersive is not an adequate description for this game i played it on ps3 for a few days but my old hands cannot aim on controller i lost interest quickly being able to drive with a controller and swap to a mouse and keyboard setup without touching a menu is genius the game runs smooth as butter on a mid range system with an i53570k 16gb and a 680 gtx i can pull 60 fps in mostly very high settings nary a stutter or popup tree or building in sight i spent 40 minutes just driving around obeying the traffic laws listening to fernando give me his views on feminism i havent heard the same repetitive crap from the npcs that seems to plague other open world games what i like to call the arrow to the knee problem this is the first game in a long time that i feel completely justified in spending sixty dollars on here in america talk is cheap even so buy this game i like it so much i wasted time writing a small review for you

i havent fully played a grand theft auto game since vice city my friends have been raving about grand theft auto 5 and i was on the fence about it because i outgrew the game and wasnt my cup of tea anymore i was wrong i took a chance and bought it and wow i do not regret my purchase one bit d the world looks beautiful granted if you have a decent pc rig to play it the game mechanics are pretty fluid missions are creative and the story is fantastic i was never really interested in the story much for the past gta ive played but this one has gotten me hooked the characters are very memorable and well developed you can easily connect with them at all times i havent ran into many bugs yet in the main story mode the online experience so far is soso the open world and missions that you do are pretty fun against other players although it gets really laggy and glitchy often whenever i play with some friends not sure why this happens but it does kill the mood a little bit overall though its decent but if youre in it for just the online multiplayer portion then i would probably wait a little bit until things get fixed and optimized again thats just my experience i would do a little more research about online experiences from others before purchasing honestly with that little negative asside i could go on and on about how awesome this game is but that would turn this mini review into a book if you dont mind the violence lots of swear words drugs etc then this is a game for you and a must buy d

i bought 6 copies of this game from steam and 5 from gmg for family and friends to play with out of those 11 copies all work but 2 of them but its just my luck that the one of the two non working copies is the one i am using i have tried every thing listed on all forums and support pages to fix my issue but nothing works an open ticket from rockstar in an attempt to fix the issue as well but still my issue is not fixed i can play the game for random amounts of time before the game simply crashes on 2 of my computers and its the same symptoms on both machines the game running with settings changed from extreamly low to as high as you can set them to test the issue and it crashes no matter what setting even safe mode crashes i doubt that this issue is something to do with my equipment and i am finished jumping through hoops for support teams with all the uninstall reinstall disable enable rollback restore none of it works i am convinced that this issue will be corrected with a patch and now i will simply wait until they decide to start looking deeper into the issue on thier end instead of looking at my msinfo file and trying to correct it on my pc i have over 500 games and this is the first one to have this issue with its persistant crashing i have yet to trouble shoot any other game as much as i have this one and the biggest bummer for me is that when i do get to play this game for the brief amount of time in which my pc works with it the game plays and looks absolutly amazing i have no other game in my library that can touch it i am hoping they can find a fix in an upcoming patch to fix my issues with this game so that i can enjoy it but until then i will just enjoy listening to my friends and family i purchased the game for enjoy it and focus on thier positive experience with it i would trade my issues with any of the customers complaining about thier car missing or thier character wasnt tranfered correctly just so that i could play the game after all those things being ed about are so small in comparison to the constant crashing issue my specs just in case anyone reading this wants to know operating system windows 7 professional 64bit 61 build 7601 service pack 1 7601win7sp1_gdr1503161654 language english regional setting english system manufacturer to be filled by oem system model to be filled by oem bios bios date 070214 221232 ver 040605 processor intelr coretm i74790 cpu @ 360ghz 8 cpus 36ghz memory 8192mb ram available os memory 8130mb ram page file 3774mb used 12484mb available windows dir c\windows directx version directx 11 dx setup parameters not found user dpi setting 96 dpi 100 percent system dpi setting 96 dpi 100 percent dwm dpi scaling disabled dxdiag version 601760117514 32bit unicode card name nvidia geforce gtx 980 manufacturer nvidia chip type geforce gtx 980 dac type integrated ramdac device key enum\pci\ven_10de&dev_13c0&subsys_31701462&rev_a1 display memory 4095 mb dedicated memory 3072 mb shared memory 1023 mb current mode 1920 x 1080 32 bit 60hz monitor name generic pnp monitor monitor model unknown monitor id ktc4200 native mode 1920 x 1080p 60000hz output type hdmi more then capable of playing a game like this when i have an old xps machine that i bought 8 years ago that is playing this game that my youngest son plays on and it has not crashed one time i hope everyone that can play the game is enjoying it as everyone i know that can play it loves it so much and cant wait to play it again

good story missions are mostly fun and entertaining very little freedom though you get failed just for getting out of a car and the ai is atrocious at one point i was running from the cops with 2 npc allies the second of which was casually strolling around getting shot refusing to get into my car sandbox is actually big not just cause 2 copypaste big actually unique areas big with huge amounts of stuff to do the threecharacter thing is a bit interesting and all the characters have rpglike stats that gradually increase its a good port and will run well on basically anything integrated will be fine for 720p lots of graphic settings

recommended
aaa masterpiece if you wint to know buy this game download it have fun
recommended
a wonderful living breathing world that has quite a nihlistic cliched story bolted onto it the radio stations are pretty rubbish the character creator is flawed and theres still a bug mountain  but then theres those moments of sublime beauty where youre sitting shooting seagulls by the beach as the sun goes down  and you realise that sometimes games can combine the best bits of books tv and films into a very personal experience just dont go looking for it in the campaign  which seems like outakes from sopranos  breaking bad  bad boys overall  a game to enjoy on your own terms  i just wish the npcs werent quite so cardboard

this game is worth of wait for many months just to get optimized for pc its an improved gameplay experience with enhanced graphics and environment thank you rockstar we may think negatively back then but now you proved us and gain your trust

after playing gta iv on pc i had few expectations for the pc port of this game to even run rockstar has really learned something though i get a constant 4560 fps on high settings with my 750 ti and the game is great fun so much to do 1010 best $60 ive ever spent except for csgo ^

the best game of the universe thanks for rockstar games

1010 worth every second of waiting for the pc version to be released rockstar showing how to convert a console title to pc this is how it should be done since ive skipped the console version completely im blown away by the cutscenes and the dialogues the missions are fun to play the graphics are awesome this is how openworld should look like 20 hours of gametime and only a quarter through the storyline without focusing on online mode or side actions this game is a must have
recommended
once you go fps  there is no turning back i had this for my ps3  i will sell it so i have this here now the games is still incredible but after rockstars new stuff  its a total killer would buy it 10 more times in 10 different times
recommended
i might just have to say it probably the best gta game to date in terms of gameplay and the world itself truly amazing and detailed right down to every little alley way or trail within the desert story as for the story i would say gta sa is still at the top of the list or perhaps vice city the story for gta v is decent enough to keep you playing but imo some of the levels while awesome were also too easy and the last mission was definitely that ultimately kind of a joy killer when you get to that final moment although as i youtube the other endings its clear i picked the wrong one protip pick option c when the time comes a little comment about the characters at first i hated them all and thought them to all be annoying with how much they screamed or whined although as i played more i started to see past it and shared a few laughs with people like trevor and had opinions change in a good way regarding franklin and micheal the 3 character choice in gta v is cool and a nice way to get the player torn between who they prefer in regards to succeeding in the story i did free roam a bit but honestly i completed the story after 44 hours and theres still plenty of side stuff i need to check out in addition to exploring gameplay in the end as a reminder what makes this one of if not the best gta games is the gameplay and world itself as i said at first its so large detailed and interactive driving is great in this game theres plenty to explore by air land or sea in addition to all the different ways to do so such as hiking biking planes jets helicopters blimps cars whatever you get the idea performance is great extremely optimized was getting 5060 avg fps on a 780 sc @ 1440p with everything on very high post fx on ultra although i had grass quality on high and mxaa off i was getting 4045 fps for my lowest avg to which i would mostly get when i was outside the city within forest regions rockstar really did a great job with this port even the controls for kb & m are good not once did i feel the need to use a controller

almost exactly 1 week since the game released and i have now clocked 100 hours in the game so heres my impressions so far and i have exclusively played online gonna wait with the story so grand theft loadi auto online heists when i read there were gonna be 5 heists 4 of winch require the full 4 player lineup i was worried you would play them once and thats it never gonna do them again but i have played all of them twice and i can see myself play them even more trying to get all the challenges and the job r made on the heists are superb good design good voice acting from the characters that do talk leveling on my 100hours in online i reached rank 50 and i didnt play jobs or heists all the time many hours spent just exploring so you can reach 50 a lot faster if you want and i think thats a reasonable leveling pace not to quick so that you unlock everything instantly and not to slow so you lose interest jobs there are a lot of different job types as its called game mode in gta iv race capture deathmatch and so on on very neat feature is on call you cue up and joins a lobby but youre not transfered into the job until the host starts so no waiting in the lobby the jobs them self is fun and big plus but is haunted by the next thing the loading times daily objectives feels like im playing wow the game features 3 daily objectives which will give you cash and rp xp completing them a week in a row will grant you even more cash and rp and a month in a row even more this is a nice thing to do as they often are fairly easy like participate in a race this could also act as a way to get players to log on daily and then think might as well play some more loading times the loading times in this game are insane it takes so long to switch from a job back to freemode or the other way around also the startup time can be pretty brutal longest this far is 4minutes but that could have been the servers being slow but overall loading times are long so dont be in a hurry glitches now this will probably differ from person to person so this is just from my experience there are some glitches that are more game breaking then other one of them being when you die during a heist or setup to a heist all you see is a image your character but you can still see the hud such as the mini map this is avoided by someone else in your heist crew committing suicide not all get this glitch only me and 2 other friends get it but 5 other friend dont get it performance again this may very and it could be my computer but i would expect higher performance from my rig its most notable when leaving the city to drive out to the desert the fps drop to 4060fps and it feels like im on a ps3 or x360 the online is a solid 910 high replay value on the heists and hopefully some more will come later on glitches some small and some bigger is what takes of the last point rig i7 2600k 16gb ram gtx980 sli 1680x1050 resolution

so far so good im running win81 a 4790k sli gtx 780s and 16gb of ram the game is installed on a 7200rpm hdd i realize some people are having technical issues and i understand that can be very frustrating but trust me when i say its worth it these are probably some of the nicest lighting effects ive seen in a game i have every setting maxed out except for msaa txaa and the high detail shadows my vram is my bottleneck unfortunately so adding any of those options puts me into the 3040fps region i am running the game at 1440p so this is a pretty demanding setup in the city im sitting in the 6080fps region and in the country areas its 4050fps or so i do notice that when driving very fast across the map i hit moments of 30fps and im not sure if this is because of the game loading the next section of the map or if its because my settings are too high theres a ton of vegetation in the country areas so one way or the other ill even out some settings to get 60fps constant if possible as for the story and gameplay its gta i played through the entire game on the xb360 version so i have less motivation to play the main story currently but i assume its basically just the same and the main story was awesome on xb360 so i cant see why it wouldnt be just as good here one thing i really noticed is that the cutscenes are actually enjoyable to watch now the console cutscenes ran so slow and choppy it was hard to even pay attention to the story but so long as your settings are done correctly they will run at a nice 60hz and it becomes much easier to get sucked into the story just understand what youre buying its still gta just like the console version but with a lot of great new visuals and online features if youre looking for a game to really tax your system this is it

im not much of writing but this time could not let it go so upside of the game online mode very good there are alot of possibilities even more if rockstars wanna keep the game giving money can just release new updates with new heists new missions just things like that will keep the game interessing at long term downside of the game yet not bad at all story mode even not being bad at all story is kinda short that said still a pleasent experience however in my opinion i think it could be a bit better personally i liked more san andreas story line at the end i recommend this game very much never been more satisfied of wasting a value like this in a game you all should try

gta 5 review online mode 90% loading screen 10% gta offline mode pros trevor cons michael
recommended
really nice game great graphics only thing i can complain about is that it took 18 months from ps3xbox360 to pc release
recommended
im mainly playing this game for the multiplayer component so please take that into consideration of my list of pros and cons below multiplayer pros character customization to a degree these include stats clothing vehicles apartments you own guns numerous game modes darts arm wrestling parachuting bike racing car racing plane racing boat racing team deathmatch deathmatch survival etc just in general its fun with friends heists my favorite part its intense but there are just so many loading screens involved in this mode alone cons loading screens really dominant in switching mapsmodes of play while in a lobby session graphic intensive youll need a highish end pc to run this on the higher graphical settings third person movement on foot feels a little awkward with a ps4 controller
recommended
fortunately this game has very little in common with gta iv instead it provides the same awesome fun that gta 3 and vice city did havent laughed as hard from a game in a long time looks gorgeous runs smooth good controlscustomizability  very good port

garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
long story short for people who love gta and want to play singleplayer only this is for you if you want to play online you will probably get killed by hackers and guess what rockstar does nothing about it there is no simple way to report players so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers game itself 1010 gta online 310 hackers everywhere edit this is itdecided to improve my flying skills all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane i didnt press anything freezes and thats it cant move at all some sort of hack joined another session after few minutes i noticed two people with godmode on so i went passive mode but guess what they started shooting cars at me and i died about 10 times i advice you not to buy this game at all

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
great game honestly but bumping the price to 8000usd before the summer sale just to be able to say 25% off is a scum move
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
a big improvement over gtaiv and well worth the wait graphics are major step up from the last gen consoles  it looks great online is alot of fun other things such as adding your own music and the edtior are welcome extras too highly recommend for any fans of the gta franchise

worth all the 60$ and even more let me tell you it`s a totally different game on pc the 60fps and graphics my sli gtx 670 4gb is totally utilized in terms of vram 1st game to ever saturate all the graphic memory on any game the game looks really good and the first person view is so detailed u can mistake it for a entry mid level first person shooter game out there the game is way more realisitc on pc very smooth and thankfully my experience is bug free this is my initial impressions will update the review when i get into the 30 hours into the game
recommended
the best hands down played it 4 hours after launch and it was great great preformance looks fantastik game runs smooth everythin about this game is just great and great launch compared to every other big multiplayer game these days

game plays find online windows 7 64bit nvidia 650 gtx ti game is really fun the community is funny and nice the settings seem slow at first but eventually you get to make your character and play online with others if your one of those dial up gamers this game is not for you phoney up some cash and get a real connection like charter giving this game a bad review right now is pointless yes there are some cons but with every new game and port of a new game there are going to be some set backs you are going to expect that has rockstar ever let you down no then why hate on this all ready just give it a week or so they will have another patch out soon enough 4 12 out of 5 stars 4 12 because i have just only begun to play the game  can change lol so far no squeakers talking on the mic yet maybe because they can not figure it out

played this game for two years on ps3 and have salivated over the thought of how good this game could be if done correctly my god its flawless this is how you do a port i never imagined this game running this good i knew it would be better than gta iv on pc but i never expected this i adore this game in my opinion all it needed on pc was 60fps and 1080p native we got so much more absolutely the best it could have possibly been never drops below 60fps with every single thing i could find maxed outexcept msaa id need another 980 for that lol were talking a game and dev that released a notoriously poorly optimized port and mindnumblingly cpu intensive game and now were maxing even all draw distances objects shadows pedestrians and traffic even with all that it still maxes out my ing gtx 980 there is no cpu bottleneck to be found here throw all of your doubt about this game out the window it is ing perfection if youre interested in the slightest and have at least the recommended specs buy this game right now just for reference gigabyte z77xd3h i73770k @44ghz 16 gb corsair vengeance ram @1866mhz msi gtx 980 gaming 4gb 250gb samsung evo ssd asus 144hz vg248qe any questions about this game or its performance feel free to ask

i have bought this game 3 times already the fact that i bought it 3 times must mean something i currently own grand theft auto v for the xbox 360 xbox one and pc this game is one of the best games i have ever played it runs amazing my rig i highly recommend this game pros 1 beautiful graphics 2 optimized well 3 unlocked fps 4 hundred of graphical gameplay display and audio setting 5 gta online 6 amazing campaign 7 a wealthy amount of game content 8 4k support 9 mods support 10 very fun to play 11 trevor phillips 12 constant updates and developer support 13 very humorous dialogcutscenes 14 heists 15 no more playing bowling with roman 16 first person mode 17 remappable keys 18 large weapon selection to choose from 19 animals to hunt cons 1 gta online servers 2 social club dont even get me started 3 over 60gb with more updates on the way better have a large fast harddrive 4 annoying phone calls from characters in gta online with no way to turn it off 5 loading times can sometimes take a while 6 12 year olds online 7 no swingset glitch to launch yourself like in gta iv

grand theft auto five is not only the best story of a game ever or best map amazing grapics but the world is so rich with n content i sunk approximatly 80 hours into gta v on playstation 3 100 on ps4 and whatever number is above on pc i bought it 3 times they are constently throwing content in your face and it has an amazing multiplayer mode although starting out can be a real grind i learned to stop playing mission after mission and just have fun save up for an apartment and a nice car or 2 or 12 and have fun with friends if you have 60 dollars anywhere buy this game story 55 world 55 graphics 55 comedy 25 overall 485

this game is perfect it plays like a dream and its most definitely the definitive version of the game 1010 on r redeeming themselves this port is perfect

how could i possibly give this top one sandbox game a bad comment definitely awesome rockstar games postponed this game like three or four times it might make some people critisize the game itself because of that i think it totally worth waiting good graphic optimization and integrated contents even including the groundbreaking first person camera view are not something you could see every day on pc games totally worth trying dont let the price scare you

awesome this game is awesome the graphics everything

even though i have only played an hour of this on pc i must say this game is absolutely amazing i had some scares about if my build could handle the game and i was very surpsrised at how well the game ran i was able to transfer my old character from xbox 360 to pc no problems everything was the same got the extra money for the prepurchase gg rockstar thanks for releasing one day early  cant wait to play this game and do some heists
recommended
the wait for this game was long was it worth it so far yes my system is an fx 8350 @ 43 ghz 16 gb ddr3 @ 1600 mhz and 2 asus gtx 760s in sli @ 1980x1080 and near highest settings im getting 60 fps on foot and 50 fps when driving fast and the game looks great 26 hours played im i glad i got it so far yes 910

this game gives me the usual love hate relationship as all previous versions of gta the main reason is that it is a lovely world to explore but the controls are too much of a fight so i am playing the controls rather then the game another huge problem is the crashes i can play 1 to 30 minutes until i get either a bluescreen  hang or program crash pc software drivers etc are all up to date this for a 60 euro game is unacceptable the focus for r needs to be the instability of the software that being said here are my pros and cons pro  beautiful world to explore  first person finally  great characters trevor rules  missions are fun  cars look stunning con  crashes crashes crashes  too few missions  no real challange after main story  controls  mulitplayer loading time last bit about multiplayer due to crashes i cannot play that so it would be unfair to comment on the gameplay itsself at this moment i would advice to wait until the crashing is resolved apart from that its a fun game
not recommended
crashes at launcher itself money burnt feeling  update read some posts in the discussions page found out that the launcher crash is related to nvidia optimus technology have to disable my nvidia gpu before starting the launcher and thereafter enable it again the game works now and is pretty well optimized so no complaints there but the fact that you have to do this stuff everytime you want to play blows update 2 well a 427 mb update fixed the launcher problem and now i have no problems recommending this game

41415 if you ever so much as touched the gta iv port on the pc and then came over to this youll understand why this game is such a fantastic major improvment i can run this game on ultra at about 80fps on 1080p with my 970 and that says a lot by itself considering how fantastic of a job r did with this port the game flat out just looks beautiful to say the least its a night and day difference in my opinon between this and the console versions with this obviously looking and feeling the best there was a couple hiccups i had on the night relase and my game crashed twice but im assuming rockstar has heard of this issue and will be fixing it promptly hopefully i have friends who do not have anywhere close to the rec specs and they are able to play this big of a game at pretty decent settings with some good frames online has also been very fun and have already had some histarical laughs with my friends ill update as the weeks go on

everything about this game is perfect

first impression see my profile for pc specs please note i have played the game on ps3 ps4 and now this comparison at the bottom i also had an issue with launching the game see below i will start by saying see below for game review i didnt expect to run this game so well on a laptop with a nvidia gt 650m 2gb its a 3 year old card so i didnt feel like i would push the settings up to high so lets start with graphical rockstar really have done well with the minimum requirements with my laptop an alienware m14x r2 i was able to have all settings on either high or normal and the game still looks better than the console version while they are locked to 30fps i was getting a low of 48 and a high of 64 fps including in the city in the air and during rush hour on the highways note couldnt run msaa as i ran out of video memory 2gb but af was at 16x without loss ok onto the game itself first off the first impressions when i ran the game well it took me a solid hour to figure out why it wouldnt even load i had to disable my nvidia card i use optimus then reenable it at the menu screen to get the game to run once it had i quickly played through the prologue to get a feel for the controls i will say i had to look into the button bindings when i couldnt do something i needed to so memorize those buttons the story is what youd expect from rockstar full of drugs sex and violence i wouldnt mind playing through again in the beautiful detail you can play up to 3 characters as they go on a journey to ravish los santos of its moneys dealing with corruption sexually active tv presenters and lindsay lohan clones gta 5 was the first gta game i ever finished and i loved it there is also plenty to do afterwards ok onto online it let me transfer my ps4 character which i transfered from my ps3 with no hassle including the bonus preorder cash i didnt suffer any lag but maybe that was because i was alone in the server not sure if that is my settings or a server issue overall owning the ps3 pc and ps4 version the story online and the graphics let alone steam integration is enough to force me off the consoles and onto the pc version comparrison if you have a ps3xbox360 and own a ps4xbone or pc please make the jump to next gen or pc the graphics alone are worth it but make it a pc version if you want fluid motion with over 40fps on a decent system with settings near the max
recommended
too soon to post a review no not at all because this games been a year and a half coming and if you honestly havent played it yet despite your platform bias then you really missed out on a great gaming experience however for those of you who were craving the experience of a nextgeneration grand theft auto from the comfort of your own pc then have i got news for you grand theft auto v has finally arrived on steam fully optimized for the true pc gaming experience the game looks better than the xbox one and the playstation 4 if you can believe it which you probably can pc grand theft auto v comes with all of the content released up to this point on the consoles with a few neat additional features the rockstar editor allows you to create your own movies the game comes with a fps camera view thats surprisingly fully functional disorienting though the game has full controller support but works just as fine with the keyboard and mouse i personally run the xbox one controller for driving and flight keyboard and mouse for everything else launchday stability at least for me has been pretty good  i only crashed once in the past six hours ive been playing ive heard that some folks have been running into issues getting the game preloaded but i had no such issues so i cant really speak on their behalf i have no problem recommending this game its been a long time coming and i know a lot of folks are bitter towards rockstar for taking their sweet time but the endproduct is worth it i ran the game on the following rig i54690k @ 35 no overclocking done asus strix geforce gtx 970 8 gb ddr3 1600 hz msi z97 gaming 5 motherboard with msaa turned off everything else at maximum and vsync turned on im able to achieve fluctuating frames between 55 and 60 frames per second

awesome game runs smooth as silk on my evga gtx 970 ftw edition game loads up fairly quiker then on consol game never drops below 7080 frams and stays in around 90120 on very high settings driving is awesome same with the flying but you need to get used to the flying a bit all i can say is that it was worth the wait 1010 only down side is that there are a few bugs in the game when doing hiests  missions when you freeze up on one screen also i get maybe a few lag spikes ever 510 minutes which is no biggy and can be imporved in future patches
recommended
its gud m8 buy now
recommended
its finally here and i can say it is well worth the wait the game looks great and runs very well with max settings rockstar did a great job on this
recommended
game works for me looks great runs great but here is a little food for thought for everyone who pre ordered and is ing you are the problem stop pre ordering this day in age you can follow tons of youtubers whos job it is to give you a review and they could tell you to hold onto your 70$ till this game gets patched you will  and cry all day and demand your money back but you wontit will get patchedand you will end up pre ordering gta 6 or any other game that offers you a pre order with a special bundle you all fuel this kind of shoddy work and guess what as long as these companies still get pre order money they are obliged to launch a game on the date they stated instead of doing what they did back in the day and delay the launchrelease i will say from looking at all the reviews negitive and positive this game might not be for everyone just until you can play the game without sorting through files and going through the steps that game devs get paid for also for anyone who wants to know i did not pre order to clarify i recommend this game but from 14k of total users who wrote comments it looks as though 20ish% cant play this game without a hassle so if you like to gamble go for it but dont  you have been warned
recommended
this game has everything and it rusn even better than gta iv 1010
recommended
this game is fantastic online is extremely fun to play with friends the game is very well optimised and the graphics are fantastic the only thing i can complain about is that the game glitches with heists on most occasions making it difficult to complete them but other than that very good game

its gtav what can i say xd

cant run it too well because of bad pc but it looked great 1010

amazing game worth the 2 year wait the game runs amazingly smooth even whilst livestreaming to twitch although my obs settings have to be set to stupidly low here are my specs cpu amd fx4100 36ghz quad core processor gpu xfx amd hd 7850 2gb double dissipation edition motherboard asrock 960gmu3s3 ram 8gb crucial 1600mhz ram ssd 512gb crucial mx100 ssd hdd 1tb hitatchi 7200rpm hdd so as you can see my specs arent worthy of computergasms but they still play this game in full 1080p the only one negative thing ive found is more of a general gta v thing not to do with the pc version but on gta online it feels very unbalanced there was one player that was killing player after player all the time and not once he died the unbalanced thing was more that it spawned us in front of a hospital right round the corner where hed come and kill us again the controls also seem a little odd but thats my opinion ive never seen a game that has e for the horn in short 1010 no matter the small opinionbased negatives

i bought this game three times three times i bought it when it came out on ps3 i bought it when it came out on ps4 i ing preordered it when it came out on pc needless to say i was pretty dedicated not only to the franchise but this game specifically was the pc version the great culmination we expected it to be mostly sure performance was my greatest concern much like everyone elses with gta4 rockstar sort of earned themselves some negative opinions with good hardware today gta4 doesnt run too bad but thats not saying much considering it was released in 2008 so whats the verdict with gta5 well it runs pretty good for the most part i was getting very smooth 60fps in the opening parts of the game but those were in an isolated rural town of the game certainly not the most intensive area however even when i got to the middle of the city i was stunned to still see 60fps with just about maxed out settings there are framerate dips dont misunderstand but never have i once found any situation in the game where i dropped below 45 and considering far cry 4 can barely manage that on my hardware i was rather impressed this is a very large detailed open world were talking about for those who have been patient for the pc version and thus havent played this game at all gameplay is mostly familiar if youve at least played previous games in the series its an open world sandbox complete with a lengthy well written story where you play at 3 characters simultaneously and can switch between them when it suits you or when the situation calls for it with the first person mode specifically combat has become smoother and better controlled its rather bizarre to control the games combat with a keyboard in mouse considering its so accurate its made the games online deathmatches feel more like the next aaa first person shooter rather than a gta game first person is also as dramatic of a change as youve heard its essentially the same gameplay but the perspective makes the entire game much mor visceral and believable if you can let yourself get absorbed into the games world you will its gorgeous with all the enhanced graphics options i thought the ps4 version looked pretty damn good but theres no mistaking that the pc version can look a lot better higher resolution shadows higher textures better lighting more crowded streets and sidewalks this version of the game hasnt disappointed visually there are problems though big ones many people cant even launch the game the launcher itself just crashes or does nothing at all when clicked i was one of the fortunate people that didnt have any problems but my brother did there are a couple solutions but some people say they dont work at all theres this exe file floating around but despite numerous accounts of people saying its safe i still have no 100% proof that it is a much safer solution involves disabling a laptops nvidia gpu before launching the game and quickly reenabling it just as it loads this seems to work for my brother but its very tedious and needs to be fixed now id hate to say it but seriously rockstar after two additional years and people already buying the game twice i did expect a much smoother launch the game is still fantastic though great gameplay visuals sound story characters its really a very well rounded game and the online mode will only keep you coming back for hours
recommended
finally some real life graphics compared to ps4
recommended
waited so long werf it
recommended
710 because of the workarounds to make it work
recommended
yes i played this on the xbox 360 on the day it came out there was no online so i played the single player then i realised that the rendering of the game was just awful then online came out i tryed it it didint work at all when it did it was fun i would give it a 810 but on pc it fixes everything the online perfect the singleplayer perfect the rendering perfect so in short note 010 ign  too much water
recommended
aside from the issues with installing the game i give gta 5 easily 55 ign 1010 gamespot 66 demongaming holy crap i think this is one of the best gtas so far the optimization is better than i expected with the graphics and since i waited since the pc version was announced its even more legit to me now see everyone online hopefully 
recommended
well so far so good the game is good i love the way it looks i mean other than the fps drops and trying to get the launcher to stop crashing for almost 2 hours its pretty solid game i fixed my launcher crash by disabling my anti virus and it loaded and played fine after that anyways other than those issues i give it a 810
recommended
absolutely amazing everything is fun from the missions and heists that you do to the fun minigames that you can play like tennis darts parachuting and racing what makes this gta stand out most is its brand online gaming mode which enables players to play a wide variety of different game modes and earn levels and money its an incredibly polished game and a huge leap from gta iv which was also an excellent game if youre a fan of gta you must get this this is the culminating point of fun and the best sandbox game ever developed thus far

one of the best games ive played graphics and sound are brilliant thought id be disappointed due to hype but its a fantastic game well recommended

you dont need mine or anyone elses opinion on why this is the best game that ever was instead ill use this space to give you guys some troubleshooting info game wont start win 7  make sure you have service pack 1 installed win 7 this fixes most social club issues  make sure you have the latest drivers  net framework 45 is required  disable antivirus and firewall for installation low fps with good hardware  turn of high res shadows  take postfx down a notch  use fxaa only for very high end systems 980 780ti 970 290x etc  watch the memory meter for vram when setting up game and add about 2025% to get a real number of vram usage  push settings up one thing ive noticed is game runs much better when pushing the hardware happy gaming

this review is written 48 hours after release game runs great really well optimized gta online works flawlessly i have not had any problems with lag or bugs the singleplayer story is the same its interesting and intreaguing in my 25h of game time that 25h was all on gta online i have come across 1 bug that has happened 3 times the bug made it impossible for me to play a mission it locked the camera on my characters face restarting the mission fixed it that bug will probably be fixed in a patch soon one note about gta online though in my opinion you need friends to play with otherwise it will be boring but thats just my opionion what can i say gta v on pc is awsome and you should buy it rockstar worked hard on this game and the results are clear 1010

so many people complain about the rgsc account  first of all  im playing this game since the day one it takes a long time for unpacking thus files  probably about 30 minutes  but i think the rest of all its ok so far ya know  whats the difference between rgsc and uplay  i knw that feel bro  ok so lets talk about the gameplay  i guess rockstar did an incredible job  i regret to pre order watch_dogs but all relieved after i preorder this one   its true mate  im using gtx 970 gaming on my cpu i got 60fps run smooth  shiny and soft between 5560 with set of high  ultra pcmasterrace d do not forget to download the latest drivers because it affects the performance of the game this is the perfect game i ever played  <3 r but rgsc kinda sucks 
recommended
incredible game even works on fairly lowend pcs and to everyone who cant even start the game you need to go into devices and printers and deactivate your graphics card and then launch gta and enable the graphics card as soon as gta is about to begin

great game theres good graphics even on normal and lots to do make sure you update graphics drivers though i had random force closes before i did
recommended
becomes a roadkill by insane civilians with panic issues 1010 would flip & fly in 1st person again on serious note i would recommend this game to any gta fan even on my  as pc i can play it on around 30 fps isnt much but i can play it there are some issues with session disconnect etc but i assume its only during the first few days of launch of servers being overloaded and will be fixed soon as we go on otherwise i havent encountered any issues yet & would defo recommend it as its nicely optimized for pc
recommended
1010 finally came to pc if you have $60 to buy this game do it its so worth
recommended
awesome awesome game paid full price and got a full experience 1010 undoubtedly

im impressed this game still playable on my  pc spec i33240 gt610 8gb ram settings windowed 800x600 all normaloff graphic settings 30 fps dx10
recommended
its here on pc now is it worth it yes rockstar did a great job with the graphics and the game looks great with lots of attention paid to details and evnironments they also did a great job with bringing life into the characters the game runs completely maxed 1920x1080 on my system with full antialiasing i7 4930k @ 45ghz and a gtx 980 4gb with 32gb of memory and i get 5060 fps constantly its really fun a big improvement from gta iv driving is a little tough at first but once you get the hang of it its much better than in gta iv

the best game  goodbye life
recommended
this is one of the best games i have played in a very long time the graphics are absolutely stunning the story is engaging and online is great fun the characters are all unique and interesting the missions are crazy and over the top like the very best of action movies there is so much detail packed in and it is a massive improvment over the last gen it is so full of things to do and places to explore also the soundtrack is very good this game is a very well ported very shiny and all up a fantastic polished masterpice 1010 if you have the hardware buy the game
recommended
been playing nonstop ever since this baby dropped the pc port is absolutley stunning its so obvious how they made sure the game was absolutley optomized before release as the game runs smooth as butter even on my low end rig 1110
recommended
realy good
recommended
its a fact that rockstar games is the main reason of some white hairs in our head they delay and then go silent and then delay and then delaybut the thing is that they do it for a reassonand that is why i think that rockstar games are one of the best game publishers out there because they are picky and dont send buggy content this game is the ultimate example for that it took us an eterity to see it on the pc but it was worthed great graphics running smoothly as  great story the name says allgrand theft auto who doesnt like that
recommended
better then the hype p
recommended
if u like reking everything u see this is the game for u

remarkable that even though the pc release came over 15 years too late its still totally worth it

this is a much better port than gta iv it even plays better than gtaiv on my gtx970 60 fps with most settings on veryhigh in 1080p this looks very good and is a blast to play after oly a few minutes it felt like a great gta

i transitioned from 360 to pc and i would choose gta v pc over any console any day
recommended
the graphical changes from the pregeneration version is huge
recommended
very fun adds loads of content that gta 4 missed
recommended
fantasic and emersive game i just cant stop playing not encountered any bugs so far and it runs very smooth on my comp gtx 770 and an old i5 proc runs it above 60 fps with some settings reduced to high
recommended
one word says it masterpiece
recommended
i remember that i accidently dropped my xbox 360 with the gta v disc in it the disc broke and i couldnt play anymore so i waited for pc when i finnaly knew that it will came to april the 14th i was so excited just the hype from the xbox 360 release i really like this game the graphics are amazing it couldnt be better i will continue to play this game and continue to enjoy it
recommended
can take selfies and pictures of cats 1110
recommended
this is how gta was meant to be played stunning graphics smooth gameplay and endless hours of fun playing by yourself or with friends worth every dollar
recommended
have to say ive been waiting for this to come to pc for ages and im not disapointed i feel that the additional content and fps mashup theyve done is well executed the way the game looks is just beutiful right down to the make moddle and serial number on the rifles in the first person view is very nice multiplayer community is a little more respectful about kos i mean there are a few but i feel that the ability to drive past your fellow players without them pulling a gun on you right away like on consol in nice ive had a few good firefights that have left my heart raceing dont get me wrong but this is only enhanced with the fps option made me feel like i was actualy there there is the issues of loss of frame rate and occationaly connection issues but im sure those will be worked out soon hopeing there devs are usualy on the ball when things arrise to do with the game issues side of things but hey what goes for consol dosent always go for pc so so far im impressed if they keep developing the multiplayer i dont see why people wont buy the game just for the multiplayer alone single player is again long plenty to do and alot of side stories to do as well as the other random stuff that goes down infront of you i had a guy drive up and loose his wheel right infront of me the sad thing is he broke my winsheild with his wheel v so like any respectful british person with a nice attitude i got out and kindly introduced him to my fists and beat him up and stole his wallet d

really glad this game finally got localized so i dont have to play it on my japanese pc anymore its a shame they only have the english dub instead of the original voices with subs but a good game nonetheless

its the same as on consoles but 60 fps dont buy again not worth it but if your buying for the first time its is definetly worth it pros graphics mousekeyboard&controller simaltaneaslysorry on spelling open world moddingalthough modded servers lik gmod will never heppen cons lack of effort in creating a modding ecosystem similar to gmod in the fact that single and multi player use different sets of mods delays
recommended
omfg thought it was real life
recommended
list of my thoughts overall story mode is awsome multiplayer looks promising but still needs work pros good story interesting and funny main charachters shooting feels good driving feels good similar to flatout with real feeling of speed vehicle damage found only 1 bug in 35h of gameplay from release in story mode you can literally drive wherever you want cons game would benefit from few confirmation windows here and there gamepad keybinding is awful multiplayer still needs some work not only bug wise multiplayer needs some sort of game browser currently lobby gathers players mostly by spamming invites if you host the game you are not guaranteed to be host at the start of the next race even with stay host option on no party system game does not compensate for lag in multiplayer if your game stutters game threats that like you were standing still almost everyone is lagging due to poorly optimised game hackers toxic community alttab can randomly cause the game to give you constant frame drops untill restarting experienced tiny amount of game crashes few facts you complete story mode with about 60% of map completion after that you can do random missions and collections etc it took me about 35h to complete main storyline
recommended
before the details if you havent played it yet buy it right now seriously its great if you have the game on consoles definitely buy it when its on a sale somewhere its easy to run at 60fps without high end pcs its worth it there is just so much to do in it there wasnt a game that got me playing for hours these days it was worth the wait for sure if you do everything alongside the story missions youll get above 7080% completion and about 35 hours out of this game without playing online you can customize your character in so many ways unlike gta iv and there are rpg elements as well there were a few problems like crashing but that seems to have been fixed by the latest patch for me at least also no more microstuttering online has one big problem the loading times not sure what causes this it can be annoying but im not going to complain about that rather the players they are there to kill you and nothing else unless you are on a job with them or you play with friends in a private lobby i have a somewhat highend pc and i push the settings to the limit which is very highsome ultra settings and 1440p and still getting above 60fps with adaptive vsync on dont touch the advanced settings those are the fps killer options without making the game much nicer so tldr singleplayer tenouttaten for me but there are people who still have problems with the game cant even launch etc online 810 takes long to rank up if you dont get invited to do jobs
recommended
probably the best game ive ever played in my life

social club is my social life now help

works like a charm even on an older system i72600k gtx 570 8gigs of ram though you need really strong hardware to enjoy morethanaconsole type of graphics anyway rockstar came through with their promise of optimisation great game great pc version 1011 would would again edit quick tip  if youre using the latest nvidia drivers and nvidia geforce experience just find the game in your experience app and click optimize it did wonders to me everything looks so nice and it doesnt drop fps much if at all
recommended
tldr i find this game to be extremely good and totally worth the money but you may experience technical issues  very good optimization the game looks good and runs on wide variety of hardware i was able to run it on high settings at 2560x1440 resolution getting 60 fps stable on a gtx 970 and fx8350 gpu usage was 90% so almost no real bottleneck for amd fx users  the story is good i wouldnt say that it is very deep but it is entertaining to watch like a good tv series way better than in gta iv or previously  characters are interesting and likeable despite their flaws all main characters have several dimensions to them which are explored over the course of the game  i find satire in this game to be extremely funny the game made me laugh out loud periodically which doesnt happen very often even with comedy shows from some lines that characters drop in dialogue to overall theme and some elements of the game world like ads and posters  i have to commend voice acting separately because it is amazing especially black characters like franklin lamar and tonya but the rest deliver too everything sounds authentic because lines were written and delivered by people natively speaking respective slangs and accents  the game wont last you very long if you are not into gta online after story missions 25 hours for one playthrough you have maybe tenfifteen hours to explore all possibilities that the game offers you like strangersfreaks missions minigames which are good try golf and darts and raceschallenges theres no progression to really keep you in the game afterwards  i didnt find the san andreas of gta v as memorable as the original but that may just be overall burn out with video games and nostalgia lack of san fierro and las venturas is definitely disappointing though  i personally didnt like gta online didnt seem fun to me  keyboardmouse controls for flight arent good and theres no way to map them properly for example i want to map yaw on mouse x axis pitch on mouse y axis and roll on a and d and theres no way to do that you cant map axes to controls i strongly advise using a gamepad for flight driving with keyboard is fine but gamepad helps if you want a more immersive experience like driving in first person  the game has some technical issues in my case ive had crashes at the end of several missions like blitz play one and the game sometimes crashes when i try to shoot from a vehicle other people report same or other issues i advise amd gpu users to do some research before buying

gta 5       but    gta online  15 minutes afk disconnects even in my apartement  or 10 seconds on desktop means idle for too long too  disconnect  long loading times in online  heists unfinished  crash random leave or disconnects  no friend auto connect to sessions 3 time loading to finally rejoin friends after doing jobs with him  bad friend matchmaking  poor bugs  crashes  no mmo feeling  undefined controller bug desktop switchcrash  no fixes in sight  you rockstar

i havent played much of the pc version but by the time i have played it is amazing they have made a huge difference from the console version and the pc version 1010  best game 2015

this by far is the best game on pc yes it is demanding if you want good graphics but the sheer quality of gameplay means you wouldnt even care if the game was 8 bit it is that fun

there are really long loading times otherwise ive never played a game so much in a 2 day session really great oh im writing this while the game loads to show how long it takes which is long just want to remind you that it is really long 9910 i bet you know where that 1 went

i feel like i can now propose to my girlfriend thank you rockstar

great game the only improvements i can think of would be bringing back food like sand andreas had and maybe some expansion pack maps of other cities hold off on gta 6 and start working on expansion cities 
recommended
1010 would be too scared to mod the singleplayer s
recommended
my pc can run solid 60 fps on full normal with some high shaders and the game looks absoloutely beautiful extremely well optimised for pc and when i tried out max settings to see how the game looked my jaw dropped to the ground the pc port may have taken over a year to finally be released but personally i believe rockstar have done an awesome job gameplay is brilliant the story is fantastic and suprisingly the driving is very well done for a pc game ^_^ if youre considering buying this game just have a look at its metacritic rating and youll probably know what to do  i played this game a lot on ps3 and i can definitely say it doesnt even come close to the pc port

great game after this huge banning mods misunderstanding we can all breath a sigh of relief and change all of our negeative reviews to positive ones but yes fantsastic game great graphics runs well and most of all mod support

well it seems rockstar did a good port this time unlike they did with gta iv i`m having no issues so far the game runs great on my midrange pc and it looks way better than it did on my ps3

garbage switchable graphics fix still hasnt hit for my model 7970m hd 2 weeks owner of the game and still unable to play no word from steam on refunds i didnt pay 60 bucks for a game to stare at an error screen or have to troubleshoot
not recommended
this game gives me the usual love hate relationship as all previous versions of gta the main reason is that it is a lovely world to explore but the controls are too much of a fight so i am playing the controls rather then the game another huge problem is the crashes i can play 1 to 30 minutes until i get either a bluescreen  hang or program crash pc software drivers etc are all up to date this for a 60 euro game is unacceptable the focus for r needs to be the instability of the software that being said here are my pros and cons pro  beautiful world to explore  first person finally  great characters trevor rules  missions are fun  cars look stunning con  crashes crashes crashes  too few missions  no real challange after main story  controls  mulitplayer loading time last bit about multiplayer due to crashes i cannot play that so it would be unfair to comment on the gameplay itsself at this moment i would advice to wait until the crashing is resolved apart from that its a fun game
not recommended
crashes at launcher itself money burnt feeling  update read some posts in the discussions page found out that the launcher crash is related to nvidia optimus technology have to disable my nvidia gpu before starting the launcher and thereafter enable it again the game works now and is pretty well optimized so no complaints there but the fact that you have to do this stuff everytime you want to play blows update 2 well a 427 mb update fixed the launcher problem and now i have no problems recommending this game

game of the year

help i started playing this game on april 14th and i havent been able to get away from it

at first the game was buggy it took 5 hours to download when i did i linked my steam account to the wrong social club account fixed now but i was unable to unlink these accounts permanantly linked furthermore upon spawning in multiplayer only i had black lines appear on my character however after downloading an update for my graphics card this resolved the issue furthermore i simply linked the wrong social club account to my ps3 character so that it carried over and it worked i got my online money aswell for preordering and the game is beautiful even in the lowest settings sadly i cannot play the game above the video memory of 1023mb despite having at least 4000mb at my disposal nevertheless great game never played it enough on my ps3 and i am so glad to have it here thanks gta 45 
recommended
great port performance wise sadly multiplayer wise its a straight port of the console miniature scale networking want 15v15 deathmatches good luck the auto mm puts you into a 2v2 or 3v3 there is no lobby to find the full games the console mm that was straight ported to pc puzzles together these 3v3 matches exclusively gta iv did multiplayer better than gta v for pc can you believe that
not recommended
the game is okay if it wasent crashing all the time after what i can read alot have the same problems which i think is poor service from rockstar
not recommended
walked into a super annoying glitch that mostlikely comes up a lot and now i am waiting for support before i can even play for 70$ i expect live chat support or a number to call but i guess nobody offers decent customer service in this industry so why should rockstar or steam be different i was skeptical to hop on this bandwagon and im already feeling some regret hopefully the game will speak for it self if i ever get to play it
not recommended
im gonna be blunt the game looks even better then i recall it looking on the current and last gen versions running at a smooth 60 the driving is a very different experience and with the simple capture gameplay element along with being able to add your own mp3s to the radio it was worth a return if you liked gtav before then youll love it now if of course youre able to run it my current build is a gtx 970 with a i7 4790k running at 40 ghz with 16 gb of ram on this i can run close to ultra settings at a clean frame rate and i havent had a drop yet this game is well optimized despite the 65 gb install you can see why its so  big

10 out of 10 would laugh at all the s aka hackers that got banned using a mod or any file to gain a competitive advantage is still cheating just ask tom brady how he modded those footballs

for starters this game is absolutley amazing but for me there is one huge issue  when you install a triple intake on your car the butterfly valves are not active they just stay shut and that just seems like a huge miss on their part

i dont see how anyone has problems with this game works fine on my msi gt60 2qd laptop no problems to report just fun around the clock only one problem i have is when people troll people with their indestructable cars 910 game would rate again

this is a great game but it needs cross platform compatibility
recommended
if your computer can run it consistantly at at least 30 fps you will have fun
recommended
do i even need to say anything about the game itself unless youve been living under a rock for the past 2 years youd know that this is possibly one of the best games of the current millenium heists are amazing the singleplayer is amazing online is amazing bla bla bla it is an excellent port with some issues people claiming to run the game at 60fps on ultra with a 970 and i5 are either lying running the game at 480p or are masters at overclocking as the game has a surprising amount of odd fps drops  despite being well optimized for the most part as a 970 and i5 4690k user with everything set to ultra except for msaa which is set to 2x and advanced graphics switched off this is what i deal with at 1080p it just drops from 60fps on foot to 40fps while driving just keep that in mind when buying this for the uninitiated in pcs my rig cost around about $1000 yeah my friend has also been having stuttering issues when driving although the problem seems to have gone since the recent patch on a side note the mouse aim is excellent as it uses raw input and has acceleration turned off by default as it should be so no issues there there are however a numerous amount of problems with gta online such as simply getting stuck on a loading screen  which happened a bunch  and somewhat ridiculous lag  desync as the game is hosted through p2p and not through oh i dont know either the billions of dollars that r have made or steam servers both of which would have worked way better than ing p2p with some guy in russia on a 52k modem one last issue i have with the game is the download  install size let me spell it out its s i x t y g i g a b y t e s yes you read that correctly 60gb no not just the install the download too if you thought downloading titanfall watch dogs or even cod ghosts was bad you havent seen anything yet had to leave my pc on for  i  you not  2 days straight of just downloading that is insane other than that the game is pure bliss i give this game a gaben  10 it was worth the weight
recommended
so sharp it melted my eyes 6060 fps

actually good port

there are really long loading times otherwise ive never played a game so much in a 2 day session really great oh im writing this while the game loads to show how long it takes which is long just want to remind you that it is really long 9910 i bet you know where that 1 went

update at bottom read the update grand theft auto 5 is a decent game dont misunderstand me its not bad but in its current state i cannot recommend it if if you can even get it to load its enjoyable for a few minutes until it starts to lag like a son of a  you can download beta drivers from amd and nvidia to combat this issue however it makes my gpu run hot as hell still playable but easily 15 degrees celsius or more than without the driver installed for whatever reason gta online with all its hype falls short only because of stupid cutscenes with annoying ing lamar among other characters that are ing annoying that you cant skip and a jackass community which the community is to be expected because its a multi player game but theres just no way to avoid any of it the story so far has been well done excellent voice acting good animations great graphics even on lowest setting and a superb cutscene to gameplay transition however if it even decides to load you spend most of your time going all across the city doing pointless tasks for half a dozen people about a dozen between the 3 characters so it makes missions a little difficult to understand when this guy you saw 40 missions ago shows up randomly and the characters talk like old buddies from high school and youre sitting there wondering where the  this guy came from its open world as much as the previous games have been you cannot enter every single building but you can enter businesses and player homes the detail varies depending on graphical settings but is better than console even ps4 and xbox1 on every setting i wont spoil any of the story mode for people whove yet to play it its pretty humorous especially with trevor youll see allot of things that you didnt need to see as well especially with trevor read the most common issues online before shelling out $60 for this my newest and most irksome issue is the fact that after nearly 24 hours of playing nearly 50% into the main story it will no longer load into the game it just ctds when its half way done so basically i spent $60 and waited longer than this product is worth to play a broken game with an annoying community do yourself a favor and wait for rockstar to fix this before buying it its not worth the frustration or take a chance to end up like me and so many others i dont recommend it im like a freaking unicorn update upon entering gta online due to boredom i found that quiting online mode and entering story that way works so i completed the story line and quite enjoyed it my previous views on it remain however after completing it i see more reason for some things than i did before multiplayer is full of s and s still you may find one or two nice people but for the most part youll get killed right outside your house go deaf from some  singing in the shower with his mic in his  or just get massacred by some level 100  on a killing spree but if you can find someone to do a heist with most people kick you if youre not level 20 or higher so its hard to get in one its quite enjoyable and fun self radio causes an extreme amount of lag even if you make shortcuts even if you keep the track number below 10 it lags like hell speaking of the radio there are maybe 3 or 4 songs that are good in my opinion and they only come on about once an hour the game looks absolutely amazing on all settings especially amazing on ultra but still beautiful on low or medium that being said it is very taxing on your system my final verdict after completing the story and getting a somewhat firm foothold in online mode single player 1010 when it works multi player 710 only in heists or a party other than that you get dominated by s graphics 610 there are less taxing games that look just as good controls  you can remap them however you want gameplay 710 its fun in most cases but when its not it really ruins the whole experience audio 1010 great voice acting and the lips match the words amazingly overall 810 would recommend to someone who doesnt want to wait for it to be fixed
recommended
original review great game but tooooooo many bugs in gta online when they fix it i would recommend the game update after the last patch where some of the worst bugs where fixed i change my recommend no to a yes it is a nice game i have had lots of fun hours playing with my friends there are still some bugs but not like when the game was released now im hoping for them to fix the last bugs and long term im hoping for an expansion or dlc with more online heists
recommended
one of the best freeroam games ever in my opinion
recommended
nice game
recommended
bought this on ps4 and pc as well nuff said
recommended
gameplay is so much fun and you can do anything in this game online multiplayer is the best i have played in years heist mode is so much fun a must have for any pc gamer even if you did not like the other gta games the story mode for this game is aaa quality never played a game that had such good quality story acting gameplay and great characters that really make you the player have a connection to them online is amazing and just as a reminder dont use mods right now as the modders got to figure out how to seperate them from online and single player players are getting banned for using mods but its only because its also running when playing online the graphics is amazing comparing to the currentgen consoles it really pushes the limit of what graphic cards can do today awesome rating 1010 
recommended
i love this game but i cant seem to play it on pc due to how many crashes occur and not even metioning how many times it freezes if anyone seems to know how to fix then feel free to tell me
recommended
i cant believe im saying this but this is better than gtasa i definitely recommend it was worth the wait i bought it months ago and couldnt wait for the official release and it drove me mad when i heard the release had been postponed but damn it was worth it great graphics runs smoothly in my pc in mediumhigh settings its not a hardcore gaming pc its got only 4gb ram but ok do buy it and dont forget to add me on social club playing it online is fun

people complaining about the game not launching need to stop its either your fault or the windows problem and that has a fix literally below the game on the marketplace i mean people say this game is bad because of their pc not being up to date this game isnt going to run on a crappy graphics card no matter how welloptimized it is the game runs a constant 60 fps and they brought what they promised you bought it for what it was labeled for so dont complain about it not having anything new it didnt advertise anything new

excellent game runs butter smooth and i mean butter smooth on my hardware would definetly recommend to any fan of open world games

the game is well optimized and it was was worth waiting for the director mode is quite fun and is a good reason to buy the game even if you already bought it before you can play as characters from the story pedestrians and even animals you can use your online character in single player play as any character like the republican space ranger and you can enable cheats making you feel like a superhero youll be able to make some really creative movies with all the options theyve given you an improvement over gta 4 theyve also added a custom radio station as well this is truly the ultimate version of gta 5 and i highly recommend it update it appears that the ps4 and xbox one will be getting a version of the rockstar editor if you already own the game on those systems then it may not be worth buying the game again for pc for those that played the game on ps3 and xbox 360 this is worth buying again

its like a dream comes true  you have brought the real los angeles to my home xd

there are a lot of details i wish were there and a lot of things i wish you could do in game and many issues especially online play but still this is a solid game overall

garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
its amazing runs like hot butter and looks fantastic those that say it is broken are wrong it isnt its probably that they have either bought a game they cant run on their broke  pc or theyre getting the dxtory glitch that will crash the game but are too stupid to do a google search to find that out it works online and offline dont let ignorant morons tell you otherwise i have a gtx 970 60fps on ultra 100% of the time no frame drops or crashes if i can do it you can too with all that said its also an incredible game that thankfully the pc version does justice get it

edit no mods  rockstars shady way of announcing that after everyone bought the game is just a step over the edge you dun goofed rockstar still recommended but may aswell just of had it on console 1010 graphics 810 gameplay  you should switch between keyboard and controller while driving etc 910 story 910 muliplayer mixes combat with racing with all the other stuff that make gta a genre of its own best game i have in my library optimized as  online is fast and reliable 1010 would bang again

10\10 great game just love this i didnt play in the console so i having realy fun time in the single and in the online thats all i need to say to describe this awsome game was worth the time of the delay
recommended
great port performance wise sadly multiplayer wise its a straight port of the console miniature scale networking want 15v15 deathmatches good luck the auto mm puts you into a 2v2 or 3v3 there is no lobby to find the full games the console mm that was straight ported to pc puzzles together these 3v3 matches exclusively gta iv did multiplayer better than gta v for pc can you believe that
not recommended
the game is okay if it wasent crashing all the time after what i can read alot have the same problems which i think is poor service from rockstar
not recommended
walked into a super annoying glitch that mostlikely comes up a lot and now i am waiting for support before i can even play for 70$ i expect live chat support or a number to call but i guess nobody offers decent customer service in this industry so why should rockstar or steam be different i was skeptical to hop on this bandwagon and im already feeling some regret hopefully the game will speak for it self if i ever get to play it

runs better than minecraft 1110  tons of fun  a lot of entertaining missions  many unique vehicles  after main story missions there is still a lot of stuff to do  you can either play in first or third person  full of easter eggs and secrets new ones are still being found  amazing graphics  not even a single person wanted me to go bowling with them and i could go on  very long loading time  textures popping up  i can start online and go make a coffee when i return the game will still be loading  i had to return to an older version of the game because the new one did not start but when i joined online i got banned  terrible fov in first person its a good game i dont regret spending my 60 on it and i recommend it to everyone who can run it

grand theft auto v after such a long delay has finally been released for the worthiest of players and i will say that the wait has been worth it i will be honest after iv i was not expecting too much although max payne was good however all of my fears were disproved as rockstar games has really released a work of art this time around there are so many things that make this game as good as it is i can barely even scratch the surface with my review the gameplay just to let you know i have not gone into singleplayer much at all just because the online mode has so much to offer just messing around with friends is an incredibly fun and engaging experience there are so many tasks to keep you occupied and make you some money you can go and conquer a heist or if you feel less inclined you can try a race if none of that interests you just cruising around the city is incredible as there is so much to see and do making and spending ingame cash has never been easier with so many car customization options clothes to buy and weapons although if everyone was a bit more friendly online it would be even better the details the map los santos is incredibly detailed some of the best map design i have ever seen it is massive but unlike san andreas there is actually stuff to do outside of the city from the densely packed city to the beaches to the mountains the map is gorgeous and diverse even after two weeks of owning the game there are still many areas that i have not yet seen this combined with all the interactive elements of the map like the pedestrians and traffic on the roads make the city feel truly alive and almost real the small details like puddles forming during a storm npc interaction all make the game that much more believable the graphics in addition it seems that the graphics were not compromised to be on the level of the consoles they are truly pcmr the rendering distance is incredible the textures are crisp and realistic  the foliage is dense and varied the shadows are sharp and detailed  the character models are good and and the reflections are great not to mention stable 60 fps i am only at very high settings not even ultra so those with more powerful rigs may get even better results having played on consoles i can say that the pc version leaves all consoles in the dust optimization in addition the game appears to be really stable unlike the iv with no crashes so far and a stable framerate i must say i was impressed that my 670 manages to do so well with this game it just shows how much work must have gone into the pc version they have definitely learned from gta iv the soundtrack while only a minor point the whole soundtrack of the game is pretty damn good all of the radio stations are great and usually feature some pretty big talent behind them while it may not be a huge part of the game it does really add to the immersion factor within the game my gripes with the game the biggest disappointment so far for me is that the driving mechanics are currently severely lacking suspensions are too planted handles like the car is on rails and cars seem to be virtually indestructible the car damage is severely lacking braking times are unrealistic one additional minor complaint is that the first person fov is way too small at the max i usually have it much much higher in other first person games the lobbies in gta online are also problematic other than that only minor issues remain like duplicating cars in online garages and server issues if rockstar manages to patch those issues with the game it would be an easy 1010 game of the century conclusion other than that it is a near perfect technical masterpiece although the wait was way too damn long the result is nothing short of epic the world is detailed the graphics rock and it actually seems stable unlike gta iv the experience is marred by the driving issues connectivity and the fov but honestly it doesnt take too much away from the overall experience making this one of the games i would easily recommend to everyone as a must own my expectations have been blown thank you rockstar and gaben for this incredible feat of videogame engineering even after the ing 3 year wait it was worth every minute of waiting this game is absolutely a must have it is gr8 m8 i r8 88 absolutely incredible worth every second of the wait

pros graphicly excellent fps mode adds alot to the game for the most part good port seemless use of controller and keyboardmouse director mode is a feature that will add lots of replay value cons a few peopke having loading people most people have no problems just a vocal minority a few fps issues when on full greaphics even with high end cards minor camera control issues in fps but that could me being an  tldr  great port if it loads highly recomend but turn down shaddows a little the fps mode adds a great new perspective that works perfectly with keyboard and mouse but have a controller ready for driving for me this game works a treat i have played the 360 version and this is deffinatly just as fun the use of first person mode makes the game epic gun fights are better and more seamless with the ability to aim now a thing i personalynuse a 360 controller and keyboard and mouse somi get the best of both worlds and i would recomend this im using a nvidia 970 and the game is on near full graphics and well my fps is somewhere between 2545 fps which would imply the game has a little work to do in regards to graphical bugs yes it looks tones better than 360 but not that much better i dread to see what 4k monitors look like in regards to full graphics so i hope an update comes out to improve this either way the game looks good and super high quality shaddows are not hugely necessary and turning them down a little improves the frame rate alot for those who have been having issues loading that gota suck and there is little i can say about that but it works well for me first time so i have to highly recomend this game and while it is technicaly a port its a fairly good one and think its worth all the money

must have

the first thing i thought when i first spawned into the virtual city of los santos well i didnt really think anything this game is so advanced so detailed and just so fun that it can last your for months maybe even years its basically a life simulator want to arm wrestle play tennis race rob a store go mountain biking i think you get the point there are so many things about this game it deserves to be the third most sold game in history what are you waiting for get it

i bought gta v for my 360 when it first came out and played it often the disc hardly left the drive as i continued to enjoy the game all the way up to the pc release i can honestly say its a whole new game on pc the graphics are stunning there are lots of new things and im still getting used to the first person view which im starting to prefer on foot now mods are starting to come out and im really going to enjoy breaking outside of the barriers imposed of what rockstar intended in this game my advice for anyone looking at this and thinking i already played it on my console is to try it on pc its not what you played before and you wont look back sure the story is much the same but the mechanics and sheer beauty of gta v pc raises the bar to a whole new very high level for the gaming industry
recommended
on a scale of deepfried bacon wrapped taco cake to frozen hamburger soup nacho salad i give this game a twice baked glazed macaroni waffle calzone drink

maybe the best open world games so far i played farcry series just cause series watch dogs gta 3 and 4 and its episodes even if its 60 its still worth it its a lot better than gta 4 it was not very good  online is amazing even after i played the xbox360 version with the heists i totally recommend it

add this game to your cart buy it why this game is fun the game is also good in other ways but they dont matter the game ran on my pc and it probably will on yours so why are you still reading this and not playing the game

the long wait has been worth it if youre a pc gamer whos spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest greatest gta then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version sure the xbox one and ps4 versions were amazing delivering gta 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures smoother surfaces better lighting and cool depth of field effects see our full review below but the pc version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the pcs strengths in doing so it adds a few more metres to one of gamings towering achievements having covered the game twice already we wont go too far into the detail of what makes gta 5 so good partly its a question of experience with four previous 3d gtas under its belt plus red dead redemption bully and assorted dlc packs rockstar has had time to refine its vision for open world gameplay and its systems and gta 5 has the best driving the best shooting and some of the best mission design of the series its also a question of structure dividing the action amongst three protagonists with three interlocking storylines and three distinctive flavours means you nearly always have the option to flick from michaels ageing career criminal saga to franklins ambitious hoodlum story to trevors crazed amoral brand of mayhem where the dumb cathartic slapstick violence we all  deep down  love gta for finds its natural home with repeated play it only becomes clearer how well all three tales mesh thematically with rockstars savage satirical take on the californian dream

an extremely satisfying rerelease onto the pc the firstperson makes each vehicle you enter more immersive coupled with the ability to be first person during skydiving and even with hang gliding personal rating 1010 for a rerelease even better at 60fps and 1080p if your computer can support it for the pc i went ahead and made my own review of the game httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv52hhtp6ppvk

unless youve been in a cave for a long time you know what gta is and what to expect the game itself is everything youve come to expect from the franchise and doesnt disappoint however rockstar themselves have just made the game frustrating by ignoring a long standing issue with their servers for months there have been reports of people who cannot retrieve their save files due to an error in the r cloud servers which means if you bought the game to play online with your friends you have a chance of being severely disappointed ive searched through their support topics and posts and all but the only thing i can find is an ambiguous were working on it from about 4 months ago they havent even bothered to give regular updates about the problem that i could see if its in another section i apologize but otherwise thats just unprofessional for a game corporation to just ignore their customers for so long after such a cursory response its just a crap shoot whether or not you can get online and when and then once there there are hackers that can just mess with your game someone filled my apartment with a swat team and big foot and then put a shark on top of my head until rockstar fixes their servers and reigns in the hackers id just stay away

i loved this game and franchise i bought a ps3 during the intial release just to play gta5 i sold it a month before the pc announcement and was excited for it finally to come to pc the ui is terrible online is full of cheaters and i can honestly say i have no idea what took them 2 years for this game to come out on pc i believe they did it just to justify selling a 2 year old game for $60 another gripe i have with the game is the online money in order to push shark cards they nerfed mission payouts to 13 of what they used to be rockstar used to be great but if i could get my money back i would

i am very disappointed with this game i had just bought it today and played for a few hours online which was the primary purpose of the purchase in my case during these few hours ive noticed modders in every server i went on to as well as said modders being able to kill and crash anyone this includes me in one of the servers i had gotten a tank off of someone and went on a rampage only to have a ufo model stuck to me and constant confetti explosions occur i was also teleported and stuck to multiple players at a time and blown up which caused the kill feed to register me as the killer this occurred so much that i couldnt even make it to the option screen to switch servers before i died again i finally got out and to another server only to be cloned multiple times and my game crashed instantly whenever i called someone out for modding online modders just ruined the game and i am requesting a refund but i probably cant because of a 2 hour limit guess thats $60 down the drain for a game ill never be playing tldr  dont buy the game and go online if you have a problem with modders ruining everything constantly

this game made me switch to pc gaming this is my first ever review used to play pretty much xbox one only untill gta 5 on pc this is my most played pc game clocking in at only 17 hoursand i think i played it only 3 times once i get on this game theres almost no getting me off the fun gameplay makes me want to play the graphics keep me in the game and the random nonsenseover the top actionhookersetc makes time fly by im only 31% complete with the single player havent even tried online yet no mods either so when mods do come outgood bye life going out to upgrade my pc soon because i finally realize after playing gta on xbox360 and xboxone then pcthat 60fps really does make a difference thank you gta for making me switch exclusively to the pc master race

i cannot recommend this game as fun as it is because of the rampant cheating that goes on in gta online it is gamebreaking for me to see an average of one one hacker per every 2 yes 2 lobbies i play in oh youd like to do a little pvp cool well how about letting a hacker stand there and take all your rpg shots and laugh at you while they flick a button that explodes the whole lobby think nuclear weapon and kills everyone in your name or maybe if they are  at you they will continually spawn new versions of you until it breaks your game or maybe they just come into a lobby and randomly pass out millions of dollars which is why most people dont report please people rockstar has made it quite clear that hacking will not be dealt with as they have been promising to deal with it literally for years the only way to stop them from being this way is to not buy the game which is what i am begging anyone who reads this review in advance to do not buy it this game is broken

stuttering by far the worst frame tearing for a pc game vsync causes even more stuttering adaptive vsync causes tearing when frame rate drops below 60 which happens very often on almost any setting 4770k98016gb

a great game but wont recommend it i have 2 reasons 1 i preordered the game for $50 and i got ingame money for story mode and online guess what summer sale is here and the game is $4761 cheaper of course but they will get more ingame money for online is that fair for people that preordered i think its a terrible joke 2 now the game is full of hackers modders and cheaters you will either find hackers with all the best vehicles even flashing vehicles or storymode only vehicles or youll find hackers with godmode on so you wont be able to kill them and they will usually grief killing you nonstop or youll find hackers that spawns all kinds of vehicles even ufos and they will give you lots of ingame money which ruins the economy _ so youll spend a lot of time trying to find a good server with no hackers but you wont find any and youll end up in a server with at least 2 hackers and youll go into passivo mode everytime they approach you but they wont be able to kill you so theyll get mad and they will crash your game and more time wasted check for the latest updates and if rockstar hasnt got rid of the hackers they should say it in announcements then dont buy it edit rockstar posted this on the news tab rockstar rolls out new cheat detection systems in gta online since then i havent seen any difference hackersmodders are still in every lobby and also ive noticed that the game crashes more often at random times

ok so i will split this into two parts offline and online offline pros  amazing graphics fantastic detail good map some interesting characters cons  pretty weak storyline characters you dont really care about i found in san andreas i was cj and cared about him i never bonded with any of these characters sure trevor is funny but thats about it not a fan of having 3 main playable characters online horrendous almost every infactevery sessionserver has hackersmodders in them stealing your money blowing your stuff up or worse making your character do these things just completely and utterly ruins the game i havent bought a shark card real money for in game money but if i had and then been hacked i would be so angry its tantamount to robbing your house or stealing your wallet its just not on this need so much work even early access titles know for hackers dayz arent even close to as bad as this its just a farce its like running around in garys mod except people arent meant to be doing this stuff an they are stealing your money its like there are no checks from rockstar what so ever the game is just crawling with hackers enter at your own risk conclusion i was blown away by the graphics and detail in the game i was a little dissapointed by the story and characters although still enjoyed the game i cant belive how bad online is for hackers its unplayable

well i have bought this game 5 times now ps3 ps4 xbox 360 steam and social club i bought it first on social club and it kept crashing and i couldnt fix it so i decided that it may work on steam so i bought it off of steam well guess what the steam version of the game also crashes so ive spent $120 on a game that just crashes every time i launch it wouldnt the developers now about this problem wouldnt the patch it faster right now i couldnt recommend the game due to the fact that you run the risk of it crashing before you are even able to play it

grand theft auto 5 is brilliant and addicting its one of the best 3rd party games out there for the pc the best thing is that its not gimped heck from what ive seen this game is super optimized now im not saying your toaster can play this game but by golly you probably could try and the game could be playable at least from what ive seen the scaling is much better than what gtaiv offered anyway going from controller to keyboard is seemlessly easy but i find myself using the keyboard and mouse more than the controller because its so much fun with it some might find driving to be better with a controller but i dont find it any more difficult than walking in this game although thats probably because ive been playing with mostly my razer tartarus and naga for the most part there are some things that are different from this version than the console version for one you can have a custom radio station this isnt just playing music from a folder or steam music no its an actual radio station in the game they even added commercial breaks news breaks and a dj for the station as if the music was meant to be in the game so you can put the entire vice city soundtrack or parts of it and rock on driving around gta v but hearing the good ol flock of seagulls as you do it its freakin awesome the online portion is neat too as if the game didnt already offer countless hours of gameplay from the single player campaign now you can do all of that over again with your own custom character now this was in the console release but this time the online portion is complete thats right no more delays we have heists team deathmatch races and more its amazing the game also has this app you can download from the itunes or google play store to upgrade your dog or do gtaonline stuff but its not required if i remember correctly i hardly used it in fact i rarely used chop if at all during my main playthrough on the ps3 but hes there if you want to use him but keep in mind to train him you must use the app as there really isnt any other way to do it in game to my knowledge overall this is a great game for the pc and its not in any shape way or form gimpped and stripped down of features from the console version i would go as far as to say that this is the definitive way to play the game it is by far the best version of grand theft auto v bar none if you dont have this game get it rockstar did a great job now lets get red dead redemption

love it gta online well in a way the modders make it fun sometimes i stacked up 4 blimps in midair and landed a few helicopters on them it was great fun then you have the money modders who are not all bad money is nice but once you get a lot it takes away that motivaiton to do heists and stuff as for the godmode hackers thay are not too cool in all the game is not dying by any measure especially on the pc this new update will most likely render most of the current hacks obsolete like it did with the previous one the online gameplay is quite simply the best in my opinion you can do just about whatever you want i will leave it at that if you have not already played it go and do it if you can`t i`m very sorry you have to miss out watch people play on youtube the game is great story mode it tells the tale of the three main protagonists michael franklin and trevor they are criminals hardcore criminals i mean let`s be honest trevor is not the kind of guy you introduce your parents to michael is cool but it is kind of hard to like him because of all if the liesno spoilers here franklin seems to be the most down to earth he is for the most part normal even though he has the blood of a few hundred men and women on his hands you follow these three on a series of events that unflold quite elegantly in this story it is not weak by any means but it could have used more well just more i personally love long games though this game is not short by any standards i wish there was more to do with this trio i felt myself longing for more upon completion of the story i guess that means they did a fantastic job with the writing summary it is the most diverse and one of the greatest games to play to date you should at least give it a try the online is amazing even if you are alone i found it to be ine of the most immersive games right next to skyrim and the last of us and fallout it is a masterpiece and i only hope the next is as good i trust rockstar completely with the franchise`s fate they have never led us astray all in all this is a great game get it rcthethird

runs at a consistent 60 fps with very high textures using my 4gb 770 gtx and an i7 4770k at 1080p i was a little worried that the pc port would run poorly even on modern hardware like gta iv but it seems to be very smooth considering it is a port the settings claim to require 2300mb of vram so id imagine having a graphics card with only 2gb of vram wont be able to run this at max settings simply because of a vram bottleneck invest in a 3gb graphics card or settle for slightly less than max settings the game is beautiful at high resolution and high fps this is a much better experience than my original playthrough on the xbox 360 when it was first released
recommended
amazing game rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didnt that was achieved anyway but im sure they were amazing graphics better than any console graphics 60fps makes it so much better and feel like youre actually there at times when youre in the amazing 1st person mode which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the pc director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is alot of fun when bored in the game definitely recommended if you have a graphics card of atleast radeon hd 7770 but it might look alright on a lower one but yeah definitely recommended

works flawlessly for me amazing optimization even on my outdated hardware i can run the game fine and it looks reasonably well on my customized settings textures average shaders and shadows high cpurelated options are varied draw distances maxed runs anywhere from 3060fps with vsync on and incredibly rarely drops below 30 my cpu is a amd phenom ii x4 955 and my gpu is an gtx 480 so you can see i dont have the best computer for todays games one of my buddies is having rendering issues and another linked his account incorrectly like a  so do be wary there are some loops you have to jump through but after that its smooth sailing theres issues that rockstar knows about though its very likely thisll be remedied during launch week the port seems to be very well done some controls seem wonky but it will just take some getting used to the population density doesnt seem to have changed much 4 or 5 additional people on small streets but nothing like the images on the store page car density is better its not doubled or anything if thats what you were wondering there are some very low quality textures even on maxed out settings for some reason aswell though you will only notice it if youre looking directly at it overall its very enjoyable for me online is a bit finicky but i expected that be careful with a few settings as they will literally drop your framerate in half such as the advanced video settings i would recommend the game but you may or may not want to wait a week or so for the first patches if you can wait do it but you dont need to it should be fine port is very very solid

gta v would have to be my favorite one in the series its clear that grand theft auto is a series that satires american culture this game seems to satire american traditions a lot more than previous games although its very apparent it doesnt over use the joke where it becomes predictable and boring this game doesnt feel like a port at all and thats something that isnt really common with games that released on console first it controls very well and to state the obvious the graphics are much better i originally played this on the 360 so i cant say anything about the ps4 and the xbox one i could say theres a lot to do in the game because there is but i find after you do all of the missions and collect all of your shiny cars the single player is very dull replaying missions and spending my time robbing little stores and then getting my wanted level to the max to get a quick adrenaline rush after the amazing campaign and the above average strangers and freaks missions the next best thing is the multiplayer where there is tons of stuff to do free roaming becomes much more fun when you have a city full of other players waiting to shoot you in the head and screaming into the mic if youre coming to gta v from console then the multiplayer then might have left a very bad taste in your mouth but theyve added content and removed a lot not all of the issues 010

oh boy the game everybody has been waiting for surely the newest gta wont have all of the issues that gta4 had i mean it does not have gfwl its years later so it should have better servers the story mode should have a character creater mode something all of the saints row games have had & the story mode not only did not suffer but was awesome for what it was [i think the last 2 sr games story about hell wasare utterly stupid] i digress surely this latest gta game will be all of the things a game like this should be coming from a company all of us loyal paying fans made rich with so many purchases of their games over the years surely this game is awesomesauce dipped in molten chocolate no sorry this game is way worse with the idiotic ghettotrash single charcter if you play as anybody else in story later ill never find out i have no desire to be a ghettotrash wannabe gangsta minority in any game with a playable nwa music video for a story mode one thats ridiculously perverted h0m0s3xual dogs3x your aunt asking for footrubs & other inapropriate physical attention etc utterly stupid in the way the games inhabitants act and speak oh & you can play offline with a whole bunch of characters i can even make one that looks like me but youll get no weapons no missions & cannot save any progress [dirrector mode] i have sixty mbs netspeed on a gaming pc thats less then a year old i can play lagfree on mmos with servers over 5 thousand miles accross the ocean but cannot connect to gtas cheap 20 year old server like ever if you go by all the various forums around the net neither can most players and the ones who can get random lagspikes & disconnects for no reason whatsoever even playing in soloonline modes the game may look nice but thats it no matter how much in game cash you spend on the games top end vehicles & motorcycles they all handle like crap which is sad because even going top speed they feellook like youre going about 40 mph compaired to real life driving the one single airplane ive found to fly yet also handled like utter crud saints row two not 3 or 4 or even 5 but two had vehicles planes & helecoptors that handled way way way better then these do maybe if rockstar cared more about gameplay & funfactor a term often used in the 90s by game companies back when games actually were designed with fun in mind instead of eye candy to sell more copies to their target audience that they obviously hate this game could have been the best all around game ever made but instead its the last nail in rockstars coffin for many people who like myself feel as though theyve been duped if you think playing a way worse story mode then gta san andreas had which was actually witty & fun despite being forced to play out an nwa video as a ghettotrash minority in an idiotic & utterly repulsive version of la & never want to play online or as a custom char that looks like you then by all means purchase this game if you plan on playing online go shell out 1000 bucks for a new playstation & hang online with all those mouthy kids two updates later the have to turn off your video card to boot up the game error has been fixed but it didnt fix anything about their cheap old trashy server connectivity issues that most players have on pc  i cannot believe what microsoft & ea have turned the video game industry into since about y2k but its utterly disgusting sad that in order to play games that arent broken & are still fun we have to dig out old copies of games thatre a decade or more old you broke my heart rockstar were through drops mic update okay after playing the game online for awhile if your online mode will work theres tons of neat & fun stuff to do on this game you can make a custom avatar to use online even save more then one per profile the editor is a little hard to figure out at 1st {chose mother father then toggle which you look more like then chose skintone etc} after that the edit is pretty easy [took me a good hour juggling the motherfather bits to get one that even remotely looked like me] but in the end its worth the effort i guess watch out for hacktool users online as there was almost always one in every session i was in but when people start mocking them they usually leave also watch for campers sitting outside places like where the tutorial ends etc all n all if they manage to get most preferably all players to stay connected online with future updates & server tweeks i do highly recomend this game the story mode is still offensive & ridiculously ghetto edit if you can connect & stay connected online want to spent an hour making your avatar & dont mind at least 10% of the people you encounter in freeroam & jobs races deathmatch heists etc being hacktool users then this honestly is an awesome game the cars almost always spin out when you try to drift but the peddal bikes & motorbikes drift quite well the stats they make you build up during the game glitch out in multiplayer the custom tires glitch out on motorbikes but none of this is that big of deal nor does the bugs make the game unfun the engine saints row2 was made with is way better for the way vehicles handle across the board yet this game overall if the 1st sandbox game to top sr2 in overall fun factor oh & the plane races are asinine & all aircraft handle like crap hey rockstar go play saints row2 1000 hours for each dev then fix your planes and car drifting still if you have a decent netspeed & 12 decent pc you will prob enjoy gtaonline gta5 storymode will always suck

first of all i love this game i think its a nice step forward for the open world genre and it started out as something awesome and had a lot of potential for improvement however this is one of the reasons why i will have to downvote gta 5 a friend of mine got 750000 from a hacker he did not ask for that money he got it anyway we both got woried that he might get in trouble for that due to people complaining theyre getting banned for recieving money out of nowhere he contacted rockstar and made a full detailed description of what happened and how he wants no part of it someone from the studio responded to him telling him not to worry as it will be taken care of around 5 weeks have passed since that incident and still nothing is being done about it very unprofessional from my point of view moving on rockstar is slowly raising prices in the game i mean come on 80 grand for chrome rims 195 mil for a car how much does it cost to fully customize it somewhere around the neighborhood of 30 heists i already payed twice for the game and i know im not the only one now theyre throwing these shark and bull cards around the only bull here is their  and thats the truth ive been with this game company for a long time i bought the gtas max paynes red dead redemption la noire etc i think its safe to say that i am a bit disappointed a part of me was optimistic that rockstar isnt as money driven as other game industries eventhough it is what it is i just hope they become a bit more focused on what the fans want without sucking away all our money

after about 60 hours in this game i can surely say that i love it it is truly a beautiful game with amazing graphics amazing gameplay and tons of content from races to missions to heists and even if you run out of things to do you can just go around causing havoc with friends ive not exprerienced any problems with the game like crashes or not even being able to start it but i know for a fact that this game has these issues as an example my friend hasnt been able to start the game for about 4 days straight now and my other friend just keeps crashing multiple times during just about 30 minutes it even had installation issues but otherwise this game is a technical masterpiece and i have tried it on both console and on the pc and i can surely say if you have a pc that can run it in my opinion it the pc version is the best imo 910 the reason behind the 9 and not a 10 is that the game had problems on release yeah yeah they may have fixed it but this game still has problems that should have been fixed before release edit @ the 2nd of july after starting up the game after about a weeks absence i joined online and the first thing that happened to me was that i died by a sudden explosion the reason behind this was clearly a hacker the only problem with using a nonprivate server about now is because of the hackers the hackers have completely taken over gta online they have ruined it they give everybody money and kill people make people unable to walk kill you and more in my opinion this ruins a big part of online

bought the game because reviews said its a good pcport form consoles i guess they meant the graphics performance in comparison gta 4 that was one of the worst ive ever seem  large world with tons of things to do  very strong story and charcters for a videogame  graphics looks good even on older hardware  random directx11 crashes every 10min to 4 hours which unlike people claiming my case absolutely nothing to do with overheating or overclockled standardclocked or underclocked gpu tried it all systems is stabil for more than 10h on burn in benchmarks no patch in a whole montch  online servers are extremely lagging on weekends unplayable  the reason why i write this review rockstar social club cant connect to steam happened the third time and i cant even play story mode because of their useless always online piracy protecting so for me great game but technical disaster last game i bought from rockstar

grand theft auto 5 is one of the best games i have ever played but the pc port is garbage so many bugs make this game unplayable gonna to do a clich with this one and do a pros and cons pros 1 graet game probably the most versatile games i have played 2 great campaign 3 the online has so many things to do it will keep you busy for 1000 hours with friends 4 the graphics are amazing cons 1 the stutteringomg the stuttering i feel like my 1000 dollar pc is a dell labtop if you tab out or even  tab the game stutters randomly it makes the game unplayable you can fix the stuttering for 30 mins to and hour by restarting the game 2 the controls for everything easy to get used to butyou have to dual wield a controller and keyboard to fly or drive cars correctly 3 oh man it sure is great running into game breaking people playing a little bit of online when bam suddenly you richer than bill ing gates the next minute you cant even play online because a modder gave you money and rockstar was like  you conclusion the stuttering alone i would not recommend this game atleast until they get that fixed im saying no

single player review probably one of the most overrated games of recent times performance  runs like utter crap stutters frequently when trying to drive around the city note that this is on a ssd with a 290x and a liquidcooled 3770k with the graphics settings toned down graphics  mediocre at best this game was originally released for ps3 and 360 so dont expect anything gameplay  nothing unique comparable to the likes of just cause sleeping dog and saints row story  interesting characters a decent plot this basically carries the entire single player experience ui  suffers from obvious consoleport syndrome some of the keyboardmouse keybinding are atrociously stupid eg the controls for controlling a plane is beyond comprehension with wasd and keypad both being used and you still need a third hand to control the camera with a mouse luckily you got a console controller right conclusion  youre better off spending money on other games gta v is 2 years late to the scene

for all of you complaining about the game not working on launch day realize this  its a launch day that being said on launch day a few hours after it had unlocked i got into single player without a problem and social club was not bothersome this is hands down the best pc product rockstar has done even better than max payne 3 an amazing port by the way this is not a port but instead what feels like something that was engineered from the bottom up to be on the leading platform and its minumin specs even let you play it on a video card thats from the mid 2000s after playing this on a 360 its just like how i wanted to remember it now with a great keyboard and mouse control scheme most rockstar ports measure your performance via the amount of vram thats been allocated for your card to produce a great image on screen 2gb would be good for fully maxed out its best to go for a 4gb card however i myself use more than the game says i should and it runs fine with the highest texuture settings a few technical highlights you get raw mouse input for zero mouse acceleration borderless window works well tons of options for shaders post processing aa anti aliasing even grass this game supports both amd and nvidia exclusive tech woot wow the rockstar editor i didnt expect just a easy to use and robust tool seriously i was able to make a really cool looking film that was literally me shooting people and jumping on a train while taking down a helicopter i a am no director gta online  its great if youve got friends better if theyre in high places by yourself with a bunch of randoms though that can be well you might want to turn on passive aggressive mode missions when they load are fun especially the heists setups is it worth $60 unless you commit your life to the new rockstar editor the fact stil remains that this is a two year old game which is now granted on the platform of choice however i strongly suggest you wait until a sale as of writing this were looking at about a couple of months away from a steam summer sale wait then update rockstar pretty nulled out of the summer sale it is clear that any delay for this game was completly justified since the end result is a well oiled product something that is becoming rare nowadays

huge memory leaksthe situation hasnt improved with the latest patchesit crashes a lot it happens to lots of players check the forum and after the latest patch the shuttering and the fps drops have made especially the online mode unplayable also lots of hackers on online mode are destrying the game and r fails to find a way and deal with them furthermore looks like r has enforced a drm with latest patch causing extreme shuttering for many players but hasnt been validated completely yet in other words the game in papers rocks its awesome but in reality has huge issues so dont buy it until r fixes the shuttering the random crashes and deal with the hackers

love it gta online well in a way the modders make it fun sometimes i stacked up 4 blimps in midair and landed a few helicopters on them it was great fun then you have the money modders who are not all bad money is nice but once you get a lot it takes away that motivaiton to do heists and stuff as for the godmode hackers thay are not too cool in all the game is not dying by any measure especially on the pc this new update will most likely render most of the current hacks obsolete like it did with the previous one the online gameplay is quite simply the best in my opinion you can do just about whatever you want i will leave it at that if you have not already played it go and do it if you can`t i`m very sorry you have to miss out watch people play on youtube the game is great story mode it tells the tale of the three main protagonists michael franklin and trevor they are criminals hardcore criminals i mean let`s be honest trevor is not the kind of guy you introduce your parents to michael is cool but it is kind of hard to like him because of all if the liesno spoilers here franklin seems to be the most down to earth he is for the most part normal even though he has the blood of a few hundred men and women on his hands you follow these three on a series of events that unflold quite elegantly in this story it is not weak by any means but it could have used more well just more i personally love long games though this game is not short by any standards i wish there was more to do with this trio i felt myself longing for more upon completion of the story i guess that means they did a fantastic job with the writing summary it is the most diverse and one of the greatest games to play to date you should at least give it a try the online is amazing even if you are alone i found it to be ine of the most immersive games right next to skyrim and the last of us and fallout it is a masterpiece and i only hope the next is as good i trust rockstar completely with the franchise`s fate they have never led us astray all in all this is a great game get it rcthethird

buy it for only the single player but if your going to buy it for the multi player dont bother to many hackers ruin this game and the experiance you mostlikly want so in my all honest oppinion dont buy the game for multiplayer i wanted to play with my friends but sadly thanks to the hakers that was no longer possible gg hackers thanks for ruining another great game
not recommended
this game is obviously a great concept its graphics are incredible and its got one of the best singleplayer campaigns ive ever experienced but dont expect to get any enjoyment out of anything beyond campaign the online is almost completely unplayable youre gonna get randomly dropped from heists right before you finish youre gonna freeze and crash anywhere from 13 times an hour and youre going to spend an agonizing amount of time in loading screens after every job its literally a worse experiance than it was on ps3 or 360 seriouslyits the same  matchmaking and the same waiting around for lobbies that will never launch dont waste your money on this game if you had it on another console its worth it for first time players for the campaign alone but if you thought gta v online would be super awesome on pc with 24 people andtons of players for deathmatches and capture missions well youre  out of luck its ironic that rockstar made a game about bank heists when the biggest heist involved in the whole game was the ing game itself and the got a lot of people twice

grand theft auto v pc how shall i go about reviewing you as we all know grand theft auto v or gtavgta5 originally came out on 17 september 2013 for the xbox 360 and playstation 3  at which time it was a huge sensation for those who owned an x360 or ps3 at the time which sadly and happily as im not a fan of consoles wasnt me eventually rockstar the developers of gta announced that the game would be coming out for the newlyreleased xbox one and playstation 4 consoles one year after their x360ps3 releases with a pc released planned for sometime in 2015 sure enough on 18 november 2014 those xbops4 versions were released and it wasnt for another five months that us pcgamers got gta v almost one and a half years after its original release date despite the pcs late releasedate i am overall highly impressed with the game one of the biggest issues that all of us pc gamers had with gta iv was that it had absolutely no pcoptimisation for instance gta iv ran at an average framerate of 32 framessecond during a fiveminute benchmark i ran i ran the game at maximum settings across three monitors 5760x1080 was my screenresolution now with gta v which has much much better pcoptimisation and after a similar fiveminute benchmark again after playing across three 1080p screens my framerate averaged out at 57 framessecond considering that gta v is a newer game with better graphics that just goes to show how badly gta iv was optimised for the pc platform versus gta v anyways the main reason i even brought all of this up was because it is a very important thing to keep in mind especially for me  because i want to actually play the game  the game grand theft auto v is a really fun game with a great story each of the games three maincharacters are equally badarse and each has their own unique abilities overall this adds to the fun of the game since in most games you have only the main character to play i found that many of the missions especially the heists that require your team to work together was extremely fun having to use one character to fly a helicopter while using another to control a submarine while the last holds off the enemies with a gun is pretty fcking awesome and something that many games havent really done lately play as multiple singleplayer characters at the same time basically im going to avoid going too far into the story to avoid spoiling it however i will say that once you start playing and understand the story the more excited youll get and the more youll want to push on and play to see what finally happens in the end gameplay so unlike the game the gameplay will cover how the game feels mainly the controls and what not first off before i get too far into that i want to mention that the rockstar social club isnt gone however games for windows live is  so thank god for that now onto the controls and theyre actually not that bad the game is playable with either a keyboard and mouse or with just an xbox 360xbox one controller certain vehicles like the planes and helicopters are easier to fly with the controller however it isnt impossible to master flying them with the kbm it does sortof feel like there is some kindof mouseacceleration ingame but nothing too serious that itll throw you off and who knows you may be able to turn it off i just dont know how ha gta online the online bit of this game is known simply as grand theft auto online and it allows you to make your own character level them up do heists and whatnot online with friends and total strangers gtao for gtaonline isnt too bad and i actually do recommend it once youve beaten the base game overall allinall grand theft auto v is a great game that i highly recommend to anyone whether it be the pc version or one of the four different console versions it has a good onlinemode that is fun to play unlike some games and most importantly its fun it has a great singleplayer story and good character acting both voices and animations were done by the same actors score 55  excellent no other words for it

yes i do recommend it to others sure there are a few times when my fps drops below like 60 for a second but overall its optomized great as far as the gameplay i havent played much singleplayer but what i have is very fun and has a lot to do the multiplayer is really fun and even better w friends story time i was driving a van to someones house for a mission along a train track a train came along and hit my van on a bridge sending it into a canyon it didnt explode so we drove it down the canyon towards a road we finally get unto the road and start driving towards the house right before we get to the house one of the people doing the mission with us drives up in a tank and blows us up we fail the mission the person apologized and offered to mod my acount to give me 50m and lvl 158 everyone said no except me got my account modded wrote about it in a review for gta v review got top review rockstar noticed it banned my acount well that last bit hasnt happened yet

great game in single player and online before the hackers became rampant now you cant join an online session without running into one or more that will kill everybody at once then spawn ufos ferris wheels and campfires on you forcing you to switch sessions since they dont go away when you die rockstar appears to be doing nothing about it

game itself it good however someone gave me money and i got an instant ban when i didnt ask them to also the vehicle prices are too much making you have to buy sharkcards that are also over priced due to the new update if you want he luxor jet or golden swift you have to buy money how are you meant to make enough money to be able to get it when the highest paid mission is 30000 how ever the heist give you more but still not enough to be able to afford a simple luxor jet with this game i feel its just a way for rockstar to make as much money as possible out of there customers
not recommended
the story mode is great as you would expect from the series however the online version rarely connects when it does youll find there are cheaters brazenly roaming free eg in supervehicles that fly through walls and fire explostive rounds obligatory bundled cash is worthless it just hikes the price so congratulations rockstar on tanking your review score

if you have played this game on 360 then theirs really no point in buying it again unless your like me and play the game for differant reasons then running around killing people i love cruising around racing exploring playing the game with a differant point of view so if your the kind of perons who would rather go off roading and find a beutifull sunset and admire the breath taking graphics then paying the 70 bucks may just be worth it keep in mind you will need a gtx 980 or even a titan to run this game how it was ment to be played they did a very poor job optimizing this and sli configurations are terrible any card you can get your hand on that has at least 6 gb of vram you will be fine 8 gb vram for 4k so for that ill have to give it a bad review
not recommended
what is the point in writing a review for grand theft auto v who hasnt heard of gta 9510 the servers need worked on and there are no animals in multiplayer dont buy every gun you unlock or youll have a literal arsenal to scroll through during combat instead of 2 or 3 when youre never using any weapon other than the advanced rifle and op pistol it gets annoying fast also dont get any of the mgs until you can get the minigun complete waste play on passive mode or make a private sessionfriendsonly session if youre afraid of pvp the ap pistol is the best weapon in the game and everyone knows the kuruma is op learn to drive a motorcycle learn to love explosives also i put turbo on a scooter

runs really well on my 4 year old laptop rockstar did a good job optimizing the game really worth the wait

online was good for the first month then the online mods came out now its a bunch of children putting on god mode and mass killing in most servers i had the thought that rockstar might actually want to do something about this since they are trying to milk money out of people by selling in game cash i was wrong so very wrong

not recommended
im not sure if i recommend it or not just read pros the game is amaing graphically very well optimized for the pc so even computers that fit minimum requirements can run at least 30 fps and still make the game look good just be sure to read information on each of the settings and how they affect performance gameplay is great great mechanics love the characters online is fun and highly customizable cons not as interesting of a story as gta iv in my opinion rockstar makes some pretty shady moves they increased the price of the game by 30% right before the sale so the price would remain default to combat it they offered free shark cards thats an extremely shady buisness move and i highly doubt that they would stop there online mode is absolutely chocked full of hackers and cheaters who enjoy nothing more than to ruin the game for everyone else rockstar keeps saying they will do something about it but i have yet to see much improvement like a lot of game nowadays there are in game purchases mostly for shark cards which reach pretty high prices especially since the game itself is $60 lot of updates to multiplayers but most are really not worth the effort even with updates the game is still full of bugs with connection errors sudden performance drops and several other in game problems lot of online players are simply not fun to play with whether they cheat or not the game is similar to call of duty where tryhards absolutely infest the game like termites on wood for example youre driving to put an upgrade on your car and suddenly a tank comes in and blows it up you could go into passive mode but then you cannot really do anything other than just sit on the sidelines which is not very fun final comments the game is fun overall which is why i recommend it id still say if youre going to play online stick to playing with friends because online public people will not respect you and let you enjoy the game espeically if you are a new player
recommended
 runs really well with a rig close to the recommended hardware works as advertised  the amount of settings you can fine tune to your liking from gameplay key bindings cameras to graphics is incredible  keyboard and mouse for shooting and a controller for driving all work simultaneously  zero problems with the social club drm rockstar really handled this well compared to the frequent problems of max payne 3 in the past definitely worth the full price if you didnt buy an early accessbeta console version
recommended
almost everything is perfect about this game but when if you can play the game crashes middle of the online play with a err_gfx_d3d_init message for thousands of player there are many tickets opened to rockstar but online is still unplayable for weeks i dont recommend anyone to buy the original copy of this game single player version has no problem note i have gtx 980  i4790k 1 month later edit reverting to pregta5 nvidia driver fixed the problem shame on both nvidia and r

i have played over 700 hours on the playstation 3 and since it is has been graced upon pc community ill get to have another 700 hours of great enjoyment with the new features optimizations and beautiful graphicseffects this has to be the definitive version of grand theft auto v that rockstar was hoping to achieve

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
ill make this plane and simple if youre interested in this game because of its online mode dont bother there has never been a game where you can spend so much time accomplishing nothing the average experience is logging on loading loading loading finding a heist where you can make decent money loading loading loading more loading then you find out the session is full so youre sent back to freemode loading loading loading find another heist and finally get in after loading loading and loading finally start the heist and play for 30mins then someone quits and youre sent back to freemode loading loading loading more loading loading and loading and then you realize its 4am in the morning and you havent accomplished anything if youre debating on getting this or witcher 3 dont waste your time with gta i regret being impatient and not waiting until witcher was released

where do i start this review is more for the gta online side of things  hackers in free mode  hackers in deathmatches  hackers in ing races they blow me up randomly just cause im beating their sorry asses legit  passive mode     loading times i have 16 gb ram a solid state drive and an intel core i7 overclocked to 45 ghz  underpowered aircraft that are shot down by anyone who has an rpg which are cheap  little boys playing with squeaky voices ok so bullets over this game is actually really good in singleplayer im actually really annoyed that they are banning people for using mods in the singleplayer aspect of the game i have not done any modding and as such i am not banned what i really hate about online is the fact that passive mode is like benefits in britain its abused like hell lets say theres this guy who kills you fair enough you drive over to him to get revenge he spots you and runs away your in the middle of gunning him down then pop hes in passive mode then he honks the sad trombone horn just to really rub it in hackers are now a big problem and for now ive completely stopped playing online i knew i hit rock bottom when i was in a pre race lobby with someone who was using a playermodel of a cat not a cat face mask an actual cat the moment we started racing i took the lead then bam he does his hacker magic on me and blows me up im like what the  i respawn only for him to blow me up again and again and again where is the punk buster in this game there is no anti cheat in this game rockstar mustve been like mergh the hackers wont be able to do  in our game cus we incrypted all de files herpy derp but no that wasnt enough you idiots at rockstar most expensive game ever produced in the history of earth mankind and it doesnt have any defence against hackers apart from encrypted game files what a load of  this game is but hey offline is still good offline 9 out of 10 online 1 out of 10

well to be frank i loved every bit of the campaign maybe except for franklins character and his boring assassination missions but to me the disaster that is multiplayer just outweighs all the positives of the game being a multiplayer guy i had my expectations so high for this game just to have them smashe to the ground after a few hours of online gameplay very slow servers dc issues and the worst system for heist set ups someone could ever imagine im sorry rockstar but i expect better from you

one of my favorite games of all time you win rockstar i have purchased this game 3 times
recommended
garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

can play heist with friends or random playersafter a successful heist and celebration you will spawn at random location with your heist teambe sure passive mode is disable cause they will shoot you in the headmy final verdict for this game is 1110surely by now you know how epic this is^_^ psi can be a duck in the game how lovely <3

this game is something more than i could have imagined you can tell rockstar put a lot of care and time into making it a great experience the city feels alive it is visually impressive story mode is great and online mode is also very fun so far i havent found a single thing i do not like about it i was worried my computer would have some trouble running it because i do not have a very powerful rig but it is running beautifully i see many many more hours of game time in my future thanks rockstar this game is a true gem 99100

after playing vice city it was mind blowing to see the change in visuals luckily the story telling is still gta standard multiplayer is also very entertaining for hundreds of hours to come

spent two hours waiting for this be unpacked while sitting on the hype train after spending two years waiting for it to be released launched the game had to make a social club the servers were dying because rockstar could not comphrend the superior power of the master race finally got to get into the actual game pfft game auto set to 800x600 for the console peasants fine spend twenty minutes changing graphics to the optimal master race specs game looks great runs smooth played through the intro nice decided to try to play online again rockstar didnt count the number of slaves from gta v so online was down so whatever game looks nice might as well play the campaign two hours later try to play online again it actually worked but glitchy as the console 100200 cars but only in the color black shoot a car until it explodes car hell steal a viper from some kid sell it go to bed spent the entire launch night wandering around waiting and making mass suicide runs while in skype call with five other master race  riding the hype train all night

played the original back in the day on something that old peeps like me called an intel 486 and it was at the time awesome and rockstar never ever seem to be able to not impress me not a console fanwell not since the mega drive and sonic but do own a ps3 dont enjoy playing on it reallyonly advantage isdont need to leave my bed oh hang on red dead redemption even with zombies although i have been sick of since well sure you can guess as i said i do own a ps3 and yescourse i bought gta v and enjoyed it but the release of the pc version isis is the fecking dogs bollox great job again rockstar unforunatly with everything good there is always a bad side rockstar in their wisdom added a passive mode withing online watch these spongers back turned they will shoot you and rob your cash which brings me to the final downside of gta v onlinethe forums dont look if you want an answer to your problemgoogle it or goto reddit do not ask forum fools hope you guys enjoyed the review and sincerely hope it was helpful and for the prospective buyers out there thinking shall i drop 40 quid on this 1 check youtube and watch other gamers playing online and single player 2 make sure your system will run gta v it is very forgiving you really do not need a great system to run it well 3 if having problemsgoogle is your friend the forums and the fools on there are not on a final note enjoy the game both single and multiplayer find friends and join a crewyou will get soooooooooo much more out of gta v ps if you speak good english mature and have a miccheck out gsns my boys and girls on rockstar social club

cannot play this game in true offline mode yes the game will start if steam is offline but the game still wants the rockstarsocialclub to be online is rockstar going to fix this until they do this is a risky buy at 40 when the person cannot start the game unless there is a internet connection i do 100% recommend the game but i would like an option to play in true offline
recommended
the best game ever 
recommended
this is absurd i owned this game on xbox 360 and loved it and so i decided it would be worth my money to buy it again on pc since then it has been a nightmare every time i try to play the game it crashes as soon as i join a lobby rockstar support is god awful and have done next to nothing to help me im not saying that you should steer clear of this game because of the freezing because i feel this is probably an isolated incident but god forbid you have a problem and have to contact the slow unhelpful rockstar team for support save your money
not recommended
its gta v except on the pc what do you expect its the same game as the consoles just better graphics and pc controls which trust me thats perfectly good enough of a reason to buy the game if you were one of the thousands of people who decked out their pc to make sure this game runs smoothly and beautifully then youll be happy to hear that it wasnt a waste of money the game looks beautiful as ive said before los angles or los santos is a gorgeous city with plenty of places to rob and people to slaughter tons of vehicles to steal and upgrade until a little smart car can withstand bullets plenty of ways to kill yourself or straight up die like head on collisions instantkill now if youre going really fast and if a car falls upside down theres a 50% chance itll explode i wont mention much about the main story except that there is three main characters you can play as individually with their own psychotic personality besides franklin and they love to steal things and yell at each other a lot there is obviously a bond of trust and friendship going on between them so its not just money and rage however like said seen it all before last thing before i wrap this up the online is fantastic if i can find games with people inside or play mission to earn money or gain ranks however being able to have insurance to get back your multimillion dollar car for under $10000 is something that needed to be in the single player but never was i would give this game a 100100 but literally in the single player buy a vehicle and destroy it you never get it back millions of dollars gone 90100 yes im a  anyways good game worth every penny remember this game is nothing new if youve played it on the console i did 360 and ps4 thoroughly then youll like it but may get bored very quickly unless you have friends to play it with
recommended
stunningly beautiful well worth the wait biggest complaint would be the weird air vehicle controls for kb  m noone uses numpad for anything r but easy enough to change yourself to something more comfortable i think this will most likely be my new time sucking game

there may be some bugs here and therebut the fun had while playing it completely outweighs it

as far as story goes gta 4 is far superior however as far as open world gta v definitley wins the story isnt what i hoped the heists were a big letdown the three leaf clover mission in gta 4 was better than any heist in this game imo however what saved this game for me was the modding not online but single player driving around los santos playing as niko bellic with claude speed as my bodyguard awesome expierence

absolutely brilliant game if you own a top end gaming pc you will love this game i ran it on an amd 8150 8 core with a 6990ati video card 8g of ram and it ran like garbage that is a 3 year old gaming tower i built 2 new pcs 9590amd 8 core with an r9 290 16g ram this pc runs gta 5 really good to awesome the second is 5960x 8 core intel 16g ram and a gtx 980 and this system runs gta awesome to perfect the game really wont run that great on older pcs and it does not like old laptops at all my i3 laptop with 1g video card wont even load the game if you have an average pc expect average performance if you think you have an awesome pc and run it and it runs like crap your definition of awesome pc needs updating like your pc probably does  performance aside the game itself is utterly brilliant assuming you can run it like i can without glitches or lag at that level is what i do my review on there are a ton of things to do in gta5 the game is very open sandbox styled  and allows alot of freedom around the map pretty much when ever you like its first person view is the best feature to come to gta since gta began all those years ago first person gives the game a whole new feel and its great but to those who like the 3rd person view its still there too i have clsoked the game 5 times now about o go in for a 6th time  its that enjoyable the stock market is a great feature and allows a player to make alot of money fast if he pays attention to whats happening around him at the time in the game the aircraft feel better than gta4 to fly i believe this is the best gta story yet and you play the game and feel like you are playing 3 different partscharacters to a movie its utterly brilliant you get to love your characters as there all pretty funny and have unique personalities alot of swearing not for kids really overall an insanely fun game to play hmmm over and over again  hope you found this review helpful

now before you jump on me for not recommending this game i just wanna say that i do not recommend buying this game at the moment  the things that makes gta 5 one of the best games in the universe  gta 5 is a flawless sandboxgame where you can go around and do almost whatever you like in an enormous map its like they put you in another life where you can do whatever you like without being punished for it you can just run down the street and punch someone in the face steal someones car steal a chopper steal a jet go on a npc killing spree theres almost no limit of what you can do the online mode is what makes this game so extremely good in my opinion just think of it doing this stuff i mentioned before but with friends when youre playing gta online you get to create your own character and when youve done that youll just have to clear the tutorial and after that youre free to join a server and do whatever you like you can contact your friends and start a job to earn money and xp if you got 4 friends one of them or you can start a little more difficult but wellpayed job called heists the more you level up on gta the more jobs heists vehicles and weapons you unlock some annoying things in gta but doesnt affect the game alot i know that this isnt something that can be helped but the loading in gta can be a real btch and the online might not be so fun without friends the cloud servers are right now a little weird because theyre sometimes preventing you or others from joining online the reason why i dont recommend buying it right now  rockstar had a problem where people who installed mods into gta got permanently banned even if they used the mods offline in the latest patch rockstar tried to fix this issue possibly but the patch only made it worse its not why you couldnt install any mods in gta why i dont recommend this game now its because of cheaters there are alot of cheaters that have overflowed the gta online servers these cheaters are ruining the gta onlineeconomy by spawning tons of money to other players on the server and they are also ruining the fun for alot of players by constantly killing them even if theyre in passive mode passive mode is a mode where you cant be killed by players or not its almost impossible to report them aswell because they can hide themselves or their name and they can use other players name becuase of the cheaters all of the good things i meantioned above about jobs heists and fun gets thrown out the window because why would you wanna play a heist or a job now when you have a funk ton of money you can buy every vehicle in the game when youre at a low level youll feel that you wont gain anything from doing heists and jobs because you already have everything youve wished for the jobs and heists will be completely pointless sure it may feel good at first but that happiness will not last long youll get bored of the game almost right after you bought it and thats why i dont recommend buying this game right now until rockstar has fixed this issue then i highly recommend this game

i have changed my opinion on this game it is now starting to feel like a big scam im hearing through the grape vinewood that automatic bans are in place if you dont buy the loan shark cards for 6000 dont know if this is in force yet at first i thought this was nonsense only a virtual trevor could come up with a plan like this  but today i have been banned for no reason whatsoever rockstar didnt even give me a reason why just a polite no reply gutless email that doesnt make any sense grand theft auto is an amazing game but i would forewarn anyone to remember its all about real money at the end of the day and how much more revenue they can squeeze out of you once your hooked in my opinion buyer beware rockstar why not re label this game grand theft of your real credit card five times over im not really bothered about a refund i had 350 hours on this game but i play games for fun not to be stressed out by  accusations and just ban me on the hoff without a fair trial wheres the fun in that  just because i reached rank 78 and went over your statistical marker you automatically banned well i have autmatically banned you from my world for now which is the real world with real money so stick your ban andreas where the sun dont vine

singleplayer  one of the best storytelling games that a grand theft auto has done with multiple main characters rockstar have managed to tell individual characters stories whilst having the main plot which links them all together  it has a long story mode which is good because it means that there are a lot of gameplay hours to be played however it can be said that a reasonable amount is filler moments this is due to driving from point a to b especially if you dont have a fast car and enemies that keep spawning in only for you to easily shoot them as they basically run into your line of fire  there are so many side activities which can be played such as tennis golf races movies robbing trucks and even investing in a stock market these activities are lots of fun to play and it adds to the overall experience of the game in a positive way  if you take the time to fully explore the world of los santos then it can be found to be very atmospheric  the cover system has been redone and it plays a big part in the combat mechanics of the game which is a nice addition multiplayer  it is great fun to play with friends  the new addition of heists mode is a great way to add to the game and when a heist is completed there is a good level of satisfaction upon completing it  the freeroam is great fun as you can cause a lot of chaos  there is a huge range of customizable options for your character as well as the vehicles that you own overall both the singleplayer and multiplayer experiences are great fun for their own reasons and if you get bored of one you can always flip over to the other as they are both awesome
recommended
not worth the current price good single player but if your buying it for online waste of time especially for first timers unless you have unlimited money and enjoy bowing up peoples cars the constant money grinding is anoying and you only see the best cars so the karuna and zentorno races get boring and the new dlc just adds realy only new cars wich are just crazy overpriced as all those who came from console are crazy loaded would not recomend 510 for story being woth it with interesting character development you know the rest its 2yrs old d

game is well made  however the additional level of authentication rockstar social club rsc is causing issues for paying customers like myself rockstar support has not been able to resolve the licensing issue caused by the rsc network which indicates that the rockstar activation code is already in use the drm feature does not work %100 of the time and until rsc can handle all the real world issues of exploits security vulnerabilities and tolerance to basic denial of service attacks it will cause the game you paid for to be rendered unplayable here are some examples from the rockstar support fb page that would render your game unusable due to the additional level of drm rockstar support we are terribly sorry for the service inconvenience our system is having serious problems problems will be resolved soon rockstar support feeling sorry we are currently sorry for you users that are new to the community a ddos group has been recently attacking our servers rockstar support please keep calm we are going to fix the problem going around this page is being monitored every few days rockstar support dear gta v fansplayers sorry for the inconvenience for online problems with modders sign in problems all of that will be fixed soon rockstar support feeling concerned we have been having problems with grand theft auto online sorry for the inconvenience

i was just reading some of the reviews for the game front page reviews were all negative just because rockstar avoided reducing the price during summer sale by throwing in multiplayer money they need to review the game for what it actually is not because of what could be considered a bad buisness practice most $60 dont even go on sale anyways so dont blame rockstar for taking the same road and trying to throw in extra ingame money the game itself is great i dont want to go into an indepth review but i would suggest watching the angry joe review or a credible reviewer give their take not some random plebs who dont even talk about how the game actually playes

this game is awesome with friends

first off good job r for an amazing port it was great to hear that they were endorsing modding on singleplayer it makes the game really fun and i think that it is fun to see all of these mods that are building up like gta iv if you do mod online it just does not make it fun do it the right way i had a level 150 character and i created a new one for pc just to for fun to keep my console and pc seprate i had a lot of trouble leveling up because of hackers of course they were reported but it is just not that fun now i go in a private session to play online so i dont run into annoying hackers that just want to annoy you gameplay as always r does a great job but this is the best i have seen in years my hours can tell it all that the game is great i dont know how r did it but they made it so realistic that just wow i cant even explain when you go under a tunnel youre gps stops working cops are much much harder to get away from which is very fun you have to hide and avoid the police helicopers in iv you just had to escape the circle now they put a full apb on you for wherever you go it is just great online when i first heard about online i was thinking what are they doing now but it turned out to be great and fun for everyone team up with your friends and complete heists such as the flecca heist or the humanne labs heist it is really fun to team up with friends or random people to win lots of spolies such as money rp jp etc overall gta 5 is a must have if you dont already go buy it trust me it is worth the money overall rating 9510 has a few graphics bugs which i think will be fixed in the future
recommended
it is so addicting and fun that i cant let go of good storyawesome graphic especially in pc d  it look and sound amazing not to forget the online of course if you have a pc that can run this masterpiece just go for it you wont be disappointed

gtav has all of the makings for a great game with unlimited gaming value there are only a few things that hold it back but these small drawbacks are hardly noticable among all of the great features of this title we expect greatness from rockstar and they delivered greatness the sign of a great game is when you are immersed in a world with little concept of time and gtav is built to suck you in with no mercy great story great online experience once some small issues are resolved and great mechanics make this a mustown game
recommended
this game is awesome the port is very impressive unlike the previous game gtaiv it is a very optimized game dont doubt me on that and the graphics look amazing there are some minor flaws to this game such as the looooooong loading screens but besides that it is an awesome game that you should pick up

i was just reading some of the reviews for the game front page reviews were all negative just because rockstar avoided reducing the price during summer sale by throwing in multiplayer money they need to review the game for what it actually is not because of what could be considered a bad buisness practice most $60 dont even go on sale anyways so dont blame rockstar for taking the same road and trying to throw in extra ingame money the game itself is great i dont want to go into an indepth review but i would suggest watching the angry joe review or a credible reviewer give their take not some random plebs who dont even talk about how the game actually playes

pros multiplayer customisation car customs fun to kill afew hours first person is better than the mods for it in other gta games cons full of hackers full of morons boring story with uninteresting protoganists no fov slider of first person most normal cars lack any interesting customs only sports cars have anything good guns are all the same with each one being better than the last no more ak for damage and m4 for accuracy like in gta 4 online is a grind fest rpg no more weapon pickups and random gta 4 fun multiplayer just bad sport bouses for destroying cars and killing people not the greatist port ever but better than gta 4 though this still needs optimisation online is unstable no mod support micro transactions everywhere over all its a 610 not master race worthy but good enough for a few days of fun i will recomend it as its a gta game even though its not the greatist one edit i played this for a few hundered hours on console as well before pc

the world in gta5 is masterfully realised and all the vehicles are a pleasure to drive fly or dive with the shooting mechanics are a big improvement as are the graphics the problem is that this world has nothing to offer other than shooting and driving no interaction with npcs no decisions for you to decide the story is on rails no real estate to acquire nothing of that sort it is all cars and weapons drive shoot drive shoot loading screen mission drive shoot for all the size and scope this game delivers it lacks soul and character for those who are interested in mp they should know that it is a mess you will spend more time with loading and lobby screens than in the game overall i cannot recommend this game for the current price yet it is a fascinating product even if it lacks depth and character

needs some more patching but overall still great but make sure you have the pc for it

singleplayer is good as always hours of fun the multiplayer on the otherhand is full if hackers and not worth your time rockstar needs to get their  together and fix their game

ever wonder why the online is so bad slow and buggy httpsuplioiv5c7llpng 5 people at rockstar work on it 5 people there is why the online is so buggy the anticheat system is an email adress that they check every 2 weeks they do ban waves on gta online monthly i think and you think steam support is bad take the chances of steam responding and half the chances of it there you go thats rockstar support and if you can get online working the first 2 weeks of a month are the only times without cheaters because they get 2 week bans and every low level has the best guns in the game because they were in updates and they got it with preorder money so being a high level is useless oh and the game runs on p2p meaning if one persons game says something it will say it for each person in the game too which is how the cheaters can remove your guns vehicles and so on and they can even remove the reports that are sent to rockstar which causes them to be unbannable

i shot a man and i meant for him to die he died fair and good yup yup gta v is a game where people spout memes and fggot out of their microphones in the online mode while modders drop millions of gta dollars because they can also theyll blow you up but you know graphics made me even more euphoric however it couldnt effect me that much as i shine and polish my golden fedora everyday im just joking of course i clean my fedora however only silly alphas have golden fedoras story mode is good you play as a black fellow a senile white man with a midlife crisis and an insane redneck canadian who loves eating people and  named trevor the three do things and steal stuff while murdering things and killing other stuff theres also a gamemode called shaming your parents which is located at the stripclub basically you play by unzipping your pants and doing the unfathomable until your mother walks in and bans your 11 year old self from the computer for 2 weeks the one who lasts the longest without their parents coming in and ruining their game wins but nah good game

gta v a fun game te play i preordered the game so i also received a nice amount of starter cash12mill that was great i could buy the best appartment already and at level 12 i started heisting already after now 180  it starts to get boring doing all the hard challenges with a premade party so we dont have a 12 yo fck up pretty fun after all now i play and just have so fun fcking around blowing up other people cars yeah 10k of a car why so after an hour you run out of cash and repeat yourself start heisting again since youve already done the last heist with a good paycheck you just get your team kick them in the butt and order them to play with you well you made yourselfs another 120k  nice stand equal to 30 min of total madness a chaos in gta v online well pretty fun online is fun until youve done everything singleplayer best storyline ive ever seen realy fun to play very exciting to play the story runs very smooth after a while you find yourself at the end and have to make the final decision cool kill a fcker thats pretty much it

great game packed with enough content to keep players occupied for many hours with amazing gameplay and graphics rockstar did up the price of the game right before the sale witch for a good reason has made many people angry over all it is a great game i highly recomend it on the consoles but currently online is a mess with way to many hackers so i would wait to buy the game until rockstar stops the hacker problem

very good story line but online is terrible a lot of hackers heists take forever because for some reason people start the exact same heist as you when you already have it even if you do manage to start a heist 90% of the time a noob will screw it over for you also the reason why you must do heists is because that is your main source of income or you wont really be able to buy a house cars etc but if you dont care about that it wont be a problem buy if the reason is to play with friends have fun in offline mode and dont care about buying nice stuff dont buy if you want to get access to a lot of stuff if youre not willing to spend at least 200 hours of your time grinding for it  whilst tolerating the noobs the hackers and waiting a lot

hackfest this game is so filled with cheaters i was unable to play in a public lobby for more than ten minutes without someone making it rain airplanes locking my toon in an airplane or giving me ludicrous amounts of money if you only want to experience the story mode then by all means get it if you are more interested in the online free roam like myself save your money

would not reccomend this game to a single person in existance no matter how rich and no matter how rich they may be save your money this game is pathetic between horrible spawns in pvp where you can constantly be spawn camped and how  each and every guns damage is this game is horrible no matter the calliber of the gun it will do the same damage every other gun dows excluding the explosives this game is terrible dont bother with it save your money the only worth of this game is the campaign and even after you accomplish that it is useless it is all around crap

grand theft auto v is one of my favorite games to play on steam it has so much to offer to every type of player the story involves three controllable protagonists michael a retired thief that needs to adapt to parenthood franklin a street hustler trying to find work in the city and trevor a washedup drug dealer who is practically insane the dynamics of these three characters makes it an extremely interesting story and one with three endings which i wont spoil for you the gameplay is your basic openworld sandbox game except for one thing it has the most amazing depiction of a real city i have ever seen i found myself practically driving around los santos for hours on end just to find and discover more things aside from that you can rob banks shoot civilians buy apartments and garages steal cars purchase new guns and armor for your character and so much more you will not run out of things to do while playing this game gta online is the biggest reason to buy this game and exactly why i got it on two different consoles in gta online you create your own character and arrive in los santos along with more than 20 other players while you run around los santos doing jobs racing others in boats or planes or just having a good time with friends this is the one mode that i play the most to sum everything up if you have the money buy the game if your friends have the game it is extremely fun to just mess around in the gigantic city do yourself a favor and give this game a try you wont regret it

i complited it on xbox 360 in 2013 just a few days after release after that i sold my xbox and was sure i wont get back to it only because of gta online and it was so until i saw my friends played heists on pc and ofcourse bought it next day thats the last thing i remember from real life   ps i still didnt play even one mission in single after intro cause complited on xbox 2 ears ago but online is so fun and addictive the only 2 cones are 1 match making if u dont have like 1000 friends in social club or just 3 that will alweas alweas play with u same time  its hard to fined good team for heists cause game will try to fined u team only from your room and friends and crew and skillsame  wich is usless and in room usually only 520 ppl and most of them low lvls or cheaters so random matchmaking is hell 2 and here the seconed cone  cheaters they everywhere u will see ppl with 999 lvl with 5000 lvl teleporting killing you with flame from above getting random stuff in your garage or just blow up hole map in one sec yes they banning lots of them but not much so be sure that u will get in rooms with cheaters like 9 times from 10 maybe someone will be afraid to play after read about those cones but i will tell u that i really get like 90% rooms with cheaters and i really love heists its even better than in payday 2 which is strange cause payday is all about heists and gta online  not i only want rockstars to add more but cant do them 90% of time cause not all my friends play same time as i do and random pick is horrible but did it stop me from playing not even on sec   in this game u have so much to do and so much to see and even when u bored after 24 hours of nonstop gaming from missions heasts races deathmatches golf armrestling and so on u cant exit game cause rain starts with thunder and u getting in car turn on your favourite radio station and just ride in the city

pros  gta v its everything that is grand theft auto it has evolved into a more serious beefy mass that it is now  graphics  vehicles weapons car mods clothing items customization bicycles are back  singeplayer story and characters  first person shooting and driving  map diversity  switching between characters  mini games  driving has a better feel both on and offroad even if just a bit  business owning  theres a wide selection of radio stationsmusic from the time it took place  custom music folder  you can swim underwater and explore just about anything you want  gta online and synching is better easier to play with friendsothers without so much difficulty  own your own houseapartmentgaragegearbikescarsetc online  even more customizations for the above that exist only in the online mode  free dlc  updates  random events across the open world witnessed a care pile up on the freeway police chases and shootouts robberies fights  gta online still a  fest if you dont have a friend or group to play with online in a friends only session you will probably enjoy singleplayer better  online missionsheists poor sports hosts and personalities make finishing anything very difficult  cheaters  spawn killersstalkers  rambos  the amount of  talking in every language imagineable and by every age imagineable some of the worst life forms exist in this game online however ive seen worse  cops are still a bit opcheaty at times and other times ridiculously dumb  needs more places to go inside of no more cluckin bell robbing sprees  car handling still could be better mainly the collisions and weird orbiting that some cars do kind of ruins the immersion  stock market its useful to get huge amounts of cash in singeplayer mode online it is pretty useless since the datagraphs shown are not accurate and do not work properly as is in singleplayer too  matchmaking still blows donky balls  online personal radars the fact that people can see you on the radar without visually seeing you is pretty lame  lack of joystick support game only supports xbox controller and similar gamepads must go through a few hoops to get a joystick working currently using logitech extreme 3d pro after having to run a program to trick the game into thinking its an xbox controller come on guys for the pc xbox controller support only really nahhh  cant create custom character that can exist in singleplayer you can use your custom online character and play offline mode but you cant do or go to places you could in singleplayer you also cant set your default online mode to friends only session private session or offline mode singleplayer is where the fun is at unless you have a friend or two to jump into a friends onlyprivate session of your own and experience id say online wouldnt be so bad if it werent for cheating in every session and if not cheating the horrible personalities that you come across in heists that make it near to impossible to play with all of the cons and poor online play i still recommend this game fully why because it is still incredibly fun however not online unless youre with some friends

exceptionally well made pc game some of the best customizability great visuals and audio best score so far and although opinions on the radio stations may vary they are appropriate for the setting as usual single player the best gta so far one of the best action and sandbox games online coop is alright and the heists are pretty good fun and with nice challenges but dont get this game for public pvp or freeroam that part was awesome the gunplay unique and fun while it was without extremely blatant cheating everywhere really unplayable simply isnt an understatement now its so bad that entire lobbies simply get repeatedly nuked regularly and it seems it can be done on behalf of another players character and gamertag youre lucky if you get to play an hour on a populated lobby without seeing this particular trick not to mention others the public pvp and freeroam are quite likely irreparable too due to how the networking is done im not sure how much better it is on consoles but i hear its a huge problem there as well this really is the most hacked online game ever it really makes you look back and wonder at how good any other online games you played have or had it really hope to see some better networking solutions in future r titles the game is still the best in many aspects for its single player and coop and not all great sandbox games even have multiplayer at all so while the public online is a huge shame and loss the game itself is still as awesome as they come and great worth for the money
recommended
im sorry to say this but it is a real shame how this all went down at first i was in awe at the game for the quality which is still really good visually and most of the ui but there is a ton of bad 1st lost internet due to storm and was as most gamers are with no internet bored so i loded up gta for the single player wrong internet connection required  you any singleplayer campeign that requires a active internet connection deserves a beating so theres that the multiplayer was cool until i flat out lost interest in doing anything whats the point even battle fail 4 had a objective take  from the other team and then there are the modders scum everywhere god forbid rockstar give punkbuster a call and wtf happened with that steam sale i regret spending the money on this

i really love this game especially on the pc i also played it on the ps3 and i must say the experience on a computer is way different and thats in a positive way graphics can be stunning if you have a computer capable of throwing up the settings to a high enough point i really recommend this game in general and for the platform i have also tried the ps4 and xbox one so i have a decent ground for saying that the platform you should choose is the pc atleast in my opinion hope this helps someone out there

runs great very well optimized now of course with updated drivers on 7850k now to to the gameplay its honestly the same than on console but now including the major texture increase and the ability to play in 4k but where i noticed the biggest increase in from specificly ps3 and ps4 is load times i mean waaaaaaaaaaayyyyy faster keep in mind only running of a 7200 rpm drive but i mean the servers for pc are a least in the loading respect they are much better for those experiencing crashing google gta 5 crash fix batch files and you should be able to remedy if not fix the issue at least until rockstar gets its act together all in all good game

its the game that finally came out what can i say its the latest and greatest gta game graphics the graphics on this game absolutely blows away gta iv i remember when gta iv was looked at as beautiful but gta v sometimes looks photorealistic even though i dont have a killer gaming rig i can only imagine what this game looks like maxed out even with my gtx 660 with the 2gb of vram being a bit limiting for a game like this the game runs smooth as silk while the shadows water and grass oh my gosh the grass youd have to see it to understand how good it looks all look super realisitc story i liked the story quite a bit the characters are all as unique as in the other gta games and having three main characters allows more room for interesting conversations the fbi stuff is a bit weird at times but everything else is solid and i never felt like i didnt want to watch a cutscene gameplay much improved over gta iv the shooting is taken from max payne 3 and the driving from a racing game no more clunky shooting or tedious driving the flying controls are a weird one it took me a minute to adapt to wasdnumpad but i felt like i had great control once i did i had friends that absolutely couldnt get over the fact that there werent good keyboardmouse controls besides the flying everything felt natural and great online gta online the place where most of your hours go there is so much to do unlike gta iv deathmatch several different types of racing the absolutely insane adversary modes truckers vs bikers quad bikes vs heavily armed guys on foot pvp wavebased survival heists and free roam free roam is gta as it was meant to be traverse the entire map in a 32 person online server spend your earned money on super cars or military vehicles and do whatever crazy stuff you want to do its insane the online performance has seemed to improve drastically but desync and general lag do occasionally occur in short if you liked other gta games and meet the min requirements for the game you should get it its crazy its pretty and its fun

lets get down to the nitty gritty of this game the pros great story mode great combat amazing graphics runs very well on graphics cards you wouldnt expect it to run on i have 750gtx would of thought it to be laggier but its very fast online mode is fun cons once you make a social club account you cant use it on another steam account its linked forever and rockstar effing support are the worst at getting back to you i have been banned from online when someone spawned money in my lobby on top of me the hell was i supposed to do read their ts & cs i shouldnt be banned but hey rockstar what do you care the worst customer service i have ever experienced noone replies to the forums too many hackers on online pc once your account is restricted you cant even play story mode waste of 40 rockstar sort this out you made a great game and  on it with the social club update\\\ rockstar have now locked me out of my account fully i cant access it they wont help i have literally lost 40 the social club is so so so bad i cant do anything and the fact yuo cant unlock your steam account from social club so your not allowed a new account is complete and utter  once you sign in with that account dont ever hack because if your locked out you cant play the story mode online mode you cant do anything rockstar you are the worst game company and i will never be buying anything from you ever again update 2\\\ rockstar have permanently banned me even from using the story mode i am going to take rockstar to court for this

edit no dont get this on pc until the hacker problems are fixed this is the 3rd time i have purchased this game and i can honestly say this is the best and worst version of the game best because its on pc it runs better it has more features its prettier etc but the ing hackers are so abundant it makes playing the game an absolute ing nightmare i know i sound mad right now but that is because i am for more than 2 weeks now i have tried to play a game of gta online without someone spreading their internet cheeks and  all over my experience but unfortunately i dont think theres such a thing i was in a 6 person lobby today 6 and there was still a hacker problem seriously i cant recommend this to anyone that actually wants to have a good gta online experience but if youre in it for the campaign and nothing but the campaign go nuts edit framerate and hackers all fixed now its okay my children its okay

overall one of my best buys on steam to date  however there are some issues with the game  1gta v requires you to be online everytime you load it up  yes it does suck at times but you can start to understand why after the end of all the single player missions because the game compares your score to all of your friends 2keyboard and mouse are just annoying to use becuase the game has been predominantly is made for controllers such as the classic xbox 360 controller 3gta v online banning system imagine you pay to play this games online feature and you get wrongly accused of hacking and then you get randomly banned  the anti hackcheat system on gta v on the pc behaves as though this game is like counter strike global offensive because it takes things too seriously and you can be banned for almost no reason at all  4modding community  although gta v pc has a huge modding community for pc  it is very hard to know which website is safe and which isnt so viruses and other malicious things can attack you rockstar are a huge company and it doesnt take a donkey to know how much we all loved modding gta iv so why hasnt rockstar implemented the mods to the steam workshop  large triple a games such as skyrim have made millons and gained millions of fans because of  comon rockstar help the fans out will ya  i am not trying to hate this game but if you are like me and bought this game for fun  well it is fun rockstar brought us a good well made game but these are just some issues with the game that grind my gears and i do recommend you buy it  but dont be an ashle on gta online

the game itself is great i like the sense of choice in the game and risk to gain awesome things this is a great game if you are a enthusiastic person if you like to express yourself or roleplay this is also a game for you however the modding community on this game is very hated by the makers of the game in single player mode story you are able to mod the game on online mode you are now allowed to mod in any way possible or else a ban that is bad for many players and modders 793 out of 1000 stars

before recent patches the game was great online play you had to deal with rampant hackers but that was alright i just played with friends now it seems that every patch rockstar releases makes the game more unplayable and laggy with stutters from just riding around fix this game rockstar

storyline was great i loved playing through it just like i did on console however online is a joke its pretty much gta 4 all over again was just in my garage moving my cars around and a modder blows up all the players including myself i attempted to report the modder which caused my pc to freeze which has never happened with any other game guess gta 5 is dead to me now until online mods are patched 1010 if youre buying this game for strictly storymode and singleplayer mods 010 if youre buying it strictly for online do not buy unless youre planing on playing in private sessions with friends 810 if youre buying for both online and storymode

singleplayer good plot sick missions with a lot of action multiplayer monotonous missions feels like farming in f2pgames not my type even with mates its somehow boring stupid people who love to kill each other i can totally recommend this game for the singeplayers sake but wait for a great deal i would spend 20 max

the game is impressive has many new things better textures better video effects it is a big improvement compared to the first version of the game on xbox 360 and playstation 3 besides having improved stability in comparison frames to its previous game grand theft auto 4 the only bad thing about it is that takes forever to load when you are in gta online

is the game fun yes is it worth buying for the pc well ever since rockstars last update of ill gotten gains 2 the game has been crashingfps dropping stuttering many other players have been reporting this problem too i do have a slow pc yes but i was running a good stable 3845 fps before their latest update then i dropped down to 3335 fps ok for me out of no where while driving i accidentally hit a trash can and boom 1113 fps i havent recovered since its been two days and it wont break loose of 1113 fps my graphics are at lowest and ive tried everything even if you have a high end computer the game will still lagstutter and crash for you for no apparent reason bottomline unless you want a game that fps drops alot dont buy gta v for the pc stick to the consoles at least they wont lag and stutter

warning unpopular opinion alert this is game does not live up to its hype there are a lot of things to do that are all very boring its just a small step up from gta iv with better graphics you will love this game if you can drive cars around for hours without getting bored the matchmaking is kinda  due to how its intergrated into the open world multiplayer its kind of a pay to play game you need money to make money however the one step up from gta iv that i absolutly love is the heists the amount of detail that goes into them really makes them fun despite losing the heist if one person failsdies overall this game is in the top 80% of games however it does not exceed its hype and is not worth the full price

this game is great if youre getting it for the single player portion the main story and side jobs  quests and activities you can do in this game is great what isnt so great is the multiplayer its a love hate relationship the loading times to get on to a game server to your first game can take anywhere between 5 minutes to 30 minutes and another 5 to 30 minutes to load another heist  job so a huge chunk of the online experience is spent waiting to get connected and waiting for the community to join any activity  heist the comunity online has not been great too theres just wayyy too many hackers and rude players to make the game enjoyable on multiplayer for me that said the heists and some of the jobs  races are actually quite fun when you manage to find a really good team of players to play with

really really fun game but its kinda sad that it worked perfectaly on day 1 and then they came out with some bs patch or update or something that caused everyone to get like 20 fps lower than usual also stay away from online unless you are going on to do heists with friends

this game abosolutely amazing at creating content for videosmisc fun moments with friends the game itself has everything you would expect from a gta game and more i love the game and everything about it i wont play it consistnatly but i will roughly 35 times a month get on for a few hours and   up or just drive around vehicle customization is amazing but the game is lacking apartment customization which is a bit lack luster the biggest and most obvious flaw is the terrible absolutely garbage load times and once it loads for 2 minutes it tells you the lobby is full only to teleport you somewhere randomly 2 minutes later sometimes on a different server

grand theft auto is brilliant it is a very enjoyable game and has a lot to offer it has a long indepth campaign mode and an even longer and insane multiplayer mode i myself have put 40 plus hours and counting in this game do not let the talk of being banned for single player mods deter you from experiencing this game here is a link to a page were rockstar officially states that they will not be banning anyone for single player mods rockstar statement so now that we killed that elephant why not buy it httpsconfuciuslouiswordpresscom20150511grandtheftautovreview

rockstars ingame stance on the huge ever growing hacker population that is in gtav online and the state that the game is in right where if you was getting 60 plus fps before now you are lucky to get 25 fps even in single player rockstar refusal to roll back the game so most of the people who brought the game can play it is just sickening my ending statement is buy this game at your own risk it is highly unstable at best and keep getting worst as more patches are added
not recommended
supposedly the latest update and patch messed the game up who knows for sure i was getting performance issues normally in the game then i switched to dx10 mode and it ran smooth mostly at 60fps max settings now i just tried playing the game recently and it jumps jerks and stutters badly especially while firing a weapon into a person or car the game went from playable to basically unplayable or at least unenjoyable and a lot of ppl are supposedly having the same problems when watch dogs runs far better than gta5 you know hell has frozen over if rockstar ever fixes it i will change my review back until then i will gladly play watch dogs at 60fps smoothly

been waiting for this to come out for pc for ages and i can safely say it was worth the wait the singleplayer is brilliant in depth story pulling you in more the planning for certain missions play it how you want to the array for cars weapons and personal customization is just fantastic and its carried over into the online aspect of the game its the best gta game ive played since san andreas gta 4 was fun but it seemed dull and boring at times this game is a breath of fresh air to the franchise and i hope theyll continue along this path with future gta games oh and the implementation of a fps camera mode for both singleplayer and online is just epic its pretty much feels like youre playing a whole new game from that aspect and i applaude rockstar for it this game gets a 1010 from me id strongly suggest this game to anyone with a taste for exploration and all out carnage at the same time

online hackers completely ruin the online experience and almost make it unbarable i would say that in every online session there is at the least one hacker typical hackers will spawn money on people taking away the point of earning your items other times they will just interfere with you trying to play the game ie they will teleport you or clip through walls in passive mode and kill you eventually they get bored and leave and if you can deal with that then enjoy story mode highly worthwhile to play and the attention to detail in the game is fantastic however once you beat the game you are looking forward to the online play and it was amazing fun until the glamour of it was ruined by hackers 60 dollars is actually a worthy asking price just for the single player alone if rockstar can figure out how to get rid of the hacker problem id say that this game would be almost perfect in every way shape and form

gta v oh my the game pc gamers craved for so long has it live up to the hype gta v has some absolutely amazing optimization i have never suffered any moderate or major fps drops even when using mods the gunplay is much better with a keyboard and mouse in my opinion of course it makes aiming easier and faster then there is online online is much better on pc as people have less connectivity issues in terms of players lagging around and getting ghost punched the real major issue was connecting to heists i am sure i was not the only one to expierience this i could rarely if ever get into a game sometimes not even a heist mission just online in general it was a real annoyance and i believe they have improved it by a alot one last thing i didnt like about online was\is the amount of loading screens before and after joining a lobby or a game mode you would wait to get in the lobby wait for the game to start wait for the game to end then wait for the next game mode to start far to much waiting my overall verdict is great game needs better servers

after multiple delays of release we finaly got to play gta v all the waiting was totaly worth it you can play hours and hours of story mode with cutscenes and multiple characters when you get bored of playing on your own you can just push alt and go right into gta onine where they drop you in a server with your friends yeah there are way too many and too long loading screens but its worth it because the minimum requirements are so low i can even play it on my laptop from 2008 once youve joined online you get to make your own character and play or dont play the gta online tutorial the first thing i did was buying a highend home with the bonus cash i got from preordering and on level 12 i think starting the first heist out of 5 it takes a damn lot of time to populate heist lobbies so i brought my friends but once you are done with the heists missions races deathmatches capture missions ect that rockstar made you just log in into the social club and download more custom races deathmatches and a lot of other stuff that players created after all of that you can start buying and customizing vehicles with all the money you earned and use them to race or to fck other people up and just when you think youve got every single car and chopper and plane and boat in the game rockstar comes to the rescue with a lot of free dlc content most online sessions have hackers in them so be sure to set up a private session if you get annoyed rockstars security doesnt really keep hackers out but in the end this game is worth every eurodollar you spend on it hours and hours of single and multiplayer fun are waiting for you will you buy the game and join a crew

i dont care about the price raise for the sales the question is is the game worth full price the answer is no not at this state the game is amazing to play the story the world and everything in it is a blast when it doesnt crash online is ruined by hackers crashes happen even more frequently in mp than sp rockstar not doing anything to fix or adress the issues nor the players affected by it when they are done screwing over pc users ill recommend this game without a doubt

well the game itself is pretty decent its got a lot to do in it and keeps you hooked however the story is utter crap all three characters michael franklin and trevor have no personality what so ever i mean you know nothing about franklin and hes arguably the main character michael has a little background and trevor has the most not to mention its been getting major lag problems even when im on high fps and a strong internet connection the game is delayed when i turn my car its delayed by a few seconds and sometimes my car and character continue to go forward despite me not holding a key down in short too little time went into the story and lag issues for a game that brought in 2 billion on the first day what a let down online is tedious for me and the story is horrible i could sum the story up in a sentence three guys who rob banks i mean yeah michael has some family problems but they took over too much of the games time ones that dont relate to the story and are involving michaels family should stay as strangers and freaks missions franklin does nothing but shoot and gangbang we learn  all about his exgirl like i said the most developed character is trevor in the small funny cutscenes we get when we switch the trevor reveals more about his character than michael and franklin do in the whole game ending statement  too many developers getting paid big money too little effort

lets get down to the nitty gritty of this game the pros great story mode great combat amazing graphics runs very well on graphics cards you wouldnt expect it to run on i have 750gtx would of thought it to be laggier but its very fast online mode is fun cons once you make a social club account you cant use it on another steam account its linked forever and rockstar effing support are the worst at getting back to you i have been banned from online when someone spawned money in my lobby on top of me the hell was i supposed to do read their ts & cs i shouldnt be banned but hey rockstar what do you care the worst customer service i have ever experienced noone replies to the forums too many hackers on online pc once your account is restricted you cant even play story mode waste of 40 rockstar sort this out you made a great game and  on it with the social club update\\\ rockstar have now locked me out of my account fully i cant access it they wont help i have literally lost 40 the social club is so so so bad i cant do anything and the fact yuo cant unlock your steam account from social club so your not allowed a new account is complete and utter  once you sign in with that account dont ever hack because if your locked out you cant play the story mode online mode you cant do anything rockstar you are the worst game company and i will never be buying anything from you ever again update 2\\\ rockstar have permanently banned me even from using the story mode i am going to take rockstar to court for this

really really fun game but its kinda sad that it worked perfectaly on day 1 and then they came out with some bs patch or update or something that caused everyone to get like 20 fps lower than usual also stay away from online unless you are going on to do heists with friends
recommended
this game abosolutely amazing at creating content for videosmisc fun moments with friends the game itself has everything you would expect from a gta game and more i love the game and everything about it i wont play it consistnatly but i will roughly 35 times a month get on for a few hours and   up or just drive around vehicle customization is amazing but the game is lacking apartment customization which is a bit lack luster the biggest and most obvious flaw is the terrible absolutely garbage load times and once it loads for 2 minutes it tells you the lobby is full only to teleport you somewhere randomly 2 minutes later sometimes on a different server

i know my hours arent amazing however gta 5 has been a decent game to me so far i know people have had problems with hackers but i only have gotten with one in the many lobbies i joined however whenever me and my friend try to play we always get terrible lag spikes and constantly freeze muliple times over i would also like to point out that the lobbies enjoy lagging me out and crashing my game the singleplayer is great the multiplayer is maybe a 610 overall rating 710 ps online isnt the greatest unless you have a friend playing with you

its a cool game a lot of people report hackers but i never see one and i hope i dont encounter one tho p graphics are amazing pcmasterrace i have a good gaming laptop with nvidia geforce gtx 960m and core i7 so i put most things at high and very high and no lag a guy invited everyone to a deathmatch with knives only but he put in a tank and killed everyone for cash so i hid climbed up threw him out and stabbed him 1110 would stab again

good game satisfied with the ported game quite optimized on intel pentium g3258 processor eventhough some people said the processor bottleneck the gpu can play around 60fps in certain places or mostly placeexcept driving driving cause fps drop and stuttering texture render lags certain mission did crash the game other than that everything was fine online is quite good having fun with the element inside it havent play online too much because of the internet connection but it looks great 9510 05 for issue in the game p

ive had tons of fun playing this game its really amazing only downside is that ive been experiencing a drop in performance ever since i updated it to the 128 version i really hope rockstars going to fix it cause i can hardly play gta online now

single player was really great and worth the money its a open playground for mayham fun gameplay and a lot of great moments in the story a improvement over gta iv mutiplayer is not so much due to rockstar poorly handling the issue of hackers and really long load times for online personally i dont like how they structured the mutiplayer and felt it should have been more open to the community but thats just me there are people working on a mod called fivem and it will have a more open mutiplayer expereince as of now that mod is still being developed
recommended
gta v is definitely a title to write home about both in terms of singleplayer and multiplayer as for the community you will find alot alotalot of hackers around 2 perlobby most of them just kill everyone repeatedly while others drop money for you etc its a great game but the anticheat system is literally nonexistant if you like openworld titles with very immersive worlds this game is for you with the exception of a large community of hackers around 33% of the community consistently uses hacks all in all gta v is a great title
recommended
most waited game of the year really well done rockstar this game simply rocks if youre looking for explosions races crimes action and more importantly fun
recommended
rockstars ingame stance on the huge ever growing hacker population that is in gtav online and the state that the game is in right where if you was getting 60 plus fps before now you are lucky to get 25 fps even in single player rockstar refusal to roll back the game so most of the people who brought the game can play it is just sickening my ending statement is buy this game at your own risk it is highly unstable at best and keep getting worst as more patches are added
not recommended
supposedly the latest update and patch messed the game up who knows for sure i was getting performance issues normally in the game then i switched to dx10 mode and it ran smooth mostly at 60fps max settings now i just tried playing the game recently and it jumps jerks and stutters badly especially while firing a weapon into a person or car the game went from playable to basically unplayable or at least unenjoyable and a lot of ppl are supposedly having the same problems when watch dogs runs far better than gta5 you know hell has frozen over if rockstar ever fixes it i will change my review back until then i will gladly play watch dogs at 60fps smoothly

final edit you will not get banned for using mods in sp only mp they do not turn off automatically that is true but still a fov mod is a tad bit of bull  i explained to rockstar what mod it was and it effects the rockstar community or some bull like that but now that theyve started sorting all of this out i will make my review positive gta v is one of the greatest current generation games and now that it is on pc we can laugh at those disgusting peasants who use consoles

grand theft auto v is a great game with a plot thatll get you hooked up graphics thatll blow your mind gameplay thatll make every other openworld game boring any fan of rockstar games gta openworld games should buy this its the best game for the rest of your life till the next gta comes anyway d bye gonna go get lost in my second lfe in the movies if v is for vandetta then in videogames v is for touching strippers killing innocent citizens swearing at every pedestrian in the city taking selfies every 10 seconds killing the cops

this game was amazing in all aspects on the xbox one but on the pc not so much i do love the 60 frames per second but this game has caused me a lot of headaches the first problem is that the game will not run smoothly for more than two minutes without experiencing massive frame drops i could live with just the frame drops but the game does not want to run on high graphics settings even though i have a relatively powerful pc i could live with that but the thing that ticks me off the most is that there are soooo many modders every single lobby i join seemes to have one or two people that randomly blow me up it seems that nothing is being done about this even though the pc version has been released for quite a while these hackers abuse and annoy players like me trying to enjoy this masterpiece and sometimes even crash normal players games until this is fixed im not recommending the pc version of this game to any of my friends edit now ive been having severe problems with crashing and framerate drops my vram is more than enough to handle the game but even at the lowest graphics it still crashes in a seemingly random pattern

awesome game im finally qualified to review it because i have racked in at least a few hours by far the greatest graphics in a game i have ever seen in terms of realism you have to love borderlands graphics though even if they arent realistic pretty funny game awesome campaign awesome characters wonderful however i completely agree with the top negative reviews about raising the price it is a completely  and  move to raise the price of your game and then add some worthless item to make it seem like you are not just doing it because you have to put it on sale but are cheap s at least watchdogs put its game on a pretty high sale especially considering that every game dev at rockstar is set for life because it has already sold 33 million copies worth $60 each but enough with my rant i loved and still do love playing this game besides the cash card this game isnt pay to win and the stereotype about adults on gta being all pissy about little kids is mainly in console although it still is fairly abundant within pc community online is super fun though even with the s rockstar really does need to deal with hackers though they are popping up everywhere and they arent the cool hackers who give people like my friend $4 mil they have to be the ones who i meet who ride on motorcycles and run you over until you die because you cant escape and for that just create private sessions but make up your own mind really i was lucky enough to get this game pre order and i dont get  off when games do what rockstar did with the infinite postponing of the game pc release and heists dlc specifically i also got a very lucky start with my pre order and if you start with nothing it is very hard to rank up but i still love the gameplay of this game and if you do buy this game hope to whatever supreme force you believe in or if atheist just find a way that you dont become a  it happens to everyone and i really hate even thinking about when i was a  in the game and i still sometimes am whenever i am a  in the game i never leave the game feeling happy with myself if i consider what i did anyway great game even if it is a morally bankrupt  company that made it edit its $60 but i love it money takes a while to get in online but with mods the sp is a blast and you can have a lot of fun online with friends

ahh yes the great game they call grand theft auto 5 this game is bloody amazing visuals what can i say i have a midrange card and i can run this game maxed out 4580fps without msaa and i can definitely tell you this game looks sexy there are noticeable jaggies but they can easily ignored 910 online the online is a totally different story there is so much ping lag and many hackers and i hope rockstar can easily fix these problems in the future overall the experience is okay and things like heistsmissions make up for these small easy to fix problems as they are fun to play and take your mind off the hackers and ping lag 710 campaign the campaign is just awesome i highly recommend you play it till 100% and you will not be disappointed not much else to say really 1010 overall i highly recommend you get this game 8510

great game online play however is thoroughly unappealing and useless totally untenable do not buy for online play if the single player game is not enough you will not like hackers and griefers rule online play its an ideal method for keeping the life cycle of the game short so that players will be ready to buy the next new thing and rockstar will not have to maintain the online servers for many years ea uses the same or similar methods of releasing broken online games time and again i expect more from rockstar not that its rockstars fault that our society produces so many low quality peopleplayers but at least give us a way to mitigate all the human trash and actually play the game ffs in short rockstar makes a great game but has yet to learn how to make a good multiplayer version that does not get overrun by trolls and griefers

having played gta4 for over 1000 hours and then bought gta5 i can say that i am left with distaste and dissatified gta5 is a open world firstthird person shooter game you get to control 3 characters one at a time each have a different personality and do not share money or items between each other the story evolves performing mainly heists like bank robberies there is barely any original missions to do besides do preheist missions i felt the game has been rushed copy and pasted missions with different routes while i find the game a bit fun to play it gets very old fast the world feels empty the traffic have a tendency to drive into the path of the player especially when the player is racing on the motorways i feel the storyline is very predictable just by judging the characters i had the satisfaction of fooling about in gta4 like inciting huge shootouts with random gangs and police it is nearly impossible to do the same in gta5 and if you incite police you do not survive long the enemies have bullseye precision even at long distances with even the shotguns and police respawn too soon the police are more aggressive some random events are fun but can get repetitive the weapons are excellent but under powered if equipped by the player npc have benefits of increased weapon stats as stated above with the police and their shotguns garages are very limited you can only store about 5 in a shed and 1 at each safehouse i would have though this game would have potential if it was a combined of test drive unlimited buying houses and garages and just cause 2 and the older gta games but no it just finds itself so serious and on par of realistic military shooters like arma vs call of duty

i also own this game for ps3 and the difference in graphics is noticeable mostly due to the higher framerate usually getting 7090 fps in online at max and the improved graphics great game a lot of fun in online mode however slightly buggy at times the singleplayer story is just amazing this might be the best edition of gta v however getting banned for using mods really rockstar this is what pc games is about as the fov is obviously too narrow in this game for firstperson mode i tried playing in firstperson but its almost unplayable due to the narrow fov i cant say i regret the purchase of the pc edition but after the bans for modding started i really feel that it certainly lowers the gameplay value

not the greatest and most optimized port but definetly still functional single player is fun from what i have experienced and from what others tell me it continues to be enjoyable the biggest downside to this game is the online experience is horrible the servers are quite often laggy because you are connected to random people from around the world this means you will constantly be connected to lobbies where many people are using voice chat in a language you dont know the matchmaking systems is one of the slowest and least functional i have ever seen unless you have a dedicated group on friends i wouldnt recommend it you will wait half an hour to get a full group and then one of them will leave halfway through a heist forcing you to start the whole process over additionally i have run in to a new experience where after several hours of gameplay gta v online has failed to save some of my online data this of course happened after i purchased a very expensive vehicle i saved several hours of in game money to purchase the game managed to lose the data on my character level but still remembered that i had spent the money somehow i lost my level and my money due to this error pros great single player decent port cons online servers laggy not localized online matchmaking very time consuming and poorly functional long load times for multiple processes load to get into online load to get into matchmaking load to boot up heist all of this usually followed by a lengthy in mission trip which can result in an hour from boot up of the game to the first sign of any actual gameplay overall single player good multiplayer horrible

so far most of the negative critics are due they cannot run the game or play it fluently and this is hopefully an issue that will be fixed however how many bad critics are due to the game is bad gentlemen so far ive seen none and its for a good damn reason bioshock infinite has a good story well yes it does pfft the last of us game of the decade pfft ladies and horses we have a game that truly goes into the interest of a gamer and im not referring to a fancy list of needs such as artistic inspiring or any liberal crap like that we have a game that along with mortal kombat has been the king of controversy a game that allow us to become mr hide a game that enforce us to torture some  guantanamostyle a well done game that allow us to fulfill the basic needs of senseless violence with tons of complete fun im not talking about saints row im not talking about skyrim im not talking about hatred im not even talking about postal damn i am talking about mothering gta5 many games sells by its name and company legacy but end up being anual crap like call of duty or assassins creed the people in rockstar they love us they dont do crap in any sense of the word they even take many years and delays to anger of many just to polish better the diamond they even do the sacrifice to put a 2year beta on consoles just to make for us the pc race a pure sexual experience nevertheless many could not run it on day one i could and i have kind of a crappy pc amd fx6300 at 35 ghz 4gb ddr3 windows 7m a cheap gigabyte motherboard and a geforce gt 640  i can run it decently and i can tell that even when i played the game with my xbox 360 the story is good you get killed without reason in the multiplayer tons of stereotypes if our modern society 1 black 1 middle aged 1 sociopath and lots of hookers explore a satirical yet accurate representation of a rotten modern society where people is moved like cattle politicians and religions throw out  everybody believes new generations are driving everything to  technologies are beyond human control and drugs are the the fastest growing market huge sandbox map with tons of random things and extras a large single player campaign with tons of extra  an immersive role play in the multiplayer with an actual history development that makes you feel you are part of the game cars tanks dogs and drugs you have it all

update game is finally functional in order to get it to work i had to completely reformat my hard drive and do a clean install i guess that rockstar cant manage to get through the same compatibility issues that even small indie developers have long since figured out im changing my recommendation because this game is amazing but i am seriously unhappy about the issues that arose during this whole process  5 days and still no fix even though the game was purchased through steam youre redirected to the rockstar social club in order to play the game whenever social club is launched it crashes before you ever get into game ive spent a week attempting every voodoo fix people have conjoured up and nothing works the biggest kicker is that once just once i got a little bit further than an immediate crash when i tried loading the game in steam offline mode but the rockstar drm then indicated that i couldnt log in because i had to log in at least once in online mode before i could get into the offline version which is impossible due to the crashes 5 gd days guys i understand that this effects a fairly small minority of people but you would think that with billions of dollars made off this game that you would be able to get people to actually play the @$% thing within the first week of release congrats on out ubisofting ubisoft

not much has to be said about the grand theft auto series as rockstar always manages to deliver an outstanding experience the singleplayer campaign starts slow and somewhat lackluster but eventually builds momentum as youre introduced to more exciting personalities and missions some of the story elements are oddly written at times and feel a bit off enough to kill the excitement the second half of the game is pretty onpoint with no real complaints lots of great dialogue and setpiece moments as expected tons of content here even if you just do the main story missions expect 20 hours or more of gameplay just for the main story gta online leaves a lot to be desired getting into a game with friends can be a real challenge sometimes starting missions and heists causes you and others to connect to a new game instance the swapping from freeroam to missions and back causes so many loading screens that it gets really obnoxious really quickly when you go back to freeroam there is no guarantee youre even playing with the same people you were originally its a real headache just trying to do a variety of things with friends console players are also allowed to transfer their characters over meaning you could be facing level 100 people as a person who just started playing for the first time the online mode should have been done differently more like how apb handles it its a real letdown but still can be good fun if you enjoy the sandboxing overall its gta on pc it looks great and it runs great definitely worth the money

gta as normal just better not tons of miles better but good enough to be better than iv massive openworld tons of missions lots of sidebits you can do the little unofficial personal rampages you can do in this series that make it worth the fun its hard to escape police unless youre lowlevel which is how it needs to be online play is dependent on players but plays well enough most shocking is just how damn fast it runs on the same hardware as i played gta iv on i was expecting massive drop in speed  its parallel or even slightly faster despite being prettier i have an old mobile nvidia card so i wasnt expecting that but i dont think you could get away with a runofthemill business pc with any nvidia card  the first of the 64bitonly games ive seen and for a reason but with quadcores and 8gb ram and a halfdecent directx1011 card its more than playable at full res but its just a question of what options you have turned on havent seen any poppingin issues but my hard drive is constantly streaming data when im playing great game looks great plays great tons of freedom huge world and more vehicles and missions than you can shake a stick at

i think the game was well worth the wait rockstar did actually deliver what it told us it was going to deliver us a smooth gta playing experience on the pc and the graphics even on medium or high are pretty darn astonishing i was sitting here earlier today watching the sunset ingame overlooking the city and all i could say was this sunset looks darn better than in real life if you havent already buy the game because this is the best gta we have gotten yet on pc

where were we left extremely lousy physics and damage mechanics an ai that apparently uses a bruteforce path finding algorithm unoptimized graphics unoptimized whatever that makes my cpu suck the watts enough to sustain a neighborhood gliches weird controls the most horrible menu ever lots of bugs biglaunch tragedy it is a game one simply must play so yes i recommend it but be prepared to fight your urges that make you want to run away pros gta being gta firstperson view is a hit story is unchanged which is perfect

last time i played gta 5 it was on the the playstation 3 and was no were neer as good as the pc version 24 hours of play time id say its a darn good game a few graphical bugs but nothing big thats all

wow just wow i have played this so much on ps4 so i expected to be bored the first day this was realised this pc version feels completly different compared to the consoles it almost feels like a whole new gta game the graphics are unreal and probably the best graphics i have ever seen in a video game so easy to run on such high quality by far the best game av played in years 1010 by far the long painfull wait was woth it

its good if you play alone in your basement single player its over in about 25 hours the missions are more tamed than in older gtas there is no driving of enemies in a bus and dumping them in a meat factory like in gta2 no you just do regular missions with killing and stealing cars its fun but not in true gta spirit its more grown up without the witty missions now the online part is just awful great idea but you need 3 friends you cant play alone or rely on matchmaking oh and be prepared to wait for about 20 minutes while playing an hour so 40 minutes of playtime 20 minutes of loading that is not good for a aaa game saying that i would not recommend gta5 maybe after 23 years if they get their  together and improve load times and the servers but not now especially not for the full price

its alright but i feel like the game has got motion blur yes it has i turend if off dosent do any diffrance i would rather play it on a consol 810 also my carma gets bugged

this game is one of my favorite games ive ever played why i like it  has some really cool heists i like gta 5 more than payday 2 because the heists in payday 2 is so unrealistic  the game it self looks amazing of course only if you have a good graphic card  the game has a lot of missions to complete you can easily spend the whole day on playing the game  the bad thing about this game is the long waiting loading screen which can take forever  all the small details a lot of games doesnt have like you can smoke cigarettes drink cola from vending machines rob stores  this game is worth buying if you like realistic rp and action game plus is also has firstperson mode

over one hundred hours logged and i havent even began to touch online yet after years of waiting we finally got it  the holy grail of self indulgence was this masterpiece worth the second wait you can absolutely bet on your life welcome to los santos once again it has been under some construction these past few years michael trevor and franklin have been waiting patiently for you with the new firstperson perspective everything is an entirely new experience new vehicles for all of the terrains to drive and fully customize new side missions new random encounters and new challenges to do in your spare time new weapons and modifications to customize and play with new business properties to buy and manage  which includes the occasional mission new wildlife to hunt and discover on land water and sky new online events challenges game modes and extra content for returning players new overhauled engine drastically improving graphics textures and world population density not to mention a gigantic menu for graphical optimization it is truly impressive if you previously had a rockstar social club account on any other platform you can transfer all of your previous online data into your new game doing this also gives you exclusive content in campaign and online this is the definitive edition of gta v and i could not recommend it enough 2010 ______________________________________ personal experience i picked up a hitchiker on the side of the road around dusk she thumbed me down for about a quarter mile and i figured what the heck she seemed like a nice enough woman she got in the car and enthusiastically thanked me for if it were not for me her knight in a shining pick up truck she would still be all alone out in the middle of nowhere and in potential danger she hinted that if i were to take here home it would be worth my while so i headed down the highlighted path towards our far off destination then she spoke again but this time it was to herself i mean everyone does it every now and again but with her it was a little different she started speeding up her speech and what had started as a low murmer had soon grown to a loud stammering she was arguing with herself going through about five different emotions all at once i immediately took out my road map and marked a new location then we veered off of our original path and onto a new patha path up a beautiful mountainside she continued to yell at herself mentioning causing harm to others as well as herself she starts crying about things her therapist told her to try that did not work i tried to calm her down the best i could and she seemed to snap out of it once again trying to seduce me like she didnt just put on a bat crazy display in my front seat i knew this woman was bat crazy i had to get rid of her i pressed down harder on the gas pedal and took a quick few shortcuts off the trail after a few miles up the mountain she finally came to her senses where are we i dont think this is the way to my house i dont remember ever coming this far out that was the most sensible thing she had said the entire drive oh no i know i said i know of this spot that is very remote i think you will really like it she relaxed oh okay sounds like a good time we turned right and stopped at a giant gate we got out of the parked car and i yelled through the gate i got another one for ya to do with whatever it is that you do two men came out of the gate with assault rifles and rope and captured the woman who was now sobbing and looking back at me terrified i asked one man for my payment and instead the other man jammed his rifle into my rib signaling me through the gate i complied afterall i was unarmed and they had a whole community surrounding me they took me to a rock and proceeded to kneel and pray to some unknown god so i took the opportunity to look around and spotted a rifle behind me on the rock i climbed over and took hold of the rifle opening fire on the townspeople after three minutes of a oneonmany firefight there was no more community left only myself i slaughtered an entire village singlehandedly stole all of their money from their homes and saved zero hostages no god

best version of gta v just finished the main storyline and enjoyed every moment of replaying it didnt remember it too well last time i played it was when it released on ps3 great optimization customizable keyboard layout and controller support great graphics watching the sun set is awesome rain and weather effects are all top notch especially at night with all the neon in the city reflecting off the roads driving is great ai is great cops will use real world maneuvers to wreck you and you feel like you are actually on the run you can dip off in an alley and if they see your headlights they will get out and investigate have them cut off and they will likely drive by if you are hidden well from sight my car was parked in dark shadows and they drove right by some funny characters story isnt the best but it does fine heists are plentiful throughout and fun with multiple ways of playing them making replayability higher shooting and combat is top notch loads of guns detail in the world is amazing the city looks and feels real and the outskirts in the desert feel just like they should plenty of activities such as boat races scuba diving flying planes and helicopters desert races etc side missions although some are boring but not horribly boring online is fun and will keep me coming back to it more and more but havent spent enough time with it to offer a valid opinion played the heists on xbox one and they were great from what i played not really any negatives for me although some people have reported having launch issues but seems they are getting sorted out fast people just basically killing each other in free roam instead of doing something fun like running from cops tldr this is one of the best action open world games on pc if not the best ingame world for this type of game its well made and deserves your attention they spent a lot of time with this port and it shows there are bugs but its nothing to write home about compared to the console versions and they are getting addressed plenty to do and keep you coming back for gta online gta online updates have been free too so far single player dlc is in the works and on the way

getting hype when i saw the first trailer on 2011 upset when when they arent for pc on 2013 getting super hype again after they annouced for nextgen getting a little bit upset when they delayed to jan 2015 getting really upset again when they delayed again to march 2015 seriously wth delayed to april 2015 getting hype on the day the preload began the game finally released i enjoyed the game like ill never see the sun anymore 1010 will sacrifice to wait for the next gta game

the game is overloaded with a content in the beginning you are the kid in a confectionary 1010 the time has passed youve realized the most of the content is pointless and has no value a bit of disappointment 810 the game has ended the mighty rockstar has not done anything which will make the game any better of a ubis yearly sandbox 7510 you have started the online the first hour of the journey is amazing and you are the rs believer once again 8510 the hours has gone in the online and all you can see is only the bad things the glitches the mistakes for which a developer should be ashamed these days 810 its not the destination thats important its the journey you are switching off the game and moving to the anabiosis until gta 6 910

this plays like the ultimate version this is how the game should have released from the start it runs smoothly and efficiently very very few bugs or glitches this is a must have for every pc gamer down side none

for the amount of time ive played this game i can say its one of my favourite games of all time i played it on the ps3 and the pc version is so much better
recommended
its taken rock two years to get this game to us pc gamers and what have we been rewarded with well a slightly tidied up copy and paste of the console version pros some of the major bugs from the console version have been fixed making the game more enjoyable online the improvement of passive mode for example there is quite a lot to do mission wise seems like many more have been added since original release one of the main things i disliked about the console version was the lack of variety and the constant cycle of 56 missions lots of different modes have been added too the concept of heists yes the concept cons there seems to be three kinds of rock server laggy decent and unstable randomly being kicked or timing out is a constant thing not just for myself but for some other players too load times they are insane you could literally read a book in the time it takes to load in sometimes the need to return to single player mode just to remake a server for you and your friends seems insanely stupid to me having to jump back and forth all the time is draining and saps any enjoyment the heists are really buggy bugs are annoying anyway but when you have had to restart 20 times and then wait for players to join your group unable to kick people without restarting the whole lobby only for one of them to crash or become stuck in the floor a random objective to spontainiously combust or a door to refuse to open it really grates combine this with load times and set up times its not worth it overall good game i guess for me personally not living up to the hype simply because there are some game breaking problems that should be being address right now seeing as the games price is top end and they reeled in the preorders i would say buy it but not at its price right now its a lot of money for something that just ends up in frustration unless rock do something about these heists and the server issues i could potentially see the player base dropping off as the consoles did when they went ignored sorry fanboy and girls but they made up wait and took our money  they need to deliver

recommended
running the game maxed out on every setting with my decent graphics card gtx770 4gb and crappy  dated processor amd fx4100 @ 36 ghz  it works like a charm with fps around 5060 social club ties to your steam account im not so sure about it all but in all honesty i dont care too much it isnt as intrusive as uplay but im not sure how it will affect offline gameplay no crashes at all no slowdowns either but i havent see too much of the game yet its been a while since i played gta v on ps3 so im relearning the map and all that stuff population density and vehicle density changes are great with busier streets and all that pretty smooth launch i have to say controls suck they really really suck when you install the game expect to spend some time remapping the controls to something more flexible and then faffing with trying to swap weapons under the same category took me a few hours to perfect something so basic and simple menus etc are just as bad and blah blah if rockstar fixed the menus controls and whatnot then i would have very few complaints anyway will probably write a more detailed review later but if you like the gta series id recommend this game any day having played on the ps3 extensively im surprised to find i still enjoy the game despite repeating all the same missions and so on on sp that is yet to try the online but looking good nonetheless ps thanks hirovard

although i reccomend this game i reccomend you get it later after some optimization updates have been released im getting fps drops on lowest quality just driving i dont think rockstar could have made a worse port to pc it could be that its just hot in my room i dont know but seriously rockstar come on you had 2 years to make a pc version and you ed it up with your  optimization all this aside gta v is a great ing game note ive fixed my issue but people are still having problems with the port second note people on gta online dont know how to do the prison break

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

best version of gta v just finished the main storyline and enjoyed every moment of replaying it didnt remember it too well last time i played it was when it released on ps3 great optimization customizable keyboard layout and controller support great graphics watching the sun set is awesome rain and weather effects are all top notch especially at night with all the neon in the city reflecting off the roads driving is great ai is great cops will use real world maneuvers to wreck you and you feel like you are actually on the run you can dip off in an alley and if they see your headlights they will get out and investigate have them cut off and they will likely drive by if you are hidden well from sight my car was parked in dark shadows and they drove right by some funny characters story isnt the best but it does fine heists are plentiful throughout and fun with multiple ways of playing them making replayability higher shooting and combat is top notch loads of guns detail in the world is amazing the city looks and feels real and the outskirts in the desert feel just like they should plenty of activities such as boat races scuba diving flying planes and helicopters desert races etc side missions although some are boring but not horribly boring online is fun and will keep me coming back to it more and more but havent spent enough time with it to offer a valid opinion played the heists on xbox one and they were great from what i played not really any negatives for me although some people have reported having launch issues but seems they are getting sorted out fast people just basically killing each other in free roam instead of doing something fun like running from cops tldr this is one of the best action open world games on pc if not the best ingame world for this type of game its well made and deserves your attention they spent a lot of time with this port and it shows there are bugs but its nothing to write home about compared to the console versions and they are getting addressed plenty to do and keep you coming back for gta online gta online updates have been free too so far single player dlc is in the works and on the way

getting hype when i saw the first trailer on 2011 upset when when they arent for pc on 2013 getting super hype again after they annouced for nextgen getting a little bit upset when they delayed to jan 2015 getting really upset again when they delayed again to march 2015 seriously wth delayed to april 2015 getting hype on the day the preload began the game finally released i enjoyed the game like ill never see the sun anymore 1010 will sacrifice to wait for the next gta game

the game is overloaded with a content in the beginning you are the kid in a confectionary 1010 the time has passed youve realized the most of the content is pointless and has no value a bit of disappointment 810 the game has ended the mighty rockstar has not done anything which will make the game any better of a ubis yearly sandbox 7510 you have started the online the first hour of the journey is amazing and you are the rs believer once again 8510 the hours has gone in the online and all you can see is only the bad things the glitches the mistakes for which a developer should be ashamed these days 810 its not the destination thats important its the journey you are switching off the game and moving to the anabiosis until gta 6 910

amazing game improvements this is coming from an owner of the ps4 and ps3 versions of gtav  yes both the only cons are  no hotas support i really want to be able to map my flight controls for air combat  long loading times in multiplayer always the case with gta online though  a few minor server instance bugs really difficult with 2 friends on same server getting into the same missions  cant transfer singleplayer saves to pc even if you download from ps4 and dump them into the savegame folder oh well the biggest improvement is the insane framerate im only running a severalyearold gtx 680 nvidia card and ive maxed out all settings and postprocessing effects except textures due to mem limits and it runs at 60fps easy smoother than any game ive ever played period i also will comment how great it is to play firstperson with a mouse and keyboard on gta for the first time

rockstar finally learned how to optmize a game for pc gamewise i have no complains as this game runs perfectly on my midend system i also would like to point the attention they gave to detail in this ie for the first time in all of gtas the steering wheel does actually move that may not sound much but it is truly a big thing things i didnt like were the rearview mirrors on cars being nothing more than a lowquality mirror and the online having nothing new i hope this will change in time either way good job on the and its enhancement rockstar definetely worth my money

hated gta iv with a passion genuinely hated it it was palestine and i was netanyahu it was a newly born baby and i was herod it was moby d1ck not the musician and i was captain ahab it was the police and i was any reasonably minded human being just going about their business it was a cat and i was a dog dont say the last analogy doesnt work because if you have a dog that likes cats then it is fgt and therefore inadmissable as evidence you are probably fgt too this game is amazing its a banquet and im a starving pauper its a bared posterior and i am a belt its someone who needs strangled and i have very big hands etc etc etc buy it dont be a twit buy it should run fine on any mediumhighend gfx cards i run it at 720p for shame on my gtx970 and i get a steady 60fps with everything up on ultravery high where ultra is not available probably going to go and kill myself now tbh ingame 1010 would review again

who needs real life when you have gta v on pc port 1010 graphics 1010 soundtrack 1010 gameplay 1010 nothing negative to say at all worth the wait edit i have been playing since 2 hours after the game had been released never had an issue playing besides the occasional restart

the game runs absoloutely amazingaltho the game has a slight stutter on the start screen the game itself runs amazing at 1920x1080 @60hz 5060fps ive been waiting quite a while for this but it was worth iti look forward to playing online massive improvement to its predecessor gta episodes from liberty city and gta iv simply a must have rockstar put alot of work into this game

running the game maxed out on every setting with my decent graphics card gtx770 4gb and crappy  dated processor amd fx4100 @ 36 ghz  it works like a charm with fps around 5060 social club ties to your steam account im not so sure about it all but in all honesty i dont care too much it isnt as intrusive as uplay but im not sure how it will affect offline gameplay no crashes at all no slowdowns either but i havent see too much of the game yet its been a while since i played gta v on ps3 so im relearning the map and all that stuff population density and vehicle density changes are great with busier streets and all that pretty smooth launch i have to say controls suck they really really suck when you install the game expect to spend some time remapping the controls to something more flexible and then faffing with trying to swap weapons under the same category took me a few hours to perfect something so basic and simple menus etc are just as bad and blah blah if rockstar fixed the menus controls and whatnot then i would have very few complaints anyway will probably write a more detailed review later but if you like the gta series id recommend this game any day having played on the ps3 extensively im surprised to find i still enjoy the game despite repeating all the same missions and so on on sp that is yet to try the online but looking good nonetheless ps thanks hirovard

 preload failed causing a redownload  framerate drops  stuttering  needs an update to fix major issues  social club is a disaster for the game  the issues metioned above such as framerate drops and stuttering that i was having was fixed i played around with the nvidia control panel in order to maximise the power use of the gpu and ingame settings i turned off vsync  in terms of the preload it kept showing me errors through the unpacking phase causing me to miss the first day of play  my fps stayed at a consistant 60 but sometimes saw huge drops reaching as low as 20 for a second  i highly dont reccommned the game if you have a pc below the recommended requirements

honestly even considering the fact that i like many other games far more than the gta series gta 5 pc is probably in the top 5 of best video games ever made this is a monument to gaming

i cannot even write a review because the game is not even starting on my laptop intel i7 12 gb ram nvidia gtx 850 m and i am not alone with this problem it cannot be that i have to open a second microsoft account disable the graphics card and do a lot of other idiotic things for a game i payed nearly 60 euros the support from rockstar is almost not existing steam only says that the problem is known and rockstar is working on it according to steam i played it already since around one hour but i only tried to make it running because of that i cannot even request my money back only because of politeness i dont say what i really think about that miserable thats all i can say
not recommended
this game is cool pros  probably the best sandbox game on pc for playing with friends online  lots of ways to customize your character  pretty good storyline will keep you intrigued  combat feels really nice  driving feels even nicer  dlc is free and isnt stuff that was ripped from the game before release  first person mode is incredibly well designed it feels like a whole new game  extremely well optimized cons  took way to long to come out on pc and a few things are missing from the console version  most people will shoot you as soon as they see you online luckily theres a passive mode but its pretty boring playing with it on  cops have perfect accuracy with guns and are extremely hard to get away from way harder than previous games  stealth doesnt work in this game and shouldnt be a mechanic  you get scars on your face online when you die and they dont go away til you restart the game its ing  who thought this was a good idea  rockstar has done everything to prevent mods from happening and it doesnt look good for the future why  not mgs v phantom pain this game is incredible and i love it ive had so much fun playing it with my friends and by myself but i really expected a lot more from a game that got 1010s from almost every review site and has never had something bad said about it its really been overhyped and the wait time that pc gamers have had to endure hasnt made it any better sure we get the director mode which i have yet to try out but thats about it pc gamers really get nothing except for some bonus cash in multiplayer if they preordered it all in all i give it an 810 tldr its great but i expected more
recommended
tons of content in this game you could spend hours of time exploring the detailed los santos or you could invest in the fully functional mini games you could even once again spend hours just watching very funny tv stations the campaign is excellent with only a few bad missions i played this back on the ps3 and recall it taking me more than 40 hours just to do the main missions a very cynical parodyexaggeration of modern life and culture taking the game literally you will easily get offended but the game essentially channels the style of a tarantino film if you have played the game before then you know it is worth replaying never played this game comes with my full recommendation

the game is welldesigned and runs very smoothly on my computer the story keeps me interested in singleplayer when i would otherwise spend all of my time on the awesome online part of the game the game is not perfect however here are some pros and cons of grand theft auto v pros good port awesome graphics good singleplayer story great gameplay awesome customization even more so in gta online enormous world full of content los santos is a satire of los angeles and hollywood and the world is full of snide remarks toward various things in the modern america from politics to the economy to 50 shades of grey ingame radio has good music more content than original xbox360 and ps3 versions including firstperson mode cons holy drm batman you have to be connected to the internet to even play the singleplayer as the game must be authenticated through rockstar servers frequent disconnects in gta online not as bad as launch on consoles but there are definitely still server issues to be ironed out 810  theres a reason gta v broke world records its the best gta game yet and its also the biggest by a very large margin unfortunately drm is a pain in the neck and server issues in gta online where youll spend a good portion of your time sometimes make the game frustrating to play

i stopped playing this on the 360 in 2013 because it was  quite simply the multiplayer experience wasnt too bad but it was just over shadowed by the huge loading times the defaulting to single player if a multiplayer server was busy and the long waiting times in between game modes 1 minute is way too much for the attention span of 2015 users i was really hoping for a lot more and a large amount of improvements but i seem to spend as much time trying to get into games and adding people to lobbys and generally ing around than getting any real enjoyment out of it not worth it

gta v finally made its way to pc if you are lucky enough your copy will have downloaded and played fine on the first day which is something pc hasnt gotten much of in recent years cough cough watch_dogs & ac unity i am also very pleased as i can actually run this game on the lowest settings which just looks like xbox360 version on my potato of a laptop with the following specs amd a65350m dual core 29ghz turbo to 35ghz apu with radeontm hd graphics 8gb ram amd radeon hd 8450g  about 750mb graphics win 7 i also have a desktop with much better specs which looks much nicer but the fact that my potato laptop cant run it is definitely awesome and last of all its gta of cource it is gunna be a sick  game good job rockstar edit so the annoyance of people getting banned over harmless mods was annoying but its rockstar and they got their  together and fixed it i cant wait for more hiests and dlc for this awesome game

not much has to be said about the grand theft auto series as rockstar always manages to deliver an outstanding experience the singleplayer campaign starts slow and somewhat lackluster but eventually builds momentum as youre introduced to more exciting personalities and missions some of the story elements are oddly written at times and feel a bit off enough to kill the excitement the second half of the game is pretty onpoint with no real complaints lots of great dialogue and setpiece moments as expected tons of content here even if you just do the main story missions expect 20 hours or more of gameplay just for the main story gta online leaves a lot to be desired getting into a game with friends can be a real challenge sometimes starting missions and heists causes you and others to connect to a new game instance the swapping from freeroam to missions and back causes so many loading screens that it gets really obnoxious really quickly when you go back to freeroam there is no guarantee youre even playing with the same people you were originally its a real headache just trying to do a variety of things with friends console players are also allowed to transfer their characters over meaning you could be facing level 100 people as a person who just started playing for the first time the online mode should have been done differently more like how apb handles it its a real letdown but still can be good fun if you enjoy the sandboxing overall its gta on pc it looks great and it runs great definitely worth the money
recommended
gta as normal just better not tons of miles better but good enough to be better than iv massive openworld tons of missions lots of sidebits you can do the little unofficial personal rampages you can do in this series that make it worth the fun its hard to escape police unless youre lowlevel which is how it needs to be online play is dependent on players but plays well enough most shocking is just how damn fast it runs on the same hardware as i played gta iv on i was expecting massive drop in speed  its parallel or even slightly faster despite being prettier i have an old mobile nvidia card so i wasnt expecting that but i dont think you could get away with a runofthemill business pc with any nvidia card  the first of the 64bitonly games ive seen and for a reason but with quadcores and 8gb ram and a halfdecent directx1011 card its more than playable at full res but its just a question of what options you have turned on havent seen any poppingin issues but my hard drive is constantly streaming data when im playing great game looks great plays great tons of freedom huge world and more vehicles and missions than you can shake a stick at

ive finally completed the story and i have to say that i am still in awe of this game sure there are things that can be improved such as those dastardly bushes that i cant drive through or the giant void of a lake that you can not boat across but one can easily forgive these things considering the breadth of the game some may call that cheap and i wouldnt argue as it does stand out as a cheap tactic to increase the size of the map after looking at average story time completions people seem to be around 30 hours i took the opportunity to do a bit of everything and when the story completion rolled around i was at 60 hours and only 70% completion im still confused on how the credits can roll and im immediately sent on another story mission for trevor when i get past it im not complaining and in a way it seems like a quick out for people just trying to say they finished it when in fact things to do in the game are far from over and more story is to be had the attention to details the beautiful scenery and the scope of this game are just phonemonal there are so many games within this game a lot of activities like riding bicycles motorcycles jet skis and so on are just as good as some stand alone games although you cant boat on the lake which is annoying when you notice it riding a boat on the ocean in this game is more realistic than any other game ive ever played skimming waves and launching into the air gives you a pretty good idea what youre getting into if you decide to hop into a boat with some speed the cars handle better than any of the other gta and so much better than saints row that they shouldnt even be mentioned i hopped in the camaro and was just blown away that they actually captured the feeling of hotrodding one of these cars if i had anything to complain about regarding a vehicle its only that i want more options i want tons of options i want everything in the real world available for my car right now do i recommend this game i think the question is stacked to be honest because there is only one way to answer yes i dont just recommend it i think that if you like games then you owe it to yourself to play this it stands as a milestone to what gaming has achieved we started out with pong we got pole position it graduated into mario bros and now it has become this its breath taking and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse
recommended
really slick gameplay and so far no issues for me i would recommend this game as it is amazingly well optimized and looks like some of the best graphics so far in a game really chuffed with it its even better than i thought it would be great value for money the first person mode is awesome i cant think of anything wrong with this game it is perfect
recommended
so as well you all know gta has always been a good game but the pros linking your steam account to the sony account online works now good graphics from what ive seen so far heists work cons i have to spam launch the game to get it to work it takes forever to launch sometimes it wont even launch at all its crashes a lot as well

i absolutely loved the game on gaystation 3 the only reason why i bought a gaystation was to play gta v and it was totally worth it selling it now btw and now i finally have this masterpiece on my 600 potato it runs smooth at 30 fps at high and you dont need a 4000 pc to run this like most console peasants like to exeggrate their stuff anyways 60 is quit high for a game imo so if you can wait to buy this wait for a sale or something you really want to play this masterpiece to bad go ahead and throw 60 at gaben fat  jk i love you <3 my overal rating would be 8510 it just lacks some life i mean the city is almost empty and there barely isnt any trafficpedestrians rockstar should take an example from watch_dogs the city if full of life

woke up on a saturday morning got dressed up and called my friend brandon he drove to my penthouse with his sportscar we went and assasinated this guy for 5000$ each customized our hot rides with nitro and neons after that we went to the strip club and made it rain also bought some weapons in the name of self defence after that we went home to smoke some pot and we were hi as ful< we went bowling but it didnt work because we were 2 hi to hit pins crap we stole a jet and flew back home jumping off with our parachutes after that i got some whiskey and played some gta v which is a pretty good game i guess
recommended
i flipped the bird to a random pedestrian he called the police and then i got shot would play again 1010
recommended
i like running over people in gta it soothes me  also like the strip clubs there nice 10your mom

awesome game  simply love it oh and probably the reason why people get banned for mods is because it changes the files around unlike a trainer where it injects information making you into a whale
recommended
rockstar is fine with singleplayer modding now so its all good
recommended
had this game on xbox and now its even better on pc if you do not have this game get it story mode is fun online is fun and now a thriving modding community once you place 60 bucks on this game you will not regret it at all to the modding community you are allowed to use mods in singleplayer not multiplayer im having soo much fun with gtav on the pc but i just have one question about it how come you are not allowing mods for it  @clarkmatthew63 will i get banned from gta online for using a fov mod or oculus rift mod  @mattophobia we have always appreciated the creative efforts of the pc modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original gta map mod for gtaiv pc among many other classics to be clear the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for gtaiv recent updates to gtav pc had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications this was not intentional no one has been banned for using single player modifications and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player pc mods our primary focus is on protecting gta online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage disrupt gameplay or cause griefing it also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized they may be broken by technical updates cause instability or affect your game in other unforeseen ways
recommended
awesome game you need a good computer to take advantage of the eye candy in this title though economics car racing a bit coarse with language and sexual content in a lot ofg cases so if you have kids best to play with headphones when they are in bed
recommended
if you want an openworld in a videogame this is the best one

ing amazing game worth every penny

would slow cap again 1010

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
really good game you must buy
recommended
gta v is a funtoplay games with interesting story mode missionit would be more interesting if the map even more bigger plus less quota of internet needed

you need not read reviews about the game to know that this game is ing great it has all you have come to expect from a gta game and the superior frames per second that people often argue about this game is a piece of art it evokes emotion it is aesthetically pleasing and is an absolute pleasure to play the world is alive filled with people who are doing their own thing people who will react to you people who you react to people who you may kill people who you may rob people who you may save i look forward to the next few content updates and patches that will add more things to this vibrant world most of all it lets you do almost anything you want even if you just want to be a threebit gangster
recommended
im stuttering all over the damn place but ive played the game previously and its fantastic
recommended
uh itslike one of the best games of all time
recommended
this game was great xd
recommended
do not buy this game if you have an invidia graphics card it will not work it will just crash and pretty much none of the solutions from the forums work you will be unable to contact rockstar support because you will be unable to attach the required files that will not exist and steam support being what it is you can just forget about playing this game a complete waste of money
not recommended
once all the issues were fixed this game runs and plays beautifully the only issue is the ing hackers the ing hackers they dont let up you can be driving and bam there goes all your money and weapons be careful when in a lobby with someone acting suspicious i learned this the hardway unfortunately

getting this game to launch was a  waited 3 days for a patch then the game works the gameplay is still awesome though 45 because of the launch errors and crashes

online play is infested with hackers impossible to play one day without them ruining the game until rockstar fixes online mode with good old ban wave i would not recommend it for anyone if you are however looking to only play singleplayer you will have a blast of a time
not recommended
was a great game at launch  but now its hacked so bad the fun is gone and its all trolls and hacks  not worth the 60$ they want for it  i would recommend buying something else 
not recommended
great game but  rockstar are es they need to work on their customer services as they are a bunch of s as soon as online is hacked the game will be much better

besides the sale tactics the game for me is unplayeable due to lag even tho i have all te recomended specs i have not found a fix to lag mostly at online

i extremely approve of this game im a little annoyed how i preordered and didnt get the collectors edition stuff because i actually want that stuff i also have some problems with the intro with crashing other than that i love it
recommended
i cant start the game says wrong update 
not recommended
first off i would recommend this game its really well done the thumbs down is to emphasize the games weaknesses the problem is with the hackers online its pretty bad with how prevalent it is and iff rockstar implemented something like punkbuster or had someway of negating the problem online would improve the other issue ive had is with graphics stability ive got a decent pc with an i7 12gb of ram and a 2gb vcard running within the recommended graphics settings and its still not consistanly smooth fps wise in my opinion buying the game and the great white shark card is well worth the $60 the $125 mil that you start off with is worth since you can buy everthing you need to play well online with that including the nicest property all the weapons you need and several highend cars and still have a lot left over the first person shooter mode is groundbreaking in my opinion its similar to the significance of gta 3 being in 3d driving off road and flying is tough but shooting and driving in the city is really good the online heists are fun if you like payday its the same idea only not as detailed in the execution but you do more more to prepare for the heist in this than in payday
not recommended
i got the game mainly for online and was enjoying it untill i got unjustly banned online is full of modders and hacker that constatly abuse the game rockstar has no real way of stoping it makeing the game laggy and contantly crash in my shoort 2 weeks playing online i was faced with a number of error crashes and failurs to load data from rockstarts cloud server even worse is the fact that i had to dig in reddit for a solution for most errors i got as there web page has fixes for most error and instructions on how to fix then yet only for ps3 xbox 360 and the next gen xbox one and ps4 nothing for pc modders ruin any cahnce of fun rather buy killing u without even being near u or by being as most people online say nice and giveing u money you might think well whats wrong with that  well i was given 150 billion by a modder while i was afk when i got back i was overjoyed untill i spent 50mill and had nothing else to buy after that there wass no point in doing anything anymore i had everything in the game bought shore i could pvp in freeroam yet everyones modding so gl killing people with godmode on thta is if the moder even lets u move without takeing ur weapons away or freeing your character worst part is innocent people are now getting banned b y rockstar cause of modders giveing them money somtheing u cant control i sugget not to get it if u want to play online it will be dead soon at the rate rockstar is baning people
not recommended
ive only played this game 10 hrs and ill tell you what the fluctuations in my lower region are ever increasing for this game im like chop with his bone like skyrim with hillbillys 1010 ign

so far so good at a constant 60fps this game is hella fun if you dont enjoy this game due to frame drop get a job and then you can enjoy this game
recommended
just because the launcher keeps crashing i dont recommand this game please fix it rockstar
not recommended
first of all i do like the game so why the thumbs down its overpriced for for a modcheat infested multiplayer you can only play multiplayer on a decent way with some friends in a private session i had hoped the update would change it but it didnt then you have the fact that steam made it even more expensive in summer sale which allowed them to give you a 25% discount and it came down to the same price it wasis not the first time i see steam do it i have no words for such malpractice
not recommended
i like this game very much and its pretty fun to play with friends but the multiplayer mode needs to be improved please allow mods to be used online in a different lobby just like in gta iv i also do not like how the price has been raised just before the summer sale thats just mean and greedy therefore i leave a negative review because this behavior should not be encouraged
not recommended
amazing game nothing more really necessary to be said
recommended
illegal business going on here raising the price to put a discount on it is illegal in the eu have fun rockstar
not recommended
shady steam summer sale practice super laggy super buggy do not buy
not recommended
cheap move rockstar
not recommended
rockstar tries to ripoff customers by jacking up the base price so the summer sale price is the same as the price it was before it went on sale 010
not recommended
nonlegitimate sale advertised discount is false
not recommended
i turned on gta online just to find out that their new update also took all the money out of my bank account i have been very unimpressed with this game for a while now but that is the last straw i didnt spend full price on this game but i am considering what i did spent to have been to much i have turned it on time and time again with the mindset of i bought it i might as well play it but at this point i refuse unistalling process initiated like everyone else is saying the game is okay it is a fun time with friends and to screw around in single player but the story is repetitive you can play for an hour and feel like you havent progressed at all some missions feel forced and sometimes dont make any sense and to me the whole story mode feels like it is stalling to make the game seem longer like missions where you drive a car for like 10 minutes to get to an objective why not put me closer to the objective i am all for realism but every mission online is boring because no one plays probably because no one likes to play as of now this is the last game of theirs i will play they go on the list of companies i have lost respect for cuddled up all nice and cozy with ubisoft
not recommended
game doesnt start no program starts atleast i dont have to put up with rockstars  game d 1010

i ed my pants when i saw the beauty that was gta 5 on the pc

took me 2 hours after release to actually get online but the preorder money got me a nice plane which is nice
recommended
maybe the best computer game ever made for any system you certainly could argue it ive played all the gtas each one right at release and again and again repeatedly over the years and ive been a huge fan since the very first top down gta way back when and this is still the best gta ever its so good its almost literally unbelievable the pc port is clearly the best version of v with an almost surreal amount of refinement graphics options control tweaks full surroundeyefinity support that even includes hud movement to prevent bezel interference and the much lauded and stunningly amazing first person mode the open world is alive and constantly in motion the game is absolutely beautiful the dialog is sharp and accurate and the amount of content is gigantic bordering on ridiculous the minigames are better than or at least very comparable to the full game titles that inspired them and theres so many the game does require a very powerful system to appreciate fully but since when is that a negative im extremely pleased that rockstar pushed the envelope of what was possible because the results speak for themselves with the review system specs below i get steady 30fps through most every type of scene and location in the game and thats with everything maxed out and vsync on except for fxaa instead of msaa and no reflection msaa everything else totally maxed out and still 30fps @ 6040x1080 i think that at least merits a o_0 dont you its not a bad port at all its just got very high hardware requirements and people expect too much out of their old rigs ive only played the game 13 hours so far a drop in the bucket considering how endless the game is but the adventures ive had already were so insane and numerous that i can barely recount them all spontaneous burt reynolds two wheeled flat spinning pistol blazing police chases rush hour fender benders that resulted in multiple hilarious vehicular manslaughters moody train rides across the countryside fistfights with angry winos giving anyone and everyone the finger the first jewely store heist that by itself makes payday 2 look like an insulting pile of crap and these are just the first few bites of a massive 27 course impeccably prepared banquet of video gaming destruction so many developers getting lazy and greedy these days but like elzar the neptunian master chef rockstar keep kicking it up another notch bam best 60 bucks ive ever spent on entertainment i will play this masterpiece 300 hours or more by next weekend truly goty and one of the best video games of all time for once you can believe the hype review system i2500k @ 4ghz asus strix gtx 980 @ 6040x1080 bezel corrected 16gb ddr3 1600 intel 730 ssd htomega striker 71 win7 x64  update 6182015 425 hours later ive beat the single player game and almost 100% it leveled up my online character to level 121 and i still love gta v to death sure rockstar has failed miserably to curb online hacking they dont listen to their own community their patches add very little the exclusive content they reserved for returning players is an insult and a slap in the face to those that have supported them for so long multiplayer is a buggy and hacker filled mess with far too little exclusive content the game itself still regularly freezes up on me for absolutely no reason at all and theyve been incredibly cynical about marketing their stupid cash cards that cost a fortune and add absolutely nothing to the game but gta v is still incredibly awesome you simply cant deny how awesome it is sorry cant be done best gta ever one of the best pc games ever the end
recommended
what a great sale
not recommended
dont buy this on the steam sale freaking rip off
not recommended
pretty damn good certain things in the story mode feel a little disjointed and there are some minor things about movement and aiming that feel off particularly in first person mode satirical elements already manage to feel dated so the humour isnt quite as onpoint as in previous titles despite whatever negatives exist its still a very enjoyable experience overall and gta online is a blast with friends
recommended
verry nice game jahno
recommended
if you do not play this game you cannot call yourself a gamer this game has brilliant graphics on the pc depending on your pcs specs the storyline is better than any gta storyline in gtas history in my opinion unlike other gta games almost everything in the game is interactive and everything in game is very realistic for example when you crash a car you actually take damage and sometimes your character flies out the front window if you harass a police officer then they will chase you also the police ai in this game are highly advanced they are very realistic and can actually bust you or kill you unlike other gta franchises i have a lot more to say about this game and the words would probably crash the steam server so ill stop here ps you get gta v online for free buy this game now oh and you can switch between 3 different people heheh @gtav

doesnt matter if the game is good or not when a company pulls a move like removing the base game and creating bundles at a discount just so they can appear on the front page of a sale and so that the game shows up as discounted on wishlists the game will get a 110 every single time luckily i am not the sort to boycott a game because of a developer but i regret every penny of my purchase that went to rockstar for pulling this move and to steam for allowing it do not buy this game
not recommended
good game shady company

i have nothing to say about this perfect game well optimized great environment atmosphere this game runs perfectly well on my gtx 880m i dont really encounter launch issue so i dont know why thats even possible and whats causing it ps dont be fooled by the review by the time of the writing its mostly positive [79%] grab it when you have money you wont regret it by paying the game for full price if you encounter any issue you can always ask the support guys whos much better than ea

grand theft auto v for the pc has proven to be amazing the visuals performance and the pc experience makes gta v shine brighter then it has on console of course with all good things there comes the bad in this case gta v suffers from players using trainers in online of course r bans them continually however the modding community is in jeopardy due to the misuse of modifications otherwise this game is an easy 1010 for me and i believe that you will enjoy this as much as i did

i told my friend back in 2013 that itd come out for pc almost two years later i was right 1010 would wait again

its been a while since ive been this enamoured with a game before the world is incredibly detailed the graphics are incredible and really well optimized its so far ahead of the console versions in every way the online is great especially if you have friends to play with the heist missions are a lot of fun and so are the online races the single player story is phenomenal i love all the characters and how dynamic it is that you can switch between them and see how their stories separate and join together again each mission including the nonstory missions feels like its own thing its not repeatitous like most sandbox game quests are the world is filled to the brim with random encounters that you can have with random people on the street and elsewhere the driving mechanics are solid planes and helicopters are easier to fly in my opinion but turbulence now exists in the game which can make things a bit trickier if you arent used to piloting in games the water physics is beautiful the world has so many different types of environments to it the world itself is absolutely huge the city alone is about the size of previous gta games let alone all the wilderness there is driving around is never boring no empty expanses like in san andreas my only complaints is that some of the rewards for missions are a little lacking it seems like its a lot more difficult to make money in this game most of the properties you can buy and businesses you can run cost more than youll ever get back unless you play for a particularly long time and most dont give you a lot of advantages the rewards for all the types of collectibles are pretty dull and uninteresting and dont really make going out to find them all worth it unless you like doing that sort of thing the onlinelobby session is poorly implemented in my opinion as its next to impossible to fill a lobby that isnt for anything other than a heist or a race unless you have friends around to play with you which makes a lot of fun game modes go unappreciated and unplayed quick job which immediately puts you in a lobby for a particular type of job helps a lot but sometimes it will land you in a lobby with someone playing their custom job which is being used to exploit for ingame bonuses and unlocks so you have to be careful with that besides that its an incredible game and if your system can handle it its pretty graphically intensive even on minimum settings i would definitely recommend getting it its worth every penny

beaten the game on the ps3 i got it again for the pc because of online contents playing alone is fun but playing with friends is better storywise michaels missions are the ones keeping me playing i like his role and his story gameplay better than the previous games except for the driving gta 4 is better graphics insanely great i love it controls get an antighosting keyboard unless if you are playing on a controller san andreas huge map i have explored most of the lands except for the seas underwater world is another different world to explore finally some background music in online what i found fun earning money for cars apartments etc leveling up character playing as female and play the dressingup game hey ive been looking at male clothes since gta vice city heists are extremely fun other game modes like deathmatch racing etc anything else i missed

the grand theft auto franchise has become a parody of itself and by extension rockstar with it this series of popular titles which now moves millions of units on console platforms once dominated as the premier actioncrime simulator of its time offering hours of entertaining gameplay with a tight wellcrafted interface in having moved into these new markets it has decayed into a clumsy thirdperson shooter which in trying to do many things does nothing well much of rockstars effort is spent producing an uninspired cinematic singleplayer experience which combines scripted sequences with high production values to run the player through a set of familiar combat scenarios which have been iterated many times already were this a title produced exclusively for pc while leaving the console ports as an afterthought inverting the current development priority held by the firm the title would be utterly unlike the current iteration and a far more rich and pleasurable experience for its audience it is encouraging that drunk on the hollow profits they farm from the console market rockstar has become blind to the greater opportunities that await the game studio which can better execute the raw formula being crushed beneath the heaving bulk of voice actors and motion capture that prevents grand theft auto v from becoming a great game creating an opportunity for ambitious developers to thrive in a proven market

hi guys im zalvager aka ibryan this is my review on behalf of the original traders group from me honestly this game was amazing on any console it is a beautifully made game and if you dont enjoy it something is wrong with you to start i thought the pc versions driving controls would be terrible i was all but right driving and shooting is absolutely beautiful and easier to do i understand the game had its bugs and is bad at times  not really  but when people actually complain that the game is depending when it comes to specs but honestly the video card and space on it is all you need to worry about most pcs are built to play the game if your having lag spikes then try messing around with the settings to check what your shadow quality grass quality etc this will effect your gaming depending on how your computer laptop works i honestly love the controls and gameplay in it i love the game and i think it is a better option then the consoles if you have a good pc the otp review 95

the worst of the series  the world is nice but its bland its missing all the nice touches from previous games cops are easy to evade by driving on railroads or heading to the beach you only see cops when youve killed a few folk  theyre never just wandering around the city missions are all the same drive from a to b kill someone at b escape on many of the missions theyre as shallow as drive from a to b and back to a without doing anything at all poor indeed [edit] have now finished the game so its held my attention to the end however the original comments still stand it really is quite bland and uncreative compared to previous releases

first of all this is a great game rockstar did a great job porting it to pc now as everybody else is saying  you rockstar this is some shady  i already owned the game but everything youve been doing with the preorders and the bonus cash pushing back the launch day and extending the cash preorder bonus everything youve been doing has been  me off lately this is the worst of it all though jacking up the price and cutting it down just so you appear to be on sale thats just too greedy for me not only is it greedy but its just stupid not participating in the summer sale wouldve been better for you
not recommended
would not recommend purchase of this game during sales
not recommended
shady practices
not recommended
i like this game very much and its pretty fun to play with friends but the multiplayer mode needs to be improved please allow mods to be used online in a different lobby just like in gta iv i also do not like how the price has been raised just before the summer sale thats just mean and greedy therefore i leave a negative review because this behavior should not be encouraged
not recommended
grand theft auto v for the pc has proven to be amazing the visuals performance and the pc experience makes gta v shine brighter then it has on console of course with all good things there comes the bad in this case gta v suffers from players using trainers in online of course r bans them continually however the modding community is in jeopardy due to the misuse of modifications otherwise this game is an easy 1010 for me and i believe that you will enjoy this as much as i did
recommended
constantly crashing every 3045 minutes unplayable
not recommended
i played this game on xbox 360 and i loved it i would have never thought it would have been released on pc  which to my surprise it was i was over joyed when i found out and as soon as it became available on steam i preordered it this game had definitely made a mark on the gaming community the graphics the story and the multiplayer are outstanding in there own respects the multiplayer has some issues of course such as repeated murder that occurs to the users online id have a group of 710 year olds chasing me from the north of los santos to the southern areas which are riddled with gang members drug dealers and the notorious grove street gang which we all know and love besides the repeated deaths by other players the multiplayer has grew on me its the most fun ive had with my friends from robbing banks to freeing prisoners i can assure you  youll have fun as long as you are gaming with your mates single player is probably the most amazing thing about gta v it features 3 main characters michael trevor and franklin witch you can switch to between missions and even in certain sections they have the most indepth back stories that ive ever seen in a video game and would highly recommend to go and explore all these characters graphics from gta iv and gta v have improved massively grass shadows and basic textures have improved along with the pc requirements which have allowed people with lower end pcs to play the game on decent fps and graphics allinall i would give my highest recommendation to go and play this game
recommended
amazing game nothing more really necessary to be said
recommended
illegal business going on here raising the price to put a discount on it is illegal in the eu have fun rockstar

excellent game by a stellar company rockstar doesnt cease to amaze
recommended
in my entire gaming history the grand theft auto series has always been a favorite of mine with the 5th installment coming to my favorite platform pc it has to be one of my top all time favorite video games i have ever played i truly applaud rockstar for making amazingmemorable characters and amazing experiences i only wish they did the same with red dead redemption oh how amazing that would be
recommended
gr8 i guess 
recommended
this game was perfectly ported to the pc the new graphics are quite an eye candy if your rig can take it it has a funny entertaining story great characters a huge city to explore and many side activities to try out the multiplayer had miner bugs here and there which can be fixed in time hands down the best gta experience 1010
recommended
single player is great so far from what ive been able to complete when i need to take a break from gta online the attention to detail put into the game world is impressive im kind of glad i didnt play the original versions on a console and held out for 2 years to have my first experience with the game as it was intended to be played on the other hand i feel that people who have proverbial dusty ps3 or 360 copies sitting on a shelf would definitely be able to appreciate the visual upgrade compared to the last time they remember playing i had an issue with my online account missing a vehicle and rockstar support was great in resolving it and compensating me so theyve earned my respect there as well online is pretty addicting but once youre high level theres really not a lot to do after you do all the heists twice you get sick of them pretty quick and they turn into a moneygrind more endgame content for people who already have the best properties and vehicles would be interesting to see the matchmaking system is still really bad though so try to play with friends
recommended
does this game really need someone to review it in order to convice you to buy it just get it already what are you looking at the reviews for ps the only thing that kind of bugs me are the car mechanics specifically the suspension when youre going at a reasonable speed and hit a curb the car jerks to ther height of teh curb which is exactly the opposite of what a car will actually do in real life at high speeds hitting a curb unless your suspension is super stiff and your ground clearance is slim to none the car wouldnt jerk upwards just the wheels would jerk upwards not the entire car and another side note why cant modern day game developers make the rim movement of cars realistic i mean i guess its to show off your rims at even high speeds but its really urealistic the only game i have seen personally that follows the actual light mechanics of moving wheels is midnight club  los angeles remix otherwise known as the psp version but thats not as much of a tick on my back as the suspension this is supposed to be a hyperrealistic game and fixing the suspension would be a huge improvement i still love this game years ahead of its time love it would recommend to anyone especially pc version because pcmasterrace thats why
recommended
this isnt even a review i just wanted to thank this man for gifting me this amazing game
recommended
listen i know that most of us waited a very very very very long time for this game and to be honest i just think rockstar were being gits half the time about it none of that matters now this game is definitely worth it i have been playing it since it came out and enjoyed every moment i have spent most of my time playing on the multiplayer where there is so much to do and mess around with even the golf is fun to do with friends i admit that the loading times are a bit annoying and quite a few people i play with and myself tend to get the odd random crash that comes out of nowhere for no reason i only started the single player the other day you do have to do the first 2 missions to get onto multiplayer tho sort of like an introduction tutorial and its amazing loads of missions and ways to do things the interactions are hilarious trevor is the guy he is what a gta player is all about just play this game to see trevor yea the game is still a little expensive but to be honest i think it is worth it but if you have to then wait till it is cheaper there is so much to do and loads i still dont know about the game but would recommend to anyone  if i was to ask trevor what he thought  trevor philips i dont know what youre talking about i dont agree with what youre saying youre talking  and youre trying to wind me up but im very very angry and i want this conversation to stop right away
recommended
once all the issues were fixed this game runs and plays beautifully the only issue is the ing hackers the ing hackers they dont let up you can be driving and bam there goes all your money and weapons be careful when in a lobby with someone acting suspicious i learned this the hardway unfortunately
recommended
awesome game no doubt worth the wait
recommended
if you have no weapons use the middle finger 1010 masterpiece
recommended
first of all i do like the game so why the thumbs down its overpriced for for a modcheat infested multiplayer you can only play multiplayer on a decent way with some friends in a private session i had hoped the update would change it but it didnt then you have the fact that steam made it even more expensive in summer sale which allowed them to give you a 25% discount and it came down to the same price it wasis not the first time i see steam do it i have no words for such malpractice
not recommended
i turned on gta online just to find out that their new update also took all the money out of my bank account i have been very unimpressed with this game for a while now but that is the last straw i didnt spend full price on this game but i am considering what i did spent to have been to much i have turned it on time and time again with the mindset of i bought it i might as well play it but at this point i refuse unistalling process initiated like everyone else is saying the game is okay it is a fun time with friends and to screw around in single player but the story is repetitive you can play for an hour and feel like you havent progressed at all some missions feel forced and sometimes dont make any sense and to me the whole story mode feels like it is stalling to make the game seem longer like missions where you drive a car for like 10 minutes to get to an objective why not put me closer to the objective i am all for realism but every mission online is boring because no one plays probably because no one likes to play as of now this is the last game of theirs i will play they go on the list of companies i have lost respect for cuddled up all nice and cozy with ubisoft
not recommended
dont buy it its trash little to no online support takes 20 minutes to connect hackers ruin everything in online mode by raining cash and freezing all rockstar transactions getting you banned forcfully if you have it for xbox360 or xbone play that instead the servers for pc and xbox are intrigrated you arnt missing out on anything

thank you rockstar the game is great and runs butter smooth so far bout ing time

as a returning player from ps3 i cant say enough how much this has improved i havent played gta since i sold my ps3 in dec 2013 and its like a completely new game first person is immersive and violent the pc allows for huge improvements in the way the game looks i know lots of people are having stability issues but as one of the lucky ones i say well done rockstar top work
recommended
i love this game it has a great story and fun multiplayer but rockstar doesnt seem to give a  about hackers completely ruining the online experience and banning innocent people
recommended
uninteresting story ok humor extremely easy killing dozens of people without breaking a sweat pointless online exploring is cool i guess and good graphics save your money though
not recommended
so even though i gave this game a rating does not mean that the game is bad just rockstar is bad the pc version is filled with hackers i see one every other lobby giving ilicit money which can trigger a ban or you can be put in a cheater pool and the worst part is rockstar doesnt bother to fix the problem instead they are finding new ways to find who has the ilicit money and to ban them now why this is such a problem is that if you get free money that would imply that instead of spending $80 on shark cards with the 8 million you get from them you can make in seconds just from hackers showering you in money bags which means less players will buy shark cars making them pointless and its a reacuring theme with rockstar that when people complain and say hackers give them money getting them banned rockstar acts like they care about what you have to say but they dont all they care about is their stupid shark cards but they try to hide that and say all they want is a clean game which isnt nessesary when no wheapons are more op than others and if thats the problem then dont complain about the free money complain about the verys small amount of xp drops but at the end of the day the game is great the city feels alive and the story is great i would recomend this game when rockstar pulls their  together
not recommended
game itself is a master piece and a prime example of pc>console but the ea tactics they pulled on the summer sale really pisses me off
not recommended
1110 its ok  ign
recommended
i hyped for the game a lot but i think it was a small disapointment so first the good sides of the game the gameplay was good i liked the driving a lot and also the games radio was really good i liked listening to it while driving the graphics look really good the online is really fun excpect its full of hackers right now and its really hard to get some good people to play with the online is really fun if you have 4 friends that own the game if you dont its pretty boring now the bad sides as you know the grand theft auto series is all about the singleplayer at least it was before but the singleplayer in this game is really bad the story is not interesting at all and the charaters were quite boring i have enjoyed all the previous grand theft auto games but i cant say the same from this game i wasted 60 euros  and i cant get refunds from this game because i have played too much of it the online missions are also pretty boring because their just go there shoot those guys and you get some money and the game comes with extra money for online and because of that the online is boring because you dont even have to work for the money well i would rate this game 610
not recommended
love this game
recommended
its gta why wouldnt i recommend this
recommended
1010 would buy it again for the third time
recommended
my computer sucks so i cannot play it  im sure its fun though
recommended
was gta v worth this long wait it is a fantastic done port much better optimized than gta iv ever was dont bother with the first person view as it cuts off about 40% of your screen rockstar has provided a lot of graphical customizations to let you get those 60fps depending on your pc hardware its always good to check your settings with the provided benchmark the grass and vegetation options on pc put the console peasants to shame the pc port is highly detailed compared to lastgen and currentgen consoles the radio station is mediocre at best gta iv and san andreas radio was better i suggest using your own mp3s and making your own playlist addition of new weapons vehicles and easter eggs throughout the game make a very nice and exciting gameplay you can customize your weapons and vehicles to your liking there are a lot of options nothing like driving a sweet ride and listening to some tunes i consider it to be one the best looking open world games which will continue to get better with modding community on pc
recommended
what you waiting for  buy it like you do because this game is the perfectly game in the whole 10 yrs i think this game should be the game of the year 2015  if you like openworld game juz buy this game if you buy this game youll get a lot of funa lot of friends and a lot of happiness that you cant find in another openworld gamein my opinionthis game story mode is like hollywoodheist movie and this game also have gta online the nicest mode in the whole world you will meet many friends like what im talking about that  juz buy this game for support rockstar game to make gta vi  point 1010  all hail to gta v  what i talking about is only my opinion
recommended
great game made my character look like a gay designer 1010
recommended
gta business as usual if you play the story mode online mode is somewhat not playable due to the horrendous amount of hackers who dont seem to get banned

the game would is okay but the customer support treats us like thieves bundling the game just so it can participate on the steam summer sale and so making it not refundable here is my minlist gta v ril summer sale     cons no hacker eradication effort long loading times devs are jews online is too grindy some singleplayer missions feel uneeded this game scarred my toughts of rockstar being a great devpublisher after all they also ruined san andreas pros multiplayer is fun for a short period good graphics and good feel to the guns quite big open world what i think  i think gta v is not worth buying for 60 euros after all i dont think buying it just for the multiplayer is fun because of the hackers and grindy feel to it  the main campaing is okay nonetheless for me gta v is extremely overrated and even though the game is okay the devs should feel ashamed and do try not to make the same mistakes they have caused i]

gta 5 is really good as a base game and if youre planning to pick up the game just for what it is id say its well worth it we all know gta 5 is a great game on its own however if you plan to pick up gta 5 for modding id recommend not picking it up just yet for a few reasons 1 the games mod library is still developing theres not a crazy amount of mods available for the game at the moment and theres rarely any super amazing high quality mods out their either 2 the game is patched often moreso than other gta titles this is something i dont hear being often talked about but at least in gta 4 patches used to break lots of mods however with gta 4 the game only received like about 7 patches on the pc version gta 5 on the other hand currently seems to be one of rockstars more active projects for that reason it seems like itll be patched more often until theyre done with it thus making more mods unstable or not working as the game patches 3 rockstars current action on modders people reporting that theyve been banned for using single player mods and all that while they deliberately stated that they do not care about single player modders people have been reported about being banned just for using single player mods i personally can not talk about this for much as i have not seen proof or had this happen to me id be weary about this though if you still really want to play the game and mod it go for it if the mods are more than cosmetic please dont go online and please dont be that guy who attempts to bring the trainer into online lobbies tldr if youve been waiting for the base game to release on the pc buy it if you want mods you might want to consider waiting
recommended
my friend gifted it to me  and im so thankful to him and rockstar for making this dream come true been waiting for this game since 2011 been through all the delays patiently but after finally getting this game id say 1010 would wait again for a game like this pros hours of fun range of graphical optionssettings good optimization lots of fun activities golf swimming tennis strip clubsscuba diving huge friggin map to explore strangers freaks cults and much more great humor great story missions & characters in story mode really fun to hang out or play with friends in gta online cons needs a patch to improve performance latest patch is making the game stutter while driving when logged into social club  if you use offline mode runs fine as wine so it still needs a patch as this game has potential to run even better
recommended
after the release of grand theft auto v for lastgen consoles on 2013 and later for currentgen consolesthe pc version was the finishing touch in my opinionand there is still more content to come pros great campaign 3 characters for the campaign awesome graphics especially on the pc version many things to do on multiplayer hours of playtimeboth on singleplayer and multiplayer cons minor bugs and glitches many hackerscheaters & modders on multiplayer the storyline gets confusing sometimes maybe im stupid paying real money for in game money is a bit oddisnt it gta v is a musthave gameespecially if you like highend lifesarguements between the characterspsychoskillersdo i have to go on

instead of working on fixing the issues present rockstar started a greedy corporate rampage issues present  online lobbies are highly unstable  i could link the 4 a4 page long chat of mine with their support through which they presented clearly they wish to  into our facescopy paste answers giving information about things i have stated to them myself hackers populate most of the lobbies while people legitly blowing up cars are put in bad sport lobbies where they could only join other bad sports ui is broken and nonnavigatable instead of fixing these crucial issues what they did is release a patch clearly about recycling old content and re selling it with a 10m price tag and a golden plating which only hackers and the ones willing to pay 75$ for 9m ingame cash could buy and then putting up it on steam sale for its original price by raising the original price to 8499 and then applying a discount on that with a shark cash cardpure  move not to mention u could buy a physical copy starting at around 40$ is wonderful tho but couldnt put away these bad feelings

this game is worth the $60 it might of taken 2 years but in the end it was all worth it if you played this on counsil or you like the old games gta 3 gta san gta vice gta 4 i would highly recomend if you have a realy good computer you will love to graphics60 fps if you have a lower computer dont worry the game is realy well optimized hope this helped
recommended
great game everyone knows this single player is 1010 the problem comes with online first the lag and bugs were common then came the cheaters that were so many that i stopped playing now finally rockstar is not even updating the game anymore and the last addition to online was just a repaint pack while the cheaters kept ruining the game play single player skip online for a while

after playing this on xbox twice it dosent have much to offer but mods which mostly all contain viruses and mailware

[edit] turns out they were banning people who left dllinjectors enabled while playing online im still going to leave my review as such until they have a message displayed before going online if mods are dectected stating something like user mods have been detected make sure to disable these mods before playing online or you will risk being banned from the online section of gta v it was always going to be such a modheavy game so they should have realised that people are going to make mistakes by leaving their playasachicken mod enabled without realsing that it would get them banned online and would need a friendly reminder to disable them the game itself is fantastic well optimised and even runs great on pcs that are a getting old and creaky however rockstar have recently changed the eula and stated that the game is not to be modded at any kind of level be it a small graphical improvement or a game changing mod and that anyone caught will be banned this is an outright middle finger to anyone who held out for gta v for pc because of mods and lets watch them change the eula yet again to allow mods once steam have the paid mod system in place disgusting company with disgusting practices who clearly have no regard to their paying customers

the game crashes and crashes and crashes randomly 5 minutes after everytime i startup the story mode boom ive tried all the methods i could find from the internet and nothing helps maybe im not qualified to enjoy this masterpiece all i want for now is a refund

fantastic graphics runs really smoothly and has a amazing script the story line had me drooling for more multiplayer is superb and a must the public mindlessly find you whilst you are attempting to do something rather important and you suddenly notice a car swerving madly behind you and a red pulsating light on the side of your car boom who could ask for a better community developers are constantly updating the game and the features amaze me you can buy a  buy their servicesthen kill them for your money backand even get a bit of profit game of the year

grand theft auto are one of my favourite game series gta v is the best gta game after san andreas which i loved due to it being my childhood game and being the game to bring new things that year and with a huge map and possibilities i have played this game both on xbox360 and pc its amazing the storyline is amazing the graphics are great the pc port is awesome works smoother than on x360 comparing to gta ivs port which was  on pc very bad performance issues the online is great as long as you dont play to grind it and have some friends to play it anyways the pc version > console is that theres some new features and the files were already opened and modding should be available soon thus we will see some good mods with no doubt truly a game of the year for 2015 too

no  the pc version is definitely better than the console version ive experienced the fun better community and communication which the console will never allowed me to although i owned a copy of ps3 version and played countless of timesbut the pc version is able to delivers me a whole new kind of experience which im surprised the moral of the story is never get a console copy of a grand theft auto game the console players are just served as beta testers for the final gamepc

great game everyone knows this single player is 1010 the problem comes with online first the lag and bugs were common then came the cheaters that were so many that i stopped playing now finally rockstar is not even updating the game anymore and the last addition to online was just a repaint pack while the cheaters kept ruining the game play single player skip online for a while

my favorite pc game ever i initially heard about gta v when rooster teeth did their lets play series on gta ever since i bought it ive been playing quite a bit when i cani say its worth full price and its not as heavy as you people would think the reccomended settings are a bitoff i say the settings reccomended are a bit higher than they are because i can run gta on several computers each of low power excluding desktop by far the biggest openworld game that i can really get intogo buy it 3

garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
i waited a year for gta v spent 60$ and then got banned for using mods in singleplayer  you rockstar  you

i never played gta v before it came out for pc because i didnt feel like buying it for my consoles and i have to say i enjoyed this game there are a lot of small details about this that work together to bring out a great game only issue i have is if you shoot sombody out in the middle of nowhere cops will somehow find you in a matter of 30 seconds but i got plenty of grenades so its alright 45
recommended
an insanely good game the story is impeccable as it is entwined with 3 different you can play as you progress through the game make them look how you want and do what you want progress through the story in any degree of depth and you will definitely enjoy it its got the classic features you expect from the modern gta games the ability to go on an endless siren filled rampage to the ability to do a triathalon that is 30 rl minutes long gta online is where i spend most of my time however as it opens the game to a 4th character you you enter los santos the games main city and progress as a master criminal completeing missions and heists and looking away from explosions beware the trolls\hackers though they tend to just kill you mercilessly to enlarge their epeen dont fret just go passive mode you can ignore it or find a new sessions for you and your pals if you want to completely lock out anyone from your session except your mates you can just start a private session from the single player side of the game its an amazing game that gets content updates every so often that are quite in depth especially the heist update heavily delayed but ultimately worth it much like gtav on pc i definitely recommend it everyone who likes the gta style of gaming

this is my favorite game of this gen and last the singleplayer is god tier if your into amazing action and good writing the characters are interesting and have their own issues and conflicts i would give the singleplayer an 910 the multiplayer is my all time favorite multiplayer the multiplayers only issue is the grind to get money and microtransactions there are quite a few moddersscripters they are not a big issue do to most of them being friendly and just screwing around not doing harm to other players and a lot of times they make the game even more fun because this game does start getting stale after a while so the moddersscripters makes it just a lot more interesting and fun all in all i reccomend this game to everyone and anyone 910

good game but we need update property more then 3 also new heist update i hope rockstar will be update soon thank you
recommended
honestly this game isnt enjoyable unless you play online but of course the hackers so you can only play in private games with friends another thing is the cost of the game now and not being able to refund it although i purchased the game before the bundle i still do not think it is worth the extra money and $60 value i have more fun playing freetoplay games like team fortress 2 league of legends and osu this game i would not give anything above an 810 and btw the games new firstperson sucks cause the screen is to zoomed in to see cars or people close by that may hit you that happened to me lol xd btw rockstar learn to add some fun commands in the console controls or game modes or something where you can do crazy stuff like in saints row cause i mean theirs nothing to do after like an hour playing online for gta 5 was improved since its release for the xbox 360 and ps3 but the hackers trolls campers and squeakers just ruin the damn game i mean its worse then rito servers graphics 9310 atmoshpere 910 storyline 810 online 410 bundle for sale 110 give people their money back overall enjoyement 510

gta v is really a good game it definitely lives up to the hype and was worth the wait the pc port is really incredible with such incredible attention to detail such as the clothing of the main characters creasing as you walk which blows my mind the singleplayer really amazing gameplay wise and story wise the online is also a blast with friends or just by yourself at the moment rockstar has a very silly anticheat which essentially allows the cheaters to play with other cheaters hopefully this will change but for the moment if you plan on playing online id hold off for a while however if you plan to play singleplayer it is worth your money there is also a huge modding community which adds even more content

if your buying it for singleplayer then dont heres why 1 singleplayer feels totally unfinished because of rockstar dedicating so much time to online 2 although the game advertises a huge environment with unlimited things to do what they meant to say was there was a boring city with a mediocre amount of things to do oh and also there is sort of an environment that you can just walk around in if you want 3 once you finish the main storyline there is barely anything to do unless you like doing the same thing over and over again then youll quickly lose interest in the side activities 4 half of the promises for singleplayer were not kept no real estate no seamless switching of characters no fun if your buying it for online then dont heres why 1 the economy of gta online is completely ruined you have three options a play normallymake no moneydont have fun b exploitcheatmake alot of moneyhave fun cspend irl money on sharkcardsmake no moneylose real moneylose your home and family 2 the community is  the only thing anybody does is either ascrew about in freeroamboring bplay heistsracescontact missions the hilarious part of this is that both heists races and contact missions get incredibly repetitive after the second time you play them so unless you like same thing over and over again then your out of luck bub in conclusion never make an online game ever again rockstar  you sincerely people that arent 10

if your buying this game for online dont bother the first 10 mins of playin with my friends is to get a trainer and set your self to level 50 because the game is a giant grind fetch questand its suffering from freezesdisconnects and hackers heist painfully annoying with strangersand once you beat the heist and have unlocked everything theres nothing left to dosave your money on somthing better this is not worth 80 dollars youll reget buying this

the next genredefining installment in the grand theft auto franchise grand theft auto v straddles the line between familiarity towards the 3d and hd generations of the franchise and throws in some brandnew mechanics for good measure launchperformance yes this is a category now i guess welcome to modern gaming the game was delayed for months after the launch of the console nextgen version itself over a year after the original games launch on seventhgeneration consoles xbox 360 and ps3 the pc version as opposed to the state of gta iv both on launch and throughout its lifespan is waaaaaaay better optimized on launch day the online servers were running pretty much as well as they are now with the exception of a couple of lost connections to servers for scorekeeping and maybe one ctd crash to desktop that said two gamebreaking launch bugs on specific missions in story mode forced me to creatively use checkpointsmissionskipping to get through the campaign im sure this must be fixed by now though i was somehow able to get the game running at mediumhigh settings at 1080p with an i73770k 16gb ram and nvidia gtx 660 ti power edition from msi at 40fps originally then tweaking the game towards more medium settings i was able to get it running steadily over 60fps nowadays probably since a title update the game runs way lower for me around 3040ish fps on mediummediumlow settings when slightly overclocked theres an occasional framerate spike every 20 minutes or so where it straightup hits 60 fps for about 5 seconds and then drops down to normal so i know it can run better but its a mystery as to whats going on although this may be due to a number of reasons which include my pc build reaching the twoyear mark where my windows 7 installation and secondary hard drive are both kind of cluttered im sure rockstar probably also is optimizing a patch or two after title updates of which one just came out so the entire experience is somewhat fluid at the moment its very smooth overall and the stability of the game for me is on par with latelifespan gta iv with a higher graphical fidelity and way less stutter story avoiding spoilers i enjoyed it although im confused as to whether i thought it was too short compared to that of previous entries or if im not used to the games pacing it went quickly which may be a good sign of how much i enjoyed it its not without flaws  the usual rockstar brand of satires here which some people love some people hate with the increased fidelity given to the world though it reaches further extremes than i thought possible and im not entirely sure it feels exactly like every previous gta game this could be for good or bad reasons the characters were less likeable than previous ones i believe again due to the approaching uncanny valley of the satire rs been going for for the past almosttwenty years overall the game was more lighthearted than gta iv but more cynical and not as madcap as in san andreas and earlier so its a bit of an outlier graphics well many have considered this the swan song of the seventh console generation and they might be right the graphical fidelity in gta v set new heights not only for the franchise but for arguably all openworld games before it there are games out there which beat this one in terms of absolute graffix but rockstars attention to detail in recreating los santos is readily apparent at any resolution with any graphics settings and it absolutely helps keep the game which is otherwise somewhat repetitive from moment to moment as someone whos played almost every game in the franchise as fresh as possible plus theres actually some color in this one at launch map design this fits in with the last criterion but overall the map is massive in both detail and sheer size on top of this rockstar seemed to pull almost every sidemission activity or variant of same theyve ever done and cram it into the map as one kind of facility or other the main jarring omissions are pay & sprays car washes restaurants with interiors and casinos pay & sprays have been replaced with ls customs repaircustomization garages strewn across the map and the latter three are physically ingame just not implemented as something you can interact with i believe overall newls map size was officially considered to be roughly equivalent to that of gta iv rdr and san andreas combined with some square footage to spare multiplayer as enjoyable as gta ivs multiplayer modes could be they were vestigial at best i suspect tacked onto the story mode at a time when microsoft was really pushing for everything to be on xbox live could be wrong on the motivation there as a result only three missions were available for players to get involved with and this never changed throughout the games lifespan hey it couldve been worse  in san andreas the only thing resembling multiplayer was a twoplayer recreation of the classic rampage mode and freeroam in v well rockstar must have been paying attention to the massive upswing of multiplayers popularity since 2008 since they effectively made a standalone title out of the online mode this time around your custom character basically flies into los santos in a stylish prologue reminiscent of both san andreas and vice city stories introductions and are herded together with a whole slew of other likeminded criminal tourists like yourself into a crash course introduction to what is essentially freemode with a campaign and side missions attached to it it works surprisingly well considering what it is and rockstar has regularly added dozens of vehicles outfits and firearms to onlines and the base games lineup of collectible stuff in the end its not perfect by any means  just like in iv vs multiplayer is riddled with hacking idiots and general online shooter chaos and outside of mission grinding and the occasionallysuccessful heist rockstar effectively locked the most substantial content ie properties expensive vehicles etc behind microtransactions you technically can go through online without spending more than the 60 dollars the entire game cost on launch but expect to spend a ton of time making money to do the majority of what there is to do in the game again doing this isnt all that terrible either onlines missions on launch were somewhat limited but a content editor machinima mode and the quality of the worlds design itself give plenty of opportunities for players to either have fun grinding missions for cash or to just goof off either by themselves or with anyone else on a server of which there can be a couple dozen people more or less overall i think gta vs got plenty of room for expansion with campaign and online mode dlc but its been a thoroughly enjoyable experience and id be quite prepared to say its got greater replay value than gta iv and perhaps some of the 3dera games as well its worth the price if you can spare the sheer amount of time necessary to max it out

this is the best gta by far yet i love it and it is actually a good port unlike gta iv was the graphics are really good and teh gameplay itself is great it has a really good storyline but who plays gta for the story anyway if you plan on playing this game on the highest settings possible make sure you have a gpu with more than 2gb of video memory i would reccommend a cards with 3gb like some of the amd cards or more my gtx 960 was running out of memoryat the highest settings i still get a solid 60 fps with a few dips here and there but i would reccomond more video buffer just a forewarning 1010

i bought this game for the 2nd time 1st when it released on ps3 and now on pc its a pearl of a game worth playing for a 2nd time in high resolution  detail settings the single player is just great and i love playing it for a 2nd time in 1st person it feels like a different game being able to use my ps3 controller with a program that emulates a xbox controller with it for cars helis and planes while being able to use mouse and keyboard for running and shooting is just the best of two worlds together from what i see most negative reviews are about the price of the game during sale and not about the game itself i did not mind paying full price for it a 2nd time because its one of the best games in its genre ever if not the best in my opinion so for me it was definitely worth it the multiplayer can be great if you have friends to play it with from what i have seen nearly every busy lobby has at least a moddercheaterhacker in it ruining the game experience for others ive seen modders insta kill entire lobbies in name of legit players sometimes using god mode teleport and you name it it does not seem like rockstar has this problem under control in any way which is a shame modders are killing the online community for legit players at this moment i will change this review when i will see a change in that which i highly doubt though so yes i would recommend this game for the sp and for the mp if you have friends to play it with the heists contact missions races etc are just fun it is definitely the best gta ever edit the amount of modders in multiplayer is just getting worse and worse
recommended
so had to delete my old review opinons have changed singleplayer still amazing fun and amusing also mods now you beat sp and want to play online at first it was incredibly fun however rockstar doesnt seem to give two  about the game atm mods are getting you banned so you have to deinstall all the mods before entering an online session but the hackers just are present in every session i come into not even amusing how they change my model into a toiler cow buggati ufo and  up my fun they enjoy spawning where i spawn and insta rek me aswell some of them even destory the fun of making money and give you millions in conclusion singleplayer amazing online unplayable for the time being

i can easily say grand theft auto v is a masterpiece of a game the story is interesting and long took me about 40 hours to complete including interesting side missions the characters are well written and most if not all missions are fun there is so much stuff to do in this game im not even done yet just buy it rockstar listened to us and stopped being greedy so the price came back to its original as for online i have very very mixed feelings about it form what ive seen its bad hackers everywhere and modders giving everyone money and killing everyone literally ruining the game but i must admit it can be fun to play with friends and id play it if you have people to play it with otherwise i dont recommend it
recommended
i liked this game a lot more than gta4 the port was better than the previous installation in the series which made it worth the wait the singleplayer was made 10x better by making it a series of american characters rather than some boring poor english russian or whatever eastern european hell hole in one of the iest cities on earth the multiplayer seemed intriguing as i know many people with many hours in it but it was not for me and didnt deprive the other content of the game if you can find a copy of the game without stupid shark cash card  attached to it to raise its price its worth your time
recommended
loading the video game loading the video game is a thrilling openworld action game which consists of a white circle in the bottomright corner of a page turning in an anticlockwise manner with the word loading to its left to accompany the exhilirating turning circle there either is a series of photos of mysterious unnamed people including a woman in a red bikini and a man with bulletproof vest under a twopiece suit or a birds eye view of a illuminated city the only the negative factor about this game is the advertising for grand theft auto v as it states in the bottomleft corner of the screen despite this loading the video game is a heartracing nonstop action piece of art that can be appreciated by anyone anywhere great plot with plenty of depth astonishing graphics great gameplay mechanics expansive openworld provides a nevergetbored feeling 1010 would recommend

an insanely good game the story is impeccable as it is entwined with 3 different you can play as you progress through the game make them look how you want and do what you want progress through the story in any degree of depth and you will definitely enjoy it its got the classic features you expect from the modern gta games the ability to go on an endless siren filled rampage to the ability to do a triathalon that is 30 rl minutes long gta online is where i spend most of my time however as it opens the game to a 4th character you you enter los santos the games main city and progress as a master criminal completeing missions and heists and looking away from explosions beware the trolls\hackers though they tend to just kill you mercilessly to enlarge their epeen dont fret just go passive mode you can ignore it or find a new sessions for you and your pals if you want to completely lock out anyone from your session except your mates you can just start a private session from the single player side of the game its an amazing game that gets content updates every so often that are quite in depth especially the heist update heavily delayed but ultimately worth it much like gtav on pc i definitely recommend it everyone who likes the gta style of gaming

log into gta online  someone places a 9000 bounty on my head next thing i know the entire server is after me 1010 would kill them all again one man army

the game still crashes on regular bases and that several month after the release in case you think its because of my hardware i got a i7 core  a nvidia 970 and 16gb ram so more than enough to run this game properly this review will exist as long as this issue is there

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
gta v truly is an incredible game and runs pretty well with everything maxed out r obviously went out of their way to provide something comfortably playable on the pc for once however it seems thats when their generosity ends as if you read most of the negative reviews it would appear that r are banning people for modding even in single player how petty and cynical of you r im lucky in that i saw the reviews before considering modding but it gets a thumbs down from me on principle i cannot with good conscience recommend this game to anyone

finally after completing the game on ps3 and xbox360 i can finally complete it on pc ive always been a fan of the gta games this easly my favorite one gta v on pc the graphics are just fantastic i mean the difference between ps3x360 and pc are huge you can even see big differences between the ps4xone and the pc depending on your computer specs ofc the cars the environment the streets the characters the infrastructure i love it i also like that we have some more features on the pc than on the ps3 for example rockstar editor i havent tried it fully yet so i cant leave a complete review but ive seen what it can accomplish and its simply amazing i can also feel that the cars are more realistic to steer on pc than on consoles i like that too rockstar have made a great job and its been worth it to wait this time i hope that many people will buy this game including my friend because id love to play with you all if you are into gta v online  join my steam crew httpsteamcommunitycomgroupsgtav4l i hope that you learn something from this review thanks for reading

arguably the best pc port rockstar has done it runs surprisingly well and im on a laptop occasional frame drops during cut scenes but other than that mostly smooth frame rate driving with a mouse and keyboard feels fine and somewhat weighted minus sports cars gamepad recommended for aircraft the fov for fps mode requires a gander at but i wouldnt recommend it if you are susceptible to nausea or motion sickness overall a solid port minus low res textures during fps mode this is arguably the best in the franchise
recommended
gtav is one of the best games i have ever played launch issues have been fixed for me in a recent patch runs incredibly well on my gtx 870m this game is a mustplay
recommended
enjoyed the ability to transition my ps3 game to pc
recommended
essentially improves everything gta iv failed at with much more content and updated graphics gameplay mechanics and a huge story
recommended
grand theft auto 5 this game is the most hyped game of 2015 and with good reason take everything you knew from gta5 on consoles then inject it with shark testosterone and slap on 60 fps and you got yourself a car racing bank robbing people shooting rage boner however if you want this game to run make sure you do the following  install the latest drivers for your graphics card im not ing around about that  make sure you have a rockstar social account  make sure that you have enough ram 8gb is reccomended by everyone  finally make sure you have a decent cpu  i have a intel i5 4690k and its at 100% cpu usage most times have fun
recommended
great optimizision very additctive with execellent soundtrack
recommended
best pc gta ever but really this game looks absolute stunning and runs well even on non top end hardware im running a gtx770 and even with the game telling me that its using 2500 out of my 2048mb vram it runs fantastically smooth gameplay with mouse and keyboard is working flawlessly aswell story is very well done and the singleplayer has a high replay value online is just a joy to play  when the servers workbut i only had 1 disconnect so far id advise everyone that likes action games to buy this amazing piece of software 1010 recommended

if youve played grand theft auto v on consoles then you wont be disappointed if you havent youre in luck because this is indeed the definitive version in my opinion rockstar have done a wonderful job developing the game for pc it was well worth the wait the amount of graphical options means you can tweak the game to how you like it especially if youre limited by hardware the addition of the rockstar editor is just the icing on the cake the best part is no matter how high or low your settings are the game still manages to look impressive you may not be pleased with the price point due to when the game was released but think of it as a brand new game being released in 2015 because its that good it is one of the greatest games ever made
recommended
the gameplay is fine its nothing special and nowhere near best game ever level but its fun and works well the plot is ok too although not the best ive ever seen for a port if its a port rockstar claims it isnt its optimized pretty well some people have problems and there are some bugsglitchesbad things that will have to be fixed in the future but nothing is really bad and worrysome its not the best optimized game ever but its great if you compare it to the  weve been getting in the last year game is pretty solid doesnt really shine out in any way but everything works and its entertaining its nice to see a working game get released for once again

there are times when i look at los santos and think why would you even think to build that this is appropriately a thought that i often have about los angeles in gta 5s case the tone is different baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled yknow despair rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit i look at it and i wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so i marvel at the care evident in san andreas gorgeous sunsets in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world in the artfullychosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience everything about los santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years the abiding irony of grand theft auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in los santos hates it there this is the most beautiful expansive and generous gta game and also by some distance the nastiest and most nihilistic rockstar went through a phase in bully grand theft auto iv and the sadly consolebound red dead redemption of framing their protagonists as antiheroes gta 4s niko bellic did some terrible things but he had a downtrodden charm that helped you like him as you piloted him through the underworld he was surrounded by people who were largerthanlife but ultimately beneath the surface people among those people were some of rockstars better female characterskate mcreary mallorie bardas the lost and damneds ash butler gta v argument grand theft auto 5 does away with all of that deliberately but to its detriment its trio of protagonists occupy a city full of vapid twodimensional caricatures and they flirt with that boundary themselves michael is a middleaged former bankrobber unhappily married and on the edge of a breakdown franklin is a young hood purportedly principled but willing to do almost anything for money trevor is a desertdwelling methdealing psychopath with a homebrew morality that sits uneasily alongside his capacity for violent cruelty and sexual aggression the campaign explores their relationship through a series of heists and misadventures as they clash with every la stereotype you might imaginethe bored beverly hills housewife the corrupt fed the bottomrung fraudster the smug technology exec and so on against this backdrop its only michael franklin and trevor that appear to have any kind of internal life i get the impression that this is deliberate part of the games relentless skewering of southern california and indicative of rockstars waning interest in romantic antiheroes trevors introduction in particular amounts to a particularly explicit  you to the characters and themes of grand theft auto iv gta 5 is heartless in that way and as a result i found the narrative difficult to care about it is ambitious wellperformed and the production values are extraordinarybut it is also derivative and brutishly adolescent set in a world where the line between criminality and the rule of law is blurry but where it is always hilarious that somebody might be gay gta v chinatown its an rrated episode of the ateam where the a stands for  the campaigns best moments come when your cigarchomping master strategist insane former military pilot and talented driver come together and when youre given the power to choose how to use each of them these heists are setpiece missions where you pick an approach and perform setup tasks in the open world before setting out on the job itself in the best of them which occur later in the campaign it really does evoke the satisfaction of having a plan come together perhaps you position trevor on the highground with a rocket launcher michael on foot with a stealth approach and franklin in an armoured ramraider with a button press you can flick between the three dynamically orchestrating a crime caper on your own terms it is also in these moments that rockstars most ambitious storytelling takes place your choice of character crew and even certain ingame actions have subtle effects on the dialogue in an early heist a crewmember dropped part of the score but as franklin i was able to retrieve ita sideobjective that id set for myself but that was subsequently reflected in a later conversation between him and michael this is another example of rockstars extraordinary attention to detail and if the rest of the campaign respected your agency in this way it might overcome its weaker moments gta v plane chase as it is this is a very long game with a lot of filler theres much driving from a to b a lot of conversations in cars a lot of gunfights with hordes of goons who show up just to run into your gunsights over and over its far richer in setpiece moments than its predecessordrug trips aerial heists dramatic chasesand many of these look incredible even if theyre light on actual interaction in the best examples you soak in the atmosphere and happily ignore the fact that youre only really being asked to follow the onscreen instructions in the worst examplesinstafail stealth sequences sniper missions and so onits harder to ignore the shackles that are placed on the player in order to preserve the games cinematic look and feel i spent a lot of my time with the campaign frustrated along these lines bored of the same mission templates that ive been playing through since gta iii and making the most of the scant opportunities to play my own way like franklins refreshingly open assassination missions then inevitably id be doing one of those rote activitiesa heavily scripted freeway chase perhapswhen the magic of that extraordinary world would creep up on me again itd hit me im doing 150 kmh along the pacific coast highway at sunset the rock station is playing 30 days in the hole by humble pie it feels incredible a collision of popculture atmosphere music and play that is unique to gta

ok game multiplayer is well interesting i understand its a game of run and gun other players but considering it punishes you for killing in free mode by reducing your sanity rating doesnt make sense as nearly everyone acts like jerks because they can and its part of the game dont get me started with the hackers spawning anything and everything including tons of cash just join an online session look for player activity on the map that looks out of place generally player activity at the airport if none jump to another random session almost guarenteed to find one lobby with hackers at any time of the day todays discount is technically a discount as basically youre getting 125mill online cash for free when buying the game at full price so if you missed out on the preorder benifits nows the time otherwise look for hackers and grab a few more million in a few minutes of searching and chasing

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9lztuvzhlse just like most people on the planet i really like gta 5 and not only because it happens to be an incredibly fun video game no grand theft auto 5 is more than that it is a game which creates a huge expansive open world for the player to explore a game that is both funny enjoyable and excruciatingly brutal a game which manages to be an amazingly entertaining parody of not only other games but also movies consumerism social media conflicting ideologies government and much more grand theft auto 5 is not just a video game no this is the single greatest parody of modern day america found within the interactive medium and as of now it is finally available in its most definitive form my original written review is apparently too long for steam so here is a breakdown huge beautiful open world first person mode adds to the immersion generally good pc port superb missions brilliant satirical humour the world is your playground enormous amount of content simply put its really fg fun online bugs and glitches no proximity voice chat long loading times narrow fov also rockstar seems to ban people using fov mods

dont listen to the people who say that you can get banned for modding in single player you cannot get banned for modding in single player the people who say they got banned are lying  here is a quote from rockstars website this was not intentional no one has been banned for using single player modifications and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player pc mods our primary focus is on protecting gta online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage disrupt gameplay or cause griefing  rockstar may 8 or 7 2015 this is an awesome game there are so many mods coming out for it like even player dedicated servers the only thing i dont like about this game is how gta onlines networking works its p2p peertopeer this makes cheating way easier and i wished r had gone the dedicated server route i have not come across any hackers as of today you may encounter a hacker every lobby i have never personally seen one i only saw two back in the x360 version of the game i would give gta v a 1010 gta online would be a 810 go buy it now

absolutely fantastic work by rockstar completely justifies the 2 year wait for pc optimization is amazingly well done fps doesnt ever drop under 50 on highvery high set up  aa 16msa etc on a i5 2nd gen & gtx 760 2gb ram port is also very smooth aiming is great and fluid and so is driving do i need to say more

130 hours and im ready to write a review this will be short and sweet pros beautiful visuals probably the best in a video game to date imo amazing singleplayer storytelling fun and well developed gunplay online lots of activities to participate in online very very well optimized great vehicle customization and vehicle options driving is far superior to gta ivs planes helicopters jet skis boats and more singleplayer characters are interesting and always fun to play as  be around multiplayer heists are tons of fun with friends huge map jam packed with content to explore huge amount of settings for you to customize to your playstyle first person mode although the fov is a bit restricted lots of things online for you to progress towards and unlockbuy cons loading screens can be extremely long and extremely annoying at times character customization is not all too stellar needs to be some sort of lobby system where you can join a game with friends all at once needs better way to locate friends on the map can be really difficult to populate a large lobby online after 130 hours i am starting to burn out but only when playing by myself not necessarily a con i suppose 130 hours is quite a bit occassional online desyncs all in all great game and i do reccommend it id rate it 95100 and the best game ive played in the last 2 years it seems like i have a lot of cons but its really just nitpicky stuff and the only bad things i could think of there are so many more pros that i just cant keep listing the game is crazy fun has tons of content is gorgeous and will run across a lot of different grades of pcs

its fun but the hackers ruin the game completely i am in the process of returning the game until they fix this issue

this game is awesome pretty fun and much stuff to do gta online is kinda more interesting to me atleast for now since im still new and i didnt explore everything but i hope this game will not get boring soon totally worth the price
recommended
this is a really good game you should buy it i was gonna end the review here but nah ill write more its crazy fun it looks great mods i bought it even though i had it on ps3 once and heres what i say its so much more fun so if youre willing to spend the money if you already had gta 5 on consoles i say get it its so much more fun several missions are easier aiming is easier and more fun using the ingame internetcomputers feels more like a real computer this game is also really fun i just finished the storyline and for the singleplayer itselfits really worth it the story is nice and long i bingeplayed the missions just finished it and i have 40 hours played there are some crazy missions and the heists are crazy fun shootouts dont feel difficult rather they feel fun sadly the online part is ed up yeah i still play it cus its fun but getting money is a grind also there are lots of hackers who will kill you give you money remove all your money & weapons etc etc if youre gonna play online find some friends to play with or a crew or play in private servers the rockstar editor the video editor for this game is also really fun and easy to use ive made a few videos with it and i can link you to my videos if you desire but really this is a good game a message to all other negative reviews dont point out shady business practices summer sale 2015 point out negative points in this game the only real negative point i can find is that hackers are rampant online and online is a bit glitchy at times also first person views fov needs to be increased the game is really goodly optimized too i mean what im hearing is that a 8 year old at the time of writing graphics card can run this game on low settings 3040 fps heck my 140 graphics card gtx 750 ti can run this at average 6070 fps on high settings the lowest it drops to is 45 if you played previous gta games youll enjoy it if you enjoy free roam open world games this is definitely a great game if you enjoy action and shooting or maybe storybased games youll enjoy it definitely get this game it is really fun

its a great game this game is great without mods theres a lot to do and is over all very enjoyable though if rockstar figure out how to make this game have not only mod support for single player which there currently is but also allowed people to use mods in a different online lobby made specifically for modded games then thatd be cool but the game is worth the money as it is definitely worth the purchase and definitely worth my preorder
recommended
i love the graphics and multiplayer but think the story and the characters are a bit under developed
recommended
this game has became fully unplayable for me after the latest update for gta v ill gotten gains part 2 rockstar strengthened their protections against modding instead of the native functions of the game being accessible directly as the game implements live decryption and obfuscation methods this severely impacts performance resulting in gameplay at 3 frames per second  even on some of the strongest pc systems available today another fine example of developers putting drm over performance

lets start this review off by saying that im playing the game on a hp pavillion hpe prebuilt computer which is the pinnacle of outdated rigs my geforce gtx 550 ti wasnt made for this not at all ive been running the game in a borderless 43 window with most graphics settings on normal which is the lowest setting to keep the game stable around 30 fps heres the deal though ive been having an absolutely great time playing the game regardless the controls are great and the game looks very good even on the lowest settings ive already played through the story before on console so ive been spending most of my time in gta online which does have the occasional connection problems problems which are likely attributed to the high load on the rockstar servers all in all the pc version definitely has issues however the pc version is definitely better than the console versions were and is one of the best if not the best aaa games released so far in 2015 of course opinions may vary and the best way to find out would be playing it yourself ps loading screens

it is everthing you would expect had you played the last gen or next gen except it comes with graphics than once jaw dropped you on your xbox 360 now is being tickled my the devil down in china basically get the game and play it even with my integrated intel hd graphics of shtness i can still play the game at lowest settings and 1280720p at roughly 1520fps so give it a shot

paid 40 for a game would be great if i could install it its ok though its not as though the company releasing this title made $1 billion of sales in 3 days from the initial release of this product 18 months ago where yknow the same thing happened with rockstar social club a stable release is probably out of the reach of a small company like rockstar extreme sarcasm off  update many hours later  praise lord gaben its alive it works i spent ages trying every fix on the internet to get this game to work and the same thing kept on happening the social club launcher would appear only for the program to stop working and you have to close it i am using windows 81 where by default one logs into windows using your liveoutlook email address do not use this if you are using windows 881 all you need to do is go to control panel > user management create a new user but choose the local option and not the one connected via an email address search for steam on your pc using the search charm install it and then the social club launcher should launch without problems its such a good feeling when it finally loads and plays i have only completed the small intro and spent the last 30 minutes just appreciating how amazing this game looks ive never had so much fun in a game then i have had just now whizzing though los santos at dusk on a motorbike and it looks and plays many many times better now it is finally at 1080p 60fps it feels fantastic and responsive in a way no other gta game ever has done and ive played the series since the demo for the first 2d gta game ive already played the game and completed it in 2013 on the xbox 360 but first person and the hd treatment mean that it looks superb there is one small thing i noticed and perhaps its just me but i was using mouse and keyboard and thought the game was stuttering which was weird as my fps monitor was around 90fps constant i plugged in the xbox 360 controller i wanted to play with and noticed that the stutter was actually the mouse i use a razer deathadder on raw input but id be interested to see if others have this problem yes i would recommend this game

people going apeshit because rockstar doesnt allow a mod that fixes the fov i understand the pain but why the negative reviews in my opinion its a very great online concept you can blow up and kill stuff together with friends and the variety of activities and missions never makes it boring you can buy gta$ for real world money but you can get money so easily with heists or chasing other players that have a bounty that its completely unnecessary to spend real money for it as for singleplayer i didnt really try it out yet but it also looks like a lot of fun only thing that has to be changed is the mod support i understand that some mods that modify the textures could be highly gamebreaking but banning people for using a fov mod is just stupid

grand theft auto v is a game that has been out for around 2 years on the consoles it went through minor graphical tweaking to be released on the next generation consoles however the games till runs at 30fps on the consoles gta5 on the pc is not just an awful port from the consoles looking at you gta4 one can tell that the game was optimized for the pc even though the game doesnt look all that much better on pc when comparing to the console versions it runs much better however i have heard about many problems relating to launching the game there have been many people complaining about not being able to get the game running in the first place as you can tell my gta5 runs fine however rockstar needs to fix these problems because of these problems there is a risk in buying this game early later on im sure that rockstar will fix these launch bugs and everyone will be able to play the game as for right now wed april 15 2015 there are still many launch bugs lets step away from the technological side of this game and move over to the actual gameplay and the content of the game this game is great after playing many months on the console versions i can easily say that the pc version beats out the console version playing at 60fps is extremely refreshing when comparing to the consoles 30fps you play as 3 different characters michael trevor and franklin with these characters you can explore the world of gta v complete various fun missions and have fun doing other activities such as golf or tennis the missions in this game are extremely fun and the heists are an incredible amount of fun the driving feels smooth as well as the shooting and the first person mode im going to briefly touch on gta online it works very well i havent experienced any problems with it nor have many other people there is an option to link your console profile with your pc profile so that you can continue your gta online experience instead of having to start over overall one can tell that rockstar has taken the time to optimize it for the pc instead of it being an awful console port gta5 for the pc feels very polished all the wait and delays were well worth it i give this a 1010 cant go wrong

waited over a year for the pc version to come out and it was well worth it what i like about the game 1 60 fpsbig time 2 first person view definitely makes uppercutting a civilian more worth it 3 well written story and the humor in the game had me cracking up 4 heists thats it 5 the design of the city is beautiful and flowing over it during the day and night is still incredible to look at to be honest i didnt really have anything that i didnt like about it one bit i thought the game was seriously a 1010 in my books there is so much to do in the game as to explain why it was a 60 gb download took me 12 hours to download it and playing it in first person is definitely a time killer i would recommend this to anyone even if you never played a gta game in your life

this game is no doubt game of the year 20132015 for me i started playing when it was released back in 2013 on the ps3 and finished the singleplayersidequests up to 90% in about 90 hours now on the pc im finally enjoying gta online with friends the pc version had a rough start for me though since i started playing on a laptop with switchable graphics but first the good stuff  huge open world  lots of activity cars pedestrians animals story mode sidequests etc  tons of stuff to do minigames like darts tennis yoga golf & activities like bars strip clubs shops etc  transportation cars planes boats jets taxis  guns pew pew  radio stations  great graphics for a console port but note the negative some negatives that could use improvement   support for switchable graphics laptops there are huge game stopping bugs for a lot of people and after a whole month r has still not fixed this see httpssupportrockstargamescomhccommunitiespublicquestions203308668gtavonlaptopissuesintelamd a hotfix is available which makes the game somewhat playable but still not the same experience as a normal desktop pc with the same specs see httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvveelgdyai0g  console uigameplay the graphics where ported really well but i cant say the same for the ui it seems like they put zero extra effort in for pc users all menus are still console orientated with just controller > keyboard key mappings applied and i dont count first person mode because thats just a gimmick  steam cloud there is no steam cloud or any cloud save for singleplayer in this game  steam workshop modding could be great for this game if it had built in support for the workshop like many other games now people got banned for using mods in multiplayer because its a lot of work to disable them after use in singleplayer a good modding system could really help here

a wise masterpiece of a video game recommended for anyone with a highend gaming computer both multiplayer and singleplayer modes are filled with hours of high octane entertainment there are some improvements that could be made here and there its by no means perfect but what game is the graphics of grand theft auto v pc are incredible from the quality cut scenes to the indepth rain as it falls from the grey clouds and reflects off of your car there is never a moment where you will not be impressed with the visuals the climate and weather is professionally done very lifelike vehicles weapons buildings and people were obviously crafted with effort throughout the entirety of the game you will be immersed in this rich explicit world the story of the singleplayer and multiplayer mode is witty and intriguing the three main characters of the singleplayer mode michael franklin and trevor are fun to play as and are likable the fourth character that you create for multiplayer is more like the main characters in old grand theft auto games a silenttype criminal rockstar have created the story with an original  jokey but emotionally chaotic  style there arent many sad moments but there are moments that truly make you feel euphoric its weirdly emotional in its lack of emotion the story appeals to a widevariety of audiences and is definitely worth exploring especially if you enjoy story line and lore in video games nonplayable characters are as graphically enhanced as the main characters are just as funny and are finished with great voiceacting the game play is intense it consists mainly of shooting manning vehicles and completing missions firing weapons and killing enemies is in a traditional format aim and shoot with the mouse and move and strafe with the keyboard  you may also use a controller  driving mechanics are easy enough to not crash your car but also complex enough to make driving realistic finally main missions and side missions are activated by travelling to markers in the open world by completing missions or by some other means you earn money which can be spent on a number of things businesses vehicles weapons houses betting stocks and more cons the signature vehicle for all three characters in singleplayer mode cannot be changed

i hate many player change to play gta v

now that i spend over hundred hours in game heres conclusion what i think of gta v and its online counterpart gta series has been the father of sandbox games and gta v is the most vast polished well executed and overall most satisfying sandbox game of them all of them all online is also ridiculously fun and as long as people would stop ing running mods online and ing about when they get banned for their stupidity it could be even better ing ten outta ten rockstar good show chap good show

its ok multiplayer gets repetitive but what can you do graphics are pretty games optimized if you have your corresponding drivers

pros beautiful scenery interesting story very entertaining cons parts of the map feel empty and dont offer much content some parts of the game feel repetative multiplayer becomes dull after a while i definately recommend this installment of the franchise it feels like the most refined game yet offering hours of fun in both story mode and multiplayer however the game gets boring after a while 7510

 no story mode review  terrible game overall the online servers are bad its laggy its  there is alot of loading screens more like the loading screen simulator what i hate the most in this game is the rule  bad sport  whoever came up with that rule should be hanged i pay 60 bucks for a game i cant play however i want you basically get banned if you have to much of the  bad sport  thing it starts with 2 days then it goes to 4 and so on if you are not a good boy when you get this bad sport stamp you also get this ugly  hat that you cant take of also you get put in these lobbys where noone is so you are basically playing singleplayer i dont know if that makes sense but that how it is this rule destroys the game soo much lol verdict 510 average if this game would fix all the  thats just soooo stupid it might hit the 710 list or even more i dont know  only online   this review doesnt cover the fun of heist and other stuff online the overall gameplay outside all that

its a bit expensive and its glitchy and buggy same as in playstation 3 and xbox 360 anyway its a fun game but the glitches need to be fixed really soon
recommended
it breaks my heart to do this but there is no way i can recommend this game in the state its in lets be clear the point of buying gta v is to play gta online if you want to play gta singleplayer then go and buy iv the story is better and the characters more likeable online is just a hot mess of cheaters and loading screens no  it took me ten minutes to get into the game yesterday random acts of trolling are the order of the day and if you havent been pked for no reason then you clearly havent played more than ten minutes so no dont buy it i love it but i cant recommend anyone actually pay money for this steaming pile

everyone knows the grand theft auto series and the basics behind the game play so ill skip that bit what i will say is that this is by far the best of a game franchise that ive already been a massive fan of for years instead of playing as one individual you play as three that you can for the most part swap between at will each character has their own skills which you can improve through use and their own unique special skill for example one of the characters is extremely good at driving and therefor when his unique ability is used it allows him to slow time and pull of incredible stunts while in a vehicle the first person view is also an exciting addition while using this the game actually takes on the full experience of a fps gun sights and all though this wasnt a feature that i personally felt was needed once i actually started playing with it i realized that it was a lot of fun and the developers did not skimp out on making it a wellrounded and entertaining experience on a final note i very much enjoyed the story of the game it had its twists and turns and i actually felt very much intune with the main characters several times i got pumped up in real life as if i were actually there robbing a bank or pulling off some other incredible stunt i would recommend this game to everyone who enjoys the grand theft auto series and what that means you might want to avoid it if youre ten years old unless you have some kind of an early warning system for when your parents are coming

so its that time again let me just say that i bought this game for the xbox 360 before and spent alot of time on it there so i have to say that the core mechanics arent different at all its still an enjoyable game but was it honestly worth waiting almost two years for the pc version to come out i have to say no it simply was not this game is nothing revolutionary it is what it was 15 years ago pros first person mode better graphicsa requirement from a console port to the pc smooth gameplaya requirement from a console port to the pc 60 fpsa requirement from a console port to the pc grass looks good cons 2 years of waiting for it guns and vehicles look awful in first person mode no major improvements have been made from the console version to pc version besides the ones that are to be expected from a pc game do i recommend the game yes is it fun sure will valve ruin the mods for this game like they tried to do with skyrim you betcha in short its good not fantastic but acceptable

took about 45 minutes to decrypt the game once the release time hit and here we go again another time devouring game so far so good no issues running the game and getting started runs great on a 3770k with nvidia 770 gtx sli @ 2560 x 1440 with asus rog swift gsync not a fan of making a rockstar account and finding my name taken by someone years ago this rockstar drm requirement is encumbersome and shouldnt be a requirement for steam version protip install this on a ssd will make installation much faster and gameplay much better will update when i experience and discover more but so far lots of fun

its not as charming and wonderful as gta iv was when it was first announced and later on released for pc but it is really great the world feels and is a lot bigger but gta ivs liberty city felt somewhat more like an actual city it felt like home whilst gta v only feels like california which san andreas is based on the characters are really great but somewhat boring if you think of it michael is a burnt out bank robber with tons of cash and still wantsneeds more and has the family drama of a housewife of what ever state show on tv franklin is a clears throat gangbanger who doesnt want to be one but still ends up being one whom later ends up spoiler but duh robbing banks and is the only sensible of the three and trevor is the psycho we all end up loving because of his rather peculiar way of being a person dont take me wrong here the story is great but i never felt it being a movie or a game rather something you go through and forget bigger parts of the story only remembering one or two heists this game is really great but i feel kinda burned out on games like these gta v put my enjoyment barrier through the roof as it has made it hard for me to actually touch any other game in the third person anarchy sim genre was it worth the wait yes yes it was was it worth playing yes and no yes because i ing love the gta series and no because now i dont feel like playing anything else plus the driving is just tedious comparing to the heavy and hard driving in gta iv which i enjoyed a lot ill still have that big chunk of room in my heart for gta iv gta v did not steal it as gta iv did other than what i said this is the game weve all been waiting for since it was first announced but it made me into a spoiled little gamer that probably will never ever play any other third person free roaming sandox game oh and online its only fun with some pals pubs are either you ending up dead in the gutter or your car somewhere in the ocean making you have to pay for it

hello there i just want to give you my opinion about this game  grand theft auto v i have been playing all the previous grand theft auto games on ps2  pc this game is absolutely amazing the graphic is just wonderful really good story mode which can take a lot of hours to finish there is a lot of side missions as well they are really cool some random crazy people you meet there is 3 main characters as you will be introduced to & be able to play as trevor the psycho who lives out in the desert running his own lille business dealing with drugs and always looking for some way to make some money doesnt matter what it takes he got his two loyal pals wade & ron michael the retired man he is pretty cool but did snitch out his friends back in the days he has a family his wife amanda his son jimmy & his daughter tracey its a complicated family jimmy is a weed smoker amanda is ing with other men & tracey wants to become famous and is willing to do almost everything for it michael will do everything to defense his family against any threat if you mess with one of them then you are probably on michaels death list just a warning folks franklin the young guy who started out trying to earn some money with his homie lamar started dealing cars but as the time went lamar & franklin got seperated franklin got into michael & afterward he was doing really good and ofcourse lester the brain of every robbery theyve done what to do without lester huh the multiplayer is cool you can those some different modes to play in missions team deathmatch races heists and so on you need to rank up to unlock specific weapons cars tunes gta v is worth every single cent they have done really good this time wondering what they will come up with next time  sorry for the bad english ^_^

the best grand theft auto yet positives  very interesting singleplayer storyline featuring 3 main characters michael trevor and franklin whose lives all interwine  lots of side missions to complete  plus several businesses which can be purchased  each with their own relevant tasks to participate in  the map of los santos has similarities to grand theft auto san andreas but for the most part it feels entirely new the mix of desert landscapes and forest woodlands really adds a much needed diversion from the skyscrappers of the city  massive collection of weapons to buy in both online and singleplayer all very fun to use  the game is obviously still unrealistic but it focuses a lot more on portraying authentic crime scenarios as opposed to prior titles this gives it an incredbile feeling unlike any other grand theft auto that these heists and raids may actually be feasible  grand theft auto v online has been superbly constructed by rockstar there are so many activities  deathmatch races additional missions that can be played with others plus the awesome heists update which is by far the greatest coop experience the game has to offer you can team up with 3 other people to complete setup missions which prepare you for a heist finale where you bag the loot and attempt to escape  the online component allows you to unlock more weapons missions and upgrades as you level up giving you a feeling of progression  graphically the game looks pretty damn good no complaints there  hundreds of hours of content available in total negatives  fps stuttering and inconsistency on powerful gpus even with the gtx 970 which i own this seemed to be mostly fixed with patch 2 but has issues now and again despite having more than enough video ram shaders and shadow options seem to cause errors like err_gfx_d3d_init which havent yet been resolved by rockstar 3 weeks after release overall score 1010 despite the occasional fps issue and the fact i still cant run everything on max settings using a high end cpu and gpu grand theft auto v is simply a fantastic game there is so much to do and enjoy worth every dollar

fun game looks good runs well great voice acting and soundtrack only 3 problems with it so far 1 game is hyperunintuitive i had less difficulty learning to program with the unix vi editor than i did trying to do very simple things in this game like figure out what the hell passive mode is or how to disable it hell i couldnt even find out how to leave gta online and i had to force it closed with task manager  2 pvp in free roam is extremely shallow get mg get fast car spray from car if not get spammed from car die shame if you had to actually aim to shoot from a car in third person this game would be a much more fun and skillful pvp experience 3 dear god the law enforcement system in gta online is atrocious you would think that offing someone in a dark alley with a suppressed pistol would reduce your chances of being discovered but apparently big brother sees all in los santos and the nations entire police force will dispatch endless troops from your anal sphincter why even have a suppressor when you have radar always on and cops see everything just remove it from the game rockstar stop misleading people

ok not much i can say about gta v at this time since this is the first time that ive ever placed it as i dont own a console and have been staying away from spoilers as best i could while i patiently waited for them to finally confirm and release to pc frankly though theres not much i need to say since most of us already know what gta is so ill just give a break down of what i think about the game so far on my rig so first of all i am running an i5 3570k processor at stock with turbo enabled along with a gtx 760 video card with 2 gigs vram and 8 gigs of installed ram i must say to rockstar excellent job on optimising this game for pc but the graphics to me were overhyped graphics are nice at 1080p but when i compare the graphics of gta v pc to watch_dogs pc with similar settings i must give watch_dogs the win for this one in terms of graphics but watch_dogs was not optimised so that might explain why they dumbed down gta vs graphics the presentation of this game is as top notch as expected and the first few minutes ive been playing i am really feeling this game the driving is ok but takes some getting used to so far these are my ratings for the game and might change as i keep playing and experimenting graphics  810 sound  1010 gameplay  910

i purchased this video game for my 10 year old child for completing his communion at first we could not figure out how to get the game to load on to his macintosh laptop but after some time a windows support representative told us that we could not install the game on macintosh and had to purchase a windows computer i did not want to disappoint my child as i was afraid that he might question his faith if he did not reap the rewards of his hard work for jesus we purchased him an official dell windows computer and started to install this video game for him this is where things took a turn for the worse when purchasing this game i was under the impression that i was buying my child a police game where you would stop criminals as the title mentioned who were stealing cars this game is not what i thought it was and i was appalled to learn that this game was the exact opposite of stopping criminals you are the criminal i stood there in horror as i watched my devout christian child steal a car and shoot an automatic assaulting rifle at civilians i then watched as he took this stolen vehicle and picked up a working girl and took her to a remote location and received favors in return for cash what horrible person would create such an awful game where the main goal is to sin as much as possible this game should be called grand theft satan i would not recommend this game for any human to play i had to go to church every day to help me forget the things that i witnessed in that game as a proud conservative christian mother i would highly recommend that this video game gets taken off of steam and the developers are sent to confession if you want your child to have a soul i suggest you do not purchase this game 110

im going to make this accurate if its worth getting or not so lets start here this game is worth it if you got a good ping fast internet have patientloading time in online is too long probly more loading time than playing the game itself having friends to play with pros its fun playing with a friend you can customized your own car too many modes to play with specially the heist its awesome you can sing while taking a bath to earn some rplvl in gta online the story is too short sonot sure but thats what my firneds always say gta online is awesome you can have s with a hooker in your car for a small fee  about the cons here it is manny players will probly kill you after you spawn so learn how to use passive mode so no players can kill you or troll there are cheaters in the game hope he will boost you up not killing you over and over again loading time in gta online is outrageous its too damn long even if you install it in your sdd few players cant even play this game even my friend cant even launch the game itself even with a highend rig rockstar dont even know the problem it will take up 6065gb in your space so make sure to pick what game to uninstall of you dont have enough memory in your hdd if you have friends to play with and have a stable low ping and fast internet its worth getting it if you got killed by another player everytime you spawn dont say this game sucks cuase probly your the one whos bad at playing this game gta never meant to have fair fight for me its worth getting cause i have friends and have stable internet the only problem on my end is getting to a empty lobby when the time is 611pm rockstar dont know how to fix that this game only shine in online not in single player so yeah its worth it if you are too lazy to read this review buy it at your own risk lol

great game well ported from console to pc but are you a one of those gamers like me that waited 2 years to play this game just for the mods because the modding community is awesome  yeah unfortunately rockstar because they are so cool and love the pc community they decited to banned anyone who users mods online and also single player  so basically rockstar is forcing you to how you should play the game and if you dont oops time to activate the banning button  rockstar i payed 60 $ for this game even though its the same  game that came out back in 2013 and then came out again in 2014 i expect to have the ability to do whayever the heck i wanna do with the copy what happens if i scratch my  with my own gta v copy  will i get arrested  i payed for it meaning i can do whatever the fck i want with the product i feel like im just renting this game and not having 100% for myself and i what happened to buy and then do whatever you want withv the product so because this game cost 60 $ and its the same game that you played back in september 2013 you ll get pretty bored pretty fast because one the story is short if you take your time to it and its not even as good as the campaing in gta 4 which was far more better then this one without the mods this game you ll get bored pretty fast that i can promise you

well what can i say about gta if i only could save 5 games from my library this one would be one of them for sure the game is awesome in every aspect beautiful graphics amazing sound very nice gameplay excellent story online mode we pc gamers have had to wait so much for this game but its finally here and its been worth it despite of having good games in this genre i personally think gta saga has always been the king since 2001 and gta v is not an exception oh and yes gta v on pc is perfectly optimized from the day 1 holy 60 fps

would i recommend this hell yes i would i played a lot of it on the ps3 and having seen the differences so far in the pc version i gotta say rockstar smashed this out of the park worth the 3999 asking price youre damned right buddy side note having played 150 hours so far ive had no problems in story mode but some in gta online with matchmaking however this is most likely down to my internet connection apart from that both modes have ran smoothly

grand theft auto 5 is the long awaited pc port of the best selling gaming series but was it worth the wait  the answer is yes it was worth it in grand theft auto 5 we play as not 1 but as 3 characters at once michael is a retired bank robber who settles down for a normal life with his family in the sun soaked city of los santos trevor is michaels best friend who is also a psychopath meth dealer who tries to run his business in the small town of sandy shores and franklin a repo man who tries to go up the criminal food chain all things are set into motion when michael levels a house he believes belongs to his wifes lover but really belongs to drug cartel after that he is put back into the game going into increasingly dangerous heists the story is the best story for a gta game as with the other ones i couldnt push myself to finish the story this time i enjoyed this a lot the main characters all have different abilities that change up the gameplay franklin can slow down time when driving a car to go through some of the tougher corners michael can slow down time like max from max payne while shooting and trevor can go into rampage mode where he takes less and does more damage the gameplay is the same thing you see in the previous games this game is huge and there is a lot of stuff to do you can play tennis go skydiving race cars boats bikes this game is huge and you will need a lot of time before you are able to do everything the game has to offer the multiplayer is pretty much the same as the single player so i wont talk about it too much but there are a few negatives i want to shine some light on the game has a nasty memory leak which rockstar havent fixed since launch there are still a lot of bugs in both the single player and multi player overall this game is amazing and if you do get it you will love every second of it get this game straight away i give grand theft auto v a 1010

rockstar has managed once again to surprise us has taken the limits of the current consoles and crushed them giving us a world alive and credible the undisputed quality technical product albeit not without some slight smear will accompany the player through a plot that will kidnap him literally and invest with a lot of things to do really beyond any canon analyzed in its purest essence gta not only proves to be an excellent title playfully but is able to take the company today and ridicule in a sublime way taking advantage of all the excesses and follies that the world is slowly getting used to another unmissable page has just been written in the world of video games now only you read it and make it completely yours

good and fun game but its not the jesus every one is making it out to be it has major problems i will just point out a few complete  police ai they pretty much trace you every where and have mass aimbot terrible weapon switching system mass lag and connection problems when in gta online npcs doing  things for example if you steel a jet from the military base within seconds a enemy jet will spawn behind you and instantly fire 3 rockets at you witch you cant dodgebrilliant programing there guys talk about not giving the player a fighting ing chance overwhelming amount of hackers running online getting 3 star wanted level for beeping your horn at the cops getting 3 star wanted level for getting shot at by gangsters getting 3 staryou get the picture being forced to do crappy car pick ups for simion even if you dont want to  being scared to get into a car as it might start a mission you dont want to do now these are just things that i have ran into that  me off a lot every game has its problems and things that make you rage and due to all the positive comments thought i would write some of the negative still would recommend 810

i just wanted to write this review so you could see my play time but with that aside have been meaning to post a review on this game for a while now & i do love this game one of the best i have ever played being 18 years old with most of my life playing video games that is saying something this game has an amazing story 3 stories at that featuring michael trevor & franklin the multiplayer is fun aside from all the kos little kids who cant aim for sheet so they resort to homing launchers and early unlock weapons that were apart of console dlc that require no skillrank to unlock unfortunately but those kids are not that big of a problem because they cay easily be out gunned the amount of content in this game is great and all at the low low price of free yes that is right next to the shrak cards for ingame currency every dlc as of the time of this review has been free and for that we salute to you rockstar if you have been thinking of getting this game and still do not have it leave a comment why on this and i will help you out with questions and information and hopefully that can help you out enough for you to purchase this incredible game rate 1010 please rate this review helpful not helpful & or funny

this game is absolutely amazing the one that immediately became one of my top favorites which i wanna play over and over again los santos  awesome city it is so beautifully designed with so much attention to details that i could probably live there if you like hot pursuits cop chases with shooting  youve got it whether you want to take a relaxing ride in a super car on city and country roads with spectacular views fly a plane copter sail a boat ride a bike and so on  youve got it if youre a fan of some sports activities  you can play golf tennis darts run a triathlon jump with parachute and of course many many different customizable cars and weapons at your disposal everyone can find some tasks of their interest gripping storyline missions is mixed with many other activities which will never make you bored ive played around 65 hours so far and still only 55% done all this comes with really awesome graphical performance  city looks almost like real pretty good music great voice acting and many funny dialogs and this is only single player in gta online you can do all this stuff together with your friends not to mention new heists which are also awesomely designed as far as everybody says yeah ive not played them yet but really looking forward to or you can just roam the city and cause mass destruction to everything around it is big sandbox and what you can do there is limited only with your imagination to sum up  this is one of the best games in my whole steam library definitely recommended

grand theft auto v is an open world actionadventure video game developed by rockstar north and published by rockstar games set within the fictional state of san andreas based around southern california the singleplayer story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from the government agency the open world design lets players freely roam san andreas which includes open countryside and the fictional city of los santos based on los angeles the game is played from either thirdperson or firstperson view and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle you control the three lead protagonists throughout the singleplayer mode switching between them both during and outside of missions the story is centred on the heist sequences many of the missions involve shooting and driving gameplay outside of missions you can freely roam the big open world mostly composed of the san andreas open countryside area and fictional city of los santos the world of grand theft auto v is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series the singleplayer mode lets players control three characters michael de santa trevor philips and franklin clinton criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions you can use melee attacks firearms and explosives to fight enemies and may run jump swim or use vehicles to navigate the world throughout singleplayer you may switch between the protagonists at will by using directional compass on the hud the game may switch between the characters automatically in singleplayer missions to complete the objectives a characters compass avatar will flash red if is in danger and needs help and flash white if he has a advantage overall i give gta v a 910 stars it is a huge improvement to its predecessor i absolutely recommend you get this game because i am just absolutely without single doubt sure that grand theft auto v will not disappoint you in anyway at all

a brilliant and fun game though it has taken quite a while before grand theft auto v became available on steam i can say that it was well worth the wait  i am really loving the game so far ive explored the first person mode a fair bit by now and to be honest i prefer to play gta v in third person mode but it might appeal to some  everybody likes something different most of my time has been spent in online and i still havent finished the single player unbelievable as it sounds but i still highly recommend the game the gameplay is great fun whether in combat races or just casually cruising around with other interesting activities like golf tennis arm wrestling and darts despite not having finished the single player campaign i found it to be interesting and fun the ability to play as 3 different characters and swap between them while doing different missions and even switching between characters during missions is a very fun and interesting mechanic in addition though the storyline is quite fun and wellwritten gta online is absolutely brilliant with the ability to play with friends and even enemies causing all sorts of mayhem with in whatever you want fairly deep customisation for your character apartments and vehicles all add to the charm of the open world experience that you can find in los santos with all the extra activities you can undergo the best part of online is heists a series of difficult but very rewarding missions with setups before a finale similar to some of the missions completed in single player that said i do hope that rockstar continues to support gta 5 with further content like they have already done so with the previousgen content on the ps3 and 360 im very pleased rockstar is cracking down on hackers as well who are ruining online mode just a note be careful if using mods in single player if you dont remove them before going into online you run the risk of being caught and banned as a hacker 201510 i love this and cant recommend it enough
recommended
a complete shambles from rockstar games you would expect a lot more from rockstar i thought they would have planned for success for this title on the pc but instead we are left with thousands of people being unable to play the game my particular case is due to rockstar having force linked my steam account that is linked to an incorrect social club account i created a brand new account because i was having trouble retrieving my old social club details and was given a warning that if i tick the box that there will be no return i decided to wait and try to gather my old details i got my old details yay but guess what i didnt even click the box and it has been linked to the wrong account clap clap clap sarcasm youre god damn right well done to whomever came up with the perma link steam cd key idea pffft i think you should at least receive a written warning from your employer now give me my 3999 back so i can buy another copy and moan about it all again ps do not buy this game guys they have completely screwed around with the background infrastructure and you will lose your 3999 technically fraud as you arent receving anything useable

they created a wonderfully optimized port of the game and it had me thinking wow rockstar has finally gotten their  together and realized how to cater to and capitalize off of the pc gaming market boy was i wrong yes the game runs amazing yes the gameplay both singleplayer and multiplayer is quite phenomenal yet they decide to make practically the worst mistake they could possibly make at this point banning for hackingcheating ok i understand that that is in the most cases a positive selling point yet rockstar believes that its a great idea to ban its players for the use of both harmless fixes to certain aspects of multiplayer and even singleplayer modifications  this has completley killed any form of modding community that could have came about from this game and i would say a good one third of the games population has already been banned i have no idea what rockstar was thinking when they made this desicion if not reverted this will be the last nail in the coffin for the relationship between rockstar and the pc gaming and modding community now we get to sit and watch this game get downvoted into oblivion tread carefully rockstar your actions from this point forward are going to be crucial to both your future game sales and player population wise revisions are in order if you wish to keep a salvagable reputation

definitely not worth the 40 you pay for this game and not worth the years we waited for this its still very buggy gta online is way overhyped and now rockstar want to ban you from gta online for using mods in singleplayer because they cant find a better way to stop hackers so have fun with your bans i for one did not get banned but im afraid to even start the game because i had a shot ton of scripthook single player mods i cant even remember which files are mods and which are not so im ed the story 810 the multiplayer 510 the community 1010 you also get banned for using mods that fix parts of the game r are too lazy to fix the visuals 710 the optimization 710 other than the previously covered points the game is quite fun its unfortunate that it is now so limited

selling this game for 38 in a sale with 25% off is illegal in the uk i paid 40 as a preorder through steam and was considering buying it for a friend last week and it was not 51 for an item to be advertised as a sale item in the uk it has to have been sold for the advertised pre sale price for at least 28 days prior this is shoddy steam really shoddy

do buy it for  the great singleplayer storyline  the fantastic visuals  the ability to choose between using first person mode and third  the questionable humour and parody  the ability to install fantastic singleplayer mods  trevor do not buy it for  online mode why the hate against gta online i love the online world and everything it could potentially offer  like flying your own jets grouping up with players and playing missionsheistsgang fights garages worth of pimped out cars and other luxury vehicles hell ill even pass the lengthy load screens with a push unfortunately its a cheater infested cesspool who ultimately have all the control in the game each game client is trusted with their own data in this p2p networking setup so anyone with the right exe can control their healthammomoneyreputationvotekicks even down to the reports that other players put in to report another players negative behaviour in a good lobby no one may obviously be cheating and everything is okay then you have the bad where someone is spawning tons of money bags on the ground allowing you to buy the most expensive item in the game the hydra jet at $3m within a few minutes thereby stripping almost any need to grind missions then you get the ugly where youre being forcibly ejected from your vehicle no matter your location weapons stripped from you everyone in the server killed from confetti explosions and giant ferris wheels being spawned that crash your game rockstar only bother removing your modded money because theyre deluded into thinking you might buy their $100 shark card that gives you $8m worth of ingame online money otherwise when it comes to issues that plague gtao they stay more silent than gordon freemans backsideorifice maybe mods in the future such as fivem will fix this since itll have dedicated servers time will tell edit note that this review came before the issue regarding rockstar and their summer sales business practices ordeal holy shipsnacks what silly banana thought ripping customers off was a good idea httpreddit39h4vs

singleplayer the singleplayer is great i really like the story and there are a lot of activities to do outside missions many different weapons and cars you won`t get bored of it as fast as with previous gta games at least that`s how it was for me regarding graphics and optimization i`d say it`s great i7 4771 gtx770 2gb 8gb ram and i can run the game on highvery high settings on 1080p with 60fps the game looks very good especially during rain in the city when you can see the reflections in the water though there are some problems the game sometimes can randonly crash and it appears it has a memory leak or something the game uses 57 gb of ram for me while for some of my friends it only uses 23 gb sometimes it uses all 8gb of my ram at that point textures houses and roads start to disappear and i have to restart the pc to fix it setting priority to high seems to increase the time it takes for these issues to appear then the vram is a bit weird i love that it shows how much vram each option uses but i don`t think it shows it correctly i can set the game to use 26 gb out of my 2gb vram and the game still runs fine i currently have it set to 23 out of 2 to keep a consistant 60fps the game also runs decently on lower end systems my brother uses a pc that is on spot minimal system requirements except for gpu and he runs on 2740 fps on 720p and lowest settings not a perfect performance but it`s playable and for some reason gta5 on 30fps feels as good as some other games on 60fps of course there is a difference it`s just not as big with some other games maybe it`s because pc version was made for 60fps and animations and everything was made in 60fps i don`t know online the online is fun it`s more of an rpg this time you need to level up your character to unlock better weapons car parts and so on a lot of missions and activities to do but if you want to by something like the hydra you will need to spend some time grinding because it costs 3 million doing high end jobs you get around 75100k an hour it`s more fun to play with friends as it will get old very fast if you play alone but unfortunatly the floodgates of cheaters have opened online is full of people teleporting all over the place having god mode explosive ammo super speed high jumping and spawning millions of cash oh and don`t forget that they are changing their playermodels to monkeys trees or s if you do encounter a cheater giving away cash then pick it up at your own risk r could remove that money or ban you or nothing could happen as always cheaters are ruining online experience for everyone lets see how the creating sp mods work will r ban for them as well becuase i`ve heard that some people have been banned for using unlimited fov mod which in a way saddens me because gta5 might not be mod friendly overall if you like an openworld game where you can cause mayhem and destruction then go for it one of the best openworld sandbox games i have played while it still has a decent number of bugs and features that should have been done differently i think overall this game is great

grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

grand theft auto v is a prime example of rockstar creating a living breathing world for players to drive shoot and explore the world of san andreas is alive and that improves the immersion and attention to detail the biggest problem with gta v is that online is tacked on and many reviews especially negative reviews are based on the online components and not the main story plus gta v does have issues especially related to stuttering for the most part these can be fixed with a little bit of research but occasionally will reappear until rockstar fixes these issues story mode graphics  9 sound  9 gameplay  10  fun  exploration  missions are varied and interesting  excellent charactersvoice actors did a good job  activites like darts and tennis are fun  bugs and crashes  helicopter controls are awful the story is great and quite believable focusing around several people this time all from different backgrounds and each have there own missions each character is voice acted to perfection my personal favorite is trevor who is so hilarious with his crazy antics graphics have been improved signficantly as you would expect with a current generation game and everything runs nice and smooth when the gta isnt suffering from the stutter bug this issue seems to be either a driver issue or related to steam overlay  and effects both story and online modes making the game unplayable online mode  coop missions are fun with other players  personal character customization  many different clothing and weapon choices  free dlc  hackers ruin the experience when encountered  long loading times  too many trolls on freeroam cussin over voicechat  some missions are poorly designed  cost of some itemscars are exceptionally expensive  repetive gta online really needs to be considered seperate from gta v story mode and as such really needs a seperate review for the most part gta o is fun but it does have many issues which all reduce the overall experience one of the few problems for me personally is that there isnt enough coop modes and missions because the main focus is pvp based i would personally like a couple more cooperative modes heists was supposed to address this but they have their own problems mostly requiring private crews to run them as they are more involved and casual playerspick up groups have a hard time one of the biggest issues with gta online though is hackers ive personally seen several already from level 8000 players to invinicible players in team deathmatch these heavily ruin the online experience

honestly well worth it i was not too keen on the game after getting it on the 360 and spending hours completing the story which i thought was utter  at first and then spending the rest of the games store life playing the online counterpart with some buddies that was pretty much the highlight for the game i must of stopped around june the year after way before heists just out of plain boredom i didnt even touch it again once heists were out since i just didnt care too much for the game lost all interest however a few weeks leading into the release of the pc version i found myself interested in giving the game another shot primarily because the game was cheaper then what id payed for it on the 360 about a 10 difference as well as all the content i had on my 360 account in terms of the online counterpart and the extra content such as heists and updates i thought why not and gave the game another shot and played it non stop for a good few days likes game is pretty much fixed it was built for the pc instead of being a port from the 360 gtaiv had and still has this problem honestly gtaiv on the pc is utter wank online counterpart seems playable havent put too much effort into this however it is in good standing and the players are far more friendlier than the 360 but you still get your bad apples far more immersive expands on all of gtavs highlights like just makes all the features better on the pc with added audio and visual support for higher end pcs runs well on a lot of pcs even lower end ones dislikes game sometimes has some lagging issues here and there for me it happens often after around 45 hours of gameplayer just restart the game or let your pc have a break and then your good to go online might be a little bit of pain for some with the difference in connectivity and p2p the story is still  but pretty cool if you played gtaivs has many references too ill expand a lot more on singleplayer below modding is a hit and miss while rockstar has only just stated they allow modding that is only for singleplayer many have still been banned for it so use caution when installing trainers the singleplayer is honestly ing boring without trainers after the story is finished not kidding the singleplayer is nothing like any other gta game in that it is just boring after you complete it it seems like rockstar put far more effort into multiplayeronline then they did with the singleplayer giving the amount of features online has compared to singleplayer in honest go for it its well worth the wait for some and well worth the purchase for more

one of the best games i have ever played in my history of gaming  ive been gaming since the gameboy 3 i cant think of one thing that i dislike in this game well i can and ill get to that so to make a long story short ill make a pro con list pros great graphics great story great heist great main characters tons of freedom fun online great endings cons not many enterable buldings online pay sucks  and everything is overpriced a bike with nitro boost cost 750k story mode heist are a bit too easy everyone likes to randomly kill each other and then run away like a little  also i couldnt help but notice all the people give this game a thumbs down due to not being able to use mods stop giving a game a thumbs down because of mods your supposed to reveiw a game based on how good the acutally game is not what mods you cancant use on it especially since rockstar never actually said that mods would be supported

ive never banked more hours in a video game ever prior to the pc release i had invested in both the 360 and xbox one versions and have well over 1200 hours spread across both platforms the only negative thus far in this release has been how hard it pushes some pcs however this should get fixed and dont let those negative reviews sway you

this is a musthave for any gamer by all means the game has one outstanding storyline along with its comedy the multiplayer is even fantastic and full of a large number of things to do with your friends this is one of the best games of 2015

so much better than console i mean its not withoutt its bugs but im having a blast online with my gaming community as well as single player in first person
recommended
summary game is good fun and in greater quality than ever seen before in a gta game  steering wheel and flight stick is not supported though which is a shame  people got problems making their laptop gpu running the game gta is gta you run around blow up stuff doing missions climbing the ranks and making cash the game has got crazy characters and during the game you get to play as different characters with different lives despite this during game they will meet and work together to achieve their goals when you arent doing missions there is also tons of activities you can do my overall impression is that gta 5 is just a little bit different in terms of features compared to gta 5 but it still feels way more fun and overall higher quality
recommended
it is quiet amazing that this game runs so smoothly considering its level of detail and beautiful graphics all developers need to take a lesson from rockstar this is gaming at its finest

seriuslywhat can i say about grand theft auto  you guys know better than mei can saybetter than others do not forget uptade your drivers

i have just started playing this game and omfg there are just no words to do justice for this game mindblowing gobsmacked each freaking second i am playing this game the details are beyond anything i have seen in the gta series or any game for that matter an amazing improvement tuning the game to your likings with a ton of options makes it run perfectly on a great many systems the game is beyond real what can i say 200100 points this q has had his jaw dropping on the floor every turn he makes the game starts with a bang and continues on to become even more amazing each mission you take on when you first break into that crib and see the details they put into creating the environment of the house you go omg the suspense of actually walking in that awesome house with a near real family inside it and stealing that car noticing that you got a passenger in the backseat that holds a gun to your head while driving the car to that crooked shop wtf the game takes you on this unbelievable ride you would swear you are playing in a movie seriously this is beyond anything i have seen before this game breathes atmospherics you have to experiance it to believe it but it is truly out there rockstar games godlike now excuse me while i play some more of what has to be the best gta game ever

i honestly cant believe people are throwing hissy fits about their games not working since when is everything perfect never this game is ing great and its 100% worth buying its literally endless fun and people can go cry by themselves yes theyll need to get their game fixed but why does rockstar need a bad review they dont because this game is great people just need to be patient yeah the game has bugs but you try porting a 32 bit console coded game to x64 with way more advancded graphics with oodles of content i applaud you rockstar for giving us pc gamers this treat to even be able to play this game on pc now your next slayer task is to port red dead redemption p

first gta game for me i satyed away from this brand bc from what i had seen it wasnt my type of game drive around and punch people in the face shoot a hooker well if the other games are like gta5 i probly missed out this game is so much more then that its an open world game with a great story so far about 15 hours in and plently to see and do the amount of detail is just amazing ohh and if you feel like it you can puch people in the face 95
recommended
its grand theft auto 5 only with more features better looking graphics and awesome optimization sort of like the opposite of gta ivs port you wont have much problem running this game and at a pretty solid 60fps too or more if possible the story is still one of the best ones written for a video game in my opinion and the world is so alive that it feels real especially when playing in first person mode this is being called the definitive version of gta v for a reason its worth throwing down the full price even right now even if you bought the game once or even twice its just that good
recommended
gta v is officially the king of kings of sandbox games the game mechanics are superb the story and online mode offers the player hours upon hours of hilarious fun especially if you have an imagination i seriously think it will be a challenge to game developers to make a sandbox game that will be better than gta v good job rockstar games and houser bros

playing this game for the first time after completing the prolougebeginning missions i as franklin first walked up to some people and pressed a button that let me talk to them i said hi and they said hi and some other  back to me then i press it again franklin goes  hows it hanging homie and they say hi back again then i get hit in the back of the head by a different pedestrian that must have been offended by my tone of voice i stood up and beat the  out of him and stole his money the other guys i was talking to didnt like that i murdered that guy and started fighting me soon the streets were filled with bodies of my victims then the police came i ran to my backyard having no weapons and hid behind a fence they soon stopped looking for me and i walked away thinking i should get a haircut as i walked in i said hi to some people outside while entering the hair saloon and a cutscene played while it played i could see the person i said hi to trying to get inside the saloon after it was over introducing that store the guy walked through the door and hit me in the face offended by me saying hi before a cutscene the hair saloon closed and i had to go outside and walk around the world and do some missions before i was finally able to get my small afro and beard bullets and fists may break my bones but words will always start it < gta v in a nutshell so far 66610 i get why people say this is the best game ever made it is also i have way too much money then i know what to do with i preordered it before march 31st

alright we al know this is a 1010 game its been out on consoles for a while and we all know its great gameplay and graphics wise the important part now is how does it run on pc does it run like gta iv from my personal experience i5 4570 gtx660 12gb ram installed on hdd i can run this game at high settings and get a consistent 60fps @ 1080p this game runs really well and was well worth the wait i have only had one issue and that is texture pop in it seems that this only happened when i first started playing the game or when i went into unexplored areas but after a while or being in areas there were no issues and the game is running amazingly i highly recommend

pros  great story  awesome gameplay  fun online  great pc port  cant express enough how much fun this game is cons less than no modding support at the time this review was written you can get banned from online for modding the single player this is obviously ridiculous and needs to be fixed that being said it is still a great game is is worth every penny however if you want this game just to mod it i would hold off until they change their stance on it final score 69 onions out of 10 would recommend to fellow ogres
recommended
after almost 2 years of wating the alpha testers previous gen and beta testers last gen} have helped rockstar make this beauty of a game gta iv was a horrible port simply put  it was just crap now rockstar have learnt from this among their other games and now we have a stable and optimised game thank you rockstar if youve played gta v before on the 360 or ps3  get it on pc if youve played gta on xbone or ps4 before  now get it on pc if youve never played gta v at all  then play it on pc this port is amazing this game is amazing pc gaming is amazing

this game crashes too much to be fun ive had nothing but problems since i installed it my first issue was not getting any of the key prompts in the tutorial mode need to buy new clothes sorry cant interact with the counter next after my bf had to use his computer to run my account through the tutorial i joined a mission with friends only to get loaded into and stuck in a garden unable to get out because the spacebar wasnt working not due to the keyboard its 3 months old and works fine in other gamesapplications and then the game crashed my bf fixed an issue i was having where multiple messages would get sent to the game due to frame loss which made most of the game unplayable especially driving now whenever i join a missionheist in gta online with a friend the game glitches or someones connection is dropped or the game crashes we fail over and over and some times for no apparent reason i can play the same missions solo with no connection problems i still occasionally crash but i didnt buy this game to play alone im not a software engineer ive tried my best to fix these issues on my own and with the help of my bf im not going to put my entire system at risk just to play a game that cant reliably work in the first place unfortunately neither steam nor rockstar will refund your money if you have these problems or playability issues steam says you have to prove that youve tried to make the game run by showing chat logs with rockstar support stating they cant fix it rockstar simply has a norefund policy so im stuck with this broken software and out the money all in all there are too many problems for me to enjoy the game at all not to mention the fact that im extremely upset that i cant get my money back
not recommended
so far rockstar has not been helpful one bit in fixing this iss of the storyline mode not working in offline seems the game will just run if you play it online for solo storymode by far the worst 60$ i have spent on a game so far due to lack of help to fix an issue on rockstars side

oh my god it was worth the wait ill admit to being a gta fanboy played almost all since gta 1 but for good reason in my mind this is by far the best sandbox game in the world it combines so many different kinds of games shooting driving flying exploring sports rpg etc but it combines them seemlessly so seemlessly that it doesnt seem strange to be shooting helicopters out of the sky at one moment then five minutes later find yourself playing tennis the plot is amazing the humour hilarious though i do have a bit of a sick sense of humour myself so maybe thats not something to recommend and the action fastpaced i upgraded my computer in advance of this game got a gtx 960 g1 2gb so i was able to play with maximum detail fps and resolution and oh my giddy aunt does it look good i want to invite all my friends over to show off how good it looks but then it would mean stopping the game to open the door and let them in and thats not a sacrifice im prepared to make yet i havent played the online version yet but i played a lot of mta back in the day if you havent heard of multi theft auto then google it now and see what you missed out on so i have both high hopes and expectations however if the single player is anything to go by i will not be disappointed in short this is a game you must own if the $60 price tag is too much wait until a flash sale and get it then just get it

i feel like i dont even have to write this review its grand theft auto v the biggest game ever it made a billion dollars in the first 3 days during the initial release it got game of the year by tons of people and its part of one of the biggest gaming series ever but hey i just want to cement the status that grand theft auto v might just be the best game nay the best thing ever made other than breaking bad of course i got this game when it came out on the xbox 360 and i loved every damn minute of it so when it came out on pc youre damn right i got it so how is it amazing the story follows not one but three main protagonists franklin clinton played by shawn solo fonteno a two bit gangster trying to escape the hood and become a serious criminal michael desanta played by ned luke a retired bank robber who goes back to robbing following his midlife crisis and trevor phillips played by steven ogg a psychotic meth addicted drug kingpin who after finding out his old friend michael is still alive he goes after him the story starts ten years before where michael trevor and their associate brad rob a bank in north yankton where things go badly and trevor barely escapes while michael and brad are shot in the present city of los santos franklin and his friend lamar work for a car dealer until michael and franklin drive one of his cars into the storefront the story takes a bunch of twists and turns throughout and it always keeps your attention there are a lot of memorable missions most notably the heist missions the voice acting is top notch the three main protagonists are well played along with most other characters the script is really good i must say the endings are decent but its obvious that one is way better than the first two cough option c cough but i honestly cant complain about anything the story is great gameplay is a lot of fun you have the option of playing from a 3rd person or 1st person perspective though all cutscenes are in the third person shooting feels great and most guns can be customized the designs are better than the 360 version though they are the same from the xbox one and ps4 from what i understand driving is good as well better than the previous gta games each character has a distinct special ability franklin can use his to drive easier michaels slows things down to make it easier to shoot the enemies and trevor will deal extra damage with every shot and take less damage flying works well but id recommend getting a gamepad to fly because controlling it with a keyboard feels awkward and its harder to be more precise there are a ton of side activities to do shooting ranges races with cars jetskis and atvs triathalons tennis golf buying and selling stock on the stock market surfing the internet looking for nuclear waste darts flight school and some more that im probably forgetting there is a lot to do in the single player about 50 hours of content possibly more while i do admit i wish there were a few more activities like bowling and maybe the option to go to some comedy clubs like gta4 i like the side activities that are here each character also has special stat bars that vary between each character that can be improved and give some slight bonuses to each specific stat once you unlock the three characters you can switch between them at any time unless youre playing a mission or during certain parts when some characters are unavailable the soundtrack is pretty good the score composed by oh no the alchemist woody jackson and tangerine dream is pretty good i dont really dislike any of the tracks the radio stations are decent as well with 16 different music stations and two different talk stations while some of the music stations are hosted by some random guys that most of us probably dont know most of them are hosted by notable people of the respective genre kenny loggins for los santos rock radio flying lotus for flylo fm twin shadow for radio mirror park and some more examples i like most of the stations but if you dont you can make your own custom playlist and it can play as the unofficial 17th music station though this is a neat idea i wish you could choose from what songs are on the existing radio stations and just put them into your own station instead of having to rebuy or pirate them graphics by god theyre amazing while my pc can only run it at normal with vsync only its still good looking if you can run it on ultra im jealous of you it looks great at day night dawn and dusk on land or in water characters look great and the environments are good looking multiplayer aka gta online is a hell of a lot of fun you make your own gangster out of a terrible character creator which is honestly my only major complaint about the multiplayer before you do a tutorial to get used to it once youre done you can go out to do jobs for people do races deathmatches and a variety of different side missions what more can i say other than its gta with a multiplayer so you know its good p i wouldve given the 360 version a 1010 if i could so you have a damn good idea what im giving gtav 1010 its the best game of the year so far for me rockstar games knows how to make a good game without a doubt and they did it here once again id tell you to get this game whether it was $10 or $110 its worth the $60 release price guys if you dont have it already get it now its just that good

great game i have own all the gta back from ps1 to 3 and xbox360 to pc i have to say this one is the far best one they ever made and well thought out the pc i have might blow the system requirements i would recomand a ssd hard drive over a mechanical hard drive so you wont get the loading and make the game little shuttering while playing hardcore max graphic setting or reaching other parts of the map in game i have a 780 gtx ti for a video card and i already maxed out on the video ram of 3gb if you are a hardcore graphic user and want the best of the best picture and graphic quality and want the max setting i would recomand 770 or 970 or better as above 4gb sli help to reduce the shuttering as far screen resolution i played on 1920x1080 on a 24 inch montior and i already maxxed out on my video ram on one card i wanted to maxed the game outbut i couldnt becasue of the video memory you can over ride it and play at maxx setting but it will start to used your system ram and will start to jutter or shuttering and not a smoothable playable frame rate and mouse will have a delay of moving around slowly on movments and action game play if cops get crowded or to many people and things going in the game it shutters but if you got a 2800 and above ddr3 or ddr4 or 3200 above ddr4 system you might get little better frame rate when useing over ride of video rams if anything like useing as virtual machine going on the back ground or something running in the back ground it start do slow down and not very playable smooth playable frame rate it shurtters around feeling like something sluggest and cant move around very good i wish i had a black titan or something that got a bigger video ram and faster as 70 gbps then you are good to go online is fun but scared already someone making auto aims already i can tell a few players was little to good but that is part of life right it a cool game here my computer intel xeon 1650 v3 at 36ghz 6 core ddr4 2400 ecc reg ram 64gb x99 chipset nvidia 780 gtx ti sli overclock to 954 mhz no boost and memory 1866 mhz x 4  7464 mhz 6tb ssd 6 x 1 tb sumsung 840 pro raid 0 1200 psu air cooled no water cooled

so gta 5 has been out for some time now and decided i have enough hours on this game to review it is it worth buying i have had gta 5 on xbox 360 ps3 xbox one and now on the pc and can definatley say gta is worth the 3999 you pay gta 5 on the pc was a long wait to say but sure it was definatley worth it the graphics are amazing and the optimization is incredible the game can run smooth on almost any computer that has the minimum requirements or even less and that is not even high for the stunning graphics you get in game for an open world game they have done a spectacular job on this throughout and i cannot fault any graphics within this game cars the cars in this game are amazing and have a wide variety of what cars you can ride not to talk about the customization that is limitless when customizing your cars when driving the car it is absolutely amazing the ammount of effort rockstar have put in to make your experience 1010 is immense and you can definatley feel that when playing the game if gta 5 couldnt get any better it did the sound of the cars engines are so damn good and accurate this is my first ever proper review but gta 5 is the only game i have played so far that i thought needed a little detailed review

this game to gta iv is what gtasa was to gtaiii theres a huge amount of stuff to do both online and in single player it becomes crystal clear that rockstar werent just sitting on the game throughout the multiple delays  they were constantly polishing it

recommended
this game make me unable to work anymore
recommended
i think dis game needs review sow game is very bad it doesnt even work on my $200 laptop wow thats really sucking very bad
recommended
beautiful 30fps consoles suck  pc with 60fps makes the game so much better
recommended
perfection
recommended
works incredibly well both for offline and online
recommended
i played this game on xbox 360 preordered it for pc and i dont regret my decision smoothest gameplay stunning graphics and worth all the delays i was honestly expecting to be disapointed with all the delays expecting the game to be bad or lacking performance  i was obviously wrong 1010 would buy again
recommended
the moment you jump in immediate story immediate gameplay its really great the graphical options are quite the tool to your experience my time with this game no lag no crashes pure smooth gameplay fast driving tons of shooting no problem its amazing the way this game plays
recommended
gta v pc finally arrive propc good optimization its on par with max payne 3 60fps it is extremely exciting and enjoyable in driving especially in first person view good graphic i think its slightly better than watch dogs but only 1080p for me rockstar editor  cons broken benchmark fixable xbox one controller is not fully supported  no trigger vibration a bit disappointed for a 2015 game not fixable it didnt use xbox one controller api a single game contains many types of games first person view and third person view
recommended
if you are not a gta fan buy it anyway if you have a decent machine then the graphics on this game will blow youre ing mind

most optimized game ive ever played it feels like im playing video games for the first time again literally walking around staring at textures because it looks that great
recommended
do i even have to say anything
recommended
i didnt play very much of it so i dont think i can write an adequate review pretty graphics though
recommended
this version of the game was worth the wait all around amazing open world action with tons of content to enjoy and incredibly well optimized it scales nicely on high end hardware and uses sli quite well too
recommended
never write a review before but gta v is superb
recommended
best game best graphics best simulation of everything
recommended
i know some who are having trouble but personally i have not had any issues downloaded perfectly walked around los santos no lag and had a steady frame rate online is fuctionable as well and has no issues i know it says only an hour on record but just the fact that everything appears to be holding up is rather nice for launch
recommended
well the wait was worth it i guess  game runs like butter on hot wheels graphics silky smoothoptimisied music size some bugs that need to be resolved load times  yea  i dont have a ssd
recommended
exactly what i was hoping for
recommended
pros its gta do whatever you please makes you feel super baller in a game campaign story is great first person totally feels like a new game cons its rockstar always cons with rockstar
recommended
enjoyed this on my xbox 360 but being pc master race i obviously couldnt wait to play this on my pc runs perfectly on my i7 920 8gb dd3 r9 290 great game youll love it
recommended
the best rockstar port and redesign ever this is more than i had hoped for the game runs smoother and more after the latest patch the online servers are running like a dream except for the fact i get put into foreign country lobbies every now and then lol furthermore i recommend this game to anyone who is considering pros spec req actually are overexagurated make sure you have a quad core cpu though and a decent graphics card online runs smooth launched with not very noticable bugs nongamebreaking cons trainers built for singleplayer work online i hope rockstar implements an option where if a changed line of code or exploit is noticed the player is autokicked from the online session autokick cheaters but if we were to say get mods for fun we would like an option to turn that setting off so we can mess around with friends thats it really hope this helps those of you on the edge 
recommended
no wonder why gta v is 3 years goty very beautiful graphics for low pc like mine online is fantastic but its buggy thats fine its 1st day very addicting story 1110 gta is the franchise that everyone should play once in your life
recommended
i think its one of the best games of this year great work

walk up in the strip club find the tranny with the biggest bazingas get a private show moan through your mic to make the tranny love you ignore other players demeaning comments this is gta v
recommended
to keep it really short and simple it was definitely worth the wait for the pc version of gta v it runs like a dream and looks just as nice as ir runs pcmr ftw
recommended
wow gta vits here the pc master race finally gets their hands on gta v this game on any platform is spectacular probably one of rockstars best works here are some pros and cons of this game ill only be looking at the singleplayer side of the game for now might update online in later pros  great npc variety amazing graphics and open world so many activities 3 different playable characters memorable characters customisation  so much of it a long long story taking me around 20 hrs without doing side missions but with every good game there are the cons cons  need a reasonably good rig to run this game a few glitches here and there glitches will be updated later in the year rockstar social has its problems havent encountered any personally price maybe could be a tad reduced considering this game has been out for 2 years now keyboard controls are not the best i tried playing with mouse and keyboard couldnt get used to it so switched to xbox one controller so all in all in my experience i defiantly spent my money well and this games selling point is probably online so if you have any friends who play this defiantly pick it up if not id still get it just for the experience and remember to check if your computer can run this game pretty sure around 48% people didnt reach minimum requirements for this game i give this game a 810
recommended
rockstar support is amazing they supported me all my items back and made me feel like a loyal client thank you rockstar and the great lady who supported me keosha_m is the best
recommended
amazing open world with unlimited things to do  ]

what the actual  is up with swimming underwater in this game this is literally the first time i have ever had to look up how to swim even as a child to teach me to swim my mother just threw me in a pool and i picked it up in about 3 seconds could they really have just not made wasd work like normal on the x axis then made shift and control move you on the y the  did they make shift forward for
recommended
ive never banked more hours in a video game ever prior to the pc release i had invested in both the 360 and xbox one versions and have well over 1200 hours spread across both platforms the only negative thus far in this release has been how hard it pushes some pcs however this should get fixed and dont let those negative reviews sway you
recommended
this is a musthave for any gamer by all means the game has one outstanding storyline along with its comedy the multiplayer is even fantastic and full of a large number of things to do with your friends this is one of the best games of 2015
recommended
so much better than console i mean its not withoutt its bugs but im having a blast online with my gaming community as well as single player in first person
recommended
summary game is good fun and in greater quality than ever seen before in a gta game  steering wheel and flight stick is not supported though which is a shame  people got problems making their laptop gpu running the game gta is gta you run around blow up stuff doing missions climbing the ranks and making cash the game has got crazy characters and during the game you get to play as different characters with different lives despite this during game they will meet and work together to achieve their goals when you arent doing missions there is also tons of activities you can do my overall impression is that gta 5 is just a little bit different in terms of features compared to gta 5 but it still feels way more fun and overall higher quality
recommended
it is quiet amazing that this game runs so smoothly considering its level of detail and beautiful graphics all developers need to take a lesson from rockstar this is gaming at its finest
recommended
seriuslywhat can i say about grand theft auto  you guys know better than mei can saybetter than others do not forget uptade your drivers
recommended
i have just started playing this game and omfg there are just no words to do justice for this game mindblowing gobsmacked each freaking second i am playing this game the details are beyond anything i have seen in the gta series or any game for that matter an amazing improvement tuning the game to your likings with a ton of options makes it run perfectly on a great many systems the game is beyond real what can i say 200100 points this q has had his jaw dropping on the floor every turn he makes the game starts with a bang and continues on to become even more amazing each mission you take on when you first break into that crib and see the details they put into creating the environment of the house you go omg the suspense of actually walking in that awesome house with a near real family inside it and stealing that car noticing that you got a passenger in the backseat that holds a gun to your head while driving the car to that crooked shop wtf the game takes you on this unbelievable ride you would swear you are playing in a movie seriously this is beyond anything i have seen before this game breathes atmospherics you have to experiance it to believe it but it is truly out there rockstar games godlike now excuse me while i play some more of what has to be the best gta game ever

i put 100 hours into this on ps3 plus another 15 on ps4 and this feels like im really playing it for the first time if youve never played it before you need to drop what youre doing and play this immediately if youve played it before and you have a pc thats powerful enough to run it at 60fps go for it just know that contentwise with the exception of the rockstar editor suite this is identical to the previous versions
recommended
nothin but fun and guns

recommended
this is the game we were promised when the ps3xbawks versions came out heists give everyone a reason and a way to get wealthy the fps is acceptable for the pc master race and the graphics have potential which exceed most mid range rigs capabilities have not tried online for pc yet but heres hoping the community is slightly less aggressively stupid then the ps3s wasis

really great game my pc cant handle it too well but it will be fixed probably i rate it a 910  wolf gaming reviewers

best game ever go and buy it
recommended
garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
best gta so far and probably one of the best games out there rockstar have done themselves proud
recommended
same  i do in real life but in higher resolution
recommended
downloaded the game and imediatly started punching everyone 1110 would punch again
recommended
gta v is a better port than gta iv it runs smoother despite the fact it uses newer tech ive never played the console versions so i cant compare it to those  though its pretty obvious that the pc version runs and looks much much better  however its one of the better aaa releases of late i recommend using a beefy cpu and gpu to fully enjoy the pc version im running it on an i7 4470k haswell and a 770 gtx which allows me to run everything on very high except for textures that are set to high with a stable 60 fps higher w vsync disabled you can squeeze by with an older card but youll be missing out on the full scope of graphical improvements in this release im still playing the story mode and havent bothered with gta online yet so i cannot comment on its functionality but story mode is running fine no crashes or stutters or any other game breaking issues my only gripes seem to be in game design and its a little petty of me ill admit i dont like the cops in this game theyre too invasive and it feels like a lot of the chases are more tiresome than exciting losing the cops in this isnt as fun as in previous titles also it feels like they pick up on every little crime you commit and thats a bit of a change from the other games unrelated but just as annoying the phone in this one is absolute trash unlike the one in gta iv gta ivs phone was quick and intuitive whereas in gta v im annoyed with how much time i spend trying to find different things in my phone when im busy driving or doing a mission it seems like theyre just too busy satirizing apples iphone when they should have made a functional phone for us to use perhaps i shall adjust so thats all concluding id like to just say that rockstar has improved so much in this latest release it seems like they have learned from gta iv and listened to their fans quite a lot when it comes to developing a port for pc aside from that the gameplay & story remains pretty flawless and loyal to the gtafeel that were accustomed to with the exception of annoyingly clairvoyant police and a couple of petty gripes of my own still its definitely a better port and worth giving a go
recommended
worth every cent i spent on this game

awesome game worth the 2 yr wait
recommended
a fairly good port for a fantastic game first of all i know everyone in the master race with a  pc is going to thumb this down because it didnt work on their rig congratulations r will give even less of a damn and will either not port their game to pc or do a terrible job this port is actually decent it just needs some more polish port wise theres alot of graphics options to tweak and balance out sadly there still needs to be some more work done here as shadows msaa and grass totally kill performance grass on high is fields of lush green grass grass on normal is the same as grass being turned off really no middle ground pc controls work well enough controller works better as is to be expected of a 3rd person game from console a fix that is needed is in mp when you press t and type in chat the keys still do player actionssuch as jumping out of a plane so type well done guys great effort while flying a plane has you jump out and fail the mission bravo gta online is much more stable than the last gen and current gen console releases yes theres lag this isnt tf2 on dedicated servers think of it like an mmo conclusion fairly competent port lots of effort was put into it a really fantastic game truly an epic and one of the best for its generation but thumb down anyway if the game didnt work for you and you havent even played more than an hour
recommended
so far its amazing there has only been one bug fix update and i am waiting on some more to come out before i give my final opinion i am currently experiencing big frame drops about every 20 seconds and it gets worse as i play oh crap the game just crashed thats also something to remember anyways the game is still gta v but with better graphics and new pc only tools i do reccomend this game as updates are coming soon to fix the bugs one at a time

definetly the best gta it is like the enhanced and high definition version of san andreas lots of things to do excellent story mode excellent characters awesome game a must have

100x better than console versions excellent game cant stop playing on the ps4 and ps3 i played an hour then got bored but with the pc version theres so much more things to do and see and everything just looks amazing the rockstar editor is great except it exports the videos as a vid file which nothing i download or use seems to playrecognize i tried quicktime vlc windows media player and a few more 910
recommended
after prelaoding it and letting it unpack went to sleep woke up a an hout early so that i could try out the game and not have a hectic morning before leaving for work5 hrs later me thinking  work lets keep playing did not go to work for 2 days and put in about 20 hrs during those 2 days 201510 will skip work again and to be really honest this is the first gta i have played and it absolutely held my attention from the first moment i launched the game its that good did not have any launch problems and got a sold 60 fps nealry all the time it shows the amount of time they have put into the port with all the plethora of options available to the pc gamersnot a single crash occurred during the 43 hours of gameplay between me and my roommate yes we are pretty cheap and share a single copy of the game xd and to all the detractors out there you need to understand that when a million copies are sold not all will work on day one and atleast 20 percent of the purchaser base wont be able to play it buy this game its an absolute delight you wont regret it a single bit and it will also show that pc ports can be an absolute delight if done right yes im talking to you ubisoft you suck and someone should wipe you out of the face of this earth anyways to conclude buy this u wont regret it

gta 5 is an amazing game we should all know thisbut the real question is if its a good portits not realy a port but stillthe answer is yes aside from a few bugs i have ran in to like the humorous line glitch for characters online to frustrating glitch were i freeze durring heists but all my concerns can be patched out so i would recommend

great game well optimized worth every penny

amazing d really nice job rockstar but only problem is my gta online player has lines all over him o

why dont you already own this game
recommended
while it wasnt released in a fast manner got it to download after about an hour and a half it still made the deadline before midnight gta v is one of rockstars best games the story we should all know by now its been out for about 2 years the online is great aside from the heists having a few broken sections frozen screens and during the first part of the flecca heist it breaks over all 810

its ok

game is fun

the best game in the series no doubt about it runs smoothly on almost every pc out there so dont worry i was worried that i couldnt get good graphics with my hd 7950 and was surprised when i could run the game smoothly on highvery high with 60fps constantly without the card even using 70% of its memory my brother runs it on high too with his gtx 660 so you probably can run it too i dont think it puts too much strain on your cpu cant really tell since im running an i7 quad core overclocked i was contemplating about putting it on my ssd because of the long loading times online but i dont really think it would matter since everyone got the same loading times probably because the servers are running hot right now or the game is just insanely big theres two cons i can give this game the first is that it took me 2 days to download and install xd second one is more serious its riddled with bugs right now not gamebreaking bugs but still frustrating ive gotten bluescreens because of heists me and my friends have serious issues joining each other in races or just in freeroaming people getting logged out for no reasons the game continues to run but you cant do anything loading screens freezing  the bugs will probably go away after a while when youve sold 500 000 copies on pc already you know they are working their butts off but still highly recommended
recommended
crashes alot but good game

my gpu is a potato but it still runs this 1010

i need to meditate or masturbate or bothtrevor philips 2013 with that comment in mind i have come to the conclusion that gta 5 is not just a sandbox but a comedy as well its like seinfeld with guns and crime but as a previous owner of the game on xbox 360 and xbox one and now pc i strongly reccomend you get this game on pc as the graphics are better and the gameplay is more personal and the online is just hats off amazing i mean i made 355000 dollars in 2 heists today and spent it all on guns and clothes overall if you have a pc without gta v its as if you have a body without oxygen you cant live without it
recommended
great game i have own all the gta back from ps1 to 3 and xbox360 to pc i have to say this one is the far best one they ever made and well thought out the pc i have might blow the system requirements i would recomand a ssd hard drive over a mechanical hard drive so you wont get the loading and make the game little shuttering while playing hardcore max graphic setting or reaching other parts of the map in game i have a 780 gtx ti for a video card and i already maxed out on the video ram of 3gb if you are a hardcore graphic user and want the best of the best picture and graphic quality and want the max setting i would recomand 770 or 970 or better as above 4gb sli help to reduce the shuttering as far screen resolution i played on 1920x1080 on a 24 inch montior and i already maxxed out on my video ram on one card i wanted to maxed the game outbut i couldnt becasue of the video memory you can over ride it and play at maxx setting but it will start to used your system ram and will start to jutter or shuttering and not a smoothable playable frame rate and mouse will have a delay of moving around slowly on movments and action game play if cops get crowded or to many people and things going in the game it shutters but if you got a 2800 and above ddr3 or ddr4 or 3200 above ddr4 system you might get little better frame rate when useing over ride of video rams if anything like useing as virtual machine going on the back ground or something running in the back ground it start do slow down and not very playable smooth playable frame rate it shurtters around feeling like something sluggest and cant move around very good i wish i had a black titan or something that got a bigger video ram and faster as 70 gbps then you are good to go online is fun but scared already someone making auto aims already i can tell a few players was little to good but that is part of life right it a cool game here my computer intel xeon 1650 v3 at 36ghz 6 core ddr4 2400 ecc reg ram 64gb x99 chipset nvidia 780 gtx ti sli overclock to 954 mhz no boost and memory 1866 mhz x 4  7464 mhz 6tb ssd 6 x 1 tb sumsung 840 pro raid 0 1200 psu air cooled no water cooled

i started building a new pc back in 2012 it was for this game i had previously had a nvidia 9800gt 1gb card that had lasted me for agesbut i couldnt play gta4 on max graphics  the new computer was going to be buily exclusively to play gta 5 on ultra settings and anything else for that matterbut that was also a long time ago its funny how 3 years later 2 generations of intel processors 2 generations of video cards ultrahd4k resolution monitors and ddr4 memory to name a few have come out since 2012 yet my x79 i7 3930k oc 42@ghz titan slix2 16gb ram setup was built i can proudly announce that i can max it out on 2560x1440 and even tho it cant hold a constant 60 fpsits awesome beyond belief there is nothing more beautiful than the sun glaring through early morning city fog with the silloutes of trees flickering in your eye as your looking for somewhere open at 6am to hold up the only thing i dislike about it would be thatummmnaah i got nothin other than the fact it had a few issues with the benchmark which has been quickly resolved by rockstarthis games perfect ill conclude that yes i would recommend this game hell id glady annoy the  out of my mates to get it if i so have to do so haha

got it for gta online no problems from start and its been great

grand theft auto v is a prime example of rockstar creating a living breathing world for players to drive shoot and explore the world of san andreas is alive and that improves the immersion and attention to detail the biggest problem with gta v is that online is tacked on and many reviews especially negative reviews are based on the online components and not the main story plus gta v does have issues especially related to stuttering for the most part these can be fixed with a little bit of research but occasionally will reappear until rockstar fixes these issues story mode graphics  9 sound  9 gameplay  10  fun  exploration  missions are varied and interesting  excellent charactersvoice actors did a good job  activites like darts and tennis are fun  bugs and crashes  helicopter controls are awful the story is great and quite believable focusing around several people this time all from different backgrounds and each have there own missions each character is voice acted to perfection my personal favorite is trevor who is so hilarious with his crazy antics graphics have been improved signficantly as you would expect with a current generation game and everything runs nice and smooth when the gta isnt suffering from the stutter bug this issue seems to be either a driver issue or related to steam overlay  and effects both story and online modes making the game unplayable online mode  coop missions are fun with other players  personal character customization  many different clothing and weapon choices  free dlc  hackers ruin the experience when encountered  long loading times  too many trolls on freeroam cussin over voicechat  some missions are poorly designed  cost of some itemscars are exceptionally expensive  repetive gta online really needs to be considered seperate from gta v story mode and as such really needs a seperate review for the most part gta o is fun but it does have many issues which all reduce the overall experience one of the few problems for me personally is that there isnt enough coop modes and missions because the main focus is pvp based i would personally like a couple more cooperative modes heists was supposed to address this but they have their own problems mostly requiring private crews to run them as they are more involved and casual playerspick up groups have a hard time one of the biggest issues with gta online though is hackers ive personally seen several already from level 8000 players to invinicible players in team deathmatch these heavily ruin the online experience

log in the other day to the online mode upon seconds of logging in gave a player who drove by the middle finger who decided to reverse his car next me because he thought i needed a ride i shot him in the face and stole his car and drove it off a cliff the player placed a 9000 dollar bounty on my head which had every player in the city coming for this sweet piece of a$$ i went into a 711 and robbed the owner and found a player hiding in the back room waiting to kill me i laid his punk  out and stole his car and took off old lady ran into my car at an intersection so i got out of the car pulled her out of it and stomped her down and stole her car and drove off some hole in a fighter jet flew through the city streets looking for me and bombed me out of existence all for 9000 petty people this game is hard to stop playing hands down best game ive played in a while

best pc port of a gta game
recommended

recommended
works incredibly well both for offline and online
recommended
i played this game on xbox 360 preordered it for pc and i dont regret my decision smoothest gameplay stunning graphics and worth all the delays i was honestly expecting to be disapointed with all the delays expecting the game to be bad or lacking performance  i was obviously wrong 1010 would buy again
recommended
the moment you jump in immediate story immediate gameplay its really great the graphical options are quite the tool to your experience my time with this game no lag no crashes pure smooth gameplay fast driving tons of shooting no problem its amazing the way this game plays
recommended
gta v pc finally arrive propc good optimization its on par with max payne 3 60fps it is extremely exciting and enjoyable in driving especially in first person view good graphic i think its slightly better than watch dogs but only 1080p for me rockstar editor  cons broken benchmark fixable xbox one controller is not fully supported  no trigger vibration a bit disappointed for a 2015 game not fixable it didnt use xbox one controller api a single game contains many types of games first person view and third person view
recommended
i paid 5999 for a game that dosent start
recommended
so worth the wait this game does not feel like a port at all it appears to be very well optimized and runs maxed out 4060 fps on my r9 290  4ghz 1100t @ 1920x1080 with some basic keybinding adjustments and a multi button mouse the game feels like its made for kbmouse i never played it on console and am only a couplefew missions in but it plays sooooooooo smoothly and the characters and dialogue so far are absolutely hilarious music cars controls everything is awesome everything you could want out of a gta game  so much more buy it thats all that needs to be said
recommended
couldnt wait for this to come on and now that its out i can say it is worth it running the game on maxed settings is bliss and the controls for the mouse and keyboard are league better than using a controller even though i have played gta 5 across 2 generations of consoles and clocked over 200 hours on it i can say without a doubt that the pc is the true version rockstar have made an amazing port to the pc went straight into online with no problems and a full game straight away cant wait to play it more and with friends when they have downloaded it
recommended
rockstar more than made up for gta iv with this awesome port everything works exactly as expected and i have a stable 60 fps with a gtx 970 on very high awesome
recommended
short and sweet review answers to questions you may have yes you can transfer a character from another console onto gta v pc you will even have the option to change the characters appearance with a slightly more indepth creator the graphics are stellar and there are a ton of options you can tinker with gamepads are fully supported loading times are drastically shorter compared to consoles gta online achievements and progression carries over with your character as well but not campaign progression unbelievably contrary to most games that are newly released there were no issues with online multiplayer that i found played with my friend it was smooth as silk the game runs like a dream and i havent hit any major glitches or bugs that broke the game this is an excellent port of an excellent game well worth the wait
recommended
very much recommended if you want a nonstop fun time for pc after a year and a half of console privledge it has come to the pc if you dont know about this game by now youve probably been living under a rock
recommended
runs on hd6850 with almost 60fps medium settings full hd
recommended
this is now what i call a game ah
recommended
port seems good only real issue is the annoying social club but its not too bad
recommended
im really glad that rockstar formed a loyal team with the console users and created such beatiful optimized and bugfree game for us
recommended
never write a review before but gta v is superb
recommended
best game best graphics best simulation of everything
recommended
i know some who are having trouble but personally i have not had any issues downloaded perfectly walked around los santos no lag and had a steady frame rate online is fuctionable as well and has no issues i know it says only an hour on record but just the fact that everything appears to be holding up is rather nice for launch

great port runs so smoothly on my outdated set up ignore all the reviews complaining about  on the first day no game has had a perfect release

recommended
good game worth my money 10010 you should buy it and get crazy
recommended
14 hours in im enjoying the game main characters are strangely likable and interesting gameplay is more or less like iv but smoother in some respects and missions where you can switch between characters become a lot of fun the special abilities do seem just a tad overpowered at times though port seems good im not running it quite maxed out and have the occasional frame rate hiccough in certain circumstances but it isnt anywhere near bad enough to say its not a good port if anything it could do with the settings menu being less annoying to navigate the intro movies could also do with being skippable after first launch they get very annoying when playing with settings that require a reboot i have experienced a consistant bug with the benchmark going crazy and failing a mission halfway through it seems to start a new story mode at the same time or something pc gamer had the same issue which made setting up a bit more of a hassle than it needed to be
recommended
game of the year no lags runs great completely opposite from gta iv game devs did a great job to optimize this game the only minus is social club though i didnt had to go through 7 rings of hell what i had to make when i bough gta iv i am not disappointed in fact that i have chose to buy gta v instead of bf hardline thank you rockstar for another great game from you even though it came out after 2 years on pc
recommended
it runs maxed on my laptop im sold
recommended
one of the cleanest pc ports ive seen in a while gotta love that 60fps
recommended

recommended
i dont do a lot of review but to be honest buy this game i bought it on every consoles xbox 360 one and i bought it on pc killed a cat dont feel bad at all 1010
recommended
if you have a relatively modern pc meaning build date of at least 2008 which is usually really pushing it then youll run this no problem the installationlaunch errors are few and far between and if youre capable of reading and troubleshooting then its no issue the game runs terrificly with 100 fps i prefer limiting it to 60 on my computer with a gtx 960 i54670k 34ghz and 8gb of ram 100x better than the console version thanks for the beta test peasants
recommended
it was 60 dollars for a 60 gb game the way i see it 1 dollar per gb is pretty good for the fun i am getting out of this
recommended
gta  v good game for those who like openfree roaming sandbox games however do not trust all the reviews saying this game is bug free at first i mostly play online there were no bugs at all until i hit level 8 then it started as you can see in the list below  upon death camera would freeze on the death screen preventing you from seeing where you were going after you respawn  heist sequencing bugs out and cutscenes play in the wrong order  random disconnections due to an unknown error on the server  game crashes due to rockstar games social club errors pros  open gameplay and tons of activities to do  lots of ingame content  game looks beautiful and runs smoothly well optimised  controles are good however flight might take abit of getting used to cons  game can feel like a grind to unlock more stuff and earn money  after you complete all the activities a few times the game can feel boring  initial loading takes a long time ive had to sit and wait for the game to load for about 12 mins and that is with an i74790k 16gb ram at 1600mhz and a gtx 780 ti 3gb  ingame loading takes a long time about 30 secs to 1 min  people will randomly leave your server in mass waves leaving you on your own  transition from loading to playing is cool at first but the entire thing takes up 510 seconds and becomes monotonous after awhile my recommendation if you enjoyed previous gtas then i would recommend you wait till around mayjune 2015 to buy this game so that most of the bugs are fixed if you did not enjoy previous gtas so much then i would recommend that you wait for the game to go on sale
recommended
very good game

gr8 m8 88 hurry up and ing buy it already
recommended
bans you for installing mods
not recommended
garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
hackers thats all i have to say nothing is being done to stop the hackers they run around in the online play and kill everything
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
i cant stop play gta v 1010
recommended
havnet played too much but oh man is it just as fun as i remembered game runs really well and it looks gorgeous if you havent played it before youre really missing out on an awesome story and an awesome world na thats not even taking into account the online mode which adds so much more
recommended
better than i thought gettin good fps
recommended
i never have to go out with roman again
recommended
good portnot waste money to buy this gameconsidering the game was released 2 years ago god bless
recommended
excellent port after gta iv i was concerned this port would be rubbish as well so far gameplay has been buttery smooth with no hiccups i get 60 fps with little to no drops at high settings at 2560x1080 loading times to get into game are loooong but with an ssd that time would probably be decreased i havent had any issues at all logging onto gta online at all my specs for reference i54690k @ 44ghz 2x gtx 770s @ 1200 mhz 16gb ram windows 81 pro and game is running off of wd black 7200 rpm hdd
recommended
its basically a corporate conglomeration of subtransient particles that reconsider their constituents in a particular manner
recommended
rockstar really hit the mark with this release we all know its a good game from the previous releases but the performance and optomization are excellent from the pc release game runs like butter with every setting maxed on a 770 4gb thats pretty damn impressive for a game that looks this good what surprised me more is that online worked nearly flawlessly from the moment of release as soon as the game onlocked myself and 6 friends jumped on and played for several hours with zero connectivety problems there was an issue of traffic spawning inside of eachother and making the game lag a little bit it was minor and we only encountered it a few times 910 release would recommend
recommended
great game the more people the better hopefully rockstar will patch the game regularly and continue to improve on the performance so that i stop seeing dips in frame rates
recommended
this game is a masterpiece
recommended
best gta ever created
recommended
to those people writing reviews or looking at the reviews of those who are complaining about being unfairly banned rockstar has already stated they wish to keep gta online from being polluted with modifications to give some players an unfair advantage single player is in no way in this pool the people writing these venemous reviews were caught and dealt with the correct way happy gaming great game eat  cheaters
recommended
its a gta game did you really expect it to be less than awesome ignore the people whining about getting ban since its really easy to awoid by just staying out of the hacked lobbys
recommended
i give this game a 1110 there is so much you can do in this games not to mention good ai detailedbig map and a great multiplyer i recomende this game to everyone
recommended
wow this game i dont even like gta seroiuusly its the subject matter but this game if you have a decent rig and enouph ram you will be shocked now ive played some games i played atari in the 70s and 80s i had nintendo playstation xbox played daggerfall the week it came out so i have some prespective this game has something for pretty much everyone want to play gta online alone with nobody blowing youre crap up repeatedlly  done want to cruise around with youre friends  or complete strangers   done want to takle the single player story  which actually exists in this day and age and its good if you can get past the subject matter  done want to cruise around getting money so you can upgrade youre crap get a house and cars etcetc  done maybe you just want to walk the streets marveling at all the sights and the advancement of the gaming landscape  and beleive me it has advanced   done even if youre pc is kinda cheesey this game has got you covered the optimization is apperant this game has had alot of work  the ground looks amazing lol and it shows now i dont know what the big deal is with mods but dang this game is just that good maybe people just really want to add orcs or something which is fine but if you like games and you have an actual 3d card on youre system then its a no brainer you will get youre moneys worth even on low settings it looks good  trust me ive tried them all  just make sure youre pc can run it before you buy it
recommended
awesome game and didnt know it was going to be that good on pc brilliant game rockstar

good the game is fun and is worth it but maybe some bug fixes and more updates but the game is playable and better optimized then gta 4
recommended
the game crashes faster than mayweather running 1010
recommended
although some users are experiencing difficulties from crashes and glitches in the game there is no denying that this still is the best pc game out in the market right now single player  1010 epic action packed story never a dull repetitive moment multiplayer  710 little to no lag heist is great but has a tiresome lobby system with crazy amount of loading time that kills the gameplay experience even when installed on ssd gameplay  9510 everything you love about gta franchies but more and better

i can only wish that people would have tried to fix their problems before leaving bad reviews the fact is gta v is perhaps one of the greatest modern games to come to the pc the defining nextgen title if you ask me but its prestige and merit has been drowned by individuals leaving negative reviews because of the games rough start which is why i come out of the woodworks to leave this review the fact is since i played this game on xbox 360 i was captivated by the plot something so masterful and elegant had never been seen before in the video gaming world at the time and even at the games release on the pc nearly two years later it remains amongst the top tier titles this game runs wonderfully on hardware that it normally wouldnt be able this is because rockstar has pulled off an incredible feat and showed the rest of the gaming world what a pc port should look like people insult rockstar and say that they dont care yet they have delivered a beacon of hope to those of us who have been observing a disappointing lack of care on behalf of developers when it comes to moving games from consoles to pcs this game is a must have the plot the gameplay the dialogue the online mode  its all blissful this is one that will continue to get hours from me for a long time into the future just like red dead redemption did and all other past gta games if youre having a problem with the game i guarantee you that there is a solution out there look before you leave a negative review be thankful pc gamers because we have received something of exceeding rare quality  a game that plays and feels like it was built just for pc in spite of being a port from the consoles
recommended
i have been playing it since it came out on ps3 and have pretty good experince 1010 would waste my time again

recommended
worth every second of wait entailed the polish and performance is mind boggling
recommended
a game that will no doubt provide incredibly memorable experiences from trying for an hour to get a sailboat over a bridge with a cargo bob to get it out of a lake only to find theres a second bridge down the line to going through hell to steal a motorcycle from the lost but then finding out you cant keep their version of that motorcylce to spending hours driving back and forth to get a car you want to spawn then seeing it all the damn time after you finally have it despite the uncountable moments of blind rage this game has given me its truly an amazing game with something to offer for everyone so get it dammit
recommended
im running this game on an asus g751 laptop with a 970m with a mix of very highhigh settings and it looks and runs great for me at the time of this review windows borderless does seem to cause jitter so keep that in mind if you want to use that setting
recommended
best launch for a highly anticipated game i recommend this to everyone i have a budget graphics card r7 250 and i still had fun in this game with minimal lag
recommended
i literally cant stop playing this game help me

this is no doubt the best game since the release of csgoeverything is as you would expect of a greate game bairly bugsamazing gfxgreate controlsvery stable first person mode works greatedeathmatches with fps are better then the past 5 cod titles and honnestly is a pretty good shooter on its own theres only one little downside i can think of and thats driving handlingits better then gta iv but not on the same level as the rest of the game in my opinion but the driving is easily forgotten if you look at all the plus points would give 1110 if the driving was betternow only 1010
recommended
1010 lots of fun
recommended
definetly much better then watch_dogs this atmosphere of 90s aka max payne with snow and old police cars in the prologue made me to decide that this game is going to be exciting already recommending as its a very interesting title

its a great game every bit about it is good other than a lot of frame rate issues which apparently isnt just on me and my pc i see no reason not to buy this game if its your type of game just wait a month or two for a patch or two before actually playing it

ive played it on console but wanted to have it on pc too as i thought it would be fun to play through again with a mouse how wrong was i it isnt just more fun or a simple port of a console game this game is a masterpiece and its optimized for pc superbly the graphics are truly some of the best in game ive ever seen it runs fine on my pc which i guess isnt basic or average but certainly it isnt high end im running it on a gtx970 i7 36ghz and 16gb ram and nearly all of the settings are maxed and im getting about 50fps even in the times of highest action the rockstar editor and director suite are amazing tools and the creative minds among us will be able to create some brilliant videos with this software even i managed to create quite a cool police chase i reckon you could create a movie with it if you could find some decent voice actors and some people to help make scenes im looking forward to the modding community going berserk with this game not that there is anything missing from the game but just the additional features that could be loaded in future like a mod that allows you to play as a cop and find crimes in the city anyway its an epic game and without any doubt thus far april its my game of the year and genuinely i cant see that changing nothing is in the pipeline to beat this if you buy just one aaa game this year let this be it

gtavexe is awesome and show rockstars promises to us very well optimization but this game took cpu and memory resources a lot gtavlauncherexe in normal rgsc version is fine every pc can launch it up but gtavlauncherexe in steam version is a crap laptop with nvidia optmus or ati gpu has tons of issues in it so i still give yes because nvidia optimus still get a way to play this game and enjoy it but to be honest whats ruin this games pc version is not the game is the launcher what a shame

i started building a new pc back in 2012 it was for this game i had previously had a nvidia 9800gt 1gb card that had lasted me for agesbut i couldnt play gta4 on max graphics  the new computer was going to be buily exclusively to play gta 5 on ultra settings and anything else for that matterbut that was also a long time ago its funny how 3 years later 2 generations of intel processors 2 generations of video cards ultrahd4k resolution monitors and ddr4 memory to name a few have come out since 2012 yet my x79 i7 3930k oc 42@ghz titan slix2 16gb ram setup was built i can proudly announce that i can max it out on 2560x1440 and even tho it cant hold a constant 60 fpsits awesome beyond belief there is nothing more beautiful than the sun glaring through early morning city fog with the silloutes of trees flickering in your eye as your looking for somewhere open at 6am to hold up the only thing i dislike about it would be thatummmnaah i got nothin other than the fact it had a few issues with the benchmark which has been quickly resolved by rockstarthis games perfect ill conclude that yes i would recommend this game hell id glady annoy the  out of my mates to get it if i so have to do so haha

gtx 760 almost running on max with 60 fps game is so smooth and no crashing at all unlike gta 4 my computer is not blowing up strippers in hd found a vacca somehow then lost it cuz mission killed someone and took a snapshot then sent it to him 1010
recommended
aside from the mouse sensitivity being tied to the framerate makes the 1st person view seem awkward and unnatural which i assume will eventually be patched it is a really solid port i experienced no issues whatsoever getting the game to launch or run and despite my low playing time as of this writing 5 hours no crashes i74790k @ 4 ghzgtx 970 on very high settings  high shadows  no msaa gets me 7090 fps @ 1080p with occasional dips into the 50s during high intensity action online character transfer from ps3 worked on launch day except i had to go to the barber and change my eyebrows and remove lipstick and i retained my vehicles as well the bad 100% sp progress did not transfer

so worth the wait the game is really great

this game is hands down superb in every aspect the game play is great graphics outstanding and everything runs smooth for me at 70 fps on the highest settings possible with my twin 880s the fun missions will also keep you busy for days the game was well worth the preorder and wait in other news the silence from all the babies and whinebags who previously cried about waiting is now deafening and game reviews are all magically positive perhaps they released their stress by picking up hookers in the game
recommended
have some work to do if it wants to be as good as bad rats but you cant really compare any game to bad rats
recommended
great game the loadings could be quicker though
recommended
fantastic game but random fps drops

runs faster than a hooker with a death threat

gta v the beautiful game i got wanted randomly in a mission he drove through the window of a clothes store couldnt get out and the car blew up 1010

installed on pc win7 x64 everything worked using a geforce gtx560ti drivers 35012 running it in directx10 rather than 11 since that allows the game to run in 1920x1080 res with dx11 the memory exceeds 1gb which is what the gtx560ti card has as max framerates are fine  gameplay is fine  all in all gta5 is fine  the onlinemode is not quite as good or maybe its just a question of getting used to it as it was in gta4 for some reason you cant play against other players and weapons and items require you have earned skills or money the onlinemode in gta4 was superb in gta5 it feels like a step back i only played one day though so maybe i just havent found out how it all works yet and even so it is still very good in gta5 the police is much betterfuntougher now as is civilians and well pretty much everything you cant go wrong with this game  jel

very nice game

when i load the game it all loads fine until the launch pannel comes up right before the game opens the launcher crashes the game is unplayable

recommended
this game is perfect  you must buy game and joy 
recommended
most gaming companies especially ubisoft and ea should take a lesson from rockstar on how proper optimization is done on pc games very well executed rs the delays really paid off and after a very long time i feel i got my moneys worth what other company nowadays releases a game with such demanding graphics which from dayone are fully optimized which company spends actual time to release a polished product and values its quality first and foremost instead of following the fast and easy money tactic rs took its lesson from the gta iv clusterf@ck on release day and delivered a premium quality product i run gta v with everything on ultra at a constant capped 60fps finally a company that respects its customers and the glorious pc gaming master race

well there it is the greatly anticipated threetimesdelayed port of gta v for pc after a 2 hour 59gb download and a 15 minute unencryptingpreallocatingunpacking session on one of the fastest ssds out there at the moment everything went smooth from thereon and i was ready to jump into the game at 1am after doing a couple of missions in the single player and familiarizing myself with the controls which are really smooth except for when flying a plane i decided to check out gta online 8 hours later i noticed it was 9 oclock in the morning and i had to already have been in the office obivously i worked at home that day as this is honestly one of the most addicting games ive played in a long while as anyone probably knows already and as anyone can tell from all the other reviews this is definitely a game to get id like to add some negative points to this review section however some of them might be fixed in the future and all of them should definitely not withold you from buying the game but its good to know there are still some issues with this game one of the few negative things i can say about this game right now is that gta online sometimes literally takes 34 minutes to load up and this loading period also happens when you disconnect from a job or get kicked from it or failed to connect to it it also seems the game stops loading or loads terribly slowly when you alttab out of the game during the loading screen i like to do this and do something else while the game loads so you really have to be on the loading screen for it to continue loading ive missed out the start of a job and thus got disconnected because i alttabbed to desktop for 30 secs while joining a heist when i tabbed back to the game the heist had already started without me as my friend who was also in this heist told me and i was stuck on an infinite loading screen that i could not get out of also joining another players session can sometimes take very long when there is no free slot in that session youll be asked to be placed in a queue but this doesnt work very often either somehow ive ended up singing in the shower more times than actually getting in the game with my friends when i clicked join game other minor bugs i noticed when browsing the web on your virtual smartphone and clicking on a video the video will indefinitely play and you cannot close the browser anymore thus resulting in you having to altf4 out of the game furthermore flying a plane feels really wonky aside from the turbulence which also adds an extra difficulty factor the plane tends to nosedive and you seem to have to correct this continuously by pressing numpad5 nose up other than that this is an amazing game because once youre in with your friends all the loading time was well worth it and i cannot think of any other multiplayer game out there right now that is this much fun to play

great game but im pretty sure i spent atleast two full hours so far on loading screens so 910 for the excessive ing loading

excellent game this is by far the best iteration of it if youve got the right rig it will run to your satisfaction think need for speed meets 007 everything or nothing in a truly open world topped with interesting characters amidst a compelling narrative plastered in cynical satire and a volley of direct unapologetic critiques about modern western culture also a great way to blow off steam
recommended
 well written story central characters and plot  story missions side missions encounters etc  witty funny npc character banter and comments  graphics  atmosphere  art style  open world sandbox with great physics  radio stations lowdown 911 is just killer  great npc ai including animals  modding  rpg elements  first person view i fondly remember the first time i flew out of my windshield  taxi cab fasttravel is a great feature  initial client load makes me wait an entire 10 seconds before i can play  i dont really like rottweilers but chop is still pretty cool 1010 worth every penny

my imo score 1010 why dont have to answer romans calls anymore because he isnt in the game seriously though here are my points story i havent played it yet but based on my brothers gameplayit is really well crafted and very unpredictable except for some parts there are also a lot of twists in the storythe inclusion of 3 protagonists was also done very good with each of their respective special abilities cheat codes are fun too online i played about 99% of my time in online the community as i expected is sos or shootonsight kind of players so you dont really have a room for making friends the real fun comes when you are playing with your friends the jobs are actually good and make a really stable source of moneybeware thoughvehicles are very pricey and it will be a while until you bought your first legitimate vehicle it will still be longer before you bought your first apartment too although they are very expensive they give you a safe haven from the rampaging players that shoot you down with no remorse they also give your owned cars a safe place where other players cant blow them up and you have to call the insurance company to get it back the most expensive ones looks something that only iron man can buyhell the garage already looks like a house heists my favourite part of online they are cooperative missions that need good teamplay and effective communications the succeeding heists after the first one are extremely hard without teamwork but it really feels good once you bring home the bacon it gives you a darn lot of money especially if you are heist leader i got 200k once the problem is that most of the players who joins your heists are 1 noobs who cant do  2 people who dont know what to do 3 people who perform their roles poorly and 4just incompetent s who sit around  while you and possibly others are getting  by the police however when someone you know or trust gets together on one crew you can have actually fun and it doesnt even feel that you are competing you also burn through heists quickly and you level up fast optimization hell this console port doesnt even feel like it truly the pc master race has prevailed the graphics looks very beautiful the streets and cities are very lively the effects are truly stunning all this runs on my decent laptop with the following specifications gtx 860msingle intel core i74710hq 25ghz34 16 gb ram it runs around 4060 fps on very high settings with no aa and on 1920x1080 there is a little stuttering and screen tearing but it isnt really noticeable and it is just probably my eyes getting damaged from playing gta v constitently well thats all i could say for this review this review will be updated as the game also updates on pc
recommended
the launch is quite a disaster apart from the windows user name issue my nvidia optimus laptop can not open the gta v launcher luckily i managed to play the game with a workaround apart from that the game is quite optimized and able to run on my laptop and the graphics is just too awesome the environment is so realistic that you are easily immersed in it with the first person perspective plus the game has countless hours of online gameplay and single player you would not be bored for months 60 usd is a steal for this game

a masterpiece stunning graphics and excellent effects need i say more
recommended
gta  v good game for those who like openfree roaming sandbox games however do not trust all the reviews saying this game is bug free at first i mostly play online there were no bugs at all until i hit level 8 then it started as you can see in the list below  upon death camera would freeze on the death screen preventing you from seeing where you were going after you respawn  heist sequencing bugs out and cutscenes play in the wrong order  random disconnections due to an unknown error on the server  game crashes due to rockstar games social club errors pros  open gameplay and tons of activities to do  lots of ingame content  game looks beautiful and runs smoothly well optimised  controles are good however flight might take abit of getting used to cons  game can feel like a grind to unlock more stuff and earn money  after you complete all the activities a few times the game can feel boring  initial loading takes a long time ive had to sit and wait for the game to load for about 12 mins and that is with an i74790k 16gb ram at 1600mhz and a gtx 780 ti 3gb  ingame loading takes a long time about 30 secs to 1 min  people will randomly leave your server in mass waves leaving you on your own  transition from loading to playing is cool at first but the entire thing takes up 510 seconds and becomes monotonous after awhile my recommendation if you enjoyed previous gtas then i would recommend you wait till around mayjune 2015 to buy this game so that most of the bugs are fixed if you did not enjoy previous gtas so much then i would recommend that you wait for the game to go on sale

very fun and worth the 60$ to buy it multiplayer is always filled with something new and it never gets old
recommended
the first thing i notice after starting this game up is how incredibly well optimized it is for my system im runnin a 7 year old i7 920 processor and 2 gtx670s in sli with 12 gb of ram hardly a top notch modern system and i am literally running this game at 1440p with 4xmsaa and txaa with all the main graphic settings at their max except for postfx at mediumim not a fan of most postfx visuals it is running smooth as butter for me 90 percent of the time with some sweetfx tweaking this game is visually stunning and runs literally twice as fast as gta 4 and that game is 7 years old i dont know how they did it but i really commend rockstar for taking their time getting this one right i am in awe of how well optimized everything is and i hope other companies like ubisoft take note of how to do it right
recommended
exactly the same game 1010 would be conned for 40 again
recommended
listen here you fagguts is good game is fan mod is not ban yes
recommended
only 25 people per server usually have to switch sessionserver 23 times before you can get 4 decent people to play a heist for 1 hour gameplay be prepared to get at least 45min of loadingtime if you are using the best equipment of pcssd100mbit bottom line is too much loading
not recommended
gta 5 on the pc is incredible i play the game in high to lowish settings and the game still looks incredible ive completed the story and i was very very impressed apart from a few trevor missons and the tourtre misson i had a few bugs one of which franklin was meant to follow michael but got stuck in the wall and i had to reload part of the misson to fix it the online is also incredible i mainly got the game to play online and i was not dissapointed the heist missons are awsome with a group of freinds all in voice chat but try and play it with other players and no voicechat then you wont stand much of a chance the attention to detail is incredible if you start a certan misson as a certain character you can see it in a differnt point of view to if you started the misson as a different character my rating of this game is 910 because of the few missons that i did not like such as the sidemisson that forces you to record someone having sex a main misson where you play as trevor and very voiolantly kill a bunch of cowboy sort of hillbilly ais  and and a misson were the player is forced to interact with tourtreing a fairly inoccent man
recommended
game is really funny i remembered sitting in other peoples car point middle finger the whole time ignore all those negative comment theyre just butthurt for using fov mods which changes memory setting fov mods also kinda give you a unfair advantage so imo i considered as a cheat not as much as a mod
recommended
great game but the r doesnt like modding it seems
not recommended
mods are best part of the game yet its banned
not recommended
horrible lag that requires a person to install specific drivers for it to run smoothly why is this always the case with the gta franchise if i was running a low spec pc i would understand this but not if running a extreme gaming pc wont reccomend this game to anybody no matter how cool it is
not recommended
rockstar has pulled the wool over our eyes we were expecting a moding experiance that would add years to this game however 1 month after millions of players purchased this game and no longer had any chance of gaining a refund for there money they decided to alter their eula now the end user licences agreement forbids a user from altering the game in any capicity meaning if you mod this game you will be banned from not only the multiplayer servers but from your own private singleplayer games aswell i can not reccommend this game i was had
not recommended
waited two years to be able to play this game with mods due to the great mods on gta iv ifwhen they changes their eula then get the game if you wish to play this game vanilla then sure get it but this is not the pc gaming way

this is my third time drafting this ing review not because of some   bugs with the game 1st time i closed the browser without submitting the damn thing second time the power in my house flickered at 420am hmmm causing the internet to cut crashing the game mind you i was dumb enough to try and write this thing in the steam browser with the overlay the review i was speeding through an intersection and tboned the  outta a civilian car as i picked myself up from the pavement and started to make my way to my car the driver of the car i hit who survived somehow said it dont matter this here is a rental 1010 right off the bat i found myself enjoying this console to pc port more than ever ive yet to find a port so well done it brings a tear to my eye i dont usually get off my  and write these things but with the comedy from the story line and online i couldnt stand to withhold my opinion of rockstars latest pc release im not a console  pc master race thanks beta consol usrs fer bug fixin d apart from the longer loading screens when playing with people across the atlantic like england and them chaps i feel i was already prepared with the multiple release date setbacks for the game on pc but if those delays truly meant getting the game to its current state on release id like to thank rockstar for doing it i have not had a single game crash graphical issue or some major bug thatd make me wanna refund the game the download was smooth as  and finished in 3 hours dodged the decryption fiesta by purchasing the game the minute it was released somehow still reaping the benefits of the prepurchase offer ive seen a lot of people complaining about bugs and im going to be honest hear and say i highly doubt most of the people with this problem are on windows 7 have a computer from 2013 have an hdd faster than their mothers breaking point could go either way with that and were smart enough to have predicted the strain a game the size of 60gbs would have on the system in whole reminds me of wolfenstein new order 40 gbs for the love of god if you are going to be gaming with high end games dont ever run windows 8 and dont  about  not running cool when your rig is cheaper than $1k and was bough preassembled from dell 7 years ago sure the upfront price is more than a console but the pc can do more than just game it can do your ing homework show your discreetly stored porn for when the time is right and play games that look 5 times better than they do on console lets get to the content because i only have 20 something hours im gonna wait until i accumulate more so i at least look like i did more than just idle the game in the background  wip  three bugs ive encountered that dont really bother me like i stated at the top of this review its my third time drafting the er so when i lost internet unexpectedly i wasnt expecting the entire game to crash whats more i was in the story mode completely removed from online that was the first time my internet has been out in a month so why should i complain alttabbing now this only really happened once and if i recall correctly it happened while i was in a random session up in my apartment building i simply alttabbed and found that i could not alttab back in all of my other alttabbing occasions have gone smooth as hell for whatever reason my weapon attachments will not stay attached in online during missions or heists i can alleviate the issue by making a quick stop at a gun store before heading to the assigned job in a heist but its slightly annoying
recommended
first of all i have to say that im white and not a racist but i was in the strip club as franklin and wanted to jerk off so i got my stripper and went in a private stall but when i toouched her i was creeped out that my hand was black after that i never jerked off while in the strip club as franklin again

this game to gta iv is what gtasa was to gtaiii theres a huge amount of stuff to do both online and in single player it becomes crystal clear that rockstar werent just sitting on the game throughout the multiple delays  they were constantly polishing it

its so buggy but i still playing in it cuz its gta xd
recommended
the game you basically allready know from all the videos from youtube while waiting to get the pc version compareed to the console version ps3 is a very big improvememt one more radio station new songs to the other radio stations the graphics look awesome the first person prespective is a bit wierd at first almost the entire keyborad does something diferent but in general is better than the original release and it proves that pc is better to play games than consoles but not all games aply
recommended
dont know why everyones complaining if you cant follow basic instructions hell you just need to press 3 buttons to link your steam account and activate your code then you probably shouldnt have had access to this game everything worked for me since day one gj rockstar edit apparently a lot of people complaining about hackers and getting banned for simple sp mods ive been playing with mods on singleplayer for a lot of time and even had a hacker give me about 10mil online but im all fine
recommended
if you liike getting mad all day cause you just spent $70 on a game to play on your only day off this is the game forpiece of  wont launch ive tried all these ing fixes amd drivers did  cant get past the wanted level when launching love it great game 1010 would buy again really worth my time

awesome game great way to waste time although the online has its issues

grand theft auto 5 one of the most anticipated and best selling games ever released on steam in light of the controversy surrounding the modding of the game im going to mostly avoid talking about any of that and actually speak to the quality of the game itself rockstars policy on modding is a separate discussion altogether and shouldnt factor into a review of the vanilla game experience itself gta 5 was the last game i ever purchased for my aging xbox 360 i thought it was pretty fun and that the characters and story were interesting however the decade old 360 was incapable of rendering the game to its full potential pop in and constant lag detracted from the experience worst of all though was the aiming god i hated the aiming left trigger> auto target enemy right trigger> shoot so easy i could literally beat entire shootout sections by just alternating between the two triggers the joysticks were far too imprecise to allow for reliable manual targeting throughout the experience i always thought to myself  if i only had a mouse and keyboard and finally after nearly two years the game has come to pc i never completed the game on the 360 but i finally just finished it on pc i never played the multiplayer heists on the 360 but now i heist all the time on the pc whats changed why do i like this version of the game so much more more than anything its the controls i love being able to aim accurately without the auto aiming feeling like a crutch i love how the game manages 60 frames per second and still manages to fill los santoss streets with believable amounts of lalike traffic i love that i can switch between mouse and xbox controller flawlessly without any need for setting changes the performance is great on a variety of systems as far as i can tell this game has been delayed many times for the pc but rockstar has really saved the undeniably best version for last with the availability of mods im sure to play this game for the forseeable future just to see what kind of physics based wacky mayhem i can cause since this game has been out for so long and there is already so much written about it im going to assume base knowledge of the games plot you can switch between three characters which is an amazing innovation for rockstar to have implemented theres michael the washed up middle aged retired bank robber franklin the young gangbanger from the hood trying to make some scrilla and finally theres trevor the crazed hillbilly meth head each character is interesting enough in their own right but its their interactions and dealings with one another that is the heart of the story they all have different motivations and ideologies and it never gets old watching them bounce off of one another my one complaint is that franklins character is the leased fleshed out having enjoyed gta san andreas i was hoping to have some more of that hood gangster feel with some insight into franklins background there was never much resolution to franklins continuing dissonance with his beginnings as he gets wealthier and wealthier by working with these older professionals which was what i thought was the most intriguing aspect of his story arc however i think that this problem is due to the fact that with three characters you can only spend so much time with each of them and still put together a cohesive game in addition to this the game has several different endings but only one of them really makes any sense in my opinion youll see what i mean when you get there the singleplayer will take a long time to beat even if you only do the main missions but theres tons of activities and races and random encounters and small story strings tantalizing you to uncover the game is beautiful and huge from the sprawling metropolis of los santos and the desert outskirts of blaine county and is a great testament to how developers can and should make an open world game compared to assassins creeds and far crys world which may seem to be huge gta5 has much more life and interesting sights and sounds that actually prompts you to explore versus just boring mileage between you and your next objective ubisoft has yet to come to grips with this idea that quantity of space does not equal quality of content theres so much to see and do and the obsessive attention to detail is ridiculous at times you can sit and watch television programs that are fully animated and voiced the radio stations which plays better music than any station ive ever heard have notable djs such as kenny loggins and jesco white the countryside is full of a variety of wildlife which hearkens a bit back to red dead redemption there are many secrets to find and so many locations to explore i doubt ill ever truly uncover everything there is there is a multiplayer component of the game which is one of the best ideas that i possibly can think of for any gta game what better way to enhance your experience in mayhem than to share it with friends rockstar is definitely ambitious in its approach allowing players to own their own apartment cars and allowing extensive customer characterization as well as customization of fun scenarios besides the rockstar created content the rockstar created missions are serviceable enough if not a bit cliched the heists are multi part scenarios that require a cooperative team and have huge payouts and i think thats what i enjoy the best if only with friends some of the problems with multiplayer is that the loading times are really killing the experience quit a game and then load join a game and then load be transferred to a game load ive probably spent a solid 5 hours of my playtime just looking at loading screens another issue is that apparently theres quite a bit of hacking going on which nobody likes in any multiplayer game this ties back to the modding issue as its difficult to tell the difference between a multiplayer hack and a singleplayer mod i personally view the mass banning of people who use single player mods as a misguided attempt to curb the hacking epidemic however this is still an issue and shouldnt be overlooked to be honest im a bit afraid to use mods but hopefully itll all get sorted out soon rockstar definitely needs to make the distinction clearer to avoid wrongful bans in conclusion gta 5 is a expansive beautiful world which you can lose yourself in for hours or just kill some stress by running ever some pedestrians its a violent and gritty experience at times for sure but there are times when cruising up a mountain pass with the sun setting behind me and watching the thousands of lights of the city flicker on i forget i was playing a grand theft auto game there is much hilarious fun in multiplayer to be had if you dig around a bit to find it anyone who has enjoyed gta in the past should definitely pick this up and even those who are new to the series should strongly consider it this game is more than just a video game it is a fantastic experience that all gamers deserve to enjoy

it takes awhile to load the game but hey this is a 59gb game man so far theres only occasional hang for few seconds during my game play mostly are caused by my nvidia gt640m 2gb otherwise i will be able to run this game at 25  30 fps this game is absolutely addictive be prepared for not stepping outside for at least a week
recommended
its the same as the consoles but feels completely different no more tapping the aim button for autoaim amazing port as well
recommended
an open world to enjoy on a quiet afternoon solo or with total chaos with friends the single player story is unforgettable with enduring characters and tons of hidden treasures if solo play is not your thing you can create your own character and go online to enjoy los santos with your friends or meet some new ones both styles provide a stunning environment to play in and a wide variety of customizations available this is the latest chapter in what is easily one of my favorite series of all time

so much fun to play this game  if you play with your friend you gonna having fun more than singleplayer d

for the first time ever i am not going to recommend a gta title the single player is just not as engrossing as previous storylines whether its due to multiple protagonists or the company becoming fat old rich guys whatever it is its just not doing it for me the comedy is not funny i didnt even bother listening to the radio its just not engrossing multiplayer was awesome in spite of itself and id still be playing if it didnt have a random chance of crashing on every load particularly during heists which are the most fun thing to do in gta5 online even when its working though it is stiff clunky slow and unwieldy this would be forgivable if there werent so many online titles out there to learn from but there are and rockstar have clearly been too arrogant or lazy to learn from other companys in short it could have been great but its not buy it down the track on special or something or wait for them to iron out the billions of bugs at the moment and at full price its just not worth it

if you are purchasing this game on pcmac for the sole purpose of modding dont you will get banned from gta online even if you dont go into online mode i hadnt even tried to go online after a couple of days of modding and when i tried to go online yes even after i uninstalled all of my mods i couldnt because i used mods in storymode

please do not that every negative review on gta v is just because a bunch of pc gamer wannabes want mods gta does not need mods it doesnt require mods its a game that you actually have to try and play too bad the baby cant have the candy oh boo  hoo if you wanna mod a game so badly go mod skyrim or go play garrys mod look the game doesnt even need an fov mod they have a field of view slider in their settings i have mine at max due to me having a 2k computer so if you read the reviews and think its bad then think again most of it is just a bunch of people who rely too much on cheats and mods to remember that true gaming doesnt need mods if you teach yourself how to play properly you can pretty much play like youre modding oh hey there is a term for that modder communityits called skill gta requires it from you mods wont help you with it die too much online go play single player die too much there too well its not halo or c of duty so you may wanna switch up how you play this game is a true 810 the online is 910 single player tells the story of how 2 ex friends and a young adult slowly taking over the city while online you do the same but as your own persona why would you need mods for this well ask the modders that question they seem to be on their hands and knees to rockstar about it well the same happened in rdr and rockstar still bans modders there too so give up modders and actually try to play the f game this time

gtav offers beyond a doubt a vast array of activities you can do even after finnishing the main campaign however i personally do not enjoy most of them whilst rockstar clearly put a lot of effort into offering a lot of recreational activities in the game i feel that they somewhat neglected their core gameplay mechanics which are supposed to form the foundation of the game  i experince frequently high input lag where my character receives his orders about 1  5 seconds too late  the gunplay is dated especially those who are not used to playing thirdperson shooters may find gunplay inaccessible and punishing especially in online mode firstperson mode isnt too good of an alternative either especially in online mode seeing as the thridperson view offers better tactical awareness  bad stealth mechanics sure this game isnt a stealth game but if they want to include them then they should make sure that these mechanics are somewhat good this is the type of stealth where as soon as you are spotted every enemy on the entire map is immediately alerted to your exact position even if you killed the enemy finding you before he could even gasp in shock  dated flying mechanics the flying in this game has barely been improved on sure the controls are somewhat solid but not really good it may be fun to bombard enemies in online mode with a jet as much fun as griefing can be but the mechanics are not good enough to make the effort required to procure a jet worthwhile on its own aside from these bad core mechanics rockstars bad customer support and their sanctions against modders further points unfavourably upon this entire experience you might feel tempted to buy it just to see what all the fuss is about but ultimately i would not recommend it i tried to force myself to find an aspect of it that i like but to no avail the campaign offers too little replay value singleplayer outside the campaign gets dull incredibly fast online mode also gets dull and annoying if you do not have friends to play with and the rockstars take on service culture is the final insult i wish i hadnt spent 40 gbp on it i know i will most certainly not spend any money on rockstar products in the future

eng the game does not need to probably do a lot of great presentation super good largely a game the biggest problem is probably the game requirements the game does not want to act anymore even on the new computer almost at all 800x600 minimum setting is the maximum performance for myself which can only be obtained at 30fps and this must not be smaller in order to raise the performance of the game up this does not harm myself was the essence of myself however to get the game to work and that it is playable referral 3 fin peli ei tarvitse varmaankaan paljoa suurta esittely super hyv suurelta osin pelin suurin ongelma lienee pelin vaatimukset peli ei tahdo enn toimia edes uudella tietokoneella lhes ollenkaan 800x600 minimi asetuksilla on maksimi suorituskyky itsellni jolla saa vain 30fps ja tmn pienempi ei saa jotta voisi nostaa pelin suorituskyky yls tm ei kuitenkaan haittaa itseni olennaisinta oli itselleni kuitenkin saada peli toimimaan ja ett se on pelattava suositteluni 3

grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
great game however its glitchy as ing hell rockstar offer almost zero support and dont fix crucial errors tied to the social club i had an error with bluescreens their support recommended that i restart my computer 
not recommended
i preordered this game back in february and i expected to be able to play right off the bat but after 20 attempts at launch every time it stopped responding and closed out to fix this issue rockstar wants me to spend 500 dollars on a new video card and processor of which i dont have on top of thati cant get the money i spent back so thanks rockstar for making me waste 60 bucks
not recommended
hello i bought gta v and i downloaded and every thing was good but when i tried to play rockstar code already in use

great game i never played the console version so there is no way for me to be bias here i have played my fair share of ports and over hyped games that have come to the steam store and in one way or another they are usually not as good or up to par with any of the original versions during the port process often times games will also have very poor conversion and then things become broken or not adjusted to a better gaming experience for pc players however after playing through this game so far i can assure you that it is a magnificent port that runs extremely well for pc unlike a lot of other games the video is steady and works wonderfully while the controls for both keyboard and mouse users or controller users have very well optomised and easy to use dont have any doubts that this game is bad because you will get the same if not a better experience then the previous versions from what i am able to tell online works very smoothly with loads of player activity and a variety of game modes to keep you entertained for a long time while the sttory is very interesting and keeps you wanting more highly recommend it and it is great fun with friends
recommended
game is excellent and good fun for about 30 seconds until the plagued server disconnects kicks you from online sessions seems the problem hasnt been fixed since xbox 360 days to add value to the 60$ purchase the original game file ended up taking 120gb of hardrive space anyone else spend 3 days downloading the file to a 110gb ssd just to find out on launch day there wasnt enough room but that wasnt a big problem what gets me is that rockstar dropped the banhammer on a huge chunk of its gaming crowd including myself taking barley playable online content to just not playable at all
not recommended
look i understand ill get flamed to hell i continue to play the game because well 5999 enough said but i just do not like this game at all the vehicular control is just terrible the griefing is unreal i dont know anything about these so called bans because i just came to the game recently so this negative review has nothing to do with that at all i simply dont like this game its just not as crazy and fun as i thought it would be yes this is my first go with gta online of any kind and no i simply dont recommend it if youre looking for something absurd and not too serious like say maybe saints row iv multiplayer i really came in expecting we could just do what ever we really wanted to without penalty aside from tking other players but thats not entirely the case yeah yeah i should have done more delving into the game to understand what i was buying but with no demo for online multi and youtube videos really only showcasing the over the top awesome moments i just i dont find that at all so far in this game i want that game that i see on youtube where is it here tldr my experience so far shows that there is no jets helicopters or tanks rolling around gunning each other down and stuff such as this going on at all so far my experience is sitting around waiting for a quick job driving around yields no other players to interact with or any players interested in interacting outside of a job not what i expected nor wanted

get it worth the price end of story see you online
recommended
stay away from this game seriously once you have payed them you are of no further use to them thousands of people with game breaking bugs and or issues that are not getting adressed at all if you contact support you are simply given automated responses linking you the same help page you read a hundred times before you contacted them if at some point they actualy get round to fixing this i may be interested in trying to play it again until then dont bother the stress is not worth it
not recommended
over 3 weeks later and i still cant play the game dont let the play time deceive you thats just how long i decided to troubleshoot until i gave up most awards are from transfering accounts rockstar only wants to send irrelevant automated responses once every few weeks to the people who cant get it working correctly even running recommended specs get your refunds while you can and even if you some how manage to get it to work enjoy the hackers 3 weeks after launch and only one job worked lag or glitch free

this is my third time drafting this ing review not because of some   bugs with the game 1st time i closed the browser without submitting the damn thing second time the power in my house flickered at 420am hmmm causing the internet to cut crashing the game mind you i was dumb enough to try and write this thing in the steam browser with the overlay the review i was speeding through an intersection and tboned the  outta a civilian car as i picked myself up from the pavement and started to make my way to my car the driver of the car i hit who survived somehow said it dont matter this here is a rental 1010 right off the bat i found myself enjoying this console to pc port more than ever ive yet to find a port so well done it brings a tear to my eye i dont usually get off my  and write these things but with the comedy from the story line and online i couldnt stand to withhold my opinion of rockstars latest pc release im not a console  pc master race thanks beta consol usrs fer bug fixin d apart from the longer loading screens when playing with people across the atlantic like england and them chaps i feel i was already prepared with the multiple release date setbacks for the game on pc but if those delays truly meant getting the game to its current state on release id like to thank rockstar for doing it i have not had a single game crash graphical issue or some major bug thatd make me wanna refund the game the download was smooth as  and finished in 3 hours dodged the decryption fiesta by purchasing the game the minute it was released somehow still reaping the benefits of the prepurchase offer ive seen a lot of people complaining about bugs and im going to be honest hear and say i highly doubt most of the people with this problem are on windows 7 have a computer from 2013 have an hdd faster than their mothers breaking point could go either way with that and were smart enough to have predicted the strain a game the size of 60gbs would have on the system in whole reminds me of wolfenstein new order 40 gbs for the love of god if you are going to be gaming with high end games dont ever run windows 8 and dont  about  not running cool when your rig is cheaper than $1k and was bough preassembled from dell 7 years ago sure the upfront price is more than a console but the pc can do more than just game it can do your ing homework show your discreetly stored porn for when the time is right and play games that look 5 times better than they do on console lets get to the content because i only have 20 something hours im gonna wait until i accumulate more so i at least look like i did more than just idle the game in the background  wip  three bugs ive encountered that dont really bother me like i stated at the top of this review its my third time drafting the er so when i lost internet unexpectedly i wasnt expecting the entire game to crash whats more i was in the story mode completely removed from online that was the first time my internet has been out in a month so why should i complain alttabbing now this only really happened once and if i recall correctly it happened while i was in a random session up in my apartment building i simply alttabbed and found that i could not alttab back in all of my other alttabbing occasions have gone smooth as hell for whatever reason my weapon attachments will not stay attached in online during missions or heists i can alleviate the issue by making a quick stop at a gun store before heading to the assigned job in a heist but its slightly annoying

gta 5 on the pc is incredible i play the game in high to lowish settings and the game still looks incredible ive completed the story and i was very very impressed apart from a few trevor missons and the tourtre misson i had a few bugs one of which franklin was meant to follow michael but got stuck in the wall and i had to reload part of the misson to fix it the online is also incredible i mainly got the game to play online and i was not dissapointed the heist missons are awsome with a group of freinds all in voice chat but try and play it with other players and no voicechat then you wont stand much of a chance the attention to detail is incredible if you start a certan misson as a certain character you can see it in a differnt point of view to if you started the misson as a different character my rating of this game is 910 because of the few missons that i did not like such as the sidemisson that forces you to record someone having sex a main misson where you play as trevor and very voiolantly kill a bunch of cowboy sort of hillbilly ais  and and a misson were the player is forced to interact with tourtreing a fairly inoccent man

wow this game i dont even like gta seroiuusly its the subject matter but this game if you have a decent rig and enouph ram you will be shocked now ive played some games i played atari in the 70s and 80s i had nintendo playstation xbox played daggerfall the week it came out so i have some prespective this game has something for pretty much everyone want to play gta online alone with nobody blowing youre crap up repeatedlly  done want to cruise around with youre friends  or complete strangers   done want to takle the single player story  which actually exists in this day and age and its good if you can get past the subject matter  done want to cruise around getting money so you can upgrade youre crap get a house and cars etcetc  done maybe you just want to walk the streets marveling at all the sights and the advancement of the gaming landscape  and beleive me it has advanced   done even if youre pc is kinda cheesey this game has got you covered the optimization is apperant this game has had alot of work  the ground looks amazing lol and it shows now i dont know what the big deal is with mods but dang this game is just that good maybe people just really want to add orcs or something which is fine but if you like games and you have an actual 3d card on youre system then its a no brainer you will get youre moneys worth even on low settings it looks good  trust me ive tried them all  just make sure youre pc can run it before you buy it

awesome game and didnt know it was going to be that good on pc brilliant game rockstar

i was viciously chased by a non violent monk in what appeared to be a 1970s sports car it was like the movie the duel except i was on a bmx bike going down a mountain he ended up getting gunned down by police after he got bored of chasing me and robbed a quik e mart i poured one out for my stalker and proceeded to shoot the police by a miracle of some kind he returned to life and me and him proceeded to shoot all the police around us 1010 would get chased again

gta online is quite possibly the finest coop ive ever played
recommended
best gta yet intriguing story fun as hell multiplayer and no you do not get banned for using mods on singleplayer only for multiplayer which is fair imo people like to jump the gun on any misinformation they can get their hands on
recommended
story so the character stories were less of a parody but more realistic but ungrateful kids and a nagging wife too realistic 45 graphics great well optimized 55 music what youd expect from gta the only real fault in this game is the constant whiny biness of trevor cant really blame michael cause hes only deflecting the flak hes getting stfu trevor you whiny b you make soap operas look like masterpieces of art
recommended
its gta nuff said

you can shoot doges many fun very storymode such multiplayer wow10

pros incredible amount of detail very long game 56 hrs of game play and im currently at 60% never a dull moment cons  1010 would recommend

first of all i have to say that im white and not a racist but i was in the strip club as franklin and wanted to jerk off so i got my stripper and went in a private stall but when i toouched her i was creeped out that my hand was black after that i never jerked off while in the strip club as franklin again
recommended
this is more about the online play okay so the long delays the game went through at the start was stressful but when we finally got a realease i was expecting alot better then what we actaully got there are still alot of bugs and the connecting is terrible at times the character movement is horrible it feels so bulky and is hard to control which is really frustrating now moving onto some nicer things about the game the world you play in is beautiful and the shootingdriving is really easy to control but i swear its like the ai are trying to annoy you on purpose sometimes heists are fun and interesting but i was annoyed at the fact that we only got 2 bank heists and one of them was an introduction good game thats why i reccomend it but there are alot of little things letting the game down
recommended
my computer keeps freezing when i put it on full screen someone help
recommended
really good  buy it play it love it
recommended
this is seriously the best gta i have ever played this is the true gta v experience and this is how the developers wanted the game to be i really really love this game 1010

one of the best ports initially i had some freezeup issues that were fixed with a simple restart ever since then its been running like a dream at highvery high settings specs amd fx6350 about what you need to have an enjoyable experience nvidia gtx 660 runs everything at 3060 fps at 1920 with aa off 8gb 1600mhz ram may not be enough currently unless this stutter problem is fixed 7200 rpm hdd the game uses some streaming data so make sure its on a decent hard drive ie not an external one 710 port not only does it run well they gave us many features from the start that the peasents didnt get also the first person mode is awesome i was very surprised at this edit the stuttering seems to have come back and way worse after about 45 minutes of gameplay it begins to eat up all your ram and wants it hits about 90% usage the game starts stuttering to all hell the stutters last anywhere between half a second to a second and can be as frequent as less than a second between makes the game unplayable after about 2 hours and requires a restart gonna knock off three points for this 710 story trevor knocks off three points  killed jonny 1010 singleplayer albeit not as well written as iv its still great fun and i played it through twice enjoying both times 1010 gameplay gunplay is somewhere between max payne 3 and gta iv lots of extra things to do driving feels better than iv 610 multiplayer online structure doesnt support modding and can often seem like a grind if you have no friends to play with not to mention the kuruma  the kuruma 810 game
recommended
best game i have ever playedseriously though this game had a lot of hype and it completly backed it up
recommended
its been 8 days and 2 patches later still cant play due to crashing 10 would waste $90 again

gta5 is great better than gta4 good history and you have a family never i thought that a gta serie would have a character with wife and kids well is not perfect but is what you have in the game mike is the only character that really matters something in the plot well he is the protagonist trevor and franklin is easy forgettable i dont have to say that is worth to buy the game right
recommended
a great game with a story that captures and holds your attention the fact you nerds need fov changers is laughable without all the butthurt morons this game would be straight positive reviews
recommended
great game for just wanting to release stress 
recommended
rockstar loves the pc comunity they gave us the best version need i say more
recommended
whos the master platform now

definately the best in their series of gtas could use some work on their optimizations but oh well runs good enough on my rig after 120 hours still a fun game
recommended
the best game of 2015
recommended
still just as fun as on both gen consoles
recommended
the best $60 you can spend in 2015

glad i skipped the console version was worth the wait
recommended
best game of century
recommended
1010 would recommend
recommended
1010 fun to play apart from the annoying people in online who go on rampages but other that that its great and a lot of fun
recommended
the single player game is pretty good though its difficult for me to enjoy with my gamers apathy inability to enjoy playing most games it doesnt really do anything new but it does what it does very well unfortunately the multiplayer seems to have a bit of a hacker problem right now for the most part you might not have a problem but then you might run into a person who cant be killed and revels in killing you over and over thats frustrating to be sure id say yes id recommend this only because i guess most people would enjoy it then again there are those who wouldnt enjoy it myself being one of them the game is capable of producing some great moments which make it worth it but have a bad experience with someone cheating online and youre likely to have a reverse opinion of the game
recommended
the long wait for this title to come to pc was well worth it visually impressive hilarious story and the online has room for plenty of hours to be spent only complaints i have thus far is queue times for your own heists can be difficult if you do not have a preselected group
recommended
awesome game ever you must play
recommended
buy this game now if you havent already why are you looking at the reviews you shouldnt have made it down hear you should have immediately bought the game but if for some reason you want to read a review by me then here you go pros graphics array of weapons array of vehicles better car physics no boat cars captain rpg like multiplayer trevor micheal franklin insurance cons loading screens literally hell sniper npcs those damn cops can snipe insurance my damn kuruma costs $1000 to get from insurance company review 1010 ign buy this if you can because well because i said so and i believe that we should spread this game to everyone
recommended
just pure amzing

i spent around 20 hours in game and no one called me to go bowling 420420 totally recomend this game its freaking awesome i am also thankful that the game launched and runs without any problems on an amd computer amd cpu and amd gpu i am really surprised
recommended
if you can get it to work its really freaking a whole lot of fun this game has redeemed itself it gets a thumbs up from me if your fps are really low make the second slider in advanced graphic turn off
recommended
game is full of hackers warning if a hacker shoots you with money bags you will get a ban not the f hacker nice going rockstar i told them i had video proof that i was teleported and shot with money bags on my gta 5 account from rockstart support to answer your question it is damaging the integrity of the game to accept virtual currency ingame from other players as gifts this is because it works against the games design the appropriate actions are taken against the accounts of those who abuse the ingame economy or interfere with the designed game experience
not recommended
an absolute masterpiece and truly the definitive version of gta v buy this game as soon as you can its worth every penny
recommended
thank you for the good game freemasons and friends has done a good game as usually
recommended
great game but im pretty sure i spent atleast two full hours so far on loading screens so 910 for the excessive ing loading
recommended
excellent game this is by far the best iteration of it if youve got the right rig it will run to your satisfaction think need for speed meets 007 everything or nothing in a truly open world topped with interesting characters amidst a compelling narrative plastered in cynical satire and a volley of direct unapologetic critiques about modern western culture also a great way to blow off steam
recommended
 well written story central characters and plot  story missions side missions encounters etc  witty funny npc character banter and comments  graphics  atmosphere  art style  open world sandbox with great physics  radio stations lowdown 911 is just killer  great npc ai including animals  modding  rpg elements  first person view i fondly remember the first time i flew out of my windshield  taxi cab fasttravel is a great feature  initial client load makes me wait an entire 10 seconds before i can play  i dont really like rottweilers but chop is still pretty cool 1010 worth every penny

my imo score 1010 why dont have to answer romans calls anymore because he isnt in the game seriously though here are my points story i havent played it yet but based on my brothers gameplayit is really well crafted and very unpredictable except for some parts there are also a lot of twists in the storythe inclusion of 3 protagonists was also done very good with each of their respective special abilities cheat codes are fun too online i played about 99% of my time in online the community as i expected is sos or shootonsight kind of players so you dont really have a room for making friends the real fun comes when you are playing with your friends the jobs are actually good and make a really stable source of moneybeware thoughvehicles are very pricey and it will be a while until you bought your first legitimate vehicle it will still be longer before you bought your first apartment too although they are very expensive they give you a safe haven from the rampaging players that shoot you down with no remorse they also give your owned cars a safe place where other players cant blow them up and you have to call the insurance company to get it back the most expensive ones looks something that only iron man can buyhell the garage already looks like a house heists my favourite part of online they are cooperative missions that need good teamplay and effective communications the succeeding heists after the first one are extremely hard without teamwork but it really feels good once you bring home the bacon it gives you a darn lot of money especially if you are heist leader i got 200k once the problem is that most of the players who joins your heists are 1 noobs who cant do  2 people who dont know what to do 3 people who perform their roles poorly and 4just incompetent s who sit around  while you and possibly others are getting  by the police however when someone you know or trust gets together on one crew you can have actually fun and it doesnt even feel that you are competing you also burn through heists quickly and you level up fast optimization hell this console port doesnt even feel like it truly the pc master race has prevailed the graphics looks very beautiful the streets and cities are very lively the effects are truly stunning all this runs on my decent laptop with the following specifications gtx 860msingle intel core i74710hq 25ghz34 16 gb ram it runs around 4060 fps on very high settings with no aa and on 1920x1080 there is a little stuttering and screen tearing but it isnt really noticeable and it is just probably my eyes getting damaged from playing gta v constitently well thats all i could say for this review this review will be updated as the game also updates on pc
recommended
the launch is quite a disaster apart from the windows user name issue my nvidia optimus laptop can not open the gta v launcher luckily i managed to play the game with a workaround apart from that the game is quite optimized and able to run on my laptop and the graphics is just too awesome the environment is so realistic that you are easily immersed in it with the first person perspective plus the game has countless hours of online gameplay and single player you would not be bored for months 60 usd is a steal for this game

in spite of everything is the best game today 710 i like the fact of being able to smoke cigarette hit a bong and drink alcohol if and when i want managing three protagonists sucks this causes the player does not identify himself as the protagonist and main character unlock things only near the end of game has no sense after all when the game ends you dont need anything things are necessary only during the game in the story mode cant customizing the character sucks rockstar needs to improve on the faces of the characters the online character customization sucks and is very limited customization of vehicles is also very limited lack the full nudity of hookers in private dances the loss of focus introduced by rockstar in games nowadays drivability of the helicopters and drivability of military aircraft in online races and in online flight school makes me angry was an absurd show the toughest guy of the gta series johnny klebtz as a crybaby and a weakling and show the leadership of the lost and damned as weaklings and cowards this contradicts totally the episodes from liberty city ps this game is not for casual players fun fact you can choose niko bellic as your father for online game
recommended
very good game with perfect graphics and storyhighly recommendedbut need update for low end graphic cards just like gta iv need patch
recommended
overall a great version of the game it feels very at home on pc and not like a rushed port seriously it should be great though as everyone knows how long it took to arrive i was one of the crazy ones that got it on xbox 360 xbox one and now pc every new version was a strong update and got me into the game again the pc version is incredible and i highly recommend it to everyone i have not had any issues running the game on my end for those that do have issues i hope they get sorted out quickly so you can enjoy this beautiful game

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

if you consider getting this primarily for the singleplayer experience go ahead and snag it up its amazing the story is great the world feels alive theres lots of activities wildlife and 81 squarekilometres of land to explore online on the other hand really has its issues with long loading times nonintuitive and sometimes unresponsive menus connection errors and crashes for some theres also less car variety and no wildlife in online mode and the world seems to have less details compared to what it offers in sp its fun with friends yes but everything is fun with friends i can not wholeheartedly recommend this game for its online mode at 60 or your regional equivalent tldr interested primarily in singleplayer  feel free to buy at full price interested primarily in multiplayer  wait for a sale

encountered game breaking glitch were police would shoot me i am a white character so i dont understand what is happening rockstar please fix your game other than that its a great port gets my but hole puckered

probably the most important good thing about gta v is that for its money it offers you more than any triplea game on a market without necessity to buy dlcs\season passes and other cancerous  you pay for a complete decently optimized and goodlooking game that can take about 60 hours for a single playtrough add some more if you are 100% junkie my steam says i played for 51 hours and finished 765% and even more if you are willing to play gta online which is not that great in standart game mods but might pleasantly surprise you and 3 of your friends in online heists mode story is a great mix of actioncomedy and crime drama genres with not a single moment being wasted full of wellwritten and perfectlyacted characters beautifully directed cutscenes and gameplay moments with seamless transitions from one to another the ost feels right both the official score and radio tracks programming and attention to details makes the gameworld alive and natural i can only think of 2 reasons why a person may not like gta v assuming this particular person likes video games 1 you just dont play action or openworld games at all 2 you dont like playing as a bunch of bad guys with a necessity of killing cops federal agents and a military personal other than that gta v is without a doubt the best openworld action game and a commercial product of a great quality and pleasureperdollar value 10\10

amazing story mode with an envolving story and memorable characters along with fluid gameplay being one of the best single player modes ive ever played about gta online it is definitely the best multiplayer out there if you are looking for some fun time white friends
recommended
almost certainly the definitive version of the game amazing graphics runs smooth with little to no drops in fps for me at least great story and gameplay it does take a little bit to load onto online servers but when you so get on it is well worth the wait loads of content and gamemodes to keep you playing for hours well worth the price 9510

just like old time san andreas and gta v bought that game into this franchise man nostalgia in this game is awesome
recommended
i would have to say having read others reviews and having my own experience i would not recommend this game im not saying the game itself is bad i loved what little time i had to enjoy however that said it is a game plagued with problems for pc users multiplayer is effectively ruined by hackersmodders i saw hackers rampage on a server in the few minutes i had online thats enough for me single player just does not work and crashes after 510 mins spent a day trying various fixes but to no avail i dont intend on reinstalling my whole system another time or re downloading 60 odd gigs of data several more times for those of you who can run this game well done im jelous but im not wasting time on this

i dont write many reviews in fact i dont know if i ever have before but i went out my way to write one because gta is just broken i mean single player is great no problem there except from the modding community but if youre buying this game to mainly play online which is why i did pull out a bottle of advil and put it next to your desk because this game is going to make you wanna pop those pills like they were pop rocks the sheer amount of hackers online are staggering if you join an online server with more than 15 people in it you are bound to encounter a hacker i can almost guarantee it ive played my fair share of online games hackers pop up here and there but i try not to let it ruin the experience of the game in gtas case theres just no way around it even if you avoid hackers on the map they just mess with you from a distance im so tired of joining a server and having a hacker clone a 100 copies of my character to make my game crash the first time it was kind of funny second time not so much having it done to me over 20 times is a bit ridiculous i mean come on r you ban good people for wanting to change their fov yet are completely ignorant to the overwhelming amount of hackers if you want to hack money into your game i honestly wouldnt blame r for turning a blind eye who cares if people are lazy but i do take issues when it comes to people making a game unplayable for other people in its current state gta online is not ready plain and simple they need to add some sort of anticheat system or something along those lines if other games can do it so can you r tldr buy game if you want to play single player dont buy if you plan to play gta online hackers in almost every server that can easily cause you game to crash without warning

this game is great for new players and players who have owned the game on current gen or old gen consoles for players coming from console i can say it is well worth paying for the community are alot nicer you rarely see people kill you for no reason like you do on console online also has the chatbox which makes it alot easier to host events and things in a lobby every player will see it and most likely read it and maybe join in with what you are hosting  for singleplayer you can use mods which just makes the game so much fun there are a variety of mods out there that lets you pretty much do what you want but i would be careful about what mods you are installing as some of the mods secretly transfer over to multiplayer which gets you banned so for now i would install the mods and just play singleplayer and when you want to go online close the game and deleteuninstall the mods then play again and you will be fine 
recommended
this game clearly had alot to live up to and i think rockstar deliver time and time again

really nice game

ive played this game since 2013 on my xbox360 and ever since it came out i fell in love with it story is amazing aswell as the multiplayer sure its a grindfest having to rank up to leverl 80 before you can do anything but its still amazingly fun im always playing it with my cousin and other friends always doing heists starting street wars with rival gangs or even cruising with my friends in our million dollar cars i couldnt recomend this game enough it is truely the perfect game if you havent bought it yet for some unkown reason i would highly recomend you do it after reading this review if you ever want to play dont hesitate to add me httpsocialclubrockstargamescommemberconstipatedpixel and if youd like to join our crew heres a referal httpsocialclubrockstargamescomcrewrabid_monkys my system for prefrences amd a85600k apu radeon hd 7870 2gb msi 8gb ram unknown brand i can play it on a mixture of high and medium settings with the fps ranging from 7040 dips in frames arent very noticable only in certain areas of the map

i actually never wrote a review before but after playing gta v i decided to do it o the game is totally out of concept the storyline is about family problems spending time with your children and chasing after your cheating wife there are also unnecessary activities like yoga and tennis they did even put it in some of the missions and that made it very boring the game doesnt give me the feeling that im playing gta but the sims _ however the graphics are amazing and the requirements are low the gameplay is also nice so i can still recommend it
recommended
awesome game with great gameplay and many funny mods

firstly please keep in mind this review comes from someone who played vice city psp and iv pc and wasnt very fond of either this isnt written from an experienced gta player what first got me to like this game was how well made it was how smooth and polished it was on the tutorial and later open word was then there was the attention to detail after i found myself watching 15minutes of realtime watching ingame telivision yeah i was kind of impressed ] gun play to me seemed very well made practical compared to the previous two games i played not including vice city as that was on a psp not fair to compare i wont mention the story for obvious spoiler all ill say is so far im enjoying it as with all open world games i love the various ways to do things whether meaningless or story based at the moment saving up for a sniper to see if i can snipe my way through missions my rig is a budget amd build 8350  270x and it plays 4050 on high not the highest which is very high had some troubles adjusting settings even making them fully normal or off lowest possible and started hitting 3040fps on those fixed when i used recommended settings so not sure whats up with that thanks for reading will update this with anymore details or complaints the more i play ]

excellent graphics excellent gameplay excellent story the online experience is could be better its much better if youre playing with a group of friends using teamspeak or skype to communicate otherwise dont expect to talk to anyone ive heard lots of stories about online hackers cheaters and connection issues but i only play with friends in a private session and have no issues whatsoever modding in single player is a blast and worth doing  but remember to remove the mod files before you go online cant recommend this game enough

one of the best games i have ever played a little crude mind youdef not for kids but pure fun

gta 5 is so far the best gta and possibly game ever made its optimization is very well made as i can play it on my 3 years old midrange laptop smoothly connected to ips monitor played in fullhd the story is well designed as well and the online play is very enjoyable as you can level up your character and buy more stuff as you go along 1010 game for sure

the goods and bads of gtav of course these are just my opinions but feel free to agree or disagree lets start with the good items 1 lotsa cars and customization sure not everycar can be completely decked out but where else can you turbocharge an electric scooter 2 plenty of activities to do racing killing fyling killing robbing storebanks killing 3 passive mode for when the kids with jets attack 4 own up to 30 cars at 1 time given you have 3 ten car garages apartments 5 alot of weapon choices 6 singleplayer is pretty amazing  3 characters and and a pretty great storyline also with numerous activities and now onto the bad things 1 just about everything costs money why would i pay $500 just to kill myself in mp 2 some things are heavily overpriced sure it keeps things in check so everyone isnt cruising around in a bugatti veyron or lamborghini venino but $50000 just for a pilots suit that only functions cosmetically 3 you cant sell any weapons every weapon you buy is stuck in your inventory for eternity and just stuffs up your weapon wheel some poeple are ok with it other people find it annoying 4 be prepared to join a community more toxic than chernobyl sure not all servers are bad but occasionally you get servers with kids rolling around in jets blowing you up with their op cannons repeatedly or the guys who only bought the game just to make your gameplay experience a living hell 5 hackers oh yeeee hackers always find their way in games especially gta not all hackers are out just ruin everyones experience but it gets annoying trying to find a server where there isnt a guy is just blowing everyone up with their magical powers 6 swear block if youre going to make a game 18 keep it 18 dont just give in and make it kidfriendly all of sudden by removing our ability to swear god d if anything the negatives are mostly just a setback to the game rather than a complete deal breaker which is why im thumbsupping it it is possible even with the negatives to have a pretty good game experience even better if you have friends to play with as long as you have the parince to play your going to have an exceptional time just make sure you take these setbacks into consideration before buying the game and dont think that its gonna be a smooth easy ride to the top ranks of online unless you have alot of cashmoney to blow on shark cards online currency then you probably can do whatever you want
recommended
i pretend to be a bus driver and kill anyone who crashes into my bus 10 outta 10
recommended
there isnt much to say since the title of the game speaks for itself basically gta 5 is the gta that we wanted for the nextgen and the amount of things added makes it have a lot of replay especially for those who enjoy exploring and finding little easter eggs and things i know i typically do longer reviews but for a game like this there is no need to really do one if you enjoy gta as a game then you will like this the only things to keep into consideration si that the online version where you play with other people is sometimes plagued with hackers and that is annoying also make sure your rig can handle this the graphics are demanding and i can see its effects on my machine if you cant run games like skyrim at ultra without lag then you wont be able to handle this even on low the graphics while still good are demanding overall fun game so many things to do so many gta things present and um yeah good game
recommended
ive played this game thrice now each time on a different platform each version has been more fun and chaotic than the last my first playthrough was on the now inferior xbox 360 the graphics were gorgeous they were a sight to see third person shooter 3 playable characterswho worked together in heists and missions gameplay was solid the attention to detail in this game is amazing and youll have to play it to know what i mean now here is where one of my favorite multiplayer experiences ever comes in gta online its really hectic and not quite what i had in mind after watching trailers and stuff but still on october 1st 2013 my friends and i went to our houses and logged into xbox live we decided to make our crew we kept going back and forth on names and when we went to enter them they had all been taken then my friend luke told us to just start playing while he got a name 15 minutes later he says quietly done two seconds later i get an invite to the love bunny crew and our crew tag was love jesus that makes me laugh every time we had a blast it almost felt like dayz in the sense that you couldnt really trust anyone except in here unlike dayz almost everyone was a total prick at least in dayz there is about a 5050 chance that they are friendly ugh anyway i loved it but then i lost my disc in mid2014 i heard about a possible port er remaster to the nextgen currentgen really consoles id had a ps4 since december 15th 2013 exactly one month after its launch and almost a year later gta was being released for it keep in mind my current gaming machine was built in early january a few weeks before the release this trailer was released showing off gta v in first person this was mindblowing for me i had always wondered what it would be like to have a gta v in first person since i saw some gameplay of gta san andreas and gta iv in first person i thought it was going to be gamechanging in reality while it is nifty its kind of gimmicky i went to gta online and found out that i could transfer my old 360 character boy was i excited same drill really fun openworld chaos and the multiplayer was the same ol shoot first ask never routine it was fun but the my machine was built two months after in early january that next year i was ready for the pc version to come out because i wanted a game that could bring my machine down to its knees this isnt the game i can run this 60 frames per second easily director mode and rockstar editor were added this time around pretty much the whole reason that i bought it again worth it the other day i tried going back to the ps4 version mainly because id misplaced my keyboard that day  dont ask and it was unbearable 30 frames per second no mods and jesus christ did the ps4 crash it i dont know does a bear  in the woods so in short pc goodness 1010 would club hooker to death again

you could play this game forever and never get bored after i beat the main story i was just running around punching people in the face for my strength to rise i kept doing it for a hours until i punched the wrong person and got chased by a gang of chicos before i ended up dying i decided to switch to trevor bad move he had a wanted level of 4 and was in a high speed chase at the time i decided to say screw it and got out of the car and went rambo on the cops chasing me i had a grenade launcher so it was pretty easy to clean them up after that i hid an underpass tunnel and waited for the cops to stop looking since my health was low when they finally did i left to go steal a car and was hit by one instead trevor died

it took a long time to come out but it finally has and it is still worth it the story is great and i still played it eagerly after already playing it on the xbox one a few months ago the gameplay is also very good the graphics look great and its not as hard to run as youd expect it to be the map is gigantic and full of fun interactive events like rampages strangers and freaks missions and random events and of course its gta so you can run around stealing cars shooting a pedastrian just because he got a small scratch on your super car which you then get a wanted level for so you blow up a police helicopter and eventually get a five star wanted level all whilst youre in a pink car wearing nothing but your underwear

this is a lovely game that you can enjoy for hours there is so much to do and interact with just make sure your system can handle the load of this huge game i see a lot of people give negative reviews becasue it was laggy and they probably didnt look at the requairements i do think that the summer sale price was stupid but that is not the game itself so many people gave the game a bad review just becuase of the price it is a hit game and you should be surprised that it even would go on sale the sale is basically giving you $1250000 in game cash for free with your purchase so why complain although a huge problem is the fact that modders run wild you just have to hope they are not trolls and are nice

i got to say this is my first gta game so i had a lot of expectations that needed to be met in order for me to like this game but i cant really compare it to previous games all my expectations were from hearsay i got this game when it first came out but due to finals i wasnt able to play it that much until may ive since put 144 hours into this game the most i have done with any game that i own on steam in that month and all that time has been in multiplayer i havent even touched the singleplayer this game is so good that my dad who pretty much only plays wow saw me playing this and decided to get this game and has loved it it would take me too long to describe the pros for this game so here are the cons  i have had issues with my latest driver gefore 980 and this game which has caused me to crash multiple times however its a simple fix all i have to do is go and instal the 34786 driver i havent fully tested this out but i think the problem was when i had nvaa running ill be sure to edit this to see if it works out  it can take you a while to get some of the more expensive objects such as vehicles or appartments but if you do heists and missions you can get that money in a surprisingly quick time while still having a blast  if you dont have 3 other friends to do heists you will be waiting for randoms to join your game however the wait time has decreased significantly since the game first came out now you might only have to wait 3 minutes but there is a good chance that it will be full sooner than that  there is no way for you to give money to your friends but that is understandable because that is how the hackers were able to give sooo much money so its understandable why on the note of hackers are there hackers yes do you see them frequently more often than not you dont but you can from time to time are the hackers a bad thing absolutely not they dont ruin the gameplay at all because 1 if they decide to be  and start killing you you just go into passive mode and they cant do anything to you 2 if you dont feel like going into passive mode you can always join another server that wont have one and it is as if nothing ever happened 3 half the time you can get money from them because most of them are nice 4 they turn the crazyness of gta online from 10 to 11 there have been times where there were ufo saucers in the middle of downtown los santos blowing people up and my only reaction was laughing because i just got blown up by a god damn ufo xd overall i got to say this game is amazing i know that some of the cons may seem really outstanding but thats because i havent listed the awesomeness and hilarity of this game it is absolutely normal to be driving down the street crash into a npc car get mad at it shoot the driver start going on a rampage because  it why not accidentally shoot a player by accident i mean that it was unfortunate that the player had to cross paths with you during your rampage so now they must die they get mad they call in a helicopter they start shooting at you with missiles and machine guns and then the next thing you know the entire server is fighting each other in downtown los santos with so many cops shooting at anyone and everyone that you would have thought that the national guard was being called in all because you were doing 100 in downtown and got mad that you lost control of your car and slammed into a npc

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

its a good game the storyline is fantastic the online has its fun moments but the servers netcode and matchmakinglobbies are absolutely terrible not to mention theres a hacker in almost every lobby now the regular content releases bring a solid amount of new content but the bug fixes roll out at an alarmingly slow rate

its a very loud to say about the game online it looks like primitive multiplayer thats all about story mode i find myself boring playing the story there are many good moments in story but this thing with jumping from mike then jump to trevor then again jump to mike i get use to play one hero like it was in gta 4 or sa gta 5 online mode not impressed me because of closed clokin bell fast food restaurants 1 strip club per huge city are you serious why my hero cant sit on bench in park what century game is this 1990 we have 2015 outside and gta still have no interactive with open world shame on you for this rockstar damn why wont you took everything good from all gta series and put it in one gta 5 i know the answer it because of ps4 thats why im shure that we will not see something really interesting in gta 5 onli sorry gta 5 multiplayer but ofcourse we will see more and more clothes and many new carspathetic i show thumb up only because i respect gta games

i have to mentioned that i played this game on the 360 before i got it on pc so for me it not worth paying the full price of a new game just to play trough the same game again just with better graphics if you are a first time player this game is 100% worth it else you will play it a few hours just for the woows of better graphics and then realise it the same game you played before sure mods are fun to use and add something more to the game but the fact that you cannot play with mods with your friends online really eliminate the fun you can have with your friends and i am very disapointed rockstar did not allow mods online even if it was just on private lobbys if you are new to gta v buy it you will have a lot of fun hours if you already played it on one of the consoles i dont recommend buying it since its the same game you already played with better graphics wait for a sale my recommended price cannot be more than $25 if you already went trough it

great game been playing this series for as long as i can remember and being the first actual game besides mario paint for snes that started my desensitizing process much improved from gta 4 definitely for online also yes theres hackers but i joined a crew that relies mainly on crew sessions problem solved everyone else that cant do that is just being a  about it speaking of es im giving you a negative rating for the same reason as the last 1000 reviews you were a golden company at one point  this game at todays day isnt worth full price if you fixed your  i know you wont then sure put it up to 8000 regularly so to recap good game there are options to stay away from hackers get the  out of your mouth and remember we keep you in business fix hacking problems and jack up price atleast then youd actually have a reason to

youre probably going to buy this game regardless of any reviews or have already done so but i would warn you that the game requires memory both vram and ram for me it uses about 5 gigs of ram and around 17 gigs of vram so make sure you have plenty of memory and a good video card if you have an old processor like i have an old amd one you wont be experiencing butter smooth 60 fps gameplay regardless the game is still playable the framerate is still rather stable even if low at times its much better optimized than gta4 thats for sure so singleplayer works rather well what about multiplayer not so well long loading times bugs exploitable glitches hacking to be honest the networking in gta online is horrendous when considering the games budget did you like to play with mods in gta4 multiplayer well gta online has all kinds of stats and money that is universal so mods are prohibited altogether to prevent cheating this system because the client program the game itself has all authority on your online stats rockstar cannot trust you to inject any kind of code into it this is the laziest and cheapest possible networking design in a game that has the largest development budget in history dont get me wrong gta online is fun at times but rockstar should fix their 
recommended
do i recommend it yes and no story mode great didnt have so much fun since san andreas multiplayer mediocre lots of sessions with less than 10 players and just a few ones with more than 20 cause of this making money or hosting heists is pretty much impossible and takes a long time it could be way better lots of cheaters too but thats not much of a problem when the faultsbugs of the game are more annoying than someone who cant die performance eeehhhmmm fps drops highend gpu random crashes and not so random ones it could be better too i do not recommend this game if you are going for the multiplayer i do recommend it if youre going for the story mode its true that rockstar raised the bar for themselves this time with a decent optimization and not so many bugs but still aint perfect and is far from it

cannot even play the game and they wont give me a refund heard they were workng on an update for users who could not play i guess they dont care about the other players and just gave up

finally gta iv has come out now this is a great game it does however have its pros and cons i wasent really hyped about this game after about a month when it originally released the release dates for the pc version kept being pushed back and the online was having its fair share of issues however when the time came for the pc version i grabbed one to play with friends and i thought it was worth the buy the pros the game features in my own opinion a great story filled with humor and good chracter development the chracters in this game are some of the best out of the whole series i think and they really kept me engaged with the storysingle player the nest big thing was the city for me the city kept me engaged and hooked from the start of the game i felt like the character was realy a part of the city during the campaign and the ai was decent enough to give you a feel of immersion the graphics are good as well as the effects the first person mode was also a big plus for me something new to try and have to say it really makes points of the game very interesting and fun the weapons are nice and offer a decent variety now the cons my first biggest problem with this game is how rockstar handles things by that i mean having to use rockstar social to use this game is a little annoying and the reviews i have been reading about simple mods at times getting people banned and support from rockstar being very weak does not give me much confidence the next big thing i think people should know before buying is that no new heists have been planned so far from what i have read i feel rockstar is really being lazy when it comes to content and some of these heists as well as the next con point dealing with the hackers of the game instead of banning people or letting their software ban people for simple mods they should be banning people who are hacking and making the online experience  for others in the end gta iv is a solid title in the gta series even with its flaws i would recommend this game to my friends and others however i wouldnt recommend it for full price why well for starters this is what the games third release plus with this release there really isnt any new content from the original release which was a pretty good time ago i would recommend waiting for a deal before grabbing this game but i do recommend this game if you are a fan of sandbox games or a fan of previous titles of the series or saints row

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
everyone should already know this game is 1010 its just awesome there endless things to do so get it make some friends and have some fun

wow wow wow gta v makes me cry i cri every tim the whole storyline was just amazing i really bonded with all the characters franklin michael trevor romani mean lamar it was just an awesome action packed fairy tale of a repo gone wrong a jewelry store heist and a mission to fight the fib and merryweather i chose ending c for the final mission i couldnt kill my buds when they pushed devin down that  cliff from the hell that he came from i realized that was the end yeah when i saw the credits i was just devastated i just sat in my chair and watched the credits roll by that was it i just felt empty like the list of story missions left what was i going to do now i thought the campaign would be long as all balls like gta iv or maybe even a story as long as just cause 2 or something but no it was just gone and the rest of the stuff i had on gta v undone was just strangers and freaks it was over $60 to feel sad worth it and after all thati just felti had to do something about it so i played gta online 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999991

do i really need to explain

the best gta game so far sadly game features only los santos it would be great to see san fierro and las venturas great story although it felt a little bit short i hope that there will be some expansion for single player game has many interesting places that are not used in single player story for example army base and prison also missions mainly happen in city so country side feels unused multiplayer is great and heists make it even better its fun to play this game together with friends
recommended
i really enjoy playing gta v single player and online despite the recent swarm of hackersmodder passive and not getting too close to them helps alot despite what others say gotta learn to coexist with the hackersmodders until rockstar finally bans em if you buy this game there is a chance you may experience issues but not likely dont nit pick and you will be fine
recommended
this game is fantastic when it works im not sure if its only me but i am forver being told that my data cannot be taken off rockstar servers gta online is unavailable turning on msaa causes gfx_initialisation failures every 5 minutes and even with it off my game often stops working the recommended reinstall achieved nothing my story mode is glitched after the crew selection for the first hgeist i am now stuck as michael unable to change character or do any missions im still recommending it because the game is fantastic when it does work but the errors i state have been present since launch and there is no offical word on why these errors are so prevalent

ha ha suckers i bought it before they jacked up the price  but sriously rockstar  move

game is a buggy mess memory leaks all over runs fine for a few hours then crashes sometimes less sometimes more you never know when it will crash and so on i havent seen anything fixing the issues since i bought the game no patches nada they dont give a  sad but true the online part no not worth it its hack kingdom or worse dull repetive gameplay with no sence of goals at all dont get this title unless its on a discount big time story 510 the first hours up to the first heist the story is solid and fun then it just runs out of content and is filled with crap gameplay every loading screen or completed segment of the game you will sit and say please dont crash over and over and over again 210 clean smoth 60 fps sure for 30 minutes then the stutter hell begins until its unplayible audio radiooff verdict you dont whanna know

i got to say this is my first gta game so i had a lot of expectations that needed to be met in order for me to like this game but i cant really compare it to previous games all my expectations were from hearsay i got this game when it first came out but due to finals i wasnt able to play it that much until may ive since put 144 hours into this game the most i have done with any game that i own on steam in that month and all that time has been in multiplayer i havent even touched the singleplayer this game is so good that my dad who pretty much only plays wow saw me playing this and decided to get this game and has loved it it would take me too long to describe the pros for this game so here are the cons  i have had issues with my latest driver gefore 980 and this game which has caused me to crash multiple times however its a simple fix all i have to do is go and instal the 34786 driver i havent fully tested this out but i think the problem was when i had nvaa running ill be sure to edit this to see if it works out  it can take you a while to get some of the more expensive objects such as vehicles or appartments but if you do heists and missions you can get that money in a surprisingly quick time while still having a blast  if you dont have 3 other friends to do heists you will be waiting for randoms to join your game however the wait time has decreased significantly since the game first came out now you might only have to wait 3 minutes but there is a good chance that it will be full sooner than that  there is no way for you to give money to your friends but that is understandable because that is how the hackers were able to give sooo much money so its understandable why on the note of hackers are there hackers yes do you see them frequently more often than not you dont but you can from time to time are the hackers a bad thing absolutely not they dont ruin the gameplay at all because 1 if they decide to be  and start killing you you just go into passive mode and they cant do anything to you 2 if you dont feel like going into passive mode you can always join another server that wont have one and it is as if nothing ever happened 3 half the time you can get money from them because most of them are nice 4 they turn the crazyness of gta online from 10 to 11 there have been times where there were ufo saucers in the middle of downtown los santos blowing people up and my only reaction was laughing because i just got blown up by a god damn ufo xd overall i got to say this game is amazing i know that some of the cons may seem really outstanding but thats because i havent listed the awesomeness and hilarity of this game it is absolutely normal to be driving down the street crash into a npc car get mad at it shoot the driver start going on a rampage because  it why not accidentally shoot a player by accident i mean that it was unfortunate that the player had to cross paths with you during your rampage so now they must die they get mad they call in a helicopter they start shooting at you with missiles and machine guns and then the next thing you know the entire server is fighting each other in downtown los santos with so many cops shooting at anyone and everyone that you would have thought that the national guard was being called in all because you were doing 100 in downtown and got mad that you lost control of your car and slammed into a npc

at its current state it has a bunch of issues but the game by itself is great for some people optimization is great and make sure you are running the latest drivers overall i have a ton of issues that makes this game hard to enjoy and unplayable and effects how well i do  huge stuttering issues especially when in a car or going fast the game seems to render 247 and it starts to microstutter to really bad freezing and stuttering to the point where the game crashes the game is literally unplayable due to this  random fps drops the stuttering issue is much worse but sometimes my fps would drop from 40 to 20 and it varies quite a bit when going into different areas i understand that fps should vary but drops that cut fps in half is weird  there are also a lot of graphical bugs in the game make sure you are running the latest drivers even then there is still some minor tearing with vsync on  a long with these issues people are having a huge amount of issues with the game a lot of people cant even start it up and some just have bad performance issues for no reason  apparently ive been told im not the only one experiencing these awful issues it is not overheating my pc runs at max 45c on cpu and 65c on gpu it is cpu and ram heavy but regardless that shouldnt cause anything also lowering the graphics does not increase my fps much and sometimes makes it worse due to cpu offload running default presets seems to run best most of my settings are on high and very high but textures and a few small things on normal advanced things turned off  pc specs cpu amd phenom 965 quad core oc 37ghz be gpu amd r9 270x 2gb ram gskill ripjaw gaming series 8gb @ 1600mhz psu rosewill capstone 80 gold 750w modular motherboard asrock 880g extreme 3 am3 case thermaltake overseer full tower black storage seagate barracuda 1tb 7200 rpm 130mbps this is what the game is on os drive 500gb samsung 500gb 7200 rpm hardrive 80mbps  i hope to get an ssd soon and upgrade cpumobo  overall i would really enjoy the game but all of these issues along with other peoples issues ruins the game it is a great port overall for some atleast and for some it wont even start and runs rough i do believe my stuttering is from my hardrive but it shouldnt be as other people experience it and my friends with lowerend hardrives can run this game fine  thoughts or even a fix much is appreciated please no fanboying i do not have the best pc but i am somewhat above minimum especially in some hardware specifications i know more about my specs the rest of the components are ineffective in terms of performance

pros  great graphics even at low settings  controls are easier with the keyboard and mouse in my opinion  smooth gamplay smoother than consoles  mods cons  still the same exact game available on xbox 360one and ps3ps4 pc doesnt really get any exclusives other than mods my opinion this is a great well thought out game the version on the pc however is supperior to the console versions both in graphics and gameplay the keyboard and mouse makes moving around and shooting more fluid and also mods if you have finished the game and dont know what to do just get some fun mods great game overall definatly reccomended

this indie gem created by upandcoming developer rockstars interactive has received mixed reviews but im here to tell you not to listen to the unwashed masses gta v has you play as three characters miguel frankie and tevor starting as trevor the goal is to roam the city to steal as much cars as possible hence the games name  grand theft auto as you get better at stealing cars you unlock miguel and franklin and their respective criminal activities child slave trafficing and explosives smuggling the game takes a dark turn towards the end where you must streamline your child trafficing methods to be able to compete with the chinese meaning cramping them in smaller spaces and giving them worse and worse conditions a real eye opener to the people unaware of these real issues you and i as world citizens face today the games message does however get a bit hamfisted toward the end where you spend an entire mission beating the living  out of asian children to heart tugging music i disabled the music in the audio options but it plays in this section regardless you cant skip this part but i get why the game has such a high age restriction after getting maximum score on the mission great game but its pretty graphic so take the age restriction seriously

pretty good game some of the things i enjoyed right away throughout my play through is that this game is eye candy very nice to look at also a bit of fun to explore mini games such as towing cars yoga tennis etc are nice feaures but also a bit boring past gtas had vigilante missions owning property gang wars which is disappointing because these were removed from gta 5 other than that gameplay is very solid and a step forward from previous gtas overall a very well optimized and good looking game with solid gameplay and exploration however its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness for the game will eventually make its vast open world a boring sandbox but for me this game will make me last until fallout 4 comes out
recommended
this game is simply stunning its world is huge and there is heaps to do in both single and multiplayer this game is definitely worth the money

the game is great amazing and comprehensive story alongside really fancy looks for a game of its size i cant blame it for some unpolished edges but i still see a lot of problems my game crashes a lot it isnt a pc problem ive lowered the graphics and the bar in the settings is in the green zone but i still just crash and the popup just says a problem has occurred a little bit more description on the problem could actually help me attempt to solve it that aint half of it there are times where my game freezes for a few seconds then just closes entirely the popup then says i was logged out because i was logged in on another device when i only have rockstar on this pc and i dont share this account with anyone no i havent gotten any downloads pertaining to gtav and i havent clicked on any malicious links loading time is a huge annoyance as well i understand it takes some time to load the map and insert all the nitty gritty details we love so much but in online i find myself having to wait three minutes or more just to be told that the match is full then being sent back to open world takes another two minutes i know unlimited open world exploration is quite equal to a few minutes of waiting but we should be told why we had such long connection periods so that wed actually understand it same as the aforementioned problems i would probably not be here typing this notsohappy review if that was the case

its a ronseal game does exactly what it says on the tin thats not neccessarily a bad thing but aside from a few nifty gameplay mechanics its fairly weak sauce compared to earlier efforts the switchable three characters work and work well the script and story is excellent and the world is sublime but so many buts the singleplayer campaign is really all there is once thats done sos the game oh you can be all completist and collect bits of scrap or bits of letters and the like but thats kind of rubbish you can do some races if you like maybe visit the 10 or so locations in this vast sprawling city that you can actually go into you can buy different shirts cars surf the net and get all meta superficial crap abounds but other than a whole lot of diet coke theres not much there with caffeine and sugar you know also rockstar still cant make flying as effortless as it is in say far cry which is baffling you can go online but if i wanted to associate with my fellow man id go to the pub oh you can do that in gta v too so yeah recommended but its nowhere near as good as fc4 and that was basically just a copy of fc3 with a tuktuk and ridable elephants so its not like they raised the bar into the clouds

although very crude like russian prison language crude its super immersive world will give you the ride of your life

i only played 70 hrs of this game and 40 hrs where singleplayer the rest was split in 5 hrs finishing flight school 20 hrs killing others playerswith a few even started killing each other to see who is better and the rest 5 hrs playing events with players with the level 5 or 100 and was so was so uneven that it was like the race between the rabbit and the turtle only this is a game and not a story i would recommend this game for the story and the graphics the multiplayer is repetitive uneven only made for the money and after a few hours you see that is so much that you can do there are players with 1000 hrs played but those are really really really not the kind of person anyone would like to talk see know or know of overall 910 for singleplayer 610 multiplayer 1010 graphics and 810 fun so 810

early life winston leonard spencerchurchill was born to an aristocratic family on november 30 1874 as his life unfolded he displayed the traits of his father lord randolph churchill a british statesman from an established english family and his mother jeanette jennie jerome an independentminded new york socialite as a young child churchill grew up in dublin ireland where his father was employed by his grandfather the 7th duke of marlborough john spencerchurchill when he entered formal school churchill proved to be an independent and rebellious student he did poorly at his first two schools and in april 1888 he was sent to harrow school a boarding school near london within weeks of his enrollment he joined the harrow rifle corps which put him on a path to a military career at first it didnt seem the military was a good choice for churchill it took him three tries to pass the exam for the british royal military college however once there he did well and graduated 20th in his class of 130 up to this time his relationship with both his mother and father was distant though he adored them both while at school churchill wrote emotional letters to his mother begging her to come see him but she seldom came his father died when he was 21 and it was said that churchill knew him more by reputation than by any close relationship they shared churchill enjoyed a brief but eventful career in the british army at a zenith of british military power he joined the fourth hussars in 1895 and served in the indian northwest frontier and the sudan where he saw action in the battle of omdurman in 1898 while in the army he wrote military reports for newspapers the pioneer and the daily telegraph and two books on his experiences the story of the malakand field force 1898 and the river war 1899 in 1899 churchill left the army and worked as a war correspondent for the morning post a conservative daily newspaper while reporting on the boer war in south africa he was taken prisoner by the boers while on a scouting expedition he made headlines when he escaped traveling almost 300 miles to portuguese territory in mozambique upon his return to britain he wrote about his experiences in the book london to ladysmith 1900 early careers government and military in 1900 churchill became a member of parliament in the conservative party for oldham a town in manchester following his father into politics he also followed his fathers sense of independence becoming a supporter of social reform unconvinced that the conservative party was committed to social justice churchill switched to the liberal party in 1904 he was elected a member of parliament in 1908 and was appointed to the prime ministers cabinet as president of the board of trade that same year he married clementine ogilvy hozier after a short courtship as president of the board of trade he joined newly appointed chancellor lloyd george in opposing the expansion of the british navy also in 1908 he introduced several reforms for the prison system introduced the first minimum wage and helped set up labor exchanges for the unemployed and unemployment insurance churchill assisted in the passing of the peoples budget which introduced new taxes on the wealthy to pay for new social welfare programs the budget passed the house of commons in 1909 but was initially defeated in the house of lords before being passed in 1910 he also drafted a controversial piece of legislation to amend the mental deficiency act of 1913 mandating sterilization of the feebleminded the bill eventually passed both houses with only the remedy of confinement in institutions in january 1911 churchill showed his tougher side when he made a controversial visit to a police siege in london police had surrounded a house where two robbers had been caught churchills degree of participation is still in some dispute some accounts have him going to the scene only to see for himself what was going on others state that he allegedly gave directions to police on how to best storm the building what is known is that the house caught fire during the siege and churchill prevented the fire brigade from extinguishing the flames stating that he thought it better to let the house burn down rather than risk lives rescuing the occupants the bodies of the two robbers were found inside the charred ruins while serving as first lord of the admiralty since 1911 churchill helped modernize the british navy ordering that new warships be built with oilfired instead of coalfired engines he was one of the first to promote military aircraft and set up the royal navy air service so enthusiastic was he about aviation that he took flying lessons to understand firsthand its military potential though not directly involved in the disastrous battle of gallipoli churchill resigned his post because he felt responsible for proposing the expedition for a brief period he rejoined the british army commanding a battalion of the royal scots fusiliers on the western front and seeing action in no mans land in 1917 he was appointed minister of munitions for the final year of the war overseeing the production of tanks airplanes and munitions from 1919 to 1922 churchill served as minister of war and air and colonial secretary under prime minister david lloyd george as colonial secretary churchill was embroiled in another controversy when he ordered air power be used on rebellious kurdish tribesmen in iraq a british holding at one point he suggested that poisonous gas be used to put down the rebellion this proposal was considered but never enacted though the conventional bombing campaign was and failed to end the resistance fractures in the liberal party led to the defeat of churchill as a member of parliament in 1922 and he rejoined the conservative party he served as chancellor of the exchequer returning britain to the gold standard and took a hard line against a general labor strike that threatened to cripple the british economy with the defeat of the conservative government in 1929 churchill was out of government he was perceived as a rightwing extremist who was out of touch with the people he spent the next few years concentrating on his writing and published a history of english speaking peoples world war ii though not at first seeing the threat that adolph hitler posed when he rose to power in 1933 churchill gradually became a leading advocate for british rearmament by 1938 as germany began controlling its neighbors churchill had become a staunch critic of british prime minister neville chamberlains policy of appeasement toward the nazis on september 3 1939 the day that britain declared war on germany churchill was appointed first lord of the admiralty and a member of the war cabinet and by april 1940 he became chairman of the military coordinating committee later that month germany invaded and occupied norway which was a setback for neville chamberlain who had resisted churchills proposal that britain preempt german aggression by unilaterally occupying vital norwegian iron mines and sea ports in may debate in parliament on the norwegian crisis led to a vote of no confidence toward prime minister chamberlain on may 10 king george vi appointed churchill as prime minister and minister of defense within hours the german army began its western offensive invading the netherlands belgium and luxembourg two days later german forces entered france britain stood alone against the onslaught quickly churchill formed a coalition cabinet of leaders from the labor liberal and conservative parties he placed intelligent and talented men in key positions on june 18 1940 churchill made one of his iconic speeches to the house of commons warning that the battle of britain was about to begin churchill kept resistance to nazi dominance alive

if you liked gta 4 youll like this too it might be laggy at some points and even though you think you have a good computer and think you can play this game with all high graphics and not lag at all youre wrong i have a pretty nice gaming laptop and my settings for this game is on the lowest it can and it still lags and random times enough about computer quality this game is still quite fun for the past week or so this is all ive pretty much played all day its actually postponed work ive been needing to do for a gaming company im a part of just like 4 theres many swears and even more graphic content i wont spill the beans there fast as hell cars and even cops are somewhat smarter though there is only one island theres still a lot of land to cover many cars most of which are pretty good and of course youve heard of fighter jets and tanks way better tanks than gta 4 hell you can even steal a commercial jumbo jet nice thing i like is you dont see cops just driving about so you can drive as fast as you want and not have to worry about hitting cops gta 5 online might seem like its bullcrap you can buy places and cars theres insurance and you pay bills for your apartment if you have one no big deal theres heists that you can do you get a crap ton of money or you can always just rob a store tip shoot the cashier after they give you the money sometimes theyll whip out a shotgun and shoot you in the face but online is still pretty fun you can check out some of my pics i took to see planes tanks and some other things tldr well then you prick to sum up fun awesome game better than gta 4 i suggest getting it online can be a little weird at first but you get used to it want to know what i mean by that then read what i said above dickweed

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

i have played this game first on last gen consoles on release dayps3 and when i moved to pc this was my first game enjoyed this game far better on pc the graphics are nice textures are detailed in depth the game is very optimized and runs well on windows 81 with mods or without anyone who enjoyed gta iv  san andreas or any others will enjoy grand theft auto 5 if your pc is low on specs theres mods that help dense down population and traffic my experience with this game lately is playing the game with the rapid response mod as playing as one of the lspd officers but shooting random civilians and giving arrest to those i hit xd

very good game single player is fun complete and never boring now that we have mods probably a good 1010 from me but on gta online its kinda mixed its pretty boring if youre playing without friends around because you will most likely get bombed by some dude in a jet or get shot at by little  in kurumas but in the rare chance that you have friends everything will be fun from start until you run out of  to do online just depends if you can handle playing solo or not it is a recommendation buy

well its a great game its perfect in every way however yes however if you have a pc like mine or lower than mine dont get it until you get a better one my specs ram 4gb graphics card amd radeon hd 7310 graphics in other words look at the recommended specs not the minimum specs if you have the recommended specs or higher get this game if you have lower than the recommended specs dont buy it i run a pc booster and i stil get about 1015 fps and it wont let me get past the prologue mission because when you get to the getaway car it freezes at the loading screen for me dont get me wrong though if your pc can handle it get it

classic gta formula with a tonne more additives solid game once it finally made its way through to pc the time taken to release was a little dissapointing by rockstar but it was to be expected pick this game up probably the best online freeroamercriminal game on the market right now massive world great attention to detail and so much to do that you could easily clock over 100 hours without fully discovering the game 910 recommendations theres not very many good online freeroamer games but if the appeal for a massive single player freeroam world sprawling with things to do is still in your interests i suggest giving a chance to the following fallout 3 and new vegas [great with mods] skyrim [a classic with mods] witcher 3 [modern classic]

this is an allaround great game that will make you spend countless hours messing around with cheat codes mods crime and much more pros so many things to do making the world insanely immersive gta online has people competing in all different kinds of missions races etc to make it rich the console peasant race has nothing over the pc master race anymore mod support wellwritten story with many interesting characters rockstar editor can be used to make some epic action slowmo clips movies montages etc too many things to do you will not get bored cons the game had some performace issues when it first came out fps dipping way too low when driving fast lag when cops showed up etc gta online can take ages to connect to the game requires an entry level graphics card if you even want to run the game on low settings the clumsy gunplay which is fine is sometimes annoying to use with a mouse so i definitely recommend a controller to play this is what i did random gamemodel glitches which kill your fps i was driving through the mountains when a tree glitched out and its branches shot up into the sky infinitely long and killing my fps other things like this have happened multiple times and require a game restart the game is more than a 60 gb download so if you dont have superspeed internet get ready for a long time waiting and a lot of bandwidth used up final verdict this game is huge and immersive with countless fun and interesting characters and missions rockstar really didnt blow this one off the pc port of gta 5 could be better but at the moment it is not bad the game has some beautiful graphics which will kill your pc if you dont have one that is good enough but the game now runs smooth and i rarely run into issues
recommended
nothing to do with the actual game itself just saying that people need to stop getting so whiney about the whole sale situation not happy with it wait until it returns to normal after the summer sales stop giving the game bad reviews for the wrong reasons
recommended
if you have $60 there is no reason why you shouldnt get this game it has just about everything cars racing both 3rd and 1st person shooting and driving and just about as much violence and epicness you could fit into one game this game has something that will appeal to anyone wether it be sensless violence or sexual content the story is great lots of humor but nothing that will be going in the history books the charactors are hilarious especially trevor but the online really stands out you create your own character that you will be stuck with throughout the online furthermore you can buy your own apartment stealbuy your own cars and fully customize them conduct complex heists and do fun yet challenging jobs to earn cash and of cours the online game takes place in the fully open world were you can do practically anything you want and with the new update you are allowed to use mods in single player so ignore any hateful reviews based off the banning of mods
recommended
as good as this game is it has little to no anticheat do what you want with this information buy it or put it off until rockstar actually does something which will most likely be never the game itself without any cheats or hacks not mods is great i highly reccomend it
recommended
this is actually very worth the wait a very great game and suprisingly dosent need a powerful pc this claims my favorite game on steam 1010
recommended
incredibly well optimized and overall an incredibly fun experience to play you should know what to expect if youve played a gta game before only this time the online mode is definitely the star of the show so many things to do with constant updates that itll take a long long time before youve exhausted all the content in the game only gripes i have with the game are the amount of hackers at the moment which fortunately rockstar are cracking down on hard although from what i hear unjustly banning people who have been affected by hackers and also occasional crashes with the game in certain online missions which can put you in a bad sport lobby would recommend overall though
recommended
rockstar didnt  up multiplayer this time ofcourse im recomending it
recommended
great game that lives up to the grand theft auto series however the only downside is the obscene amount of hackers and poor online server options that make this game quite unpolished

never regretted buying this best game ever

this is what i really think of gta v and gta v online pros the game is greatly optimized unlike gta iv the graphics are realistic and amazing the next gen online experience is interesting for the new players easy to make gameplay videos record gameplay without any lag and then edit the videos in the video editor or 3rd party software cons the story mode is exactly the same the only new feature that was added is the first person camera that can give you a new experience in the gameplay right now there are some annoying hackers in some online sessions i really hope this will get eliminated its difficult to make money in gta online especially if you havent unlocked the heists you can buy gta online money but you have to pay a lot right now during the summer sales rockstar isnt really lowering the price of the game so it will be difficult to purchase on the other hand they added a shark card that gives you gta v online cash so the price of the game stays the same find a friend that owns the game and have fun playin & killin rockstar games social club official page [socialclubrockstargamescom]

i am going to be honest this game is sooooooo good i bought one for my friend and i hade my best experince ever with him on online d now lets get this going pros the controls are ok when you get to know them the graphics are always some good  the game is fully optimized rockstar is always watching whats bad and then they will patch it in the future the heists feels realistic and fun at the same time the game can get hard but it doesnt make me mad about it p the secrets is scary and intresting playing with friends makes this game more fun and the combat is ok beside on the online _ coins the loading screens are everywhere so it feels like i am going back to sims 4 reborn _ you can disconnect so many times because the servers are not really highly connected to you and its hard to get money when with the heists my ratings are 1010 bcuz this game is awesome when you dont think about the coins the game will cost you 59 euros but its worth it 1010 friends with guns igni mean p0lly

my first day in grand theft auto v  i accidently blew up a truck  > mission failed  i tried to kill and run towards the enemies  > instantly died  i drove a car  > got stuck or destroyed the car  i raced with the car  > did not even finish the first lap while the others finished all of them  i ran after the civilians  > i did not keep up  i went swimming  > i drowned within 30 seconds  i flew a plane  > crashed it within 30 seconds  i flew a helicopter  > it started to smoke within 1 minute 3 still awesome

i could not have been more proud of spending sixty dollars on a videogame other than grand theft auto v rockstar has definitely achieved a major milestone in producing this game a huge step forward from old grand theft auto iv v takes you on a major journey through a fictional los angeles to once again experience the joy and wonders of the whole grand theft auto concept in a new better and more free environment the story is wonderful just as good as ivs story in a sense that niko bellic doesnt make a physical return which is such a shame along with its wonderful story grand theft auto online makes an even better story for the player himself playing with your friends doing heists online with them was not something people were expecting especially in an openworld game such as this its an illuminating experience rockstar has sold over 250 million copies of the game and has made billions of dollars while doing it and i must say rockstar you deserve it

so i was playing as michael this morning driving around the city no big didnt want to kill anybody so i honked to this angry chinese dude to get out of my way and he pulled me out of the car so i beat him to death a few seconds later the ambulance shows up two doctors come out to try to help him one of them get hit by a car so he pulls the dude of his car and smash his head until hes dead and then proceed to try to help the dude i killed and i was like are you ing kidding me but i wasnt laughing so hard until they started crying because they couldnt save the guy i killed in time yes the one crying was the same doc who killed another guy seconds before because he got accidentally ran over as he got out of the ambulance a couple seconds later they suddenly started running and i realize that was because the ambulance got randomly stolen as they left it in the middle of the street this is the point i decided to drop from college because this game is so worth my time and money that i just realized there isnt really anything else in this life 1010 would buy it a hundred times if i had to

hotfix for intelamd switchable graphics card grand theft auto v has exited unexpectedly after surfing the internet for some time ive finally found a solution for this this launch error often happens to those users who has a switchable graphics card which is mostly available in laptops in my case i have a integrated graphics card of intel hd 4000 and a dedicated graphics card of amd radeon hd 7670m  no need to point out that my laptop is crap cause i already know that but anyway follow this link here  if youre too lazy to watch and read the whole video ill just explain it here download the hotfix needed in here httptechcodersnetpagesgta5html extract the files somewhere you can easily access eg desktop launch gta v through steam then wait for a few seconds run as administrator the file gta5hotfix found in the file you just downloaded  profit if it looks too suspicious for you let me explain on how it works upon running the hotfix the program will attach a debugger to the process to check for exceptions and voiding the addresses that crashes the game to desktop after the game has successfully launched it will automatically detach itself i cant say that this is worth the money why cause i won this game on a giveaway therefore i didnt spend a cent hooray for being lucky and its all thanks to the marshmallow man  again thank you for hosting that giveaway i wont allow a single day to past without me playing this game atleast once thats how awesome it is

gtav is a great game it is really the visuals are stunning everything about the storysingleplayer is fantastic just one thing the game is still called grand theft auto while the autos are there id like more customization options for them but thats just me the online could be fantastic  but its not heres why  loading times its kind of better now but when the game came out its name was grand loading seriously loading jobs loading sessions loading heists loading everything not to mention the others serverrelated problems like being invited to another session trying to join getting kicked because its full and having no other choice but to press retry cant go back to the previous one so its either waiting until someone leaves or killing the game to better restart it  r wants you to spend money seriously you just bought the game for like 60$ or something  yeah but since you do want to pay more you can spend 80$ more real dollars to get online currency like any good p2w game would propose you to  isnt this great   leveling and unlocking alright some people are just like dont grind play the game youll earn money and exp without even realizing it i call  on that seriously you should earn xp just by playing the damn game just by being in it  even grinding is difficult since replaying the most rewarding missions is not so rewarding because your gains will drop the more youll replay  jobs i mean come one yeah its an online game but it lacks a thing it really does for example i want to start a race i set the cars type to muscle because i love muscle cars i disallow custom cars blah blah and every single player leaves as soon as he gets in i dont mind people not liking anything else than supercars i dont but what kills me is that there is no fricking way to race with ais  why  because there are no ais  you cant play a race with ais you cant start a deathmatch with ais you cant do  on your own  even though ais do exist in missions and heists and they know how to race and how to kill  and dont tell me to go offline to race with ais  its my online character that i want to race with its my online sabre turbo that i want to race with i dont give a damn if my franklin has the same car online im not franklin just let me race  hackers i dont mind them teleporting and dropping money on my head i dont mind them using their tools to kill the cops but i do mind them killing me in passive mode i do mind them using godmode and killing every single player at once i do mind them calling themselves modders to feel better about the fact they are just script kiddies that cant play a game the normal way and for the love of god i do mind the fact that it seems so easy to fricking script in this game  i mean come on  the moment i have to report 3 different guys in one session for using railguns is quite a bit too much  tldr play this game for the singleplayer or just play it if youre into the gta serie but gta online is an enormous piece of dump most of the time also filled with a sad bloodthirsty community i also heard something about steam summer sale

jwell jwell jwell gland thefft awwto this game is a prime example of aaa filth it had a massive budget and cool graphics and features but is unpolished as hell with  interfaces and terrible online still they get away with it because of the massive name and its hype the developpers are also notorious for their jewblizz behaviour they release the game 3 different times and know they will get away with it because each time it is released it is lacking in some department the online caters to casuals and is rigged to make them money from ingame purchases they left out alot cool posibilities because it would make the fedora queeers soil themselves the single player is good i cant lie 910 probably i really like the amount of customization that goes into online even though everybody is autistic and looks the same wearing suits and fedoras this game is difficult to review the core of the game is really cool and fun but there is a crust of rockstar  surround it that makes it really unpleasant to deal with it makes me ashamed that i supported rockstar by buying this games twice i think i will go with a 810

loading screen simulator 2015 is the best and most realistic simulator game ever created you really feel like youre truly experiencing loading screens with complete realism jokes aside ive never been a fan of the gta series i hate drugs vulgar language excessive sexualisation and crime and ive never really enjoyed a gta game but gtav is different the world is huge enough multiplayer is customisable enough and content is enjoyable enough to overcome the downsides that create a defined divide between opinions this game is 65gb of space well taken so what makes me overcome my distaste for this game series well the sheer number and variety of cars and weapons the numerous types and examples of minigames and missions the list goes on gta v is a great game deserving of all the praise it gets and for that i cant help but recommend this game to even the most closedminded of people

ive been holding out reviewing gtav for quite some time now not because its bad and that i need to find reasons to criticize it but rather because there is so many great things about the game that its hard to organize them all together into one review pros  the story mode story is great  the online is great  the driving in the game is great  flight controls are very solid  player unique skills that are improved by doing activities  many guns to chose from  many cars to chose from  many clothes to chose from  the heists are fun with 3 other people you know  realism and detail  this game has tide cycles an altimeter and other flight gauges turbulence hydroplaning etc cons  p2p connection for missions and heists  loading screens can take some time  heists are super hard when teammates dont have microphones ill probably edit the review if i find more things to compliment or to complain about but in all honesty gtav is a very solid game the only real issues with online and story mode are simple bugs or technical errors but other than that their cons arent that they arent fun its just that sometimes things break if youre discouraged by the $60 price tag on the game i understand you however i feel that you will be by far getting your money back through the enjoyment of this game

the game is centered around three characters michael trevor and franklin michael is a retired crook in witness protection sitting on his money and raising his family trevor is michaels old friend and accomplice in crime and is a complete psychopath who just wants to kill steal and get drunk all at the same time franklin is the young gangster wanting to do more that sling dope and throw up gang signs he wants to rob banks and then live it up in a mansion the game starts out with franklin and his homie lamar repoing some cars for their boss simian he is a car dealer who scammed people out of money franklin eventually ends up trying to take michaels sons car michael is hiding in the back of the car when franklin takes it from his michaels house michael tells franklin to drive the car in to the front of simian dealership michael tells franklin to quit his job stealing cars and join him and rob a jewelry store trevor sees the jewelry robbery on the news and recognizes that michael did the robbery trevor hasnt seen michael in 19 years he goes and finds michael at his home in los santos a fictional patrol of los angeles and finds him they decide to pull a big heist and then retire gameplay is mostly like all other gtas you walk around and steal cars and get into trouble the cars handling has changed drasikley from gta 4 no more of the heavy realistic driving now its very arcady i didnt really like this change i prefer realism in my games the cars are too floaty and they seem to bounce off everything they touch the shooting is vastly improved from all the other gtas the music selection is bad and i mean bad there are no recognizable songs apart from 1015 songs that are good out of the 240 licensed songs if you think thats no big deal then what are you supposed to listen to in the car while driving the driving and the music are the only two things that frustrated me the most in this installment but i digress i love this game ive put about 500hrs into the game on the xbox 360 and ps4 and i still cant get enough of it if youre a fan of gta its a must buy if you like a good story this games got it if you like open world games buy it

this my friends is the masterpiece of the rockstar studios buy it wait for a week to download the game files create an account and hop directly to online leave the story aside and enjoy the online los santos oh in addition to that you may have to wait like 10 minutes to join a server randomly crash from the server get kicked for being afk from the server because you went to grab a glass of water for 30 seconds wait 5 minutes to join a jobheist and if you are lucky fail the job and lose your whole progress because of some imbecile left the mission these will happen most likely because welcome to grand theft auto v where everyone is dumb as a bag of hammers no offense everyone story is spectacular online is quite annoying if you dont have friends still 1010

gta 5 is the mark wahlberg of videogames the graphics are like swoosh the driving is schlomp the shooting is like w wwwww the franklin is like the steve urkel of grand theft auto the trevor is like the jack nicholson of grand theft urkel the game takes place in americas worst city los angeles the main character is played by michael his wife is a big whre but dont tell sharleen i said that the games career mode rips off of payday the heist you play as three musketeers and rob five banks so that you can buy ten cars on your phone instead of hitting the f key like everybody else grand theft auto vice city is a remake of wave race 64 turns out the fbis witness protection program is actually a diabolical pyramid scheme to sucker criminals into doing infinity suicide missions for some cowabunga dumbss the whole game michael goes okay ill do this one last mission for you guys but then im outta the game for good random jage michael im pulling you out of retirement for one last job okay ill do this one last mission the okay ill do this one more theres one okay this one final mission then iiim outta the game for goo alright this has to be the last one then im out of the game for good grand theft auto iv is real life whenever you steal a black guys car hes listening to rap whenever you steal a mexicans hes listening to hasta maana tortilla chimichanga grand theft auto chinatown wars is a remake of pilotwings 64 point of the game is to teach impressionable children how to gun down droves of innocent civilians whenever you play as franklin you have a five star wanted level for doing nothing they only have songs about california in this game unless you go to the classic rock all you hear on there is radio gaga then it goes yapatapatapayapa pikachu ah choose you saturday saturday but even still gta v is the best singleplayer game ive played in years super ambitious brilliantly atmospheric jampacked with subtle details and easter eggs masterful storytelling loveable characters checkpoint technology dog graphics 05

after my original review of this game in which i did not recommend this now i have to recommend it after a rough start things have now started to smooth out pros great multiplayer included mission maker well optimized great graphical improvements and effects compared to console versions mod support many bug fixes insane fun engaging story line personal radio  cons all players in online sessions sometimes disappear never ending loading screens sometimes in online aircraftshelicopters camera lock uncontrollable high vram requirements missions sometimes glitch out requiring to restart  i would give this game a 8510 fix the bugs and lower vram requirements my specs are processor i74770 ram 16gb ddr3 clocked at 1600 gpu nvidia gtx 760 3gb of gddr5

best game at this time hands down  been playing for almost 29 hours straight and im still enjoying it the graphics are like p0rn for the eyes the story is very nice and diverse looking at the old gta stories the online mode in this game is done very nicely as well and lucky for me i found out about passive mode pretty soon  1010 would buy again

wow wow wow gta v makes me cry i cri every tim the whole storyline was just amazing i really bonded with all the characters franklin michael trevor romani mean lamar it was just an awesome action packed fairy tale of a repo gone wrong a jewelry store heist and a mission to fight the fib and merryweather i chose ending c for the final mission i couldnt kill my buds when they pushed devin down that  cliff from the hell that he came from i realized that was the end yeah when i saw the credits i was just devastated i just sat in my chair and watched the credits roll by that was it i just felt empty like the list of story missions left what was i going to do now i thought the campaign would be long as all balls like gta iv or maybe even a story as long as just cause 2 or something but no it was just gone and the rest of the stuff i had on gta v undone was just strangers and freaks it was over $60 to feel sad worth it and after all thati just felti had to do something about it so i played gta online 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999991

the best gta game so far sadly game features only los santos it would be great to see san fierro and las venturas great story although it felt a little bit short i hope that there will be some expansion for single player game has many interesting places that are not used in single player story for example army base and prison also missions mainly happen in city so country side feels unused multiplayer is great and heists make it even better its fun to play this game together with friends
recommended
i really enjoy playing gta v single player and online despite the recent swarm of hackersmodder passive and not getting too close to them helps alot despite what others say gotta learn to coexist with the hackersmodders until rockstar finally bans em if you buy this game there is a chance you may experience issues but not likely dont nit pick and you will be fine

this game is fantastic when it works im not sure if its only me but i am forver being told that my data cannot be taken off rockstar servers gta online is unavailable turning on msaa causes gfx_initialisation failures every 5 minutes and even with it off my game often stops working the recommended reinstall achieved nothing my story mode is glitched after the crew selection for the first hgeist i am now stuck as michael unable to change character or do any missions im still recommending it because the game is fantastic when it does work but the errors i state have been present since launch and there is no offical word on why these errors are so prevalent

ha ha suckers i bought it before they jacked up the price  but sriously rockstar  move

probably the most important good thing about gta v is that for its money it offers you more than any triplea game on a market without necessity to buy dlcs\season passes and other cancerous  you pay for a complete decently optimized and goodlooking game that can take about 60 hours for a single playtrough add some more if you are 100% junkie my steam says i played for 51 hours and finished 765% and even more if you are willing to play gta online which is not that great in standart game mods but might pleasantly surprise you and 3 of your friends in online heists mode story is a great mix of actioncomedy and crime drama genres with not a single moment being wasted full of wellwritten and perfectlyacted characters beautifully directed cutscenes and gameplay moments with seamless transitions from one to another the ost feels right both the official score and radio tracks programming and attention to details makes the gameworld alive and natural i can only think of 2 reasons why a person may not like gta v assuming this particular person likes video games 1 you just dont play action or openworld games at all 2 you dont like playing as a bunch of bad guys with a necessity of killing cops federal agents and a military personal other than that gta v is without a doubt the best openworld action game and a commercial product of a great quality and pleasureperdollar value 10\10
recommended
yeah i have a lot of hours 300 at this time why and why do i not reccomend the game here is why its almost impossible to play on a server with real people due to hackers unless you like me have friends to play with and join a server with no randoms defeating half the point of gta online then i wouldnt bother with the online portion if you dont youve got the choice between a hack infested online game and unreliable randoms to play with and disapppoint you or the single player portion the same sp portion that was cut short shorter than the previous gtas so they could make their online portion you see where im getting at over 100 aud to play a short campaign or play online and get hacked if you dont join a private server not to mention they jacked up the price of the game right before steam sales thats just dishonest if you have people to play with then i do reccomend it if not then hell no idk who decided games should cost $100 aud or that long campaigns are now 20 hours

no fun to play alone you need a dedicated team of 4 people you and three others to have any fun many many bugs online loading times are bs and its system for putting you in a lobby boots you to singleplayer more often than a lobby hackers wait three years then play this game when r gets their  together

a new release in the gta series this game is by far one of the best out there particularly because you can do whatever you want ive played gta v since its release on console [ps3xbox 360] so far its been fun taking time to play the story but once you beat it or if you dont you have the choice of multiplayer now out of all the time i have to admit story and multiplayer got quite boring until an update released then i bought the cars and messed around

after 450 hours and a few hundreds more from ps3 i guess its time to write a review sunmmary combat 710 fun 1010 gameplay 910 graphics 810 online 9510 would be 10 if it wasnt for cheaters story 8510 i recommend this game to my friends gta v and gta online you can count them as two separate games or not whatever you wish it doesnt change to me i have done 100% of the story on ps3 and i can tell you i really enjoyed it when the game came out i thought single player would be played a lot more because thats how it has been in the previous titles but nope gta v is mostly about gta online for this reason my review will be based on gta online story the single player story is very good most people do 2% and jump to gta online i recommend doing the story at least when you get bored of playing online there are cool things that unfortunately you cannot see in gta onlinei wish they would add those things first person camera i love the addition of the first person camera because it adds a new perspective making me want to do the story again because it feels different that said the first person camera is a disadvantage in multiplayer you have a limited view when you want to shoot back in the car you have to go all the way around when you are shooting 180 degrees behind you overall its just hard to play in first person because of the limited view on the other hand it offers an amazing immersive experience combat the combat is okay its not the best thing in the game recoil is almost nonexistent and some guns stats dont make sense compared to reality but overall its acceptable freemode this is where most people will spend most of their time freemode is awesome a lot of things to do a lot of places to explore definitely recommend going in freemode with friends dont have any make new ones you can get cars apartments garages etc i wish we did not have a limit on the number of garages you can own though that does not make sense if i have the money why should i not be allowed to own as many vehicles as i can missions missions are okay but they feel very repetitive they seem to be the same thing every time especially after youve completed all of them driving and races driving takes a little bit to get used to but its good make sure you know how to handle your car while its in the air a d shift ctrl races are fun especially the ones created by users heists awesome heists really enjoy them wish some of them had a better payout though once youve done them there is no reason to do prison break series a and humane labs other than fun because the pacific standard gives so much in payout or better the other ones dont give much flecca job is more something to do fast with a friend if its two of you hud i really like the hud it doesnt take a lot of the screen the only thing that bothers me is how big the invites are they become really annoying one thing i would really appreciate is the ability to toggle between expanded map and mini map instad of having to press z twice every few seconds and having to stick with one graphics graphics are very good im currently playing at 4k resolution almost maxed with 2x gtx 980 sli and an i7 4790k @ 48 ghz i was a little surprised and disappointed by how much cpu the game uses i ran the high priority script and still cannot run the game at max settings because the cpu is my bottleneck yes a 4790k is my bottleneck at 4k max specs leveling i like the leveling i like that the guns are unlocked at certain levels because it gives people a reason to level up inb4 people saying its not fair because you have a minigun talking about unfairness please remove the armored kuruma or at least make it not possible to shoot from it the kuruma is ridicolous dont drive next to me with an armored kuruma because i will blow you up community as expected a lot of offensive little kids and cheaters nothing we can do about that the patch from yesterday removed most of the cheaters which is awesome but i doubt it will go like this for long suggestion to rockstar add the things you have in single player to multiplayer wed love to see those things and they would make the game even better special vehicles and such also allow us to use police fire dept paramedic etc uniforms this game still has a looot of potential i recommend this game to my friends i know i have much more to say about this game so i will update as i think about them

runs on my mediumish build very well on medium settings rarely goes below 60 story is very entertaining but kind of hard to be pulled in to multiplayer is fantastic extremely entertaining despite some ludicrous item prices heists are funny and challenging requiring a decent amount of teamwork kind of buggy visually especially with shadows and buildingai popin selfradio also causes extreme fps drops but the other radio stations are very good funny djs and good music for the most part 8510

garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
awesome one word can only describe it

recommended
almost certainly the definitive version of the game amazing graphics runs smooth with little to no drops in fps for me at least great story and gameplay it does take a little bit to load onto online servers but when you so get on it is well worth the wait loads of content and gamemodes to keep you playing for hours well worth the price 9510
recommended
i would have to say having read others reviews and having my own experience i would not recommend this game im not saying the game itself is bad i loved what little time i had to enjoy however that said it is a game plagued with problems for pc users multiplayer is effectively ruined by hackersmodders i saw hackers rampage on a server in the few minutes i had online thats enough for me single player just does not work and crashes after 510 mins spent a day trying various fixes but to no avail i dont intend on reinstalling my whole system another time or re downloading 60 odd gigs of data several more times for those of you who can run this game well done im jelous but im not wasting time on this
not recommended
i do recommend this game im giving it a downvote because of its incompatibilty for weaker computers i would really appreciate it if they had low settings not medium to ultra a low setting would be great
not recommended
i dont write many reviews in fact i dont know if i ever have before but i went out my way to write one because gta is just broken i mean single player is great no problem there except from the modding community but if youre buying this game to mainly play online which is why i did pull out a bottle of advil and put it next to your desk because this game is going to make you wanna pop those pills like they were pop rocks the sheer amount of hackers online are staggering if you join an online server with more than 15 people in it you are bound to encounter a hacker i can almost guarantee it ive played my fair share of online games hackers pop up here and there but i try not to let it ruin the experience of the game in gtas case theres just no way around it even if you avoid hackers on the map they just mess with you from a distance im so tired of joining a server and having a hacker clone a 100 copies of my character to make my game crash the first time it was kind of funny second time not so much having it done to me over 20 times is a bit ridiculous i mean come on r you ban good people for wanting to change their fov yet are completely ignorant to the overwhelming amount of hackers if you want to hack money into your game i honestly wouldnt blame r for turning a blind eye who cares if people are lazy but i do take issues when it comes to people making a game unplayable for other people in its current state gta online is not ready plain and simple they need to add some sort of anticheat system or something along those lines if other games can do it so can you r tldr buy game if you want to play single player dont buy if you plan to play gta online hackers in almost every server that can easily cause you game to crash without warning

fantastic game with great optimization the single player has a great story with a lot of side missions to do although they get tiring after a while and gta online is lots of fun with heists missions and all the different chaos you can cause with friends it looks beautiful and runs at around 7080 fps with nearly everything on very high on my nvidia 970 there has been controversy with mods on this game but there are simple solutions to make sure that you dont get banned if playing single player keep the mods in your gta folder but if you want to play gta online put them in a different folder it is a bit of a hassle but it is necessary at the moment gta online has its problems namely people who use mods in multipayer and that can detract from the fun a bit but nevertheless this game is outstanding and definitely worth it even at full price

amazing game and a masterpiece that will strike a mark in history as a flawless game with loads of fun grand theft auto v is extremely addicting and fun to play especially with friends the graphics are absolutely gorgeous and they are extremely well optimized for even the low end pcs the story mode is very interesting and the characters are plainly awesome theyre all likable and fun to play with the mechanics are absolutely genius especially in story mode how time goes in slow motion while selecting a firearm the controls are well made for pc too though you might choose to use controller moving on to grand theft auto online all i can say is that the environment and the things you can do are extremely well created and i can totally see why rockstar had spent a lot of time designing the game i am also a big grand theft auto fan as ive played almost all of them i can review this game to be the best of the series due to rockstar spending loads of time designing the game while there are cons like rockstar banning modders the online experience is still very addicting and fun i would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for action packed fun and an extremely fun multiplayer that youll never get bored of this definitely is a masterpiece and could be called one of the best games out there right now awesome job rockstar you rock
recommended
this game has some flaws but that is not in the majority but this game oh this game it is soo good ever feel bored on a friday night well then launch gta v and you will have fun for hours upon hours upon hours and even if you get bored of the normal game why not go online and do some jobs and if even that bores you then you could install some mods and mess around in single player
recommended
when this came out it took 2 minutes to load on my  laptop now it takes an hour mods work hooray lots of hackers on online online dosent load half the time unstable note i have a new laptop on the way incase its just this piece of  machine 42069  would load for an hour again edit did the same again seems to be no internet breaks it

i played gta for years  i started with san andreas and i had hours of fun the first few days gta v came out  were like a dream i completed the story mode and it was big fun okay maybe i did it in a few days but after the story i just started  to just kill everybody on my way it started to be boring because the cops are really much  against only you so i decided to use the legal ingame cheats they work only on the story mode like explosive melee and so on it started to become boring and i sold the game i played it on xbox after few days i sold it  the online mode came out  but it would be stupid to sell a game and buy it again after few days i decided to forget it for a few months after long time of waiting years d the game became available for pc and i bought it on steam the story mode  is the same  so i just started with the online mode it was much bigger fun than the story mode now i can fight against the cops in freeplay with my friends this is much more fun than fighting alone in story mode  i think everybody should know what the online mode is about so i jump to this part the heists at the first look i loved them they are easy and you get much ingame money i think that rockstar thought this too but waiting for the 4 member for the heist is so loooong if you just cant to the heist after 2 times some members just give up and leave they just leave you try to make the best and they leave you cant do the heist without all members if you are the boss of the crew you pay some money to pay the members they must be paid with something and if 1 member just leaves the money is lost and i think its not easy to get so much money back i think that the heists are really not a bad idea but they must be improved but as far as i know rockstar they dont improve the heists they just make some new stuff  i hope its something good i really like this game and i recommend it 9910 points you should buy this game because it makes really much fun and you dont get aggressive d
recommended
very good optimization extensive single player campaign and fun multiplayer although you have to use rockstars social club its only a minor inconvenience for how easy it is to spend hours on this game
recommended
gta v was already good and now its on pc this is definitely the best way to play the game
recommended
great graphics would be nice if they would have released a year earlier but was well worth the wait in my opinion quality graphics great multiplayer heists and tons of cars much better than my first run through the game on xbox one

recommended
best game ever but dont download mods
recommended
overall a great single player story the best gta sp ive played to date however online is ok but the load screens are insane they really need to be shortened some how
recommended
most of the negative reviews are for being banned cuz of modsrather than game issues itself like loading times lobbies being full etc  and yes r does allow you to use mods in sp as long as you avoid online and deleting the mod before going anywhere near online and actually i found it more interesting that most of them tends to swear insult and lie in their negative reviews which makes me wonder that  r actually did a good jobpossibly getting rid of potential community scums to ban most of them even if they got banned for using mods only in sp and did not accidently went into the online to ruin other people experience or perhaps enhance their own in any way but the most funny negative review i found was  my game bugged and i lost 1mln worth car r customer service did not helped me therefore i used glitch to get a new one and pile of swear words and he is surprised that he got banned im pretty sure r could had helped him but i almost certain that the way he asked for help was in the same manner as he wrote his negative pretty idiotic review
recommended
better than any gta game before it looks great story is worth the $60 alone online is like a whole different game on top very little crashing load times are bearable
recommended
hi there what can i say about this great peace of digital art amazing great story love everything about the game as i sit here writing this and looking down the page at some of the negative comments i started to rub my fingers together do you no what that is the worlds smallest violin just for you activation take note rockstar did a brilliant job of banning the cheaters
recommended
timed out loading session simulator 2015 on a serious note this is a pretty fun game keep in mind that you cannot use mods without getting banned by rockstar or something like that i dunno look it up
recommended
really fun online takes time to get use to but it sucked me in
recommended
i love this game
recommended
the best gta game
recommended
well i really wish i got to play the game i bought it just i didnt have the requirements that was a waste of time for me to wait 1 day and 7 hours but i have played this on other sources not this pc version i think gta 5 is worth getting just right before you get gta 5 i suggest you check the requirements
recommended
goth so much improvement since the console version not only graphics wise but far better optimized for lower hardware and the fact that it searches for your music preferences makes driving much more fun
recommended
i wasnt a fan of gta before this game but rockstar really stepped up their game here amazing characters amazing story actionpacked game on a giant city for you to explore well worth the money spoilerish pick ending c or you are gonna regret
recommended
i only run and punch people and its so much fun that i forget i have missions to complete
recommended
great buy
recommended
this game is going down as one of the all time greatest rockstar absolutely nailed it in every aspect my only complaint is that it took so long to release
recommended
awersome game the story is just brilliant plotclimax and ending
recommended
this game is definitely worth the money please note that rockstar is not banning for single player mods and the people who said they got banned for no reason or for single player mods are liars rockstar is banning anyone using mods in online mode only no one got banned for nothing these people are cheaters looking to blame rockstar because they mad bro

this game is awesome you can anything you can kill people rob the store but when you play online sometimes the connection very poor

pros   game is well optizmied  great storyline  online  heists cons  although the game is well optimized there seems to be a memory leak  self radio is buggy and can or may bring fps down  loading into online can sometimes take a while  i have an ssd   finding decent people to play heists with is a pain 9010

got the game couldnt it play it without soical club couldnt sign in steam nor rockstar helped me 1011 worth the $60

unlike gta iv where the social club never worked it actually does in this one gaben be praised on everything else it is a fantastic port of an already stunning game looks great plays great and is an amazing game to play with friends if you played it on console this is a great upgrade if you never played at all a definite must buy you will not regret it

best game i have played for quite a while i usually do not recommend preordering the game but this one was an exception this game has everything that makes a game great great gameplay story graphics comedy tragedy and most of all the online feature only problem with great graphic games like this today is it is recommended to have a beefy hardware and i am still working on it but who cares about that part of my review

this is gta this is another rockstar games product an amazing game that people wait long time for true vetern gamers was expeceting for this the best game of the year rockstar games did good job its just another game that we will buy again a game to proud that you have this on your steam a game to spend time playing hesits killing peds on streets buying cars selling houses buying houses you can do everything if you dont own this game its seems youre not a true gamer go buy this

great game i still need to figure out how to fix my rendering issue just be careful when youre downloading mods from various websites you dont know if they have malware
recommended
hours of fun online is the only way to play
recommended
first thing no they dont need to alter how they deal with modderscheatershackers you installed the modused the scriptetc you shouldve disableduninstalled it before you went online dont blame r because you dont know how things work i preloaded the game onto a 120gb drive when the game unlocked i had to start over because i me this guy right here didnt read up how preloading games works and ran out of room on the drive  my fault not rs with that said i am in favor of them offering warnings to people about these things but they are in no way required to do so we claim to be all superior because we play on pcs yet we whine like little console brats every time the world reminds us we dont know everything accept responsibility for your screw up and stop giving bad reviews to a game because you dont understand how things work geez its like combing through kerbal space program reviews all over again now that all the angry kids are smashing stuff in their basements because someone disagreed with them onto the actual review wow thats pretty much all i can come up with as someone who played the first run on 360 i quivered like a little girl who has an appointment with a unicorn when i saw they were for sure making a pc version i knew it would be better in every way shape and form r didnt let us down one bit the game is amazingly well optimized ive played since launch and have only seen a few tiny bugs the main one being an issue with going from your garage to your apartment but even that one isnt a big deal especially because ive already discovered a workaround the graphics are awe inspiring many many many many many times i find myself forgetting what i was trying to do because as i flew around mt chiliad i caught the amazing sunsetsunrise and just had to land and take it all in for a moment right before promptly being eaten by a mountain lion i was out of the loop for online and updates while the game had its run on consoles so i cant accurately speak about the new content because a lot of it is new to me but may not be to you regardless i will say there is a ton of stuff to do buy see steal and shoot in addition to the updated graphics the new first person view the new cars weapons properties and activities the thing i thought was the most brilliant was how much more effort was put into making the map be alive as possible the console versions did an amazing job at this but the pc version is above and beyond the grass sways there are tiny rabbits that peek up from the shrubbery the way the water moves when you fly a helicopter or plane close to the surface especially noticeable is how much more busy the city is now down by the railroad tracks it is common to see people welding moving boxes etc the variety of pedestrians has also been majorly increased and my favorite part real randomly spawning cars no more of the gta iv style find the rarest car in the game and now theyre everywhere the variety of cars you will see looks authentic and is neighborhood accurate you wont see beat up emperors driving down vinewood blvd much the same way you wont see a benefactor driving down grove st well you might but the driver probably has a gun and lives a recidivist lifestyle the only thing i will say about the online aspect is this say goodbye to your kids let the neighbor have your wife quit your job grab a 40 and enjoy i could go on for days about this game but i reckon you got all you need if you have any questions about something specific just message me and i will be happy to answer i dont really believe in perfect scores anymore but if i had to give one to a game it would be this one still wont though lol 9910

tldr 1010 grand theft auto v is a game with styletons of it its the first game ive actually played and felt like i was a part of something special the scope of this game is absolutely insane one minute youll be at a dam and the next minute youll be raiding a federal building from great characters and amazing writing grand theft auto v is all you could ever ask for in a video game it even does a fantastic job of immersing you in this huge world with small things like people being robbed on the street or running into random car accidents and having to drive the person you just saved in that car accident back home then having them join your heist crew it makes you feel like superhero while also being insanely human beside from gtao being heavily flawed i think that grand theft auto v is a perfect game
recommended
racing shooting stealing planning accessorizing grand theft auto v has it all easily one of the best games on steam right now this game features the first ever multiplayer mode in the grand theft auto franchise even though it bears a hefty aaa price tag this game is worth it it boasts hours upon hours of replay value with an indepth singleplayer and an even better online mode on top of this the rockstar editor adds mountains of community jobs to play through and the recent addition of heist adds even more content to play with your friends the game has run smoothly so far on medium graphics settings with my 750ti but i would not recommend this game if your do not have a good machine i would also not recommend this game if you have less than 8gb of ram or are short on hard drive space as it is a 60gb download even though this game has a great singleplayer and it can be fun just to hop onto pub servers to hang out for a while i would also recommend rustling up some friends to play it with unfortunately rockstar does not seem to want us to make mods for this game and they are frequently pushing out new updates to stop modders in their tracks for now there is not much community content on that front but i anticipate more of it in the future
recommended
feel like the pc version wasnt worth waiting for game is visually nice gta is always timeless go buy

single player is great better physics graphics and ai than on ps3 multiplayer has unskipable movies out the  and way to many loading screens and waiting for other players currently sucks havent toutched the mods yet

great game you can mod and have tons of fun in single player just like what we all waited for and the online mode is executed very good it is not flawless but what can be one of the few games that are worth the money when it comes down the hours put in to it they are some people telling about bugs and general flaws with the online game but keep in mind these are the minorites who are probably complaining about the game instead of trying to solve it themselfs this game still feels fresh even though it was 16 years ago grand theft autos release  if you dont take in to account the delay of every pc realese ever  and that is quite amazing if you compare this game to the cod franchise sorry fanboys of cod which just feels like you are playing the same game over and over and over again with some new maps for just 5999 wow at the end of the day you are carrying a full arsenal of weapons and just that is pretty awesome i am not going to score the game because score does not tell you jack  and will propably make you skip reading everything the article or review is about

this is the first of the gta games ive played and was actually surprised its one of the few games that matches the hype that surrounds it the first thing i noticed was when i logged out only about 12% of the story was complete meaning wow a game that was $60 that actually takes longer than 6 hours to beat ex cod the story is extremely long and i havent even finished it but for a good reason i had been invited to play on online mode with friends it has so many things that you can do together like survival missions racing etc it has it all though the specific categories of events this game has isnt as good as games meant for that like racing in gta compared to a typical racing game its pretty close and you dont have to buy multiple games for it as much as i do love this game there is a couple of downfalls  first being the vehicles any game i play ill always play on my mousekeyboard because well its much more accurate unfortunately they decided to make flying cancer for mouse users instead of being able to steer with your mouse like every other game does they make you use your numpad and wsad so not only is it extremely annoying you go from 0100 when trying to turn if you expect to win any races or flawlessly finish a flying mission youre probably going to want to pick up a usb controller the other downside to the game is the connection especially after the game was first released the connection was terrible and you couldnt stay in a session for longer than 30 minutes though its gotten better and im sure it will still improve its still pretty bad normally id assume its my own connection first but it happens to the people i play with also overall i think this game is great and like i mentioned before one of the few games id pay $60 for its got a lot to do it satisfies both completionists and people that just like to finish games customization isnt pay to win and a blast with friends 910

this game was definitely worth the wait

i have to say ive had my share of issues with this game but once you get past the problems this game is just stunning the story is captivating the gameplay is fresh and the world feels alive the online part is fun but there are always notveryfriendly players that will ruin your experience i recommend playing with friends exclusively the modding scene has picked up pretty quickly weve seen great progress in a short period of time the game has great potential hopefully r will stop trying to prevent modding the game itself is amazing when there arent any gamebreaking glitchesbugs in your way hopefully the developers will fix them soon enough i recommend this game

have to say one of the best gta games i have ever played and pc version must be the best version of gta v i have tried it in xbox 360 and ps4 but i have to say pc version is the best atleast if you got enough good pc to run it smoothly one of the reasons i find this more enjoyable than other gtas that i have played gta iv eflc san andreas vice city gta iii because the game world feels so dynamic and alive there is alot of things to do and discover along the missions the way they designed the world map it feels very familiar in my opinion to san andreas world map it has places you can swear that you have been there before but they arent as they were still nice touche thou the characters are interesting but i think travor is the one with most character development still not my favourite character amazing still then some minor things i hate but you may disagree is for example special cars after storing them into garage you will lose it anyway if you dont bring it back weapon pickups its just that i loved to find things around the world in the older games and this includes collectables yeah like i said i liked them alot from the shells and sprays in san andreas im very aware there are collectables in gta v but they arent the same feeling but like i said you might disagree maybe im just blinded by nostalgia now the bad things you should be aware of nothing major mostly coming from online server browser yeah its missing and the system is kind of a weird one and the jobs and such i think they should have server browser if not the sessions because its stupid if you want to find something its not that easy or atleast would be easier with server browser loading screens really depends on yerrrr hardwareee ayo some models are dissapointing for 2015 game even on highest settings better fov slider and lastly world scale as alive and big the world feels atleast judging from so far that i have explored around the map the scaling feels just a bit off for long distances thinking how fast the desert turns into major city only in about 5miles yeah well overall my opinion is like gta or like freeroam getgetgetgetgetget and overall games its great experience its no masterpiece but its still fantastic tldr 910 buy it

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

an awesome game to play religiously or just to play every now and then

most fun game up too date twisted

i played gta for years  i started with san andreas and i had hours of fun the first few days gta v came out  were like a dream i completed the story mode and it was big fun okay maybe i did it in a few days but after the story i just started  to just kill everybody on my way it started to be boring because the cops are really much  against only you so i decided to use the legal ingame cheats they work only on the story mode like explosive melee and so on it started to become boring and i sold the game i played it on xbox after few days i sold it  the online mode came out  but it would be stupid to sell a game and buy it again after few days i decided to forget it for a few months after long time of waiting years d the game became available for pc and i bought it on steam the story mode  is the same  so i just started with the online mode it was much bigger fun than the story mode now i can fight against the cops in freeplay with my friends this is much more fun than fighting alone in story mode  i think everybody should know what the online mode is about so i jump to this part the heists at the first look i loved them they are easy and you get much ingame money i think that rockstar thought this too but waiting for the 4 member for the heist is so loooong if you just cant to the heist after 2 times some members just give up and leave they just leave you try to make the best and they leave you cant do the heist without all members if you are the boss of the crew you pay some money to pay the members they must be paid with something and if 1 member just leaves the money is lost and i think its not easy to get so much money back i think that the heists are really not a bad idea but they must be improved but as far as i know rockstar they dont improve the heists they just make some new stuff  i hope its something good i really like this game and i recommend it 9910 points you should buy this game because it makes really much fun and you dont get aggressive d
recommended
very good optimization extensive single player campaign and fun multiplayer although you have to use rockstars social club its only a minor inconvenience for how easy it is to spend hours on this game

gta v was already good and now its on pc this is definitely the best way to play the game

great graphics would be nice if they would have released a year earlier but was well worth the wait in my opinion quality graphics great multiplayer heists and tons of cars much better than my first run through the game on xbox one

best game ever but dont download mods
recommended
overall a great single player story the best gta sp ive played to date however online is ok but the load screens are insane they really need to be shortened some how
recommended
most of the negative reviews are for being banned cuz of modsrather than game issues itself like loading times lobbies being full etc  and yes r does allow you to use mods in sp as long as you avoid online and deleting the mod before going anywhere near online and actually i found it more interesting that most of them tends to swear insult and lie in their negative reviews which makes me wonder that  r actually did a good jobpossibly getting rid of potential community scums to ban most of them even if they got banned for using mods only in sp and did not accidently went into the online to ruin other people experience or perhaps enhance their own in any way but the most funny negative review i found was  my game bugged and i lost 1mln worth car r customer service did not helped me therefore i used glitch to get a new one and pile of swear words and he is surprised that he got banned im pretty sure r could had helped him but i almost certain that the way he asked for help was in the same manner as he wrote his negative pretty idiotic review

better than any gta game before it looks great story is worth the $60 alone online is like a whole different game on top very little crashing load times are bearable

hi there what can i say about this great peace of digital art amazing great story love everything about the game as i sit here writing this and looking down the page at some of the negative comments i started to rub my fingers together do you no what that is the worlds smallest violin just for you activation take note rockstar did a brilliant job of banning the cheaters

timed out loading session simulator 2015 on a serious note this is a pretty fun game keep in mind that you cannot use mods without getting banned by rockstar or something like that i dunno look it up

this is just in awesome ignore the reviews of those who got banned of using mods

no need to say anything about it because it is a masterpiece believe me this game should be in your library

pro i really enjoyed the single player theres really not much to say about it its almost perfect for me i think im going to replay it for the fourth time con if i wanted to go neurotic by a closetoworthless online experience id have bought a ubisoft game like any splinter cell  the enjoyfactor is so close i think ubisofts best team personally helped to develop this feature but i still recommend it because if i can join to a session and if i can start a heistmission and if no one leaves and if dont raise twelve grandchild until the loading screen ends its really fun if no one kills me immediately after the mission which also generates a loading screen and i die internally twice per hour
recommended
the pc version of this game is epic having played this on my ps4 and now on my new asus rog laptop i can safely say that the pc is king graphics 1010 gameplay on keyboard 1010 the only down side is that you would of expected a few decent dlc by now considering how long the game has been on the market

this game is definitely worth the money please note that rockstar is not banning for single player mods and the people who said they got banned for no reason or for single player mods are liars rockstar is banning anyone using mods in online mode only no one got banned for nothing these people are cheaters looking to blame rockstar because they mad bro

if you already own a copy of the game and you are asking yourself is it worth buying it again for the pc the anwser should be yessss purely for the first person perspective it makes the game feel brand new and it works extremely well which i have to say surprised me of course you would also buy it for the graphics the extra content and the bonus that as a pc owner we can create our own radio station if like me you running a amd card you need to download and install the amd catalyst 154 beta for windows  grand theft auto v optimized this should solve some of the issues the link httpsupportamdcomenuskbarticlespageslatestcatalystwindowsbetaaspx creating you own radio is extremely easy all you need to do is open your documents there you should find a folder called rockstar games open it then open the gta v folder there you will see the folder you want to put the music in called user music then open the game go into settingsaudio and there is and option to scan for music once you have scanned the music into the game there will be a radio station called self radio which will play the songs you put into the user music folder you can play them as it is listed in the folder or you radomise the playlist or even have radio ads between the music httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvynurnhffndm i had given this game a bashing when i thought rockstar were banning people for modding the game in offline mode but thankfully that is not the case thankyou hacc for bringing it to my attention

worried that this game wont run on your computer read this i have a lenovo laptop with an amd a105750 8 gb of ram 2 hard drives solid and spinning win 7 on solid and gta v on spinning and no dedicated video card when i got this game i did some research and found that the best direct x setting was 101 for me not the default 11 this helped but did not fix completely my only graphical problem pixilated horizons its still very playable at around 17 fps and causes very little discomfort when playing so yes gta v runs fine on the a10s integrated graphics and i hope that the system requirements dont make you not want this game if all that you are missing is the graphics card just remember that the a10 is pretty high performance as far as integrated graphics goes so do your research 1010 would disprove system requirements again

well what can i say this game though what one hell of a difference compared to consoles so much more to do and a way much better than the  they give you on consoles i would say if you already have it on console or not get it on here as you will notice the hell of a difference on consoles it is 25 fps or less and on gta v it is 60fps so much better and smoother even in 4k so far better than consoles trash the consoles for the master race continues luke

after a 150 hours of playtime i had to with grand theft auto 5 on pc i feel that im ready to review it gta v is an amibitious open world game that is extremely detailed at every block and is able to show its strengths through its memorable characters and riveting missions los santos a modern day la with a satirical twist makes the city feel authentic and familiar landmarks are scaled similary and popular locations recreated in los santos are closely taken in consideration rockstar has successfully recreated a city that is not only believable but also enjoyable to roam you play as three criminals throughout the storyline that will complete numerous heists and repel against rivals through your journey for fortune humor also plays a key role within gta v as youll find yourself snickering or sometimes laughing uncontrollably at ridicioulous moments these moments make the game much more memorable and unforgettable the online component of gta v is similar to its single player counterpart but can also be played with friends or a crew race participate in a gang war set up a heist or mod the your car the possiblities are somewhat endless you will be able to sink a lot of your time into the multiplayer component of gta v but it may become repetitive after a while if youre attempting to play alone always try to play with friends gta v is an amazing open world game with much to do it is worth its asking price and performs phenomenally on a variety of builds positives great pc version large world enjoyable characters 40 hours of single player content mod support multiplayer provides endless amount of content negatives peer to peer conneciton is used in gtao lod issues seemed to arise during some recent patches

i think this game is good its pretty nice but the servers are a bit slow from time to time its all understanding due to the heavy activity on the online servers but still

fantastic game with great optimization the single player has a great story with a lot of side missions to do although they get tiring after a while and gta online is lots of fun with heists missions and all the different chaos you can cause with friends it looks beautiful and runs at around 7080 fps with nearly everything on very high on my nvidia 970 there has been controversy with mods on this game but there are simple solutions to make sure that you dont get banned if playing single player keep the mods in your gta folder but if you want to play gta online put them in a different folder it is a bit of a hassle but it is necessary at the moment gta online has its problems namely people who use mods in multipayer and that can detract from the fun a bit but nevertheless this game is outstanding and definitely worth it even at full price

i own this game on every system except for ps3 what can i say another great game by rockstar with over 29 days played in gta online i can say i have wasted a good bit of my time burrowed into this game but hey its fun and entertaining to say the least it was worth every penny except for the bad net code on xbox 360 right now preventing me from playing with my friend the pc version is hands down the most bada$$ version ive played now on the topic of mods i enjoy using them in single player and believe that only certain mods should be allowed in multiplayer like fov etc but that is no excuse to go around aimboting or giving people infinite money and so on overall 1010 singleplayer 1010 multiplayer 810

gta v is definitely packed with crazy and more challenging missions i would at least died 12 times before completing the hard mission before playing it for the first time saw many complaints on how they were unable to launch the game or crashes during the game even with high end rigs i was worried at first but once i launched the game it felt like they were talking about another game lolplayed for many hours now i dont even encounter a single problem running it smoothly at 6064 fps note that it doesnt have an ultra setting most is at very high which i assume is the ultra level i have a typical high end built rig just the usual stuff i7 4790k 16gb ram with a single gpu asus strix gtx 970game has never crash at all through hours of playthere are lots to do indeed in the big world however no game is ever made to perfection and its not possible either since everyones expectation and own liking are different cons  single player experience only no option to let you change your default car i hate michaels dumb car pimping it does not make any much difference  you cant drop your old gunsit gets annoying once you buy better guns and needed to switch a few times to use it  you cant go topless by freedom sometimes i just want the character to go topless to show off the tattoos having the bad  look when theyre about to commit crimes like saint rowsit only happens during mission randomly and you cant have the option to do so thats all i could think of for now this is still an awesome open world game i really really do not recommend this game for anyone under 13 very heavy vulgarities on language and actions
recommended
whats there to say this game is awesome buy it now

this game is awesome buy it but if you want to have even more fun play on the 5m modded servers when they come out

the seventh game in the grand theft auto series brings back los santos and san andreasthough greatly overhauled it also brings a fair amount of new stuff to do compared to its lackluster predecessor as well as a fleshed out online component unfortunately it also comes with its share of issues for one its an incredibly hardware intensive game and while you can run most of the settings at high or very high if you dont have a 34gb vram card youre not going to be able to run textures on anything higher than normal its also plagued by a few persistent issues such as the custom radio causing stutter for many and performance drops where they really shouldnt occur issues with shadows either not appearing or bugging out have also been reported and experienced by myself those issues aside its a better port than the previous games and the online component works much better on a good desktop than it does on consoles loading times are good and the new director mode allows you to unleash your inner spielberg if youve already played the console version you know what to expect if youre new to the game youll be in for a treat

1010 would wait a few more years

awesome game and the most important thing is that i can play it with my mac video card 750m only thing is once you finish the single player missions the game gives you a lot of money and theres barely anything to do yet the money still isnt enough to buy the golf club and i couldnt really find a way to earn that money feels a bit sad multiplayer is really fun

1010 openworld lover should buy this game

gta online is a beautiful cloud simulator you can see houses under the clouds roads and at night street lights the camera shakes slightly which really adds depth and the entire scene is blurred slightly gta online offers a wide variety of places to view clouds in a city similar to la or a place called sandy shores a more rural area while you watch your clouds they even let you listen to the city belows radio stationswhich have a huge amount of music to listen to to really top things off other plays can join you in watching the clouds and you can text or voice chat with each other occasionally although this is very very rare the game will glitch out and put you in the city you usually see from the clouds they give you guns or sometimes youre in cars its a really weird bug i think its an easter egg gone wrong overall its a nice calming multiplayer cloud simulator that really makes me feel like im some creepy dude who has his own private helicopter only to stare at the same spot for hours in it

amazing it outshines gta 4 by a landsllde you can do about everything in this game and more just beat the story and it was the best put together video game story in years where it has you pretty much cheering for the characters like they are real people but still give a feeling like its a real world adaption of a movie graphics look amazing and im and the minimal settings too i believe  my compute ris only 1  2 years old  so that just screams how amazing and life like everything looks especially since all cutscenes are acted by the voice actors themselves so they really nail how the character would react with motion behind it oh yeah and the voice work is amazing main characters sound believable and entertaining while the minor npcs all sound like they are having real conversations and react like real peopleto most things at least since cant directly talk to them the ai is fantasticat times at least what i mean is that they hit the head on how people would walk and do stuff so all the npcs feel natural its justsometimes the game does glitch out with ai but thats on rare cases more of a physics thing anyway biggest complaint is that when driving if your driving in wrong lane people tend to swerve toward you instead of trying to swerve away the big feature though is heists basically fun main quest robberies that earn you big bucks but requires big team and careful planning and prep basically you will be introduced to a heist idea and will study up on the place sometimes then you will go to a planning board screen that will explain the two paths you could take to achieving a successful heist with both options being completely different sometimes and resulting in its own events that will make the heist smoother or pay more after you choose you get to make the choice on the crew basically you have a list of people who you can choose to do certain roles usually being hackers gunmen and drivers the big thing here is it is important that you choose correctly who you take with you because they can die from not being skilled enough or make bad mistakes but you dont want to hire to good of a team because they require big cuts in the loot as you find potiental crew members and level up existing ones in heist  which make them better without raising the cut percentage  its all your decision though gameplay is amazing a literal wall filled with different guns though they are broke into 8 classes that game takes time to introduce before you can buy sadly but hey some are so expensive you wouldnt be able to buy them tll the point they unlocked them anyway because of the amount of money they give you in start which brings me to my only two complaintsin the begining unlike gta 4 which would pay you for nearly every job but with low amounts gta 5 doesnt pay you for alot of jobs but makes up for it with when they do pay you its usually big and the fact that business exist for you to purchase and earn money as well as other ways to earn money also the biggest complaint i have that in single player  because multiplayeri s a different beast and i only liek talking about single player in reviews like this  they give you so few heists theyre about 45 in the game after say 40 hours of gameplay i just wish they threw in more and really explored the aspect of multi pathed heists with some routes that just are failure routes if you cant be efficent and have a great team other than that i still say its a great game and will always recommend till hopefully gta 6 blows it out of the water  just hopefully not in the next couple years like some companies do  very much in the top ranks of my favorite games

ignore any sense of doubt thats preventing you from buying this game it truly is a masterpiece i only really entered the grand theft auto game series when the fifth game in the series released back in 2013 i first owned it on my ps3  but since the next gen releases that have of course made their way to steam it has truly become one of my favourite games of all time i dont want to ramble on for too long talking about the game has be done so often and youtube is a great source for witnessing the experiences that can be had with this game personnally i reccomend this game for its totally professional and truly playful cynicism everything from the storyline plot to the inside jokes and excellent portrayal of radio and all the excellent ingame company names that mock those in real life the online experience just gets better and better also alone or with friends its truly entertaining and the pc offers the most potential out of services such as creator and the rockstar editor the heist missions do require communication but frequently the players youll encounter are sociable and willing to talk if not just go to ammunation and start a little war in los santos its equally as rewarding seriously what a game

have to say one of the best gta games i have ever played and pc version must be the best version of gta v i have tried it in xbox 360 and ps4 but i have to say pc version is the best atleast if you got enough good pc to run it smoothly one of the reasons i find this more enjoyable than other gtas that i have played gta iv eflc san andreas vice city gta iii because the game world feels so dynamic and alive there is alot of things to do and discover along the missions the way they designed the world map it feels very familiar in my opinion to san andreas world map it has places you can swear that you have been there before but they arent as they were still nice touche thou the characters are interesting but i think travor is the one with most character development still not my favourite character amazing still then some minor things i hate but you may disagree is for example special cars after storing them into garage you will lose it anyway if you dont bring it back weapon pickups its just that i loved to find things around the world in the older games and this includes collectables yeah like i said i liked them alot from the shells and sprays in san andreas im very aware there are collectables in gta v but they arent the same feeling but like i said you might disagree maybe im just blinded by nostalgia now the bad things you should be aware of nothing major mostly coming from online server browser yeah its missing and the system is kind of a weird one and the jobs and such i think they should have server browser if not the sessions because its stupid if you want to find something its not that easy or atleast would be easier with server browser loading screens really depends on yerrrr hardwareee ayo some models are dissapointing for 2015 game even on highest settings better fov slider and lastly world scale as alive and big the world feels atleast judging from so far that i have explored around the map the scaling feels just a bit off for long distances thinking how fast the desert turns into major city only in about 5miles yeah well overall my opinion is like gta or like freeroam getgetgetgetgetget and overall games its great experience its no masterpiece but its still fantastic tldr 910 buy it

highly enjoyed my 50 hours of loading screens

2 thing please read before you buy first off i want to say rockstar has done it again with gta 5 with more difficult officers heists and just crazy stupid stuff that you can do with friends ex having chinhook helicopter pick up a car and use it as a wrecking ball no miley is not in the game to smash your friends rockstar has put together a very compelling storyline with an addicting multiplayer it is very clear that none of there time was dedicated to online beacuse online is absolutely  at this point if any of you readers know what went down when gta 5 hit consoles this is ten times worse for those of you who dont know what went down heres a rundown hackers hackers hackers rockstar has done absolutely horse  about it too hackers are ruining the game by 1 giving players who do and dont infinite money theres nothing else to do except crazy  but everyone is equal 2 being massive ing trolls who cant die blow you up at any given time and shoot explosive bullets 3 ddos your game if you try and report them they crashed my game so horribly that i had to restart my computer and yes this was almost immediately after i reported him rockstar has no antihackmod system so literally everyone who has google and a brain can ing hack it at first it was not so bad but now there are ing hackers on every lobby i have to get a private lobby with my friends to play in peace however this is a fun game if you dont get hacked the storyline is great and multiplayer is addicting if you can find a nonhacker lobby this is not a thumbsup nor thumbsdown review because i have mixed feelings about this game thank you for reading this and i hope it leads you to better your decision about whether to buy this game tyathias

go online hackers use your id and other peoples to explode everybody on the server at the same time whilst spawning clones of your character with assault rifles and stun guns who then precede to murder you later on the same clones die and get stuck to your body so no matter where you go you have a pile of corpses getting dragged around with you for the rest of the session 1110 would drag dead clones around again

in gtav you are placed in the shoes of 3 characters who would go about breaking every single law in the name of money experience a revamped los santos as you run around doing your shenanigans and raising hell all over the place storywise when compared to gta iv the tale of niko bellic gtav is much lighter and not as dark and serious as gtaiv at the very least you will get tons of hours of gameplay in easily which would guaranteed your moneys worth [its a gta game 100 hours is easily achieved just by messing around] onlinewise there are tons of activities to pursue such as races missions heists more messing around just with other players this time

im going to be honest this is my favorite game of all time i played the  out of it on 360 and pc just adds on it but ing rockstar ing rockstar  from here on out i am going to use r for rockstar  r has been banning people for modding in single player yes single player the worst part of this is they never warned anyone before bringing out the ban hammer so let me give you a quick scenario of what has been happening 1 you play the game dont like the forced 90 degree fov 2 you see a mod that changes the fov to 100 degrees 3 you play the game with the 100 fov mod in single player 4 you take off the mod to play online because your scared of bans 5 you load online just to find yourself banned for using a mod in single player 6 you write a  steam review because your upset and thats it that is the game at the moment if you plan on playing the game without mods go for it just remember you cant play online if you use any mod at any time i understand r not wanting mods but maybe a warning would be nicer next time

the goods and bads of gtav of course these are just my opinions but feel free to agree or disagree lets start with the good items 1 lotsa cars and customization sure not everycar can be completely decked out but where else can you turbocharge an electric scooter 2 plenty of activities to do racing killing fyling killing robbing storebanks killing 3 passive mode for when the kids with jets attack 4 own up to 30 cars at 1 time given you have 3 ten car garages apartments 5 alot of weapon choices 6 singleplayer is pretty amazing  3 characters and and a pretty great storyline also with numerous activities and now onto the bad things 1 just about everything costs money why would i pay $500 just to kill myself in mp 2 some things are heavily overpriced sure it keeps things in check so everyone isnt cruising around in a bugatti veyron or lamborghini venino but $50000 just for a pilots suit that only functions cosmetically 3 you cant sell any weapons every weapon you buy is stuck in your inventory for eternity and just stuffs up your weapon wheel some poeple are ok with it other people find it annoying 4 be prepared to join a community more toxic than chernobyl sure not all servers are bad but occasionally you get servers with kids rolling around in jets blowing you up with their op cannons repeatedly or the guys who only bought the game just to make your gameplay experience a living hell 5 hackers oh yeeee hackers always find their way in games especially gta not all hackers are out just ruin everyones experience but it gets annoying trying to find a server where there isnt a guy is just blowing everyone up with their magical powers 6 swear block if youre going to make a game 18 keep it 18 dont just give in and make it kidfriendly all of sudden by removing our ability to swear god d if anything the negatives are mostly just a setback to the game rather than a complete deal breaker which is why im thumbsupping it it is possible even with the negatives to have a pretty good game experience even better if you have friends to play with as long as you have the parince to play your going to have an exceptional time just make sure you take these setbacks into consideration before buying the game and dont think that its gonna be a smooth easy ride to the top ranks of online unless you have alot of cashmoney to blow on shark cards online currency then you probably can do whatever you want
recommended
i bought the game for the 60$ before the summer sale so other then saying that rockstar is applying the american tradition of screwing over their customers or potential customers by pull some bullnjsgfvwejf move however i am not going to talk about that i am going to talk about the problem i have been having long before the summer sale the rockstar launcher it wont finish loading at all after a minute or two of patience i get a message from my computer saying that it crashed it will still be there though after i press close program which is odd as balls i have made a quest of finding a fix for this mighty foe nothing worked after reading a few posts of the steam fourms of this game i knew i wasnt the only one others went further then me by after rockstarsteam for help accourding to all all of them it was pointless and the proplem was never fixed that was three months ago nothing as changed rockstar gives no care or has any idea how to fix it to hell with rockstar to hell with most major gaming places to hell with it all buy this game somewhere else a used copy that is way cheaper then 60$ because the problems it not worth it
not recommended
although rockstars customer support and marketing sales strategy isnt exactly great the game iself is comapred to previous installments of the gta franchise gta v gives played a moving intense and cinematic experience the story is well written dialogue between characters is smooth and realistic the game has a great sense of humour which is not only limited to the main characters a con that stems directly from the new cinematic experience is the loss of freedom or at the feeling of lost freedom in my experience three or four hundred hours played across pc and console the free roam between missions and after the conclusion is lacking although i cant quite pinpoint why i feel this way i believe it has something to do with the ludicrous police response times animals calling the police extremely low health civilians and the ability of cops to track you based on scent and xray vision even though the game has its flaws its still an incredible addition to the gta franchise and i hope that future games will continue its legacy now on to the online portion most if not all of my online complaints stem from poor customer service i myself have rarely come up against hackers and unlike the broad community i dont really mind them as long as they dont chase me around los santos for 10 minutes throwing bags of money at me people who hack stats spawn vehicles even use god mode are fine in my opinion as long as they dont use their power to annoy others obviously a wish that will never come to fruition not sure if i should be mentioning this but i often find people complaining that they have been banned for th fov mod but i honestly believe that the just use it as a scapegoat i have been using the fov mod since the games release and i havent been banned leading me to believe that people being banned for using the fov mod are actually using trainers or other more intrusive hacksmods anyways i wholeheartedly recommend this game despite its flaws questionable business tactics and shotty customer support

very fun game highly reccomended for first time players

so fun cant stop

i didnt mod the game so i didnt get banned 1010

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
 great game but  move by making it $8000
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

killed some hookers stole some cars then came home and bought gta 5 nice game

early life winston leonard spencerchurchill was born to an aristocratic family on november 30 1874 as his life unfolded he displayed the traits of his father lord randolph churchill a british statesman from an established english family and his mother jeanette jennie jerome an independentminded new york socialite as a young child churchill grew up in dublin ireland where his father was employed by his grandfather the 7th duke of marlborough john spencerchurchill when he entered formal school churchill proved to be an independent and rebellious student he did poorly at his first two schools and in april 1888 he was sent to harrow school a boarding school near london within weeks of his enrollment he joined the harrow rifle corps which put him on a path to a military career at first it didnt seem the military was a good choice for churchill it took him three tries to pass the exam for the british royal military college however once there he did well and graduated 20th in his class of 130 up to this time his relationship with both his mother and father was distant though he adored them both while at school churchill wrote emotional letters to his mother begging her to come see him but she seldom came his father died when he was 21 and it was said that churchill knew him more by reputation than by any close relationship they shared churchill enjoyed a brief but eventful career in the british army at a zenith of british military power he joined the fourth hussars in 1895 and served in the indian northwest frontier and the sudan where he saw action in the battle of omdurman in 1898 while in the army he wrote military reports for newspapers the pioneer and the daily telegraph and two books on his experiences the story of the malakand field force 1898 and the river war 1899 in 1899 churchill left the army and worked as a war correspondent for the morning post a conservative daily newspaper while reporting on the boer war in south africa he was taken prisoner by the boers while on a scouting expedition he made headlines when he escaped traveling almost 300 miles to portuguese territory in mozambique upon his return to britain he wrote about his experiences in the book london to ladysmith 1900 early careers government and military in 1900 churchill became a member of parliament in the conservative party for oldham a town in manchester following his father into politics he also followed his fathers sense of independence becoming a supporter of social reform unconvinced that the conservative party was committed to social justice churchill switched to the liberal party in 1904 he was elected a member of parliament in 1908 and was appointed to the prime ministers cabinet as president of the board of trade that same year he married clementine ogilvy hozier after a short courtship as president of the board of trade he joined newly appointed chancellor lloyd george in opposing the expansion of the british navy also in 1908 he introduced several reforms for the prison system introduced the first minimum wage and helped set up labor exchanges for the unemployed and unemployment insurance churchill assisted in the passing of the peoples budget which introduced new taxes on the wealthy to pay for new social welfare programs the budget passed the house of commons in 1909 but was initially defeated in the house of lords before being passed in 1910 he also drafted a controversial piece of legislation to amend the mental deficiency act of 1913 mandating sterilization of the feebleminded the bill eventually passed both houses with only the remedy of confinement in institutions in january 1911 churchill showed his tougher side when he made a controversial visit to a police siege in london police had surrounded a house where two robbers had been caught churchills degree of participation is still in some dispute some accounts have him going to the scene only to see for himself what was going on others state that he allegedly gave directions to police on how to best storm the building what is known is that the house caught fire during the siege and churchill prevented the fire brigade from extinguishing the flames stating that he thought it better to let the house burn down rather than risk lives rescuing the occupants the bodies of the two robbers were found inside the charred ruins while serving as first lord of the admiralty since 1911 churchill helped modernize the british navy ordering that new warships be built with oilfired instead of coalfired engines he was one of the first to promote military aircraft and set up the royal navy air service so enthusiastic was he about aviation that he took flying lessons to understand firsthand its military potential though not directly involved in the disastrous battle of gallipoli churchill resigned his post because he felt responsible for proposing the expedition for a brief period he rejoined the british army commanding a battalion of the royal scots fusiliers on the western front and seeing action in no mans land in 1917 he was appointed minister of munitions for the final year of the war overseeing the production of tanks airplanes and munitions from 1919 to 1922 churchill served as minister of war and air and colonial secretary under prime minister david lloyd george as colonial secretary churchill was embroiled in another controversy when he ordered air power be used on rebellious kurdish tribesmen in iraq a british holding at one point he suggested that poisonous gas be used to put down the rebellion this proposal was considered but never enacted though the conventional bombing campaign was and failed to end the resistance fractures in the liberal party led to the defeat of churchill as a member of parliament in 1922 and he rejoined the conservative party he served as chancellor of the exchequer returning britain to the gold standard and took a hard line against a general labor strike that threatened to cripple the british economy with the defeat of the conservative government in 1929 churchill was out of government he was perceived as a rightwing extremist who was out of touch with the people he spent the next few years concentrating on his writing and published a history of english speaking peoples world war ii though not at first seeing the threat that adolph hitler posed when he rose to power in 1933 churchill gradually became a leading advocate for british rearmament by 1938 as germany began controlling its neighbors churchill had become a staunch critic of british prime minister neville chamberlains policy of appeasement toward the nazis on september 3 1939 the day that britain declared war on germany churchill was appointed first lord of the admiralty and a member of the war cabinet and by april 1940 he became chairman of the military coordinating committee later that month germany invaded and occupied norway which was a setback for neville chamberlain who had resisted churchills proposal that britain preempt german aggression by unilaterally occupying vital norwegian iron mines and sea ports in may debate in parliament on the norwegian crisis led to a vote of no confidence toward prime minister chamberlain on may 10 king george vi appointed churchill as prime minister and minister of defense within hours the german army began its western offensive invading the netherlands belgium and luxembourg two days later german forces entered france britain stood alone against the onslaught quickly churchill formed a coalition cabinet of leaders from the labor liberal and conservative parties he placed intelligent and talented men in key positions on june 18 1940 churchill made one of his iconic speeches to the house of commons warning that the battle of britain was about to begin churchill kept resistance to nazi dominance alive

this is one of those games that was clearly built from the ground up with the word fun in mind everything from the games open world to its charaters and narative reflects this notion despite some flaws like its ui being a little to minimalist for my tast and that the games satire while always funny is never quite as clever as it thinks it is but those are issues that can easaly be overlooked this still is good old runingguningkillingpedestriancarjackining fun

the game has been out for two years theres not much for me to add in detail that said im constantly floored by how much detail they packed in im a sucker for a good open worlder r continues to be the diamond standard i really wish there were a lot more missions though r built this huge open world but ive got a feeling well only see limited additions if any this is because the emphasis seems to be on multiplayer thats not my thing so im worrying my favorite franchise may be dead anon multiplayer is a hugely expensive feature to add because of the amount of investment into network optimization and anticheat you have to put in heres the short of it id gladly pay 30bucks for an equal or better expansion pack that did nothing but place a new or sequel story line in exactly the same world no new features just a lot of new missions and story or a good heists engine for single player that would work too

yo what it is cuz heres the deal single player is dank 810 bomb nuggets online multiplayer is stank 110 bomb nuggets overall good game and port recommended only if you plan to play single player primarily avoid the buggy flawed online gameplay at all costs not even the dankest bomb nuggets could make that maggot infested pile of tyrannosaurusrekt garbage tolerable

best game ever you can do a lot of things without any mod but it is sad to know that you cant use any mod anymore not even in single player or youll be banned this is the only flaw of this amazing game

at first i thought this was just another gta a console port done reasonably well but for all that just a console port however the more i play the more i like it no not like it i love it i am not really all the motivated by the gta franchise in the past but i like open world games so they appeal to me on that basis what has really got me into gta v is that it is big not large huge a really open world which is something i didnt expect from anything that had even sat next to someone that had once looked at someone that once played something on an xbox it is massive and open with all sorts of interesting ways to get around the graphics caveat here i have unusually powerful machines at my disposal sli and tri sli titans custom watercooling blah blah blah depending on my latest build i seek out the most demanding games because i like state of the art i want to see the potential of todays technology explored and in many respects gta v does that playing at 2560x1440 and above with all the options enabled these textures look incredible how many times have i been wizzing along in a car and crashed because i am staring at the city in wonder this is what i like massive open and no compromises on quality on top of that they are not afraid to have themes which appeal to someone over 14 not gratuitously nor is it out of place but it adds something and makes the city feel that little bit more alive i still have a lot to do in gta but it is one of those games i know i will be going back to for a long time the seminal moment of the gta series

i built my gaming pc primarily for a few games that i knew i wasnt going to buy for console this game was one of them after finally getting all the parts putting it together and getting it up and running gta v finally came out for pc about a year later being hyped for almost year and then seeing the games launch get delayed twice kinda sucked i actually didnt mind rockstar postponing the release i would rather they make sure that the game is actually ready and at least playable on release day cough ea cough the story is amazing every gta has had an amazing story this games keeps the tradition going i had the chance to play it on my buddys ps4 after it released for a second time and only thought about how much better it would look when run on my pc i have to say this is simply one of the best games ever created for pc so far in terms of graphics gameplay and everything else the map is the biggest map created for every game ever and every nook and cranny of it looks incredible sometimes i like driving around and just enjoying the scenery even though my pc was budget built and only sports a midrange graphics card an amd r9 270 i was still able to max out the cards 2 gigs of memory with as much details as i could whilst still maintaining a solid 60 frames per second and it still looked better than the console released copies every friend that came over to play couldnt stop drooling at how smooth it played and how beautiful it looked i still have yet to get a crossfire graphics setup as well as grab a 4k monitor and see what else this game has to offer i also tried out using a less powerful card a gtx 750 ti and it still looked pretty frickin sweet i totally recommend this game to anyone that loves being able to do anything they want in a world that looks so realistic get lost in such a great story have a good time playing with friends and anyone that wishes to push their pcs to the limit

the first gta ive actually enjoyed bacause of the first person camera viewpoint but mainly because theyve tightened up the driving physics although the traction is still like driving on snow you can travel about 200 metres along the sand on a beached jetski and included a drivers eyeline camera viewpoint although it does turn into a chestcam on vehicles like the quad bike but all told a really really enjoyable experience one of my fave games and one of the best ive played in a long long time ive not enjoyed myself this much in an open world game since mafia lost heaven
recommended
amazing game and amazing port must own for gta fans obviously

this is a really good port over from the consoles and i would recommend it to anyone who has played any of the gta games previous and even to those who havent

online is awesome when you play with friends or when you do random races but otherwise there are a lot of hackers so watch out p

i have put almost 100 hrs into the game its allot of fun and you will enjoy it once you get the swing of the match matching it takes patience because you will be enjoying load screens and mach making screens allot if you are playing on your own starting a heist on your own can take from 510 minutes to get a full lobby per mission and there are 5 not to mention the load into and out of free play after every setup if you dont have an ssd now is the time to invest hackers are a problem and they are not i will explain you will run into a hacker every time you play the upside is that if you dont keep cash on you but deposit it then its nothing but a minor annoyance they kill you you spawn 100 ft away no negative consequences to you if they blow up your personal vehicle they have to pay for the new one so being a hacker with teleporting and so on is useless out side of minor trolling i dont see the appeal but apparently they like it one thing that will happen allot is server crashes they occur on the regular like allot allot to the point its common place and accepted but this is not acceptable for a multimillion dollar if billion dollar profit game i am in a crew and i am not the only one this only happens when you are in free mode mucking about good thing is it doesnt drop you from the game just everyone in the server leaves leaving it empty with just you connecting back to free mode after a job or heist is also hit and miss and will hang up about 1520% of the time even kicking you back to single player thankfully you can join a job or heistif invited from single the game will attempt to connect you to a new sessionheistjob by pulling you from your sessionwaiting then it realizes it cannot connect to the full serverwaiting then it connects you back to a new sessionwaiting and then you get to try it all over again all in all the game is a blast even when you get a night of load screens

a game in witch is fun with friends but even better if ur good in public to have the most fun you must be a higher rank then 40 so you have some good guns to troll alot of money to pay for blown up cars a mic and can talk a bunch of  and a friend to back you up and humiliate the player more if you dont find humor in this your not gonna fit into the community well cause what i just typed is basicly the whole community

gta v is the first game of the gta series that i played and i have to say its single player story mode is one of the best games i have ever played what i liked  very interesting story line with its three different characters  stunning eye for detail which shows in interaction with people environment voice acting physics driving is better than some socalled racing games  great customisation options for cars  vibrant city with all npcs going about their business los santos is very much alive  excellent graphics and performance there were only very few occasions where it dipped below 60 fps  variety of missions which never feel repetitive  huge choice of weapons and vehicles  good sense of humour both in story cutscenes as well as npcs what spoiled the experience a little  you spend a lot of time picking cars up from the impound because a mission forces the personal vehicle on you and impounds your current vehicle behind the scenes  random spawn points after character switch while sometimes funny can get a tad annoying  bugs in the garage system have you lose your vehicle stolen or purchased alike on occasion  it doesnt matter which clothes you put on because on character switch the game might decide that you wear something else even if not on a mission these are all tiny details in the big picture though the single player experience is fantastic i wish it was a bit longer as for the online part of the game it feels like an afterthought so im not really going to take that into the rating everybody is going berserk and theres no really goal apart from levelling up by doing the same things over and over my impression is that it mainly serves as a source of extra money for rockstar story mode is a lot more captivating overall verdict without taking gta online into account 9910

23 hours in and already my game of the year it has some of everything in it a walking simulator driving simulator jet skiing flying choppers and planes playing tennis doing yoga robbing a jewelry store and that was just the beginning i spent my first few hours just walking around from the ghetto to the industrial area to the city center to the vine hollywood sign just to take pictures while on the way being chased by a coyote and then me trying to get friendly with the one parks officer and accidentally bumping into her and then i found myself on the run again just to trying to dodge her bullets and stay alive then when i eventually got to the vine sign i fell off the top of the sign to my death it was a perfect moment driving is a pleasure even with the keyboard and is actually thrilling and fun this time round even if not as realistic as gtaiv the story is fresh but still reminiscent of classics as die hard the ateam scarface  miami vice goodfellas heat etc get this game and play it the way you want and you will find many things for yourself within it

i played gta v on the xbox 360 and recently transferred my game progress over to the pc the pc version looks way better and the controls are better i thought that using the keyboardmouse to control the vehicles while driving was going to be bad but it is not that bad the shooting using the keyboardmouse makes the game 10x better

vehicles explosions guns online story heists more guns cars and explosions etc what more do you want first person well they have that too now only for pc want awesome gamefootage of yourself making awesome stunts or funniest moments or simply want to make yourself a video star well the rockstar editor is a thing what else do you want this game is already a pretty big map waiting for so much exploration but dont simply take my word for it its alot better in person maybe even firstperson come on money talks and this game is well worth that cash in your pocket

great game to get killed dozens of times by random players passive mode will only work on foot so whats the point of using that other than that story mode is pretty cool and would recommend playing that than gtavonline its like saints row but with drugs

this is another great sandbox story by rockstar games that pushes the envelope on whats possible in the gaming world the terrain may not always be destructible but that works for hilarious moments of false logic because this is a video game where logic sometimes doesnt exist to the point its countless hours of fun with its single and online play and has a lot of replay value with the community you find online the story is also amazing with its constant satire brands such as lifeinvader where you feel like a facebook stalker and no one can judge you for doing it in a video game
recommended
this game is so buggy its not even funny 1 gta online doesnt work at all 2 steam still says im playing it an hour after i quit it and guess what i cant launch it because its already running 3 rockstar offers no support for any of these issues and neither does valve 4 so many other people are experiencing these same issues so dont hate me saying oh your comp must be  im a dumbass edit it now works but this game was not ready for launch rockstar seriously needs to consider doing closed beta testing before releasing another game

gta v has it really been so long since the original gta i still remember running around as a small sprite running over people in my sprite car it was so much fun and now with the fifth iteration of the game graphics are better than we could have ever imagined back then but i digress gta 5 has fortunately retained its dark humour excellent gameplay fun gunplay and fun car chases the pc version has good graphics im not going to gush about them since i was admittedly slightly disappointed in them i was hoping for even more fidelity but make no mistake the game still looks good in its current state whats more and perhaps even more important is that the developers made sure the game is nicely optimized which means buttersmooth framerate of your choosing of course depending on your pcs specs i was somewhat skeptical at first since this is a console port but its a proper port key bindings lots of graphical options mouse options and so on kudos here voice acting is for the most part excellent and a joy to listen to the story is fairly interesting and the various missions varied and a lot of fun to play through i love the banter between the characters aside from those there is a lot to do in your characters freetime such as tennis golf movies tv and so on theyre not just stupid mini games but actual albeit admittedly dumbeddown versions of their reallife counterparts and a lot of fun and lets not forget about online play even if youre not a fan of dropping into public servers you can still enjoy it with friends in private sessions a little warning here  the whole tutorial section and process of playing with friends is unnecessarily convoluted and unclear minus points here but eh once you get through the long tutorial and are allowed to play with friends youre in for a treat buying properties clothes food equipment weapons cars boats airplanes and so on there are also many premade races deathmatch and team deathmatch fights time trials missions defend and assault coop heists etc its all there opening the option of doing whatever you want i would say even at the full price of 60 the game is worth it but if you can get it at a discount even better absolutely awesome

love this game gotta start modding soon

the game is $5999 but it is the best experience on steam before you do buy the amazing open sandbox game youre gonna want to have an amazing computer to run this game such from gta iv troubles i had if you have a high end intel core i7 4790k nvidia 960 gtx 4 gb and other great specs such as me then youll get your $60 you paid for i love the gta series and have spend hundreds of dollars on buying these games for years hopefully i helped you buy gta v or not

pros and cons baby pros  amazing gameplay that ends up making you want to do it again likeable characters all having there own ups and downs easy to follow and good storyline large amounts of vehicles specializing in there own thing large array of weapons and attachments heists in single and multiplayer are enjoyable besides a couple cough cough merryweather heist great amounts of customization for single and multiplayer characters and vehicles hours of content im only halfway through the story and i have 77 hours multiplayer which is pretty much its own game for free cons  shady actions during the steam summer sale p way to many hackers in multiplayer multiplayer lobbies are almost never full and are somewhat empty not very many heists in single or multiplayer runs pretty bad unless you have a decent enough computer a lot of driving speaking of driving it can get quite laggy during it overall grand theft auto v is a great game for people with decent computers it brings enormous amounts of gameplay to the table and in my opinion is worth the 60 dollars for all the time i have and am planning to put into it
recommended
best gta yet all the things you liked from the previous one x10 just wish it had come out sooner
recommended
gta  its just well gta this openworld game is wonderful content from rockstar is nice  player created missions and events at times starts to feel repetative and grind like many exploiters open servers tend to feel more like a death match miss some of the single player activities in the mp world that could just add a few more ways to make a living could uses a petty crimes sorrta updatebearking in to houses moving stolen goods etc like the mission in gts sa but i play it alot i always go back to it and is best with a group of friends
recommended
amazing game  great story line and voice overs
recommended
forget the sale fiasco youre still looking at one of the greatest open world games of all time $60 for an experience that will last for years sounds good to me
recommended
fun with friends or by yourself
recommended
i waited to make any judgements on this game until after i had some time to play with a group of friends i found the story rather dull mostly relying on shock content and morbid humor along with abrasive racial stereotypes as for gameplay though the driving is amazingly enjoyable not to sloppy and not to tight all in all a big win for this player as expected the gunplay is pretty sloppy though many things have been tightened up obviously since release but it is obvious where most of the resources went in this games development its suspiciously easy for a headshot veteran like myself to blow out tires while sitting shotgun in a sports car travelling at top speed so in my opinion i dont recommend this game at 5999usd at 3999 or 2999 this game would be absolutely worth it do i like it not so much do i like playing games with my friends absolutely

rockstar has done it again with another amazing gta game including an open and dynamic world to play in i love that this game offers such a wide variety of activities to do with awesome customization like cars and outfits the heists especially are well constructed and are so much fun mechanics such as driving handling are decent but not perfect nonetheless this is definitely worth the buy

good game but might have some bugs still in it but it is acceptable everything else is really good but the community is horrible which you cant blame the game about totally worth buying

if you can pass the people trying to kll you from time to time or that there are hackers in the gta online multiplayer overall its a fun game but not all the time there are people trying to kill you there are heists jobs and even races or deathmatch if you get bored in just free roaming

completely love this game it has definitely been approved upon since xbox anybody who has played the lastgen version should definitely get this

i dont even have to write much to say how great gta 5 is its simply beautiful at 60 fps

the story mode is enjoyable although the story telling is quite forgettable the ability to alternate between the three characters michael franklin trevor at any time is a nice feature and is especially fun during heist encounters my only wish is that there were more of those encounters los santos is a nice open world ready to be explored there are plenty of things to do and lots of things to spend your illgotten cash on the online sessions offer a bit more except it falls short to two things 1 the rampant cheating by mod users which apparently rockstar has no control over and 2 an autoaim feature that is accessible for game pad users which renders pvp absolutely useless if you use keyboardmouse otherwise gta online has a lot of potential there is a lot of fun to be had with the pve multiplayer aspect eg heists if you can avoid the downfalls mentioned above

jwell jwell jwell gland thefft awwto this game is a prime example of aaa filth it had a massive budget and cool graphics and features but is unpolished as hell with  interfaces and terrible online still they get away with it because of the massive name and its hype the developpers are also notorious for their jewblizz behaviour they release the game 3 different times and know they will get away with it because each time it is released it is lacking in some department the online caters to casuals and is rigged to make them money from ingame purchases they left out alot cool posibilities because it would make the fedora queeers soil themselves the single player is good i cant lie 910 probably i really like the amount of customization that goes into online even though everybody is autistic and looks the same wearing suits and fedoras this game is difficult to review the core of the game is really cool and fun but there is a crust of rockstar  surround it that makes it really unpleasant to deal with it makes me ashamed that i supported rockstar by buying this games twice i think i will go with a 810

loading screen simulator 2015 is the best and most realistic simulator game ever created you really feel like youre truly experiencing loading screens with complete realism jokes aside ive never been a fan of the gta series i hate drugs vulgar language excessive sexualisation and crime and ive never really enjoyed a gta game but gtav is different the world is huge enough multiplayer is customisable enough and content is enjoyable enough to overcome the downsides that create a defined divide between opinions this game is 65gb of space well taken so what makes me overcome my distaste for this game series well the sheer number and variety of cars and weapons the numerous types and examples of minigames and missions the list goes on gta v is a great game deserving of all the praise it gets and for that i cant help but recommend this game to even the most closedminded of people

ive been holding out reviewing gtav for quite some time now not because its bad and that i need to find reasons to criticize it but rather because there is so many great things about the game that its hard to organize them all together into one review pros  the story mode story is great  the online is great  the driving in the game is great  flight controls are very solid  player unique skills that are improved by doing activities  many guns to chose from  many cars to chose from  many clothes to chose from  the heists are fun with 3 other people you know  realism and detail  this game has tide cycles an altimeter and other flight gauges turbulence hydroplaning etc cons  p2p connection for missions and heists  loading screens can take some time  heists are super hard when teammates dont have microphones ill probably edit the review if i find more things to compliment or to complain about but in all honesty gtav is a very solid game the only real issues with online and story mode are simple bugs or technical errors but other than that their cons arent that they arent fun its just that sometimes things break if youre discouraged by the $60 price tag on the game i understand you however i feel that you will be by far getting your money back through the enjoyment of this game

the game is centered around three characters michael trevor and franklin michael is a retired crook in witness protection sitting on his money and raising his family trevor is michaels old friend and accomplice in crime and is a complete psychopath who just wants to kill steal and get drunk all at the same time franklin is the young gangster wanting to do more that sling dope and throw up gang signs he wants to rob banks and then live it up in a mansion the game starts out with franklin and his homie lamar repoing some cars for their boss simian he is a car dealer who scammed people out of money franklin eventually ends up trying to take michaels sons car michael is hiding in the back of the car when franklin takes it from his michaels house michael tells franklin to drive the car in to the front of simian dealership michael tells franklin to quit his job stealing cars and join him and rob a jewelry store trevor sees the jewelry robbery on the news and recognizes that michael did the robbery trevor hasnt seen michael in 19 years he goes and finds michael at his home in los santos a fictional patrol of los angeles and finds him they decide to pull a big heist and then retire gameplay is mostly like all other gtas you walk around and steal cars and get into trouble the cars handling has changed drasikley from gta 4 no more of the heavy realistic driving now its very arcady i didnt really like this change i prefer realism in my games the cars are too floaty and they seem to bounce off everything they touch the shooting is vastly improved from all the other gtas the music selection is bad and i mean bad there are no recognizable songs apart from 1015 songs that are good out of the 240 licensed songs if you think thats no big deal then what are you supposed to listen to in the car while driving the driving and the music are the only two things that frustrated me the most in this installment but i digress i love this game ive put about 500hrs into the game on the xbox 360 and ps4 and i still cant get enough of it if youre a fan of gta its a must buy if you like a good story this games got it if you like open world games buy it

this my friends is the masterpiece of the rockstar studios buy it wait for a week to download the game files create an account and hop directly to online leave the story aside and enjoy the online los santos oh in addition to that you may have to wait like 10 minutes to join a server randomly crash from the server get kicked for being afk from the server because you went to grab a glass of water for 30 seconds wait 5 minutes to join a jobheist and if you are lucky fail the job and lose your whole progress because of some imbecile left the mission these will happen most likely because welcome to grand theft auto v where everyone is dumb as a bag of hammers no offense everyone story is spectacular online is quite annoying if you dont have friends still 1010

best gta game since san andreas and now the ultimate version is here one of the best pc ports ever even a decent computer will be able to run this game with midhigh settings with 60fps 2gb vram is definitely recommended though this was my second time buying this game first was on ps3 worth the buy again even better if youre buying for the first time you wont be disappointed a week after the game came out i have already beaten the game 3 times have fun 1010

gta v has it really been so long since the original gta i still remember running around as a small sprite running over people in my sprite car it was so much fun and now with the fifth iteration of the game graphics are better than we could have ever imagined back then but i digress gta 5 has fortunately retained its dark humour excellent gameplay fun gunplay and fun car chases the pc version has good graphics im not going to gush about them since i was admittedly slightly disappointed in them i was hoping for even more fidelity but make no mistake the game still looks good in its current state whats more and perhaps even more important is that the developers made sure the game is nicely optimized which means buttersmooth framerate of your choosing of course depending on your pcs specs i was somewhat skeptical at first since this is a console port but its a proper port key bindings lots of graphical options mouse options and so on kudos here voice acting is for the most part excellent and a joy to listen to the story is fairly interesting and the various missions varied and a lot of fun to play through i love the banter between the characters aside from those there is a lot to do in your characters freetime such as tennis golf movies tv and so on theyre not just stupid mini games but actual albeit admittedly dumbeddown versions of their reallife counterparts and a lot of fun and lets not forget about online play even if youre not a fan of dropping into public servers you can still enjoy it with friends in private sessions a little warning here  the whole tutorial section and process of playing with friends is unnecessarily convoluted and unclear minus points here but eh once you get through the long tutorial and are allowed to play with friends youre in for a treat buying properties clothes food equipment weapons cars boats airplanes and so on there are also many premade races deathmatch and team deathmatch fights time trials missions defend and assault coop heists etc its all there opening the option of doing whatever you want i would say even at the full price of 60 the game is worth it but if you can get it at a discount even better absolutely awesome

love this game gotta start modding soon

this game is so buggy its not even funny 1 gta online doesnt work at all 2 steam still says im playing it an hour after i quit it and guess what i cant launch it because its already running 3 rockstar offers no support for any of these issues and neither does valve 4 so many other people are experiencing these same issues so dont hate me saying oh your comp must be  im a dumbass edit it now works but this game was not ready for launch rockstar seriously needs to consider doing closed beta testing before releasing another game

godly graphics even with my not so top notch pc really rate this game 2110 xd

ignore the trolls and haters with weak pcs the game runs fine on my i74770k and gtx 780 mostly maximum settings and pulling an minimum of 80 fps with averages of 130 fps the world is amazingly detailed and immersive the characters put a smile on my face especially that crazy mary ann exercise freak and frankins nutty feminist aunt great game great port 1010 edit online is very awkward and clunky with lots of loading screens horrible interfaces and random server connection losses and gamebreaking glitches i only rated the single player in this review

its a cool game but delete some cheats for online i shoted a guy who had a car i shoted him with the rocket launcher like three times and he didnt die please fix it
recommended
it is not even a question about whether you should buy this game after owning the xbox one version of this game the pc edition improves upon it in every way the graphics are immense and even if your pc cannot run the game on high or ultra settings even normal is better or equal to the next generation consoles a 25  40 hour campaign dependent on how you play it with hundreds of side missions hobbies cars and other extras your 40 could not be spent better this does not even include gta online which has even more missions heists races etc which will only add hours to the enjoyment without friends it can be quieter and less crazy despite this with or without friends this game keeps you occupied for many many hours i can happily say that this is one of the best games ever made in every way

rockstar can suck my  absolutely no support for those who cannot play the game because of their  perma link to steam accounts so if you bought the game on a different account not activated to steam rockstar will take outs its big willy and shuv it down your throat and make you wait 1 month to answer a ticket that will probably not help because giving the power of unlinking your steam account to the customer is too much to handle and would give them a god complex  you ruined my dayweek

this is truly the definitive version of gtav it works so much better than when i tried it about a year and a half ago looks like they included lots of fashion updates in this release but expect it to take a while to unlock all the looks i must say i hate the story the characters and the liberal use of the nep word but i play online and dont have to deal with the losers on the cover or their script nep that

ive been meaning to write a review for gta for a while but i was unable to decide if my review was going to be for the sp or the online or a mix of both i mean i could talk about how the story was super fun the split between the different characters offered varied and interesting views on different issues or how modifying cars online and racing around pulling drivebys on unsuspecting people only to rage later when someone does the exact same thing to you is massively hilarious tonight i decided on a different path with a little help from a friend yo essy shout out dawg what gta is really about when you get right down to it and where youll find the most fun possible is if you go onliine find a server with a modder it isnt hard pretty much every server is infested with them like your average nightclub is infested with testosteronefuelled mindless sleaze machines if youre lucky and if the modder doesnt spend 30 minutes blowing you and everyone else up instantly over and over for some kind of perverse fun you might chance upon a modder who decides to do what one did for me tonight i paint you a scene of a lush forest a beautiful countryside slope filled with all that nature has to offer suddenly the redleather booted stripper army descends  everywhere guns in hands they are ruthless killing machines rockets fly and stripper bodies are flung through the air all is blood and pain you get into your insurgent unsure of what sick twist your life has taken your only goal survival but no your companion says he wishes to talk to a lone stripper to pursue peace so you pull up and watch as that brave brave man exits the vehicle and walks up to her suddenly theres a fist fight that redleather donned temptress is smashing your buddy all over the front of your insurgent whilst you grip your steering wheel and cry tears of pure blood why is the world so cruel what manner of evil had you discovered all you can think of in this moment is saving your sweet dear friend you slam your foot down on the gas and run that sleazy ho over bam she scoots a mile backwards into a tree her body surely broken high fiving your buddy you watch as he gets into the car your eyes widen in horror as you watch the broken stripper body stir back to life that demented hellspawn begins twisting herself back to her feet the redleather hiding her spilled blood as she gets up and starts running towards your car shoot her terminator you think as your buddy gets into the heavy mounted machine gun and opens fire its useless she runs away taking bullets into her back and leatherclad  as if theyre mere raindrops so full of horror are you that you cant even bring yourself to make a joke about the stripper taking loads instead you slam on the gas once more and chase her through the forest not satisfied until you run her over three more times stopping on the last to spin your wheels ontop of her back the only sure way to kill the termistripper menace great game 1010 would witness a stripper armageddon again screenshots available in my library

250 hours in and i cant get enough mods definitely help the offline part i refuse to take gta online seriously until rockstar gets its act together and allows me to use mods in a private session with friends if i wanted to i have used scripthook v in the storymode only and the enhanced native trainer which has better options than the vanilla native trainer i dont want to forget cheathappens trainer its a solid trainer but lacks the car spawning and accurate teleporting that the enhanced trainer has another benefit of the enhanced trainer is it never forgets the settings and i dont even have to activate it the following playthrough i have played the ps3 ps4 and pc versions of this game so without question this was a masterfully ported console game it doesnt have very many bugs at all unlike a certain batman game gta5mods is the best place to get any mod you want most of it is simple to install but always make backups of important gta files specifically ones you modify like the weapons meta and weapons animation meta files you can have insanely powerful weapons with a certain mod but the only downfall is that the pedestrians in the ammunation shooting range have molotov cocktail shooting guns but just dont use the overpowered weapons mod until you get all the challenges bronzed there isnt really a need to gold medal them this game is running on my pc which is an amd 6350 39 ghz 6 cores 8 gb 1866 mhz gskill ram and a standard hdd on windows 81 at the moment soon to be windows 10 my gpu is an amd r9 270x i have this pc hooked up to a sony bravia 40 hdtv and the audio is pipelined to my 51 surround sound system as for frames per second i dont have a digital reference but i dont think it drops below 50 fps at anytime

very nice cops totally not sarcasm  willing to take bribes if you call up lester  willing to shoot or beat people for the pettiest of crimes even if in no danger  sometimes shoots civilians in crossfire during firefights  threatens and yells inane insults at players and npcs that they are engaged with  runs people over and arrests them for staining their car with blood  bumps into you and beats you for assaulting an officer of the law  somehow deemed to be more important than civilians murders 40 civilians receives 2 stars punches a cop square in the face receives 3 stars  willing to attack you without actual probable cause if you stand in their vicinity for too long  totally not a gang with a gang mentality  tip always escape them on a train if you can recommended @ 45 stars aside from the cowardice doughnut patrol in this amazing game the depiction of the american dream turning out to be nothing but a hustle and a struggle for real people in this kind of poverty living in the state of california with the corrupted government that runs it working with the shadiest figures in the fib in all heists including members of anonymous or the mafia better check out mount chilliads pyramid art to put two and two together totally nothing inconspicuously ed up about this game and the comparrison it has to reality with our current state of political affairs and the militarization of our police force everybody on the streets know this when the police come shoot it out or book your  outta there cuz they wont have no mercy and nor should you censored the police 1110  the game does have its flaws but its very enjoyable especially if in a comedic sense and  or for someone who lives the street life

this is a fun game for sure lots of people give negative reviews for the banning of mods and such but seriously this game is perfectly fine without mods and if you decide to use them and get banned congratulations on making  decisions the only thing i dislike about this game is the open multiplayer games its not fun at all to be in one of those everyone is constantly killing eachother and you thats boring as hell if i wanted to fight everyone all the time i would play the deathmatch mode sadly the people that do this arnt going to change because they are all inconsiderate  anyways onto the positive stuff i love how its open world and there isnt any limit to what you can do get a good frind with you and go to a private game and you can have so many amazing adventures along with the hundreds of missions and new hiests this game is easily one of my favorites the story in singleplayer is also something to try out i thinkits a compelling story and every one should at least give it a go my official review 910 great game

very nice port 100x better than gta ivs port runs very well on my 780 classy fully maxed but i bet it could handle lower end to midrange graphics cards just as well settings turned down of course i dont recommend turning grass too high it kills frames when you get out into the sandy shores area also for people confused modding is allowed you will not be banned for modding  however do not expect you can go online with your modified scripts and cheat menus designed for singleplayer some of these still work in gta online so the anticheat system will ban you if you are buying this game for the online aspects i recommend you do not mod your game at all people have gotten banned for even using a fov mod in gta online so try to avoid modding your game too far

gta 5 what is there too say more then a year we have waited for it and at last it has arrived when they promised pc too be the deffinitive edition they werent lying though i have run in some isseus the game is a perfect example of what ports should look like these days too give players a little boost this is the 1st thing you should look at httpimgurcomhrqgxpi and make sure you turn down advanced settings if any isseus appear now the game itself is were it really shines the gameplay both 1st and 3rd person play amazing and have been worked out very well indeed in my honest opinion gtas 1st person is better then that of some games too this date as for the single and multiplayer story is so far so good just the switching between characters makes the game feel more natural it feels like you are actually watching a movie or tv show but you are controling the actors yourself a great addition too my library i would give this game an 85 out of 10 for all that it is worth enjoy your stay in los santos
recommended
single player is awesome a lot of fun the multiplayer though i dont know if there was a multiplayer i think it was just a collection of loading screens and waiting at lobbies for people to join exaggeration then youd get matched up with people from like china and have to deal them lagging and not speaking english when you really need to actually discuss your plan on heists then if someone quits your heist you just cant work on without them you just get booted too much driving to objectives in the heists too spend so long driving places for realism the multiplayer has some real potential but it has some huge flaws it was fun though i played 100 hours of it it just has some issues that i wish werent there

c no it can not be played offline i have called rockstar cs support its called entitlement verification system essentially you have to have internet constantly connected so rockstar can communicate with your pc to make sure the game isnt pirated even if you bought thru steam look at it like what x box 1 was going to do when they launched the console the required internet connection there are no plans on fixing it because this is how rockstar made the game they said if they got enough complaints then they would look in to doing something about best thing to do is call rockstar and complain  navy198523 [supportrockstargamescom]

excellent single player with a fun story line that never left me saying not another fetchathon online has really pulled my score down unfortunately there are no opportunities to have pvt rooms instead you spend time trying to run away from players that only want to sit around and kill you instead of enjoy the games features this would be okay if rstar would simply add code to allow no pvp for those that dislike this aspect further like you all have heard you spend a large amount of time in load screens that dull the experience rstar you really made an error by disallowing pvt free play rooms and for that i give you and 10 on 10 for single player and a 3 for online play

i have played over 500 hours on this game on ps3 and ps4 i have to say this game is even better that anyting the consoles can offer this game is more fun with friends and that is not going to change when you try and play with strangers you will not get anywhere so make friends trololol p  when you are new to playing gta  online you are best joining a crew or a clan that has a team speak server as this way you might find sone people who are will help you get better at the game and also some money d when you are looking for people to play with just google gta  online team speak servers you will be sure to find something some other pros to this game are the cars which are ace when you have more than enought to choose from as you can never decide which one to use glad they have added a new top dog car now too this is something you are going to have to work up too as it is 2 million p which is no easy to get  i have to say one of the worst things in this game is the fact that you cannot seem to get rid of youre guns which is bad as when you have all the guns in the game you get favouties which are even harder to find in the mess which is the menu system for the guns  this needs to be improved as its terriable which os so annoying just arugg btw armored cars ftw op but still fun to kill people in

sold my steam inventory for pc components totally worth it sillyness out the way onto the review as demanding as the graphics are in terms of performance it can still hold well on most budget builds around the 180 or so would seriously recommend anyone to play this incredible game that has a decent build cons not really a whole lot its a really solid port rockstar have put a lot of time into releasing it on pc and id say it was well worth the wait just the whole needing to be logged into rockstar social club just to be able to play the single player can be a bit of a pain for the casual player the minimun requirements are a complete lie chances are you will not be able to launch the menu screen without it crashing as well as the ingame video memory calculator if you have sli graphics cards at both 2gb it will tell you that you have about 4gb of video memory do not trust this and start turning everything to ultra graphics expecting it to run at above 60 fps that is not how sli works rockstar but so far ive not experienced any crashes relating to gameplay just be wary that 4gb of ram should not be used if you want to have a good experience playing as it tends to stutter in open areas with lots of traffic 1010 ign

some pros insanely fun single player with very engaging and interesting if mostly scripted story missions side activities are a cool time killing thing with stuff to do that doesnt feel like youre grinding just to get the icons off the map each character has their own personality with some back story you can switch between all 3 characters mostly whenever you want besides a few times where it wouldnt make sense in the story gta style mayhem and humor that this franchise is known for decent character customization in single player mode for each character great car customization first person view is awesome and you can tell they basically remade a lot of the game to include it its not just a camera glued to the characters head graphics are awesome on ultra gtx 980 gta online is a friggin blast to play with a group of friends in a private crew session and when it works well with no bugscrashes heists are great hilarious and unscripted situations you can get yourself into both in single player and online that only the gta sandbox could provide a plethora of new tools given to pc players for recording and editing clipsmovies of your shenanigans within ls very good clothingcharacter customization in online mode the great feeling of cruising down the country highway with your fully customized online character in your awesome souped up and loud custom muscle car with classic rock blasting on the radio the tiniest of details are included in this game car cooling down noises when you get out first person mode tinting different colors depending on the color of sunglasses you are wearing the dashboard radio visually changing as you change radio stations there is so much more the detail in this game is just amazing down to the smallest thing this really makes the world feel alive and not dead or static like a lot of other open world games cool little color coded vram notification bar letting you know how much of your gpus memory you are using and how hard you are pushing your card with the settings that you choose in the graphics options this bar updates in real time when changing settings some cons having 3 characters can sometimes make collecting things like clothescarsguns more of a chore than a joy online is pretty buggy and crashes frequently it is very obvious that gtas online mode end game is to make you either grind for money andor buy shark cards with rl $ for gta cash for some reasons below if you take car parts off it costs the same amount to put them back on you have to rebuy them there is no car part inventory like there is with clothes and car parts can get very expensive you get penalized for defending yourself against aggressive players if someone is chasing you in an armored car and trying to kill you you have to pay their insurance if you blow them up which can get expensive if they are driving something expensive small inconveniences make online mode a pain sometimes these include being split up from your group after every heist setup mission game crashing right after or during a heist mission random game crashessession time outs with generic or no error messages rubberbandinglaggy carspeople in online that make pvp difficult and defending yourself difficult in open public sessions difficult as well hackerscheaters in online there are a lot that use tools for god mode or to shoot money bags at people as well as spawning random things in the game world that make it unfun and annoying to play in public sessions load times are painfully long even on an ssd this can sort of sap the fun out of chaining missions with a group or just bouncing between sessions if your game crashes or lags out during a mission it counts as you quitting the mission and will mark against you as a bad sport which will put you in lobbies with actual griefersquitters if your game crashes or lags out during a mission you lose all ammo you used on that mission which can be very expensive depending on what you used this is unlike when you legit fail a mission and have to restart where the game will give you money to compensate for ammo spent if you lag outcrash its lost some things to note that are neither proscons game is decently optimized but takes some beefy hardware to completely max it out and keep 60fps1080p playing in online mode with random people or pugs can be frustrating a lot of people quit mid mission or just generally dont know how to communicate well in my opinion the best way to play online mode is with a group of friends in a crew within private crew sessions it took me about 50 hours to complete the main campaign and that was with a handful of things left around the map i am currently sitting around 75% on the 100% checklist in game things to think about imo this game is very much about the journey and not the destination have fun while you are playing and enjoy all the gameplay for what its worth dont grind in online mode to get that next car part or that next weapon unlock or you will get it and think so what now just have fun and enjoy the game as it comes its a great game and i recommend it

look i love grand theft auto 5 had it since the ps3 days and ps4 days and now pc days but i do not like how much people are getting banned even when they use mods and or hacks in single player not just that when people mod and or hack online and they give everyone money they get all banned most times but dont worry though rockstar says they fixed it idk make your choice its your money but i still love the hd 60fps

amazing improvement to the already great gta 5 for consoles definitely worth picking up although i am currently having some stuttering issues which i hope are fixed in a patch other than that bug and a few other performance issues i recommend everyone reading this to buy the game
recommended
grand theft auto v for the nextgen consoles was already a warm welcome but the pcversion is most definitely the best version once again the series brings us back to los santos where we can play as michael trevor and franklin the game is visually impressive and there is a ton of things to do in this openworld exploring the region is treat in its own rights gameplaywise the game is classic gunfights driving etc no big surprise here but hey why would you fix something that isnt broken right however the game linearity is a bit of a letdown here you dont have much to say about how you will complete your mission thats unfortunate but the game remains fun and if the story is not enough for you there is still the online multiplayer

gta 5 is a pretty good game solid gameplay and the online alone is almost worth the money if you have friends to play it with i havent even so much as dabbled in the singleplayer because the online gameplay has been enough to keep me plenty busy that being said gta 5 has a very serious problem with the nvidia geforce gtx 660 graphics card and this is the basis for my negative review anyone with this graphics card  beware from the moment i started the game it would crash at least every 30 minutes sometimes less sometimes more this often happened during heists jobs or other very important sequences in the game making it damnnear unplayable im posting this after already trying literally every fix i could find online changing the graphics settings extensively and contacting rockstar support multiple times i would highly advise anyone with a nvidia geforce gtx 660 graphics card to not buy the game until this issue is fixed that isnt the only reason for my negative rating however rockstars recent shady business practices see the steam summer sale and their incompetence with my issue have really changed my view on the company all for the worse i contacted their customer support and to my surprise they were extremely unhelpful almost to the point that they seemed to be trying they refused to do anything other than repeatedly send me copy and pasted emails with quick fixes id tried before and they would not deal with my actual issue even when i attempted to bring up what i had tried and what i had not what i was dealing with and what my computer specs were on that basis alone i would not recommend the game simply because the company behind it has proven itself not to be a good one also in the past  see their other pc ports on top of that the game isnt a great port a few of the drm practices are really bugged causing my game to take twice as long to enter online mode as normal because i have to enter online twice and shouldnt be there in the first place and some features that should obviously be integrated into the game simply arent hackers and connectivity hiccups are rampant online the loading times alone are enough to kill the game and overall the game feels somewhat unfinished at this point i dont consider the game to be worth the money after all the hype gta 5 was really a disappointment and ive since uninstalled it because its not even worth my time id ask for my money back but we all know how steam is about that

not really gonna spend time writing a proper review for this game so im just gonna list the pros and cons pro  gta online  car handling is smooth  good jet handling  jets and military bases  heists  good story  good gunplay  good characters however maybe slightly forgettable  nice and large map  great side missions con  rockstar first price drop in 2025 customer support behaviour  player base not amazing

the long wait has been worth it if youre a pc gamer whos spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest greatest gta then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version sure the xbox one and ps4 versions were amazing delivering gta 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures smoother surfaces better lighting and cool depth of field effects see our full review below but the pc version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the pcs strengths in doing so it adds a few more metres to one of gamings towering achievements

after long hours of playing  the game is boring a lot and you may find in every server 1 or 2 hackers at least  if you were lucky and joined a server without hackers  there is nothing to do after finishing the hiest and the missions over and over and over

some pros insanely fun single player with very engaging and interesting if mostly scripted story missions side activities are a cool time killing thing with stuff to do that doesnt feel like youre grinding just to get the icons off the map each character has their own personality with some back story you can switch between all 3 characters mostly whenever you want besides a few times where it wouldnt make sense in the story gta style mayhem and humor that this franchise is known for decent character customization in single player mode for each character great car customization first person view is awesome and you can tell they basically remade a lot of the game to include it its not just a camera glued to the characters head graphics are awesome on ultra gtx 980 gta online is a friggin blast to play with a group of friends in a private crew session and when it works well with no bugscrashes heists are great hilarious and unscripted situations you can get yourself into both in single player and online that only the gta sandbox could provide a plethora of new tools given to pc players for recording and editing clipsmovies of your shenanigans within ls very good clothingcharacter customization in online mode the great feeling of cruising down the country highway with your fully customized online character in your awesome souped up and loud custom muscle car with classic rock blasting on the radio the tiniest of details are included in this game car cooling down noises when you get out first person mode tinting different colors depending on the color of sunglasses you are wearing the dashboard radio visually changing as you change radio stations there is so much more the detail in this game is just amazing down to the smallest thing this really makes the world feel alive and not dead or static like a lot of other open world games cool little color coded vram notification bar letting you know how much of your gpus memory you are using and how hard you are pushing your card with the settings that you choose in the graphics options this bar updates in real time when changing settings some cons having 3 characters can sometimes make collecting things like clothescarsguns more of a chore than a joy online is pretty buggy and crashes frequently it is very obvious that gtas online mode end game is to make you either grind for money andor buy shark cards with rl $ for gta cash for some reasons below if you take car parts off it costs the same amount to put them back on you have to rebuy them there is no car part inventory like there is with clothes and car parts can get very expensive you get penalized for defending yourself against aggressive players if someone is chasing you in an armored car and trying to kill you you have to pay their insurance if you blow them up which can get expensive if they are driving something expensive small inconveniences make online mode a pain sometimes these include being split up from your group after every heist setup mission game crashing right after or during a heist mission random game crashessession time outs with generic or no error messages rubberbandinglaggy carspeople in online that make pvp difficult and defending yourself difficult in open public sessions difficult as well hackerscheaters in online there are a lot that use tools for god mode or to shoot money bags at people as well as spawning random things in the game world that make it unfun and annoying to play in public sessions load times are painfully long even on an ssd this can sort of sap the fun out of chaining missions with a group or just bouncing between sessions if your game crashes or lags out during a mission it counts as you quitting the mission and will mark against you as a bad sport which will put you in lobbies with actual griefersquitters if your game crashes or lags out during a mission you lose all ammo you used on that mission which can be very expensive depending on what you used this is unlike when you legit fail a mission and have to restart where the game will give you money to compensate for ammo spent if you lag outcrash its lost some things to note that are neither proscons game is decently optimized but takes some beefy hardware to completely max it out and keep 60fps1080p playing in online mode with random people or pugs can be frustrating a lot of people quit mid mission or just generally dont know how to communicate well in my opinion the best way to play online mode is with a group of friends in a crew within private crew sessions it took me about 50 hours to complete the main campaign and that was with a handful of things left around the map i am currently sitting around 75% on the 100% checklist in game things to think about imo this game is very much about the journey and not the destination have fun while you are playing and enjoy all the gameplay for what its worth dont grind in online mode to get that next car part or that next weapon unlock or you will get it and think so what now just have fun and enjoy the game as it comes its a great game and i recommend it
recommended
if you plan to get this for online then you might want to reconsider getting it after you read this pretty much everytime i join an online session there is always someone cheating especially 30 person servers i would wait until rockstar makes it more difficult for cheaters to get into online as of now there was a massive ban wave which helped a bit but not enough to make gta online fun again i recommend making a private session to play by yourself or with your friends its just as fun that way

this game is a horrible buggy mess at best i have a problem that many people are having in which the game decides to stutter and freeze to the point of the game being unplayable ive tried everything to remedy this situation going in the games files defragging my harddrive putting the settings to low updating my display and gpu drivers getting an fps booster switching my pc to downgrade the ui for preformance and setting the processing priority to high as time went on my problem got worse because now as soon as i start the game i have nothing but lag i have a gtx 860m and an i7 that played this game at a smooth 5060 fps but thanks to the cancer that is lagging my game to hell i cant play this anymore and when the game is on its best behavior its still a buggy mess sometimes ive had a mission be incompletable because the game wouldnt load in a building i had to go to sometimes half of a mountain would be missing and the massive pop in destroys any sense of professionalism this game originally had on the consoles i would expect this kind of unprofessional garbage from an indie game made by two developers i waited at longest 30 whole seconds before the world loaded in thats 30 seconds of standing around doing nothing hoping i dont fall through the world oh yeah and when i was supposed to start a mission the building wouldnt load so as soon as i started the mission everyone fell through to the bottom of the world and died and i was stuck on the loading screen for 10 minutes ive had to restart my computer thanks to the bugs just so i could come back and witness more bugs this has to be the biggest waste of my time and money since amiibo protip from someone who has played every version of gta v to date dont waste your money on this it would be less taxing onto you to buy a ps4 hell even stealing one would be less taxing to you oh and thanks to the scumbag tactics of r raising the prices just to say that they took 25% off during the summer sale lets me know that theyll never fix this but hopefully they do so i dont have 65 gigabytes of dead data

story and single player freeroam story is mature and quite long2025 hours  you are put in the middle of heist to learn the basics of the gamewalking running  shooting this mission is both tutorial and backstory of 2 of the protagoniststrevor and michael  once you finish it you are put in control of franklin and from there you will unlock first michael and then trevor once you unlock a new character you can switch to him at any given time to do his missions during the story you will face a lot of modern problems told in what if they were honeststyle  on top of that there is a lot of swearing  blood and even a torture scene sometime you need to switch to specific character to continue to story or just need to kill sometime while waiting for next story mission  waiting to be called while you wait you can do some of the side missions of each character which could use some worka lot of side characters to meet but each one of them got the same missions when you want to take a break from the missions you can drive around and join side activities like race  golf  yoga  tennis and more overall single player can keep you occupied for quite sometime  gameplay and rpg elements its the standard gta gameplay coverbased shooting driving cars like mad and clunky flying controls cover is sticky and can be weird at timesif you are near 23 walls you may not always cover behind the one you want  also you may not always be covered  your head might be in the open or the wall you are behind it might be just some cardboard or something and you have to be careful because you can die pretty fast14 hits with no armor16 hits with armor is my experience driving feels more arcadish than realistici never drove with more than 90kmh irl still physics when crashing can feel weirdsometimes you will fly through the windshield for no reason while with higher speed nothing happens  but flying is still crap and one missclick can turn you into a meteorite  in gta v you can improve 7 stats8 in single player  staminamost importantshootingdoesnt make a difference strengthwho goes to gunfight with fists  stealth rarely used  flyingyet to try it drivingdoesnt make difference lung capacity important only if you gonna sleep with the fishes and specialsingle player only furthermore you can modify your weapons but its quite limited  you can add extended clip scope suppressor flashlight  grip and apply different skin its something but i was hoping for something more spoiled by alpha protocol  online microtransactions if you think they make gta online p2w okay but consider this thanks to people who buy shark cards everybody in gtao is able to enjoy free patches also imo the microtransactions dont make the online mode p2w because you still have upgrades and cars locked behind heists rank  so yeah would you like to earn your money fair and squarewith option to get more with real money and get free dlcs or earn your money fair and square and have to buy the dlcs public and invite only sessions for online you have 3 options to join existing public session hostjoin session with your friendscrew or just make a solo sessionbut with limited activities public sessions are mayhem 247 but you can put passive mode on and be save kinda  sessions with friends or crew offer quite a lot of enjoyment for me since you can organize events while playing solo session is the same as single player but with using your character instead of the 3 protagonists competetive gtao offers quite a lot of competitive modes still lag and not so good controls make me want to play other games that offer the same modes you have the racing with different vehicles you have common shooter modes like ctf deathmatch  last man standingincludes and team version too  some other modes which im yet to test the host can decide will you be able to use custom carsweapons or not coop apart from competitive there is big variety and of coop jobs different missions like stealing carstrucksdrugs to assassination of targets  or if you like to look at the big picture you can setup heists jobs can be played from 12 players to up to 6 on some of them with heists requirement of 2players for setup missions and 4 for the heists finale heists got certain payout while jobs payment depends on how much time you spend on the missionthe more time you waste the higher the payout but you often would like to finish the mission asap so you can start another until you start repeating them overall you gonna get your money worth it regardless if you gonna play only sponline or both

rockstar can suck my  absolutely no support for those who cannot play the game because of their  perma link to steam accounts so if you bought the game on a different account not activated to steam rockstar will take outs its big willy and shuv it down your throat and make you wait 1 month to answer a ticket that will probably not help because giving the power of unlinking your steam account to the customer is too much to handle and would give them a god complex  you ruined my dayweek

an old man named r fcked me for over 4 month and the lolipop he gave me has laxative in it its been 2 days and im still shtting blood out off my @ss i think i should appologize to r because i got an amd graphics card on my gaming laptop im so sorry that i used amd card i am the minority lol i heard nvidia user also experience the same problem but luckly they can still play i understand r is just too good to test their game on laptop graphics cards like amd and nvidia even though they asked for another 2 month i counted at least 8 kinds of problem that can happen to you when you simply try to start the game i dont know if its because their genius team never thought about run the game on laptop or they just dont want to fix the problems just what kind of machine do r use to test game before they have the courage to release it now i see why they need to delay the release date i think r still need a few century to release this game on pc its not their fault its just players not patient enough and pushed them too hard d god i wish i can play gat5 when i am still alive

if youre planning to get it for multiplayer you can forget it but if you want it for singleplayer go for it reasons is this 1 modders that use cheats to kill you and take your weapons away and use god mode 2 the multiplayer is alright without them but stupid leveling system is this you need to be a level70 for a tank but a level 100 for rpg 3 some vehicles are so op they take more hits than a tank

one of the most unstable games ive ever played you will be loading into the game for 1015 minutes every time you crash which is relatively often and changing most graphical settings requires the game to completely reboot actual gameplay isnt much different from gta 4 the graphics are much better except therere random frame drops from 15030 for no real reason only other upgrades from gta 4 is that the map is larger but is sadly mostly empty i thought it was just me having these issues but reading forums and asking friends turns out most people have these issues not worth the money not an awful game but not great either if you really still want to play it at least buy it in a sale and try out the story first ive had a lot more fun playing the actual game over the multiplayer which takes ages to load and randomly disconnects you or your friends all the time also hackers are a really big issue i lost my 1 million preorder money to one and also everyone else on the server too was set to $0 i wouldnt mind this too much if the multiplayer had anything additional but it really doesnt sorry but as a fan of gta games i can say this isnt the best one made by far again the singleplayer story is the real selling point here i enjoyed it a lot

i really dont understand how people and magazine reviews say that this game is awesome because in my opinion after playing since its release is really  i know the graphics are awesome and storyline is great up to a certain point 75% complete but then if you want to get a 100% complete it is impossible without any guides or walkthroughs online the map is big the things we have to find are stupid and a waste of time who ever made this game where you have to walk 5 miles in a desert needs to be shot there is not much to do in this game after you complete the story what would of been nice is if we could set up robberies much the same way as in the story mode to be able to pick and chose a place to rob to chose the partners to join and transport then the getaway plan and escape route by setting up checkpoints or markers on the map also we cannot rob a house in any part of the map it would be cool to be able to break in someones house to steal a car or to rob cash or jewellery to sell at a pawn shop the gravity of the game is ridiculous jumps are way over the top and doesnt feel realistic the police in the game are over the top too there doesnt seem to be any law and order they just shoot you for the smallest crime they also dont have any tactics such as boxing you in or even giving you a ticket or fine for speeding sometimes cop cars stop you even if you hit a car gently and ram you this is stupid some of the graphic scenery such as hedges in the city are transparent you can drive right through them but then at the los santos airport with the same type of hedge its as solid as a brick wall pathetic there isnt much you can do with cars either how about stealing cars and doing them up to sell and what is the point of that scrap yard its useless i think this game is over rated under developed with thought it is the worst game i have played yes i did enjoy it up to a point only to realise there could be so much more thought into making this game either rockstar ran out of budget or they just focused on the graphics and not the bits in between i am very disappointed in the development of this game and i recommend to those who wish to purchase this game to wait for a discount on steam it is not worth the money trust me

gta online has terrible consistancy errors and terribly  networking problems that cause both pvp and coop to be extremely unrealible glitchy and downright unfun to play due to the inconsistancy between damage to you damage to enemies vehicles materializing infront of you or taking instantly teleporting 90 degree turns the single player is ok nothing spectacular but the multiplayer the one thing that rockstar should have learned how to do by now considering max payne 3s online was a complete ing joke and gta 4s online was fairly ok and fun

while it is one of the best pc ports out there and sets the standard for pc devs the dispicable marketing and horrendous abuse of the steam sale system is completely uncalled for by a dev of this popularity and magnitude not even to mention the neglect of the game post hackers to solve it has undoubtably birthed my negativity for the game hence my lack of a recommendation and urge for new lookers at the game to try and buy it as cheap as possible leaving little money for rockstar

the game has a load of hackers and the game is easy to mod the map is horrible and there is no way to actualy make good money a jet cost $10000000 and if you want 10mil you have to play for years and there are loads of hackers spawning money on you get you killed when they have unlimeted health blowing you up when you go in passive mode the anticheat on this game is soo bad and the servers arent that good at all my internet is pretty good and still i got ping lagg and im an returned player to nextgen and i didnt receive bonuses for gtav the game cost too much for what its worth

at the moment it simply has to be a negative review  after a 60gb download and several long delays to release i was rather eager to get into gta 5 however the game crashes due to the social club launcher and as such is a 40 piece of unplayability when rockstar finally get off of their collective behinds and fix the nonlaunching issues being reported by many people i am certain gta 5 will be an enjoyable experience until then though it remains a 606gb chunk of my hard drive sitting there doing nothing whilst im 40 out of pocket

i can currently not recommend buying it  there are heaps of problems at the moment gta v seems like a game that has been released way to soon amongst others 1 launcher issue  you will need to create a windows local admin account if you are having a useraccount name with certain characters this is the case for almost everyone who has windows 810 as you usually have the @ due to the microsoft account 2 more launcher issues  beside this there are various problems for people with different avs dual graphic card settings etc 3 performance  it is a hit and miss once you finally can get into itit works next time it is so slow it does crash windows as it has an massive issue with memory spill it is playable yes some people do get lucky and have a machine where it does workand the game itself is as good as you have seen it on the consoles a year ago butsome if not most players experience problems and this is unacceptable update wow it is even getting worse on one of my three machines the game could be loaded although with massive performance problems that occured randomly well the last patch was installed yesterday after that it worked as well now it does not start on either of the three machines congratulations rockstar  after almost 18 years that ive played your games for countless hours it is the first time i am seriously disappointed it seems this is yet another game pushed out early due to pressure from shareholders and marketing i will wait for another 3 days before i will apply for a refund from steam

how did rockstar spend so long on this game and then so long on the pc port for it not to work i load it up start playing and it crashes within minutes i cant even get past the prologue when if they fix these problems this game will be worth every single penny im sure but at the moment stay away wait until all the gamebreaking bugs glitches and crashes are patched at least when that happens im sure ill be ready to recommend this to everyone i know who hasnt been playing the filthy console version for years but at the moment its shocking how awful this release has been especially from a publisher who spent some much time on the pc port delayed it for months and hyped it to high heaven if you are thinking of buying this game then for gods sake wait for it to be fixed at the moment while it does work for many it is not fit for release

id love to describe what i liked about this game but i really cant since its been more than two days and i cant even play the stupid thing past grand theft auto v has exited unexpectedly rockstar has completely ignored my help ticket and hasnt even released a statement acknowledging that they recognize the issue let alone are working to fix it ive tried every reasonable and crackpot fix to be found short of fully reformatting and reinstalling my oswhich im unwilling to do to play a single game worse yet these are all usergenerated fixes because and i can only assume this is true rockstar is too busy pointing at a bunch of suckers ie their customers and dying of laughter read choking on our money to take ten minutes to draft a form post its not as if im the only one with this problem given the number of complaints and help requests ive seen on reddit rockstar support forums and around the various fix websites im reasonably sure a fair number of gamers are experiencing the same exact issue im going to let it reinstall a third time overnight but im leaning heavily towards asking for a refund out of ten friends including me on steam who have this game im the only one with this issue but if you ask me a 1in10 chance of not having your game work is too high

have the game delayed numerous times to straighten out bugs only to not be able to play the game on day one because of numerous bugs this launch was rough on some people gladly not on everybody even now after a handful patches and driverupdates late it can be curiously unstable the worst part about this is that its so much fun that youll likely end up grinning and bearing it it is worth it in the end what a brilliant game

first of all i love the gta series and after seeing people play it looks amazing if i could play it there are so many people unable to open and play the game that you start thinking have rockstar even tested if the game could start my windows user account only have letter az az and 09 so i dont have that problem i click play it loads for a few seconds then stops and nothing else happens bugs like that should be tested for and fixed before release have been wasteing hours trying to fix it nothing works so untill i get to try the game it gets a thumb down from me

had fun with what little i was able to play the online mode not going to recommend this game due to its poor support and time wasted by me troubleshooting unknown errors that did not lead to being able to play this game downloaded the game was fast 59gigs 1 to 112 hrs tops installed and started the game no issues at first through the story requirement portion once i obtained access to online play the entire game has gone belly up upon starting the game 14x its not made it past the loading screens 10x its crashed mid game 18x its crashed randomly ive tried everything from rechecking my drivers are current automatically manage paging file size adjustment dx10dx101 toggling msaa setting all gfx settings to the very lowest r create a second user profile with basic characters restarts and closing the launcher once the game is open i run a i3 4630 36ghz 8gb ram r9 270x which are all above the mark for running this game i suggest steering clear overall due to r poor release of this game

the game itself is fantastic my only issue is the pc port only way this game is playable is to turn down all graphics to 50% and turn off all aa youre probably thinking i have a weak system two sapphire r9290x trioc vaporxs in crossfire on a z97 with a devils canyon crossfire issue then definetly i pulled one card and it became more playable but still not able to put the graphics settings up to decent level without major frame rate issues for as long as it took to get this game ported to pc i have to say im really not impressed

when i launch the game its says im playing then nothing happens and im suddenly not playing no word from rockstar about a patch and none of the community fixes worked for me i wouldnt purchase gta v until rockstar makes an official statement although from what ive seen on streams the game looks and runs great but the launch issues overshadow the good

the worst for trying to log in the game wants a social account log in then it wants the account to be linked to another account windows facebook psn etc then after you get it figured out it tells you that the game cannot be accessed on top of it all you need to do this to play offline no playing any of it if you are not logged in honestly rockstar it shouldnt be this difficult the people that suffer are the ones that pay for your games and the ones that want to pirate it will figure out a work around they just will they are smarter than you because theres more of them please stop penalyzing your paying customers

look the game is great and all but how is it that everyone else has a solution to their problems while im stuck here with a game that doesnt load the launcher for fn sake works well but when it comes to loading the main game it does nothing but sit there no window popping up only my cpu increasing in about 10% and after a minute it tells me the game exited abruptly would you like to safe mode ive tried it all it does not help

where to start i have about 174 hours on record according to this sheet but a good eight hours were from being afk while i tried to google workarounds for the disabled friend joining feature in the online section of gta 5 apparently this is a bug that has been rampantly reported since the console release of gta 5 but no solution or patch has been implemented i find this to be troubling in unison with the reported special character bug that prevents pc players from being able to sign in whats more preloading the game by removing 60 gb of data from my ssd only to find out that i needed to remove another 60 gb of data just to download 358 mb of deencryption why are these bugs even here this should have been fixed months maybe a year ago to me it suggests rock stars qa review over the last few years has failed at conceptualising the fundamental aspect of gaming  consistency and stability you can make a beautiful game but when i cant play with my friends or i cant play at all the aesthetic aspects of gta 5 is no longer a pleasure  it is a detriment rockstar had more than enough time to fix these problems and they never did as far as i am concerned until these bugs are fixed i have no reason to release a positive review

of all the problems to have having the game instantly fail to launch is probably one of the worst ones and i dont know how you couldnt fix it considering  is something thats happened to various other pc titles not even mad just sad at this point

well what can i say i looked forward to this one i really did it wasnt to play the game in 4k and i dont care that much for 60 fps but being a person who does not and refuses to ever own a console i just really felt like playing in a map that isnt liberty city but hey guess around 3 years of waiting just wasnt enough to secure a stable launch for all people who bought the game like myself who preloaded and is now experiencing a crash on the social club launcher great was bad enough that my account got charged twice for this game for no apparent reason but to have the game not even work on launch well i mean id expect that from ea not rockstar even if i could just play offline for the time being thatd be great youd think that logging into a different account service wouldnt be nessecary for an offline mode but hey whatever you gotta do rockstar im going to sleep now and if i wake up and this issue is not fixed itd probably be the last time i buy any game before the reviews are in and if any review that comes out for a game in the future is liek the one im typing now then id suggest you be damn sure not to make that game 0710  too much grand theft auto v launcher has stopped working

this is a dissapointment that the game does not even run im not saying its a bad game i have had a good time with it on other consols but the fact that this games release date was delayed 3 times from january to march to aprill i was expecting to get a perfect flawless game that acually runs whenever i try to run the game i get the error msg  grand theft auto v launcher has stopped working  i expect an update soon just like the rest of us but so far this was a waste of 60 bucks

do not pay $60 for this game as soon as you start it you notice right away this game is a 2 year old game sure the new kids just now old enough to enjoy this series will love it but its the same old gta 23 and 4 feeling it is definitely not a must have my advice is if you want to play it save your $60 wait two weeks and acquire it through other means i felt like i owed it to rockstar to actually purchase this game i feel ripped off like ive been sold expired milk

not recommended
ehh its ok the work theyve done is great and is easily worth the game cost alone however craftsmanship aside this is a bit better than gta4 technically speaking but not better than gta3 san andreas immersionstorywise  its a bit of a cheap gimic for game makers to let users create their own content movie mode that was a novel idea back when minecraft came out now its just lazy  the missions feel cobbled together and the character switching requirementfeature causes immersion loss  main characters are as deep as a kiddy pool and supporting characters are mostly just annoying and not lovable  trevor however was really well done  graphics controls cars city diversity engine optimization are all cinima grade awesome all in all its fun to screw around gta2 style but at $260ish million development budget they could have done considerably better rockstar if youre listening and think i should shut up or put up deal ill help you build gta6

this has got to be one of the biggest shams of all time the online features that gta v have are horrible servers are always empty when you have finally gotten a server with people youve already waited through hours of load screens once you finally get a 4th person for a heist you load the session and one person leaves so you automatically fail this  is just horrible for a game releasing in the year 2015 i mean you cant even always play on the same team as a crew member if im playing team deathmatch i dont want to have to play against my friend

game is just like the consoles version i cannot comment on the graphics since the only way i can get it to launch is by turning off my graphics card the game has numerous issues inside and outside which is to be expected with any new releasewait    didnt this thing come out 2 years ago can i recommend buying it at this time  no not in the slightest i could stomach these issues with a new title and heck i could even handle a bad port but not a aaa game thats had this much time to get its act together you have only a small chance of it even starting or being compatible with your rig but if you do buy the forums offer a hundred different things you can try to work around rockstartsnvidiawindows whoever we are blaming this hour compatability issues heck you cant even use the ifruit app its not coded for the pc version yet but the game reminds you every 5 minutes to download it buying this game now and the only hookers you will be wanting to kill are the people at rockstar that published this fiasco

total disregard with the players spent 24 hours after launch and yet rockstar even made a statement not recommend for you who are reading this analysis can purchase the game and can not play it  and just remember  i bought the pre sale

since i bought this game i have had nothing but bother with it i have 5 hours on record and that 5 hours is literally me faffing on with the graphics settings due to lag i thought maybe i would need to lower them but no i even get lag and stutters on the lowest settings all of my drivers are up to date and even downloaded the driver specifically optimised for gta v still lagging i only seem to lag and stutter online  so far  when i am driving fast but i seem to lag when driving and sometimes even walking in story mode its highly annoying i am running the game on an amd fx9370 440ghz processor and an amd radeon r9 290 4gb graphics card with 8gb ram this is totally unacceptable and a waste of 3999 many people have this stutterlag issue and many others do not i shut off all background processes also when i play the game so its not that either im hoping rockstar come up with a patch sooner than later but until then i wont be wasting any more time on it
not recommended
terrible port terrible vram usage terrible rendering for the engine it has it has a godawful input lag movement is even worse than gears of war combat is trash gun balance is trash no new content at all optimization is garbage several bugs more crashes memory leaks freezes several times eats ram randomly what an awful purchase for a game even worse than apb reloaded that had years to develop a pc version with millions of dollars waste of 60$ and space since this horrible port also has horrible compression for no ing reason really loading screens are still eternal edit it gets even better you get banned for using mods
not recommended
i really wish i could play this game at first when i got it i thought i couldnt play because my gpu wasnt good enough so i got a new gpu with 3gbs of mem and it still crashes the 2 hours i have is from me trying to play it or atleast getting maybe 5 minutes in before it crashes again i know the game is good i just want to be able to play it on my computer
not recommended
right so this wont be a review of the content of the game but whether or not to buy it in its current state since we all know the game  rainbows anyway i am not reccomending this game on the pc for the sole purpose of it having optimization issues i call it the stutter essentially whenever i run the game it could run fine for 30mins or 1 minutes or for an hour its completly random but then the game has these stuttering fits almost like trying to start up a brocken down car and it works for 10 minutes at a time just for anybody who is looking at this and about to type well maybe its your computer specs these are my specs gtx660ti 8gb ram i52310 and 5981mb left for page file use my setup is almost identical to that of the reccomended specs on the front page of the game if that doesnt give you warning whistles you might want to consolt your local cautious pharmasist the stutter problem gets worse the more you play i have also searched it up online and it seems alot of players are having the same issue dont buy this game right now use your head like i didnt and wait until the game is more polished i say 5 or six patches have a good day everyone
not recommended
fyi by stuttering i mean 021 second freezes its a really good game but for me and many others its a bad port i have really inconsistent stuttering i can be playing on a maxed out server smashing the pedal down the street flying by tons of cars with 5060 fps the next day i can boot up the game and as soon as i get in the game and start playing its stuttering i can be playing fine and 30 minutes later it can start stuttering its inconsistent and i hate it many others are having this issue ive tried turning vsync off in game and enabling it for gta 5 through the nvidia control panel lowering my settings raising them averaging them doesnt help turning off vsync enabling high priority for the game and low priority for the launcher complete reinstall of my drivers with geforce disabling shadowplay turning autoscan radio station off oh yeah that reminds me using the self radio will for some reason drop your fps by 1015 it did for me anyway the issue is inconsistent for many who experience it youll find many i fixed it posts that are only there because the game decided it wasnt gonna stutter at that moment they often edit their posts saying how their stuttering has returned this issue also happens to people with really good rigs including people that have installed their game on an ssd im waiting for a patch so that i can replace my review with a positive one my specs 8 gb ram gtx 770 2gb intel i5 2500k 330ghz windows 7 my hdd has 444931 gb of space taken up

the game is great lots of fun and so much to do but who ever made controls for pc i hope to god they are found dead in a ditch covered in cigarette burns next to who ever made the pc ui this game could have been much better if you gave away free controller with evey pc copy well lets face it the game is very good but massively over priced

really bad to publish the game with this settings had a trouble of launching had a trouble with graphic card turned off started game and turned on my card only at this time it has started couldnt run the game in full screen mode tried every resolution i could make at the end just gave up and playing with borders on full screen 800x600 auto 144hz damn not recommended to buy it now just need to wait fixing this troubles

online mode is nothing but getting killed repeatedly by people who arent comfortable socializing with others or wading through countless load screens and a clunky interface for instanced missionsheists content is restricted until you level up including some of what would be more enjoyable game modes if it wasnt for unresponsive controls and vehicularweapon functionality the story mode can be repetitive but it is good for a single playthrough characters lack depth in spite of several plot twists and one character in particular is simply offensive overall it is a poor experience for seasoned pc gamers and one can tell it is ported over from consoles the game looks fine but runs poorly on a midrange system suffers from hitching memory leaks and a host of bugs both online and off if youre thinking about purchasing wait until it is on sale as the online mode the biggest selling point towards longevity is worthless without a group of friends to play with on an empty server
not recommended
in general its a good game but if you are playing online there are small bugs which are annoying and enough to warrant not purchasing this until it ends up on steam summer sale by this time the tutorial bug and other issues should be fixed sp is great

for the most part this game is great its everything a pc gamer wants from a game great storyline fantastic graphics 60 fps you name it but there is one thing that is so serverly aggravating that it is preventing me from giving this a good review its the fact that every single time i try to join gta online it forces me to sign into to social club dosent sound bad right well the issue is every single time i try to log in nothing happens absolutly nothing in fact when i sign in it actually logs me out of the game forcing me to restart my game i cannot join online because when i sign in it sits on the sign in screen and does as i mentioned before absolutly nothing it dosent look like its trying to sign in it dosent look like its trying to do anything at all so now my friend and i cannot play online together which is a huge shame considering how everything else about this port is amazing its almost as if i can only play 50% of the game because gta online is such a huge part of the game hopefully rockstar games will fix this issue if that is to happen i will change my review for sure

awesome and good game but cant recommend due to mods not being allowed by the eula not even in singleplayer mods was what i bought gta v for and a lot of many other people rockstar has made a very stupid decision
not recommended
what could have been but isnt people waited a couple of years for the pc release of gta v anticipating and discussing the endless possibilities with the pc version all of that is gone now thanks to rockstars recent decision of banning anyone outright who uses mods this includes single player mode changes in their eula state that you agree to not modify the game in anyway whatsoever by doing so you risk being banned from playing online the choices made by rockstar are a major concern and should be addressed immediately gta iv is a game where you can run mods on both single player and multiplayer and there was no issues then if this was rockstars choice of getting rid of cheaters this is a very poor attempt because people can still inject scripts into the game undetected and get away with everything even risking other players by forcing money onto their characters and getting them banned is it rockstars fault entirely to an extent it is but its also the fault of many players a good portion of you who are claiming to be banned for no reason yeah nobody will fall for that more than likely you thought it was a good idea to use ce  or use a trainer  to exploit selling vehicles and more you got what was coming and you contributed to this poorly made decision by rockstar gg grand theft auto is still an okay game but the potential of being a greater game is gone thanks to poor choices of the community and rockstar team

i do believe this pc version of gta v can be great there is an issue where my computer or the game crashes at random points in the game or it crashes when i start the game until this problem is fixed i am unable to play this game without having constant issues with computer crashes and game crashes im going to give this game a chance because it was just released on pc last week im sure there will be a fix i hope at least and i reccomend this game but at the same time i do not because of the crashing issues my advice is to wait for a fix for this game and then buy it

the game worked for 2 days a now it is stuck in load story mode it appears to be a fairly common problem and rockstar and steam are failing to address it or even communicate on the issue stay awat until issue is resolved

edit stutter lag returns when loading largenew areas or opening doors to stores altering any modelenvironment causes huge freeze lag for example i run at perfect fps punch someone with a hat and then freeze for 3 seconds while the game calculates how to handle separating the hat from the avatar gg opening doors in stores i see black voids where the environment has not loaded in yet and then the game freezes i swerve into a gas station to dodge someone trying to run into me into a gas station game freezes for 3 seconds to calculate making the gas station explode to kill me gg games still as boring as ever as free roam player vs player kill on sight and mini games  opinion heavily influenced by poor optimization issues causing clunky input delay and fps lag after several minutes of gameplay fps is perfect when game is first started this machine is just above recommended specs based on can you run it people with only minimum requirements met should not consider this game stutter lag problems lots of people have them you can google it or youtube it and see how much of a headache youll have have to jump through hoops to maybe work for you not actually much to do online unless youre messing with your friends or other people but then again ive been spending most of my time trying to fix the fps stuttering working to try to fix it for myself but recommended specs according to can you run it resulted in crappy performanceso be wary at this point cannot recommend might change the review if any fix actually works edit stutter lag problems fixed by adding gta launcher gta executable to nvidia control panel and following some guide online to reduce usage of the launcher and maximizing usage for gta executable through that control panel also deleted process wmpnetworksvc since gta 5 supports custom music wmp might be expanded out as windows media player may be named slightly differently like mine was also run gta from a batch file from a guide on fixing gta 5 pc stuttering fixes on youtube it reduces priorities on other rockstar applications that launch and maximizes priority on gta game itself all of these had slight improvements to performance until it was fixed now runs at steady fps at full speed in a car plane and boat i did not have nvstreamsvc that some ppl had stutter lag from edit this is my first experience with the gta series and the game type in general joining a gametype outside of free roam more than halves steady fps dont see the attraction with a lot of mini games and free roam killing outside of messing with other people or playing with friends unless grinding stats and money gta is your thing almost no anonymous player to player interaction other than killing each other on sight and grinding missions in complete silence the best part about the game are the funny moments when the game glitches or someone does some dumb stuff with their characters id rather watch funny youtube videos of this game rather than play it myself edit heavy steady fps drop after several minutes to an hour of gameplay and stutter lag starts returning though never as bad as before i made tweaks unplayable then i bought into the hype you should only get this game if you like these types of games definitely not guaranteed to be fun for more hours than any other decent game on steam espcially if youre playing this without friends pros games funny < main point of everyones 1line reviews havent met anyone using illegal programs to enhance their gameplay cons not optimized for many systems may require you to spend several hours outside of game to fix issues such as stuttering gta 5 online is composed of only mini games and free roam killing free roam doesnt reward you with anything at all compared to the missions and mini games no decent anonymous player to player interaction players play in silence during mini games to grind exp and money people always kill each other on sight as far as ive seen as the only other player interaction character clothing customization is very limited samesimilar model shirtspantsshoes different colorspicture designs to create the illusion of high variety of customization no weapon customization aside from making clip size bigger and slapping on a silencer for the most part sometimes get placed into empty lobbies when there are private lobbies available if we want to play with only friends causing people to go through at least 2 long loading screens to find a populated lobby not guaranteed to be placed into a populated one when choosing to search for another lobby long loading times are long when going back into free roam the funny moments are rare and very short lived overhyped and let down by whats available and the way the player interaction is set up costs 60 dollars games too similar to the free failed game apb online without the cheaters will only give this game another try if i see any attempts at fixing these poor optimization issues or if a friend wants to play havent been this bored in a hyped game since divinity original sin

for a long time now i have been waiting for this game to come out and now that it has i am very displeased starting the game my game crashes and fails to work only once did my game load but it loaded with terrible grapghicsnot on safe mode soon after it loaded it crashed again atleast the first few times it crashed it actually got me through the social club sequence now when i start the game it takes me to the social club app and everything goes white so as anyone would i closed the application of course though when i tried to start again it said failed to launch app is already running this statment was false so i proceded on to the rockstar games support website their methods were smart and most likely usefull to other people but not me i sware i have tried everything and almost come to a conclusion that my computer just isnt capable this lead me to buying an nvidia geforce graphics card and downloading the drivers if you have read this whole thing so far you already know this was a complete waste of time now that i have wasted lots of time and money i am able to make a statement that i do not recomend this game for laptop users like myself it is very displeasing and if anyone knows what im dealing with i would very much appriciat support and help with this time nagging issue as for right now though no i do not reccomend this game for graphical errors and bugs i am very sorry for those who do not like this statement but until i can get my game working my statement remains the same and once again would appriciate some support also before i end this i would like to say that since i did prepurchase this game i am very upset to notice that for the small time frame i was able to play in my extra dlc money that i should have gotton was not in my game in conclusion i have been able to state many valid and strong reasons why i do not reccomend this game because of the struggle i have expierienced but do remeber i only dont recomend this game to laptop usersnot counting alienware

good game fun online but the new policies rockstar has put out that bans people form installing mods even if its only single player is absurd if you have a xb1 or ps4 i recommend getting it for those consoles the very thing that gives pc ports value and increase life of a game is mods if valve makes a new system for paid mods agian and rockstar starts changes its policies to allow mods again we are going to riot and im getting a god damed refund

you can get a refund but you need to go straight to your bank and dispute it say you have a non functionining product if you have my same problem with a laptop your hardware is conflicting with the software of the game so theres really no fix atm you can get a refund throuh your bank for non functioning product i am a laptop user my configuration is a intel i5 2430m cpu paired with a 6550m 2gb ati graphics card i used the latest drivers the leshcat drivers and nothing i or my boyfriend have done will let the game run on my dedicated graphics card the 17 hours logged on the game have been almost all trouble shooting and when the launcher is running it runs the timer i can get the game to run on my intergrated graphics but fps is so low and the quality is awful its so not worth it i have the issue where you click to run the game and nothing happens after social club pops up itll everntually say game failed to start and blah blah blah i have updated my drivers used modded drivers tried every fix on the forums and nothing rockstar needs to patch it badly my boyfriend and i have been trying to get this game to run for over a week now and rockstar has finally responded to my ticket but just brush it off and tell me to contact my laptops manufaturer its not fair my bf has a desktop and can play hes logged 120 hours i was sick of trying to get it to run on the dedicated gpu so i played through a few missions got to the part after you save jimmy from the yacht went to bed booted it up in the morning and my save file was gone just nonexsistent so i went through it all again and the same  thing happened so even when it does run it doesnt hold my gd saves if it gets updated i might purchase again but for right now its unplayable and ill just watch my bf play fug it game is so broken have never played a gta game before and this is not a good start

first off id like to say this is a great game look through the other negative reviews and you might get an idea why i dont reccomend it though i play through the games i have with other members of my family as in when i buy a game on steam i can play it on my account and my brother can play it on his steam account as well since they are on the same computer no problems there sadly this game is locked with one social club account you make with rockstar so the only way anyone in my family can play this is on the same exact character you cant even manually disconnect that social club account from that steam user and use another so unlike every other game in my steam library this can only be used by me to make matters worse the key they gave me wouldent work and rockstar support has been limited at best

steam launcher fails to load game running the launcher directly from the installed directory also fails windows event viewer indicates the application faulting immediately after it starts a problem noted frequently on the internet and in these reviews it has been a long long time since i had to fight a pc game to get it to work  congratulations rockstar it totally feels like the 90s again considering that based on steam reviews about 1 in every 4 purchasers is currently unable to launch the game i fully expect that a patch to sort this issue out will be on its way shortly or at least i hope so if so and should the patched port merit it i will change my review

i dont mind not having any mods on gta 5 its fun by it self probably until i get bored and want to play with mods but we cant do that because they are banning mods on gta if you do it you get banned for two weeks because u used mods on single player i can see getting banned on multiplayer because you were using a certaint mod to give you stuff but come on rockstar this was suppose to be amazing with all the mods but now its just ed ill change my vote once they change it to allowing mods on gta 5 since i already played gta on consle so i might get bored of it soon

i love this game ive played it since the day it came out for xbox 360 and the game itself is great however rockstar has placed a patch on all mods forbiding you to install any of them i wasted $60 so i could get mods and now im left with an unmodable game this is a big dissapointment for me however if you are looking to play the game no mods installed i would definitly buy it it is a big part of my life and its totally worth the money well for non modders anyway

there is always a problem when trying to sign into the social club then your account gets locked and you cant play the game for hours even after changing your password 5 times once you get into the game its fine save for how anal rockstar is about the mods which is a damn shame cause thats the only reason i bought the game for pc anyway

avoid this game and buy it on xbox one or ps4 hell even buy it on the ps3 or xbox 360 the pc version is super buggy since the last patch and youll be lucky to play for more than 1hr before it crashes then once it does you have to reboot to play it for even that long again stay away from the pc version till rockstar addresses the issue>>>>>

the game overall is good but my game stutters like crazy the 101 patch was supposed to fix this but only made it worse and entirely unplayable as of 4202015 this is unacceptable from rockstar since alot of people have been having this issue there is no fix for the stuttering as of yet gtav uses alot of cpu and ram for some reason rockstar support hasnt responded when i put my problem in on the 15th of april this issue isnt due to my system due to the fact that i get more than 70fps when i dont stutter ive tried running at the lowest setting but it changes nothing rockstar needs to fix the bugs that this game causes for people it is just unaccpetable

beautiful environment beautiful production values ctop for that phrase it is a sound solid game and my pc middle of the road build three years old now plays it just fine but i have enough brains to recognize that my 780 not three years old has its limits unlike so many other gamers who think their video card should be able to run everything maxed just because it was expensive when they bought it cudos to rockstar for taking the time to make a decent pc release stable and nearly bug free so many console developers fail epically fail at making their pc release playable at first release i do not care about online play i was bored with online play when i abandoned my wow and americas army online accounts years back if i wanted that much drama in my life i would be a middle school teacher so we come to single player it is long it is not so fun what i see as the root cause of my nonenjoyment is the change from having a single main character representing you gta vcsa4 to having three very different personspersonality types that you have to swittch through to get through the single player story it ruins the immersion by violating your empathy with your character i find myself very sympathetic to and enjoying playing as one of the characters and utterly hating the time i am forced to invest palaying the other two who suck so i am finding only one third of the campaign enjoyable and the other two thirds are torture i am forced to grind through it would have been so much better to be able to play a complete campaign as a single character with the option to start and play a new game as one of the others that would have been a much better and smarter move on rockstars part imho cest la vie and did rockstar really think i was interested in putting an ifruit app on my personal real life smartphone after making such a drama within the game about liveinvader gtas parody of facebook that grabs all your personal info and sells it to every bidder really and i just saw the post about real life social club account passwords compromised and we are barely at one week since pc release rockstar take your ifruit app and shove it somewhere as dark as the inside of steve jobs coffin please now that i wrote this i am betting he was cremated so substitute urn for coffin if so 7 of 10 overpriced and overrated

this game has serious potential but it was deliberately  upon by rockstar the quality of the port is mostly good unlike gta iv but unfortunately thats all they did right rockstar intentionally made online mode a grindfest that rivals some of the worst mmos they intentionally bottlenecked your income so that you would buy ingame currency from the rockstar store for most players if you do not buy ingame currency you will never obtain even 10% of what is offered online so essentially i paid 60 dollars to experience 10% of online mode at this point they expect you to pay extra money to experience the remaning 90% many of the vehicles are overpowered as well and inaccessible unless you play the game everyday like a job or cave in and pay money to rockstar that is unacceptable pay2win is something you expect from garbagetier freetoplay games not a 60 dollar aaa title one of the cars is even bulletproof and you can shoot out of it it makes zero sense players can actually shoot through the armorplating while remaining invulnerable to bullets this means you have to spend even more money on explosives to take them out now heres the kicker you spent 1500 for one sticky bomb and assuming you land it on their car during a fight you have to pay 7 grand to reimburse the player for their car so if some  is driving up to you and shooting you in freeroam for no reason you have to pay extra money to dispose of them and it costs them nothing this is a ing joke if you absolutely must buy this game because you want to experience single player which is the only good part of the game wait for a sale also do not spend money on the micro transactions and reward rockstar for their  gaming is being ruined because gamers support this kind of  i regret buying the game for sure live and learn i guess

i love the detail put into the game from the characters to the missions and even the little things like stockmarket changes due to the missions you complete ingame i would recommended it for what i mentioned above but i still have big problems like everyone else when i started the benchmark it loaded the very first mission and the benchmark scene at the same time randomly switching between the two i get massive fps drops randomly down to 9fps typically from walking down the street to driving a car at moderate speed ive even gotten some graphical glitches from time to time for example a rectangular line of light appearing around my character and it even not loading an entire area it spawns my character in making them fall through the ground as well as other things so like others i wont be currently recommended it edit also i thought i should mention that the money promised ingame for people who preordered is only given to franklin

from what i experienced in the short time i was actually able to get this game to runprobably around a half hour total i would rate this game 910 unfortunately this launch was a huge disappointment as 95% of the time the game refuses to even run and the few times it did crashes resulted randomly or even as a result of clicking on a different window and then clicking back on the game screen i have opened a ticket with rockstar support and tried all of the fixes they and other people have recommended but nothing has worked funny how they delayed the release again and again to ensure that the game is as polished as possible and to make certain that both heists and the gta online experience are ready to roll out on day one for pc well guess what rockstar the game doesnt even run for a lot of us im sure eventually this problem will be fixed on your end and then ill be able to forgive you but until then i just want to warn anyone whos thinking about spending their hard earned money on this game that there is a significant chance the game wont even run and so i would recommend waiting until rockstar has fixed this issue
not recommended
its a great game when it doesnt crash on you or give your computer an error that makes your computer restart itself oh and my textures wont load for the most partthere is a fix but not a proper update if the game gets fixed ill rewrite my review i will keep playing it cause when it works its fun but currently i cant reccomend it so for now a 510average because it can still be fun but in its current state i cant give it a higher rating thank you good bye

i cant fathom why this game is getting top scores the writing is awfully boring for 90 percent of the game it glitches out constantly in both singleplayer and multi youre forced to go through terrible amounts of loading screens even with an ssd cutscene prep and just plain old driving to places while terrible dialogue plays the side activities range from playable to downright awful multiplayer is an unbalanced mess and singleplayer has tons of useless padding the missions themselves are mostly fine aside from the long stretches of nothing happening thats going on with them with a few gems sprinkled in here and there controls are one area the game is a lot better in though with cars not flipping around like the roads were made of glass and shooting being a lot tighter than in gta 4 riding bikes and making jumps and flying planes is still awkward though it is mostly pretty enough with some weird dips in texture quality here and there that are probably a remnant from the 360ps3 versions it isnt a terrible game by any means but not at all worth the full cost wait for a sale especially if your computer cant handle it too good

510 this is such a fail i had bought this in febuary expecting all this hype and how good it was on ps3 to live up to it then it relesed having the rockstar social hub thing as a mandatory for both multiplayer and single is bull  as most people cant play because of it and they relesed a more broken pice of crap then grass sim or goat sim but hey want to stare and a scocial hub loading be my guest pay 40 for this game i stand by this even when its fixed as they should of gitten gud and had bata testors or somthing

huge letdown other than interesting story and great voice acting there is not much about online version i know ign will go wild and do 1010 as usual when you are a buttlicking company who strives towards free advertisment as ign does gta v sadly does not deserve 1010 when it comes to online play i do not belive that they have been working on a side project as there have been claims side project as in working on a game for pc instead of porting it over from consoles to pc this is  literally game is directly ported from consoles to pc hardly optimized no matter what settings you change game does not improve frame rates or anything i got two pcs one can run it as smooth as it gets nvidia card and on another pc with amd card it runs like crap but now back to online its just one huge pile of  what to say other than loading screens all the ing time im not here to play total overdose game again because that game had more loading screens than 20 games combined and this is exactly how gta v online feels you will spend more time on organising games and on loading screen than actually playing ing missions you limited pc version why so many loadings why not have implemented missions directly into lobby where you have alot of other players together playing around yeah you heard that right pvp type instead of hosted  with just few people apb comes to mind that game blows but one thing it does right is handling missions and having players around you so you dont feel alone in a online game 310 for online gameplay 810 for offline gameplay overal solid 610 do i recommend this game for offline goofing around yes for freemode online yes for missions and team play  no it is real crap and not worth mentioning

graphically honestly i dont think it is much better than gtaiv with iceenhance mods i played it with minimum settings and besides a lot of jaggies from no aa it looked really good i cranked up my gtx680 and tuned it for about an hour and honestly i didnt see a huge difference than stock minimal settings its really apparent that a lot of the detail was put into the textures not so much shaders which is really obvious by the amount of vram textures take and how little ultra shaders take newer game newer hardware where is the oomph compared to gtaiv with iceenhance shaders its just the texture detail weve seen this level of detail already in gtaiv the dx11 feature set along with nvidia specific features offer a lot for a developer to play with tesselation is one of the coolest things that dx11 offers yet it is near non existent in gtav you can turn it on but i have yet to find where it is being used properly shaders are neat and can offer a graphical wizardry that 3d modeling cant a great example is in valves left 4 dead 2 in the swamp map where the water is pooling and reflecting while on fire its a really cleaver piece of code to create this effect that couldnt be done any other way i think the explosions in this game are pretty lack luster for me very few particles came out of a tanker truck i crash into in the benchmark test they live and die unrealistically and have the trajectory of a firework not a tanker truck explosion i am glad i was able to play for 9 hours before my game keeps freezing at an exact point leaving me stuck in the story and not able to move forward but i am not looking forward to the weeks of tech support email i now have to endure this is really typical of rockstar for anyone that has been playing their pc games for the last decade or so if you are one of the millions that cannot play a game you have been waiting almost 2 years to play you know the grief rockstar games have great character and story yet they really lack in the technical department they are always buggy ports of console games i wish for once they would start with 3 separate codebases xbox ps3 pcand hire good programmers theyve had 2 years to do this whats the excuse we could go one by one and talk about all the shaders and i really dont see anything here that wasnt as good if not better in iceenhance mod in their defense i will add that the anisotropy of the cars is very good it always feels metallic as it should good job using shaderlab guys

warning for integrated graphics users do not buy this game you will only hurt your nerves and your wallet ive fought with many problems to get this game to work on normal settings i nearly wrecked my laptop trying to fix this brown nugget of a game and what do i get a game that looks like  on the only settings i managed to get it to work on spawning in multiplayer i apparently didnt have the rank to do the first tutorial mission so that does not work in singleplayer my keyboard inputs lag because of the integrated graphics dont ask me no idea how they are connected but a short internet research revealed that they are linked so that does not work either i know you can fix the keyboard problem but i really dont want to change my settings everytime just to play the game same as i dont want to deactivate my graphics card every time in total ive wasted about 20 hours of my life trying to get this to work not worth a single one every time you fix a problem they throw another one at you i see this game in my steam list i wish id never bought it if the game works for you be glad take a minute and thank whatever god you believe in for giving you the chance to play this unoptimized turd i personally hate rockstar for what they sold me

in totaly honesty if you like driving games  repetive gameplay then this is the game for you graphics is great the whole game is great but its just the same thing over and over and over again so in the end you dont do much except leveling up to buy better weapons to kill the people ing with you easier so yeah money & experience thats all you need to blow up everything and make the world go against you what isnt more fun then to shoot random pedestrians that didnt do  to you in the first place ooooh the irony  this  d heist  rob do missions to earn a bigger amount of cash sneak or go annahilation on their asses driving missions  all from cars  sportcars  bicycle  motorcycle  airplanes and heavy military airplanes it is fun the 46 first times then it gets freaking lame deathmatch  tdm  ffadm  its just like playing a 3d person shooter with no control you get some  power ups like armor and nades then you go hunt players and win to earn money yeey more money holy  i could go on with this list but then it might look like a negative my guide for this game reviem the verdict  dont buy this  cant belive people said this game was great reminds me abit of dragon age inquisition multiplayer that people where braging so much about holy  biggest dissapointment of my life  but if you easly find those things booring i would highly not reccomend buying this game money well wasted huhu 3

prepurchased and waited patiently for the release whambam crash what i cant forgive is that rockstar post a supposed fix for one of the suspected causes of the problem the easiest one  invalid characters in windows user name but totally ignore all the others it is left to other forums to make suggestions and investigate fixes while rockstar ignore calls for help in my case its the launcher failure message as soon as i try to load the game i have tried every fix mentioned with no success ok so i have to wait until a fix comes or demand a refund problem is that if i refund then i loose the prepurchase ingame cash bonus i cant recommend what will undoubtedly be a fantastic game when its fixed as i cant play it and i strongly advise potential new buyers to wait until these problems have been resolved maybe if this issue hits rockstars bank balance they will start to treat their customers with a bit more respect ive been working in customer service all my life and the most basic requirement is summed in a single word  communication come on rockstar  whats going on

well there is much to say about this game iill quickly go over the cons and pros of it the there is actually something important we need to discuss pros pretty good graphics okay story dicersity in gameplay replay value cons repetitive online microtransactions now what i want to discuss is the ethic of this company firstly dont take me as someone anfry about the delays for pc i played this game on the old gen listen up this game was supposed to be released in spring 2013 and was delayed until september 2013 then the online was delayed for two weeks and did not work for the first few days heists were also promised in the reveal trailer but they were delayed until just now rockstart kept making promises of the release of those heist those heists were released almost 2 years after the initial release of this game i leave you on these facts to judge if they are trustworthy

this game runs like absolute garbage i update my drivers to be able to run this game it makes things worse and now i dont get anymore than 30fps no matter what settings i play on after waiting 2 years for this game youd think that they would have sorted these things out this is not a hardware issue
not recommended
this pc version is not playable i advise anybody to rather spent the money on something else i cant progress in this game for over 1 week due to crashes at the same point of the game the support team only says please update the video driver and then ignores the ticket for 7 days  even after including every single log file possible with exact offsets why the game crashed access violation after waiting for 2 years of this release you would assume that the release will be less problematic but wow i hate pc gaming in 2015 the ports of the games lack of anything rockstar get your crap fixed and you will another postive review
not recommended
this game should not have been released as it is  there is a really bad lag between the keyboard input and the response in the game especially while driving so many other popular games i own seem to play much more smoothly i read terrific reviews online so i thought this might be something other than an afterthought port but sadly the reviews were wrong from my point of view i tried turning down the graphics and ran a benchmark but even with about 4050 fps there is still really bad input lag which leads me to believe there is some fundamental bug in the game itself the game crashed several times and even caused my antivirus to crash which is a behavior i have not observed in a game since the days of windows 98 so many other games play fine on my system so i have to conclude that this is a bad port and is not worth it as of april 2015 i sure hope they fix it because the graphics look terrific and the story was fun i played it on a console before buying the pc version until a fix is provided i cannot bring myself to deal with the frustration of playing this game as it is  life is too short

the way you walk is terrible you always need to press shift to just move more quicker than walking there is no option for permanent running for sprinting you need another extra key and if you turn around on a crane or something like that you fall to your unpleasant death if you want to play online with your friends  no problem just play this solo missions first which you cant skip and ore the most boring things we could imagine  for over an hour and then you can join your friends which are all sick of waiting for you already hey you want to do another mission sure just go grab a car and oh  5 stars again right thats the reason i had no car in the first place cause i got killed trying to get to a mission

this is all assuming you manage to launch the game of course this is a good game that you should get on console not this horrid pc version pros first person got to take part in the greatest heist of all rockstar taking my money cons cutscenes dont trigger in first person causing the game to enter an endless loop untill you reload your game when i met simmeon for the first time he just outstretches his arms for a hug and thats it the game shutdowns as i cant give him a hug or interact with anything in the game left a brother hanging the game lags when moving at high or medium speeds go above 50 miles per hour and the game will lag untill you find yourself in the middle of the street thrown from your vehicle and about to be run over by cop car i had to run in directx 10 just to play and even that lagged its fine if you want a walking simulator though or dont drive vehicles of any kind online tutorial not a tutorial it just makes you join a race match which doesnt matter if you win lose stop the car to take a  or crash the vehicle doesnt tell you any controls or features and makes you sit through very long cutscenes that of course glitch out and enter an endless loop so you try and make a new character but the game instanly crashes when you press edit character do you want some cheese lamar enters his car and drives away then comes back to ask over and over before asking that however he claims some people are just too clingy yes i would like some damn cheese lamar

if you are only buying this game for the online multiplayer i would not recommend buying it at this time currently loading into matches takes forever when you arent getting kicked because the host drops the lobby lots of people use exploits such as summoning a tank to fight in deathmatch game modes and the racing game mode is just plain broken also heists have unskippable intro cutscenes and the missions automatically restart if even one player dies i wish i could get a refund for this game
not recommended
im not giving this game a thumbs down to make some sort of statement about modding or optimization for the record i have tried no mods and the game runs better than i expected this is a good game but i want to be clear its not perfect the singleplayer is generally very satisfying and the map is fun to explore but none of the characters are appealing enough for me to want to root for them michael honestly deserves most of the things he tirelessly es about trevors insanity never amused or moved me that much and franklin just didnt have much originality in the scope of gta protagonists maybe id have grown to like one of them more if there had been one protagonist instead of three i constantly had to switch between in terms of gameplay gta v offers a huge world to explore but never really capitalizes on it i was very pleased to see the return of purchaseable businesses but was annoyed at the clumsiness of dividing them between three characters and i was deeply disappointed that there was no option to buy safe houses in other parts of the map as in many other gta games such would have been a great feature for this game considering how huge the map is more than anything though my biggest problem with this game is that it feels set up solely to get you to play gta online which i found underwhelming here the game offers you the freedom it denies you in the singleplayer but forces you to participate in missions and activities with other players in order to progress aside from some missions most of these activities arent that fun and detract from the freedom that makes gta enjoyable that said much of the game is really good rockstar has put way more energy and passion into this game than is the norm in these sad times and that much earns this game my respect the map is refreshingly large and exploring it feels like an adventure the first person mode is a great deal of fun the cars are exceptionally well made and beautifully detailed im not saying that gta v is bad or even that its not a good game its just overhyped ill still play it and ill openly say that i like it quite a lot but its not perfect tldr i dont regret spending the $60 to play gta 5 but neither am i thrilled that i did its not something id recommend against buying but neither would i actively recommend buying it
not recommended
its really buggy and id suggest you wait to buy it

the game itself is great shekelstars stance on modding however is just absurd banning players for offline mod use is entirely nonsensical and doesnt aid in any way to the prevention of online hackers it makes complete sense for online trainers to be banned as it would destroy the multiplayer mode and render rockstars goyimcards obsolete but graphics enhancing mods would likely benefit rockstar in terms of attracting new customers more then the users themselves 0510 slightly better than the holocaust

this is one of the most expensive and well made black screen simulators i have ever played exquisite graphics theyre so good youll have to restart your computer to experience them but on a more serious note rockstar should get its stuff together and release another patch for improved stability on machines with two graphics cards thankfully rockstar support has been helpful and i would recommend that over the game itself until this game can be run i couldnt care less about pc mods the game should be able to work this is really frustrating and should be fixed soon potential players should not have to jump through so many technical hoops in order to get the game to even run properly once this game can run i will reconsider this game

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

you rockstar you make us pc gamers wait months for this beautiful game all that waiting for graphics that almost no ones computers can handle not only that but there are soooo many mothering bugs and glitches i cant play a game for more than 1 hour without it crashing or freezing or just having insanely  glitches as trevor always says  you  you  you  you  yooooooooou fffffuucckkkk yyyoooooouuuuuu

if you click on no to skip the online tutorial it takes you into the tutorial which can then not be backed out of and takes almost an hour to complete you have to use the keyboard and press esc do not use the mouse in order to skip the tutorial it sucks trying to play with friends but you have to listen to them play while you do this horrible tutorial

id really like that rockstar read this the game is awesome it has incredible graphics and all the things you guys made what you promised but theres one big big problem the game lags and freezes a lot and its not my pcs fault i5 4460 8gb ddr3 gtx 970 im using the nvidia recommendatios and still it is very hard to have a constant 60fps this way i guess playing on the xbox 360 or ps3 is way better cause they dont have the same lag as the pc version has if you guys fix this ill surely come back here and change my vote thanks

i would love to say that i loved this game but i cant not now in its current version after pushing back the release date of this game multiple times there are still too many infurriating bugs with this game there is the huge issuse of extreme framerate drops which are common even post patch an issue that happens regardless of the settings you are using even with the framerate issue i got through the campain portion and enjoyed it after buying all the properties and ransacking the town with tanks and choppers i grew bored and decided to try out the online portion of the game i was impressed at first i liked the idea of having your own character within the same map you were familar with and incorporating characters you had already come across made for interesting missions but there is a huge caveat it was fun when it worked i kept track of all of the different times there was an unknown network error or if my mission unexpectedly stopped not including when people left over the course of about 90 minutes i had 7 such issues 7 what makes this worse is every time your network errors occured it automatically loaded the story mode and had to reload online this is a slow and annoying process that probably took at least 15 minutes of the 90 i played if you take into account the time spent waiting for others to join and the frequent times when the host terminated the game or kicked you from the mission the amount of time you were actually playing was probably close to 40 minutes so it is very simple why online mode sucks right now i spent 50 minutes waiting to play 40 minutes worth of game this is not my only experience where i had a plethora of issues it is merely only the only one i bothered to keep track of there are also numerous other bugs and glitches i experienced while playing not to mention the number of times i had waited only to have the host leave and ruin the set up or heist mission i really want to like this game i preordered and tried to remain positive even after numerous delays but now i find myself thinking why wasnt it delayed longer if the game still has this many issues my hardware specs fx 8320 7970 8 gb ram 1600 mhz wd black 1tb hd samsung 840 120 gb ssd for os plus a few things

i would love to offer a review of this game if it would even start maybe if rockstar got up off their beanbag chairs filled with 100 dollar bills and weed and realized nobody wants to deal with social club it could be launched using steams perfectly fine overlay and this whole  issue with social club blanking out would be resolved but then again we have to rememebr its not as if they actually give a  about any of their customers review staying negative until i can actually play which im guessing wont happen until wednesday of next week if i know rockstar

bought this game to play online with my friends and do missions etc but online doesnt even work you can have an online character and you can start missions but if you have anyone in your friends list you cannot play with them or get in the same game rockstar has even patched it already and you still cannot connect to friends or crew members you will join and there will be 4 people in your lobby max but they will soon leave your game for one reason or another basically because you are losing conenction to them

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

single player is great online not so much as it uses peer to peer and hackers are rampant so you have to play in closed friend sessions not recommending because the online is a broken piece of  will update if the issues are ever fixed

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar

long story short for people who love gta and want to play singleplayer only this is for you if you want to play online you will probably get killed by hackers and guess what rockstar does nothing about it there is no simple way to report players so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers game itself 1010 gta online 310 hackers everywhere edit this is itdecided to improve my flying skills all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane i didnt press anything freezes and thats it cant move at all some sort of hack joined another session after few minutes i noticed two people with godmode on so i went passive mode but guess what they started shooting cars at me and i died about 10 times i advice you not to buy this game at all

i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

i bought this to play gta online on pc well constant server problems due to rockstar made that impossible the issue is not on my end and there is several thousands reporting the same issue so to warn you all if you are buying this with the expectations to play online forget about it rockstar will never fix the network issue which have been around on ps34 and xbox since launch almost 2 years for the people who did the same mistake as me and bought it you actually have a option to ask for a full refund from steam regardless how many days ago you bought it grab the opportunity while you still have it

this is the first review for me and im sad to say its a bad one the game looks amazing and seems like it would be fun as hell if i could play it every time i join a free roam server i get a flood of messages saying that everyone disconnected its really me disconnecting because of some bug i opened a support ticket with rockstar and they have not replied doing some research into this i have found that many people across all platforms are experiencing this rockstar made a guide to fix the problem which said to forward some ports and disable your firewall among others things well i tried it and it did nothing i really hope they fix this but i doubt they will because this has been going on for years i think they are just not worried about the few that are getting this bug because the majority are not just goes to show how much of a  company they are do not buy this game until they come out with a patch or risk wasting 60 ing dollars

5 days from launch and still i cant play almost 50% cant play and rockstart is not showing any message of them knowing of the problem or if they are trying to fix it at this point i would not recommend the game cus you have a 50% chance of not being able to play for now i would say i dont recommend it but if they fix all those launch problems so everybody can play i am probably changing my opinion and if the game runs smoothly and they all those who still cant play including me lets just hope for a fix soon

dont rely on rockstar support to ever give you any assistance with this game due to a stupid design feature you have to log into a rockstar social club account in order to play the game even if you do not want to use any of the online features by their own admission a number of these accounts have been compromised or in plain english hacked mine being one of them as this rockstar account is linked to my steam account i am now unable to play a game which has cost me nearly 40 uk pounds rockstar supports answer to my logged requests for assistance  absolutley nothing thank you so very much rockstar

the most dissapointing game ive ever played wow this is ing terrible remember when we all thought gta 4 took itself to seriously remember when we thought its story was overblown its gameplay was janky its characters lackluster and its lack of fun well rockstar has done it again and this time its worse so lets start with free roam you cant free roam why heres why because the player is weak in gta 5 the ammount of bullets it takes to blow out a cars tires is decreased and the duribility of the cars is decreased its also harder to obtain cars so if you like me wanted to walk out side cap some dumb prick steal his ride and go on a 20 minute joyride with sirens and gunshots as your soundtrack you cant because the cops will shoot out your tires and your car will become worthless quite fast the cops themselves have also had a major  buff increasing their dammage and accuracy a cop will now be able to headshot you and it is allways a headshot for an instant kill from any range at any speed within their car you can be doing 70 on the highway in a stollen noose van and be instantly felled by a default first responder your player is weak in terms of duribility too you have half the health you had in gta 4 which was half that it was in gta 3 if this keeps up by gta 6 a fart will kill us and as mentioned before the cops are deadly accurate so you can literally walk outside steal a car and be dead within 6 seconds im serious your weapons are largely useless ammo is less plentiful has a lower cap is more expensive and your guns are weaker than they used to be so while that cop will insta kill you youll be hosing down his cruiser with a machine gun and not score any hits also if you decide to go with a motorcycle you will fall off and once you fall off your character takes about 2 millenia to get up so you get zerg rushed by 60 cops and killed within 4 seconds now for story the story is bad trevor is completely unlikeable franklin is bacically a cardboard cutout and michael while the best of the characters is a  sucker of the finest degree youll play througout the entire story constantly thinking why cant i just ing shoot this guywhy cant i just ing do this job why cant my character do anything except swallow police  the reason is because rockstar cant ing write well the story is a complete mess and i will not write any further about it because it makes my head hurt which isnt even getting into the glitches in short this game can only be saved by the modding communtiy the only way which i could ever reccomend this game is if rockstar were to seriously buff the player put the game on sale and provide regenerating health then it would finally become fun until then all i can say is nexus community gta garage the guys who did the sa multiplayer mod ing someone save this  i paid 60 bucks and got nothing for it

from what i experienced in the short time of 86 hours the game looks stunning the new features such as first person ads and the graphics are boast worthy before i get into my review i would like to list of my current pc specs graphics card geforce gtx 760 processor intel core i54670k cpu 340ghz installed memoryram 160gb system type windows 8 64bit computer name jeffpci know how much ram i came here with so dont even try and download any of mine the reason i am rating this gamereview as a negative review is because the game is simply not ready when first booting up gta 5 online the loading screens seem to take almost double the time it takes to load in on my 360 when online does load up most of the map is invisible it does load but its slow highways roads overpasses buildings and railways just disappear if you go too fast in a vehicle i was in first person and looked at how fast my car was going and it seems that anything faster than 60mphwhich is 13 of the top speed of exotic cars makes the game start to disappear i am unable to find anyone in any online sessions i have tried rockstars troubleshoot without success rockstar suggests that i change my aiming type as people who use free aim are pooled with people who also selected free aim and people who choose assisted aim are pooled with assisted aim players they suggest tweeking with those settings which i have without success in conclusion i would rate the game 910 if it were working correctly and if rockstar came through on everything that has been promised this game has been delayed two years multiplayer is kill map loading is kill loading screens are kill for now ill give it a 210 examples of things that are not kill would be updated facial graphics of the protagonist you play as onlineoffline they did a outstanding job of making my female character look delicious vehicles look slick the dashboards are unique in every car and actually fuction properly the faster you go the higher the needle climbs on the speedometer the climateweather in this game feels more real compared to 360 version when it rains it really rains pools of water accumulate on the streets which makes for wet feet this makes me wet just thinking about it the adsironsights is a welcomed change guns feel the same as before but now you have options i like the new gun animations for reloading thanks for reading my experience with gta 5 for pc ive explored vast amounts of rockstar support articles with no known fixes of my issues ive stated or if there has been fixes they did not work clearly if anyone has any suggestions or comments on fixes or how i can improve my grammer let me know i welcome you grammer nazis and trolls i will reevaluate in two weeks

i would love to say that i loved this game but i cant not now in its current version after pushing back the release date of this game multiple times there are still too many infurriating bugs with this game there is the huge issuse of extreme framerate drops which are common even post patch an issue that happens regardless of the settings you are using even with the framerate issue i got through the campain portion and enjoyed it after buying all the properties and ransacking the town with tanks and choppers i grew bored and decided to try out the online portion of the game i was impressed at first i liked the idea of having your own character within the same map you were familar with and incorporating characters you had already come across made for interesting missions but there is a huge caveat it was fun when it worked i kept track of all of the different times there was an unknown network error or if my mission unexpectedly stopped not including when people left over the course of about 90 minutes i had 7 such issues 7 what makes this worse is every time your network errors occured it automatically loaded the story mode and had to reload online this is a slow and annoying process that probably took at least 15 minutes of the 90 i played if you take into account the time spent waiting for others to join and the frequent times when the host terminated the game or kicked you from the mission the amount of time you were actually playing was probably close to 40 minutes so it is very simple why online mode sucks right now i spent 50 minutes waiting to play 40 minutes worth of game this is not my only experience where i had a plethora of issues it is merely only the only one i bothered to keep track of there are also numerous other bugs and glitches i experienced while playing not to mention the number of times i had waited only to have the host leave and ruin the set up or heist mission i really want to like this game i preordered and tried to remain positive even after numerous delays but now i find myself thinking why wasnt it delayed longer if the game still has this many issues my hardware specs fx 8320 7970 8 gb ram 1600 mhz wd black 1tb hd samsung 840 120 gb ssd for os plus a few things

to release a game in 2015 without giving the player a choice to play as male or female is this games first downfall i found quests boring and dialogue between the brothers way over the top strippers and hookers are cheap looking and topless is the most you will get with very poor detail if you are 13 then maybe this game sound cool to play but dont waste your money on this  there are much better games out there with strippers  cars and hookers with much better detailed graphics so if your thing is 90% driving around  ugly men and woman in low resolution 5% shooting in quests then this game is for you

here are my points of contention with both game modes single player has a laughable fraction of what is available in the online mode almost none of the activities you have available to you to make money are available in single player mode and those that are pay out a tiny fraction of what you would get online and my point of contention with online is surprisingly enough not the cheaters which you can avoid it is that they gate the performance unlocks behind the accumulation of racing wins you need about 50 wins to unlock every performance upgrade you can get which sounds reasonable the problem is that the wins have to be against other players there is no ai and you have to come in 1st place for it to count most people boost each other and just let the other win the number of times necessary to get the unlocks so if you dare to choose to play legitimately then you have two options host your own races excluding the custom cars everyone else has already boosted each other for and never having anyone join the race or you can feed loss after loss after loss to games full of custom cars that are fully upgraded that youll never stand a chance against its a ridiculous system that enables encourages and ultimately demands you exploit your way by or be punished constantly for daring to play legitimately in addition it is sometimes impossible to connect to your own friends sessions in the online mode especially if youre playing from a shared internet connection there has been a bug around forever where you need to complete the tutorials before being able to join friends despite them having an option to skip the tutorials it has supposedly been fixed but i experienced it on multiple occasions gta v is a great looking game with some fun content but like other games of recent times it has allowed itself to become blinded by the online component and the influence it has and they have decided as a result to abandon the singleplayer premise that they built themselves on in order to create a haven where cheaters and exploiters do whatever they want and legitimate players just have to deal with it or leave

gta v is the worst game i have ever got on steam it crashes after every mission or during without being able to save your progress making you have to redo entier missions three or four times the loading screen takes ages after rebooting it and it gets longer with each reboot sometimes your characters get black lines across their faces and bodies in online and storymode recently i came into an issue that gta v worth 40 doesnt even work as when playing i dont seem to be controlling the character and he just stands there with the only button that works is the esc key then once in the menu of the game all my keys and my mouse work but when i want to play the game it doesnt work i would rather spend money on any other game as a game full of bugs and crashes is not worth 40 steam isnt even helpful with the issue as ive spent 1 hour trying to go on steam forums and trying to report the bugs and it just redirects me and tells me stuff like reboot your computer i have about 4 times and ive rebooted steam but it doesnt work so dont ever buy this game on pc as it is one of the worst games ever on pc

if you found gta iv a miserable experience this one is worse firstly the loading times  i literally give up the will to live by the time its loaded properly then the constant hard drive thrashing that it does is beyond a joke im sure if youve got a brilliant system then things are much better but from what ive seen on youtube even the best systems out there still have long load times and in game stutter so the loading times are murderous  what about the game the game is pretty much like the last gta all the fun elements that made gta great are still missing in this version you switch between three main characters none of whom have any redeeming features a loser black guy who if he existed in real life would be executed by one of his friends as an act of mercy then you switch to a middle aged white guy who has money but his life is obviously grim problems with his family are obvious and hes got a drinking problem then you can switch to a total loser psychopath its just miserable so if you enjoyed playing a russian immigrant in the last gta this one will be just fine to be honest rockstar lost the plot after san andreas ever since that release gta has not been fun to play at all it feels hollow and just plain grim the characters are just not interesting and the missions are just tedious once you complete a mission you dont feel any sense of satisfaction just a feeling of thank god thats over with most missions take several attempts to achieve the minigames are poorly implemented

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

mods in gta 4 added a lot of entertainment and replay value to the game in gta 5 however rockstar has been banning people for installing mods in single player mods are a huge part of pc gaming and should only be taken action on if used in multiplayer i hope rockstar realizes how important modding is to pc gamers and improve on their current system to allow singleplayer mods

so im ready to have a million people rate this down without reading this and have even more people rate it up without reading this so heres my honest opinions on gta 5 enjoy to the people who read reviews so gta 5 on pc or as i like to call it gta 5 pt 3 because this has been launched 3 times when i first heard of gta 5 on pc i thought to myself darn i was hoping to spend money on 2015 lets start off with an old version of gta 5 i played by old i mean the first im an og when it comes to gta 5 and because of that i hate this version it disgusts me that 6 of my friends have this on their wishlist and that 12 already own it and when i asked a lot of them if they played the older ones all of them said no they all also love the game why do i hate this version well first off the graphics there better but i dont have the cash to upgrade to a gx980 or something like that to play gta 5 on max graphics and unless you never played gta 5 before the only way youll be convinced to come back is if everything looks awesome and theres more content or atleast thats how it works with me the content was lacking and the fact that they couldnt make it so people can play max graphics unless if they have top of the line graphics cards was bs if you played the first release of gta 5 i think you can agree with me that it gets boring after a few hundred hours of sp online sucks after about 20 hours with an extra 5 or 10 hours with friends people are already getting bored of online youd expect more good stuff with pc edition all we got was gta online heists which was horrible what are you talking about gta online heists was ing awesome  you well voice in my head thats your opinion oh my i almost forgot the mods they sucked too i  myself when i saw the flood mod when i got it the charm quickly faded away i already did this  in gta 4 whats the difference in gta 5 im also suprised the devs didnt add some feature that disabled mods when you entered online a lot of people are getting banned because of that luckily online is dead to me so i ignore it and havent gotten banned so i can happily enjoy this empty game im not purposly trying to  on this game its just how i feel theres so much else i want to say about this game but writing this review is almost as boring as playing the game ill probably write more soon just not now

online is starting to feel a little freemium as southpark would say except i paid 70 dollarsi find the grinds in this to be boring  not to mention extemely low paying and cannot help but feel this is intentional since you can bypass the grinding and just pay your wayi get you need to build your skill points no matter what but its much easier when you can just give roclstar 20 dollars and buy a near invincible vehicle im just saying i literally feeling like i am doing the dishes instead of paying for dinner when i am grinding on this game not to mention out of every 60 minutes i believe 40 of that is loading or waiting for lobbies to fill up the funnest part of this is freemode which is a remnant of what real death matches in gta 4 used to be which they have effectivly killed because there are no pickups in free mode you have to grind to get money for your weapons of course you could just pay clash of the cla i mean rockstar

single player is excellent no question about it but online should have been called load screen simulator heres some reasons why the mp is dissapointing hackers in almost every public match thye drop money on you blow you up spawn props on you and can be invincible months ago i asked rockstar what they planned to do to stop cheaters online no response it really is a shame when a product they took so much time to build is not protected from crap like this httpwwwredditcomrgrandtheftautov_pccomments33x3evreasons_to_why_im_not_happy_with_gta_online httpwwwredditcomrgrandtheftautov_pccomments33t2ehgta_online_is_ to summarize the parts about online being a mess  heres a copy paste of my favs originally posted by calibrono  youve got loading screens between everything that sometimes take minutes my game is installed on an ssd youve got random disconnects youve got loading screens that are stuck forever and you have to altf4 it youve got crazy lags the missions are so confusingly structured youve got jobs all over the map all over the menus and all over the phone but hey the pause menu does not have all the jobs originally posted by foxnos  the time that it takes for a session to load being from boot from single player from a job lobby or pretty much any loading screen at all in online is horrendous options are scattered all across the game sometimes you even have to launch single player just to find options about multiplayer like launching your own session for friends or crew only or the editor so that i can have a look at my recordings that i did in multiplayer yes of course i recommend this game but not at full price for this kind of multiplayer but were all entitled to our opinions be aware that once you beat story mode and do everything there is nothing left but repeat the same activities which is as much fun as watching paint dry edit for clarity and to add that the links above have 280 and over 800 upvotes respectively that means over 1000 people already agree multiplayer is a mess edit as far as heists go its great if you get in with friends on teamspeak otherwise its a horrid mess

maintaining a negative review considering the singleplayer mod banning fiasco a month ago sorry r not gonna escape that  so yeah the game is amazing r as a community management body not so much but yeah aside from that the singleplayer element is unrivaled and its moddability is getting better with each development but even though i myself didnt suffer a gtao ban the fact that i knew so many who did simply because of an fov mod and didnt have their bans reveresed even after contacting support means that im not removing the thumbs down even though they said were not banning anyone for singleplayer mods so many peoples accounts still say otherwise

basic summary lovehate relationship big timeand also were they actually working on this for the past year if i could i would give the recommendation a maybe rating if you have $60 you want to blow on something random go for it but theres alot more things you could be spending it on another reason why i wouldnt recommend this game is if you dont have friends to play with because thats where gta is the most fun i wouldve regretted buying this big time if my friends hadnt started playing with me knowing what i know now i couldve easily passed on this very buggy poorly optmized game  they went old school gta for things like skill building and what not but they took a few chapters out of the saints row book because some things are just silly so its fun to play for a little while but i get bored very quickly some activities are stupid and have no purpose in the game like doing yoga if you liked the older games better you will enjoy it more than someone who prefered gta 4 the heists were okay but for someone whos played payday 2 for over 200 hrs it is nothing magical they definitly didnt think about pc at all when they were making the pc version when they chose keybinds i think someone just smashed their face on the keyboard until they were all filled im honestly surprised they got wasd correct i was impressed with the level of small details they put into this like how the slides on the cops guns move when they shoot i notice something new like that everytime i play and think dang they actually put that in there the storyline keeps me captivated for awhile but not anything too special it offers little bit of complexion so that you cant immediately guess what is going to happen or what happened in the backstory as for online there are many bugs to it that go unresolved just browse rockstars forums for 5 minutes when you first start playing online play with friends when i first joined i was so confused and got annoyed very quickly but playing with friends that were equally confused made it alot more fun until you get to the point that you know whats happening another negative would be that they shove microtransactions in your face that are not worth it at all they offer 15mill at $35 and i was able to get 1 million in about 5 hours of serious online play microtransactions on an already expensive game really lowers my respect for them i didnt realize rockstar was ea in disguise it is an average game id give it average ratings all around this game just screams average if it wasnt so overhyped i wouldve been happier this is just one of those games that will be forgotten quickly i tried to not be completely negative about this game but there just arent too many spectacular things to combat the negatives

tldr see bottom paragraph the first day of gta v release on the pc was very smooth it really showed that during the preperation and delays rockstar put an effort in polishing and refining the game and refining the optimization from console to personal computers rockstar delivered and reaped glory ^_^ in my opinion gta v is an arcade game where you can roleplay as anything you want or you can unfold the singleplayer stories of the three different characters you can play the game in first person view aside from the story of the singleplayer you can choose clothing style from different fashions drive different ground vehicles and boats fly helicopters and airplanes parachute from high elevation aswell as owning pets ride motorcycles and jet skis wield different types of firearms and melee weapons you can exit a vehicle anytime if not blocked or obtructed due to mission restrictions allowing you to reinact stunt moves as in action movies etc you can play sport games race with npcs do stunts on airplanes shoot in gun ranges you wont have your cousin roman calling you to go bowling again the downside in gta v is you cant mountaineer you cant pulverise the ground or any structure in the world you cant remodel your houses the way you want it to you cant own pets other than a dog in gta v los santos you cant travel to vice city or liberty city eventhough you can overhear npcs talking about those two locations you cant own a nonlethal weapon other than the tazer no singplayer friends anymore like in gta iv4 in gta v online the things you can do on gta v online sessions are teaming up with other players around the world and engage in missions ranging from heists to jobs play different types of game modes like capture the flag team deathmatch etc or start a heist privately with your crew members or friends and cooperate and work together to complete the objectives you can mute players who are annoying you and especially when they have an open hot microphone you can setup a crew a group or clan where you can go challenge another crew to war and increase in reputation to receive higher notierity public annoucements whenever one of your crew members join a session or server receive bonuses by finishing a mission or heist with crew members and overall encouraging players to form crews to complete mission and earn ingame cash things to know about in gta v online is that you can purchase ingame online credits with real currency which actually takes out the reward feeling from doing missions or heists because the rewards would mean nothing if you already purchased 8 million ingame online credits anyway the cons in gta v online is that there is no private voice chat or direct communication instead everyone hears what you say in the online session world aswell as xbox players and other console players who play the game have an open hot microphone which ruins the mood and everyone can hear their family members yelling and them yelling back at eachother meanwhile hearing all different noises you just want to avoid hearing while ingame you can initiate missions without receiving a job or invitation from others on your phone or walking on glowing areas around the world of los santos gta v in gta v online it feels very dangerous and chaotic you never can trust anyone in session whom you dont have as friends if you dont keep a close watch on your map you might have someone trying to backstab you or assassinate you for no particular reason plus the gta v online community besides outside the game itself makes it hard to make friends outside of missions because its not possible to have private communication with an individual in a server without disturbing everyone unless you call them in the ingame phone in the singleplayer mode of the game is very atmospheric and the sea and the trees look great you can do alot of dangerous things like stunts and other crazy things that you wont risk in real life other than in gta v the online experience is usually enjoyable however different players around the world may seem to lag depending on their internet connection to the servers location and the stability of their gear that has enough computing power to run the game graphically and mathematically which also has the viceversa effect toward their perspective of where you are in the gta v los santos world all in all a huge step forward from the consoles both graphically and gameplay a greator if not more enjoyable on the pc in fps mode very smooth and enjoyable you can lose alot of hours into both the singpleplayer and online especially if you have nothing to do during the holidays i recommend this game to anyone who has never played it and anyone returning from the old gta titles like vice city but you cant play the game offline except activating the game via rockstar social club in conclusion the game is a step forward you have online and singleplayer i know it is 2015 but what happens when you decide to bring your game on your laptop or install your rig on a trailer because you want to go camping or youre in your new house well guess what you cant play the game offline on singleplayer because rockstar insists on every person who owns the game to activate it on rockstar social club everytime he or she wants to play it its a really nice game dont misunderstand but when i cant even play a game offline without activating it i dont recommend this at all to anyone unless you can bear being handicapped like a slave that you need to ask for permission to play a game you bought

not a bad game but definitely not worth the money game was delayed for 2 years and what do we get 67 minutes in loading screens crashes every 2030 minutes online is not good search for quick jobs can take from 5 to 10 minutes random lags etc get it when it will be with 50% discount or get it from torrent

the story mode is somewhat ok level though the map is fairly large there is not a lot you could have fun in it the online mode well as experienced for a couple minute some random axxhole just jump out and killed me the rest 30min would be simply the fight between me and the cracy dude not fun at all

httpsiimgurcom7msfevygif pretty graphics shallow gameplay like most video game industry developers rockstar only cares about selling copies if you expected rockstar to do something new or improve upon the series you should save your money and pretend the franchise ended with grand theft auto san andreas samp still has a healthy community and is much more fun than anything gta 5 has to offer i believe the next generation of open world games will likely come from community driven projects similar to altis life or darkrp this is the last time i will put my money towards the gta franchise

you wanna know why i dont recommend this game the online community is garbage they are bottom of the barrel trash you cant level up to save your life because no one is doing missions the ones doing the heists cant even do the heist right i literally just quit the game because we had the whole first mission of the prison break secured all the vagos dead plane up in the air and some how someone mystically died they want to restart we do within the first 5 min we lost again and again and again ive lost more money trying to do the set ups then the heist is actually worth best part is all the high level players think they are king they love to make fun of everyone lower then them when they lose the mission for you example just played a hesit final i get on the bus to go into the prison because i am the prisoner before we even get to more the  being the prison guard blows up my car for funsies as he calls it we lose the heist we restart we do everything right right before we leave the prison i hop into the truck as driver because i dont trust him to drive he glitches and throws me out of the car i say are you serious he starts running me over telling me to get in all the while i have another person bming saying that im bing when i have a right to because that is just blaitent disrespect the whole community is garbage all they want to do is run around in their armored cars killing people saying they are soooooooo much better then everyone else i cant even gain lvls anymore because no one can do any of the heist missions correctly there are no normal game missions like deathmatch or even missions there are just heists run by people who dont know how to play the game i have to repeat the same mission 15 times to even get to the end where we might have a chance at success story mode fantastic i love grand theft auto it has been one of my favorite series since i was a kid but the online needs a purge it needs to be stricken bare it is complete garbage 110 wouldnt play the online 1010 for story im tired of not being able to play a game that i love because others cant learn to play
not recommended
i love the game but theres no point paying the ridiculous full price for a game thats barely any different to how it was on the ps3xbox360 online is still broken with frequent errors and dropping of sessions something i wouldve hoped theyd have fixed for a steam release if you want this just for the superb single player id pick it up anywhere else at a cheaper price as its still the same

bans for fov mods still havent banned all the hackers who actually ruin the online experience but i dont care the online experience was never a shining ray anyways start online at level one with like 1000 bucks start doing missions missions are too difficult and pay too little but now you have some cash you may mention heists but they programmed those to make you gain as little money as possible once you keep grinding for cash and have enough money to buy a car too low level to upgrade it once you start grinding for rp 4 weeks of your life wasted for a car modification in a video game everything is over expensive and requires a level to unlock it all because they decided to add in game purchases aka cancer they have made almost 4 billion in sales now and they still try and shove shark cards down our throats plus everyone is s try and offer some one a ride in your car they whip out a shotgun and blow your head off fly over some one in a little unarmed cessna they whip out the homing launcher and shoot you down ive been playing online since it came out and i still have no idea why i guess it is a bit more fun once you spend a year and a half grinding to level 120 singleplayers alright though

if you are playing for the gun play i can not recommend this game it takes a step back from gta 4 cover system making cover really only good against an ai against a person that has played enough if you use the cover system they already know where your head is going to come out of cover if its not out already to kill you in gta4 you could come out top of cover go left and right and if it was standing cover even crouch and come out left and right so now in a gun fight you have only one spot he comes out of cover instead of the 35 you had to pick from in gra4 to try to get the win in a gun fight also no crouch was a big fail that is almost game breaking in my opinion so any depth that was in the gun play of gta4 was lost in 5 leaving the story and other thing that were fun but since we are playing a gun game here with that part of it lacking cant give it a thumbs up again everything else was better than gta4 and moving in the right direciton

gta ivs multiplayer was more fun gta vs multiplayer consists of grinding the same boring contact missions over and over to make money to buy guns and cars to what exactly grind more free roam isnt really free roam instead its basically a second lobby for the contact missions where you are constantly getting killed by scripters and higher levels unless you constantly play in passive mode theyve removed the custom free roam settings that made gta iv so dope in director mode singleplayer only you can turn cops off but multiplayer cops are always on limiting the experience to less than gta ivs multiplayer also i miss going bowling

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

this game has great optimization judging by the minimum system stats i could easily run this at around 40 fps on medium settings now this would definetly be a recommending review that is if they didnt have such an  antipiracy system i can totally see why they would be heavy on the system seeing that gta iv was pirated like crazy and this was a huge sucess i spent around 3 hours waiting for this to download not including going to school and sleeping i got home the next day and tried to log on to my social club account which i used on my ps3 copy to find out that i didnt remember my password i did remember it but i completely forgot that i needed a capital letter so i made a new account and it asked for my code since this new account wasnt linked to my ps3 copy of gta v i had to use my other one so i thought no biggy i will just figure out my other password so i eventually found out that i was missing the capital and tried to log on this steam account is already linked to a different social club account please log in with that social club account instead thats what the launcher told me i was denied access to a game that i own because i forgot i needed a capital letter in my name i eventually found out that i could change my email on my rockstar account so i did and it unlinked the game to my ps3 copy and guess what my sister made the ps3 account using her email my sister doesnt live in this household luckily she visits around every week but i have to get her password to her email address just to play this game i spent 50 minutes sitting in the launcher menu trying to figure out what was wrong and another 15 hours trying to fix it i spent 10 hours and 20 minutes trying to figure this out and wait for this 60 gb game to get the message this steam account is already linked to a different social club account please log in with that social club account instead i only have 19 gbs on my hardrive thanks rockstar edit so now i have that account linked to my ps3 account guess what same thing

hmmm where to start first off i had super high expectations being the only version i knew anything about was the pc the graphics were well above average and game play not too shabby single player story line was enough to keep me attached to it multiplayeris where it starts to get bad gameplay concept for this is good but the demand for graphics plus all the people plus hackers very unstable gaming but that can be over looked for the fact you can friends only play where the game lost me is a lack of variety in missions and limited hiests i mean only 5 heists seriously and then when they came out with the latest addition of like 4 cars and like 3 flying vehicles and 1 new gun and celibrated it i was donethats not how you do it rockstar you guys made hella money off this game alone stop being lazy new heists new guns unique cars if someone has to play 25 hours to make a few million give them a reason to until the effort makes it look like rs cares about entertaining the adhd of gamers i wont reccomend this game

can no longer say 1010 id call it more 610 due to the huge amount of time spent in loadscreens massive leap forward compared to what gta iv was this game looks amazing on max settings if your pc can take it its all been very well polished not sure it was worth the 2 year wait thats still bllst online mode and heists are alot of fun edit found 1 giant con finally the game is so poorly optimized in how you join other games matches or instances you are constantly flung into loadscreen hell they are incredibly long and often will begin loading into one lobby only after a minute or two it says its full so you enter a new load screen to go back to where you were then before you can act enter another loadscreen to try and find another instance etc etc etc loadscreeen hell it happens often that you will spend an average of 2 or 3 minutes suffering through loadscreens sometimes longer

for the time being this game is riddled with online and after the lastest patch 128 offline bugs which have been present since the release of gtaonline for xbox360 and ps3 which was an absolute nightmare upon release this is extremely dissapointing as the game for the past few months has been flucuating between okay to good to terrible performance ingame both fps and ping after patches have been released some fixed problems for users and other users getting performance hits for no good reason these patches seem to be implemented mostly to fix online bugs and the problem of modders in lobbies easily exploiting the game when they should be introducing an anticheat or had an anticheat implemented to begin with rockstar surely you didnt lack the hindsight to see that if the game was indeed moddable first mod for pc was released in a week then it would open up a massive range of expoits especially with the online portion of the game being p2p its bad to see such a large company with a huge amount of income from gta v hype up this game to be an amazing massive seamless online gaming experience but in reality the online portion is just as vunerable as gta ivs in which you guys did little to nothing about cheaters this game soon enough with be as moddable as gta iv is only difference is gta online is a hell of alot more popular with a hell of alot more potential this port was developed alongside the console versions from the beginning and after 3 delays of the game for pc countless online issues across consoles various fixes its starting to seem like this game was an unfinished product to begin with and were slowly getting the online experience that we bought into

let me first put this into perspective the game itself is extremely good and i would recommend buying this game on xbox one360 or ps3ps4 do not buy the pc port of this game until they do some serious patching because every single time i tried to play either story mode and gta online the game would cause my pc to crash and go bsod i have the latest drivers installed on my pc my specs are more than enough to run gta v and yet every time i try to play the game it crashes and i get a bsod message ive tried lowering my graphic settings running it in windowed mode using compatability mode running the game as an administrator and yet it still crashes and i get the bsod i went to rockstar to see if i could get some help only to find out that others are experiencing the same thing they are also having their games crash and lead to a bsod its one thing if a game freezes and crashes but it is another thing when the game takes my whole computer down with it this isnt just a game breaking bug but a possible computerbreaking one this guy combatdurable in the rockstar comments section stated perfectly how i felt because this game is causing my entire system to crash and could possibly end up damaging my pc if i continued so i had no other choice but to ask for a refund my honest opinion is that you should hold off on purchasing gta v for the pc until rockstar patches all of these issues because there is seriously a problem here if gta v is causing myself and other peoples systems to crash and go bsod

for a game that has been delay 5 months and released 18 months from the initial release having any bugs is utterly unaceptable upon launching my game the social club launcher crashes with no error codes ive tried every fix that rockstar and fans have put out but all to no avail when this game did initially work for 3 hours i must admit that it was a fantastic port
not recommended
wait until they fix the numerous online issues crashes server dcs instability loading screen connection issues fantastic game and amazing to play with friends but cant honestly recommend this game if your looking for the multiplayer experience if your looking to this game for its single player experience however go right ahead but bear in mind the numerous problems that the online experience currently has

ive seen some horible launches but this takes the cake im actually impressed how well this crashes my system trying to exit the game crashes computer but forcing it to quit through task manager just asks me if i want to retry playing the game in safe mode online character creation is well broken too occasionally the game will let me into what i think might be the main menu but that dosent always work itself out i dunno overall im really dissapointed i wasnt expecting the game to be good at launch but i simply wasnt prepared for this disaster i really hope this gets fixed soon for refrence my computer has a x4 750k and an xfx r9 290 edit occasionally i was able to actually boot into the game however i was not able to load anything beyond the minimum settings in dx10 and it averaged 45 fps with the new update it refuses to load correctly constantly jumping the landing page and always attempting to load into story mode this just makes me sad edit 24192015 game now runs but the framerate is sub60 fps all settings on normal at dx10

gta v was my most craved game of 2015 every delay even further made me want it more and ensured me rockstar was going to give us a fullyoptimised product here yeah this game works for a lot of people hence the dominant recommended reviews but for me no this game crashes all the flippin time im running an r9 290 i5 w 16gb ram im above rec specs and this game crashes like there is no tomorrow even after its 2 updates i dont have all of the graphic settings turned on and many of them are lower than the highest setting available and itll still crash like crazy sometimes it crashes after 10 min of play sometimes 1 hr sometimes driving sometimes walking sometimes in a mission sometimes just standing there i have found however that the lower the graphical settings are the less the game crashes but man the lowest settings look almost worse than the ps3360 version of the game i dont have a $1200 computer to deal with that its just not worth it please rockstar patch this puppy up i cant enjoy it dont ditch us

id like to write an honest and thorough review for this game but i cant why you may ask simple because it doesnt ing work i bought the game at 8am this morning and let it install throughout the day not only did i have to wait until almost 5pm for the ly huge filesize to finish downloading 59gb but after going through the process of setting up a rockstar social club account which you need in order to play the game because there is no offline mode  the offline mode in game still requires an internet connection and activating the game it just loaded and loaded and loaded and loaded and loaded see where im going with this tldr typical aaa  game never loads not worth the $60 spent on it
not recommended
the following is a personal preference read the following with a open mine or fck off i have played all versions of the game and the changes between xbox 360ps3 graphics and xbox oneps4 are massive to be honest it is a waste of money if you own a console copy the graphical changes between current gen console gta and pc is next to nothing on top of that they have promised many additions on all platforms but it is still not here they promise additions many additions and hold back as proof of this look at the heist dlc it was delayed for a bit over 1 year even the pc version has taken blows like this it was meant to be released in late 2014 here we are in 2015 and it was still getting delayed unless rockstar lifts their game i think this game is in some ways the worst gta to be released if i had to rate it i must say as much as i am level headed between pc and console id say console is like a 8510 and pc in its current state is like 3510 my opinion may change with rockstars progress but i am unsure if this is going to change my opinion

good game however you have to take into account why you are buying the game if you are buying it for the story its worth it and the story mode is acctually a lot of fun and decent in length if you are buying for the online mode you will find your self very tempted to purchase in game $$$ using shark cards to buy cool things in a game about stealing and heists it relies far to much on microtransactions heist dont payout enough for them to be worth it so many players will end up buying shark cards r should not continue this process due to this i cannot recomend the game

an awesome online game thats nearly impossible to play thanks to weird issues and a very poorly thought out interface id love to talk about how much fun this game is not only do you have the staples of deathmatch races and missions but you can even relax and watch some tv with friends play darts and pool even play some golf there is just so much to do that its hard to imagine getting bored infuriated however is really easy to imagine you have this amazing game waiting for you only to constantly run into weird impossible to fix issues online is finicky and does not give you any clues as to whats wrong want to join a friend it might not connect but instead of telling you itll throw you into a random server it might tell you the servers are down even though theyre not theres no easy way to start a job or a mission with friends you either join someone elses job randomly or if lucky actually get to invite your friends theres no easy way to get this all set up you get to fight with this while dealing with long load and connection times only to find out it didnt work or put you into the exact wrong game or even better it throws you right back into single player without asking on top of that the mouse drag even with raw input selected issue make aiming incredibly difficult if rockstar can fix these glaring issues this will easily be one of the top pc games when you can get the actual game to run its a great experience until then though get ready to spend an infuriating 45 minutes at minimum to play with your friends and god help you if anything and i mean anything causes you to be disconnected from them including but not limited too joining a mission that only had one slot available being forced to join a game instead of forming your own they load faster than you the list goes on if youre planning on buying this in april i would wait until may or at least look at patch notes

gta v is one of the most profound and mindnumbing examples on how you can take the most recognized video game franchise on earth and turn it into a cancerous cluster of hideously moronic design decisions that have no equal in terms of the sheer stupidity and broken functionality that currently plagues this depressingly messedup title as the faults with this game are numerous and require their own individual attention i am simply going to list them one by one while providing proof of their existence  1 online functionality putting aside the current average load times of getting into the online game being 163 minutes for people with toptier gaming pcs that have ssds the state of the gta servers as of right now are a horrendous mess as anyone that played the game on console or even watched videos of others doing so for more than 3 hours can attest to the problems from there has not been dealt with for the pc version httppuushhh3wz5519c93b0ajpg disconnect after network failure after server outage after connection issues after timeouts after server overloads rockstar continues their behavior of not knowing how to host proper servers even after delaying the pc release a multiple amount of times for dozens of month and perhaps more importantly giving out fat bonuses to people who preorder weeks before release to massively help them gain a better idea of the incoming traffic they still fail horrendously to offer any kind of steady service when the online aspect of the game is concerned it is however made much worse by how the multiplayer is constructed around clumsy lobby systems with zero flexibility go through the effort of creating a heist and wait for players to fill the lobby play 95% of the mission and have someone disconnect mission cancelled lobby closed down create a new game manually and wait for players to rejoin to start at square 1 again let someone join midgame to replace him pause the heist itself and give the disconnected player time to rejoin create an ai partner to take his place nope back to the 2 minute loading screens with you over and over and over again httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2fdjoz1beom  2 system functionality memory leaks physics glitches that causes crashes black screens fps spikes bluescreens graphicdriver crashes and cases of just plain bad optimization where laptops would have the game run off their integrated gpus first before checking for any external ones gta v has them all and it is a very depressing fact to face after all those months upon months of waiting for the game to be and i quote as polished as possible httppuushhk5h57923dc6b7dpng httpswwwredditcomrgrandtheftautov_pccomments32od4rgta5_crashes_mega_thread  3 cheaters on both offline and online the number of cheaters have been routinely going up in terms of being spotted by the community and they show little to no signs of slowing down httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkaeue0sfvbi due to the manner that rockstar handles hackers by slowly detecting them and putting them in queue to only be in games with other cheaters they can cause massive amounts of havoc most of which end up being beyond repair and going outside the control of rockstar themselves due to the dynamic nature of the game the most acute symptom of this very serious issue is the server stability for where these hackers roam as seen in the video the hacker spammed ufos and caused insane amounts of lag to happen due to flooding the host with collission data vehicle spawns and teleports while also flooding other players with money drops the much more chronic results are perhaps more damaging as money can trade hands in so many ways be it being dropped on the street have someone get mugged spend it on cars & other items and resellgive them away the list goes on and most of these things rockstar cant reliably keep record of and this isnt even where the issues stop either there are also other more logistical things to keep track of for example they have to dedicate a number of their servers to actually put hackers on meaning they are redirecting company resources to let hackers roam around instead of focusing these efforts on contributing to a more positive experience for the nonoffending players even then hackers are allowed to purchase new accounts and keep on creating massive amounts of havoc as punishment is lingering at best and there are no immediate countermeasures to deal with these situations  4 system design if you were to ask me what personally disgusts me the most about this game it has to be without the shadow of a doubt the bad sport system how does it work it bans you from the regular multiplayer including private sessions with your friends separating you from everyone else if you blow up other players cars leave online games early or simply get reports sounds like a necessary thing on paper with gta being what it is but oh the cancer that can be find if you observe it more closely here are 4 scenarios where the game will punish you and cut out your ability to play online a defend yourself from someone trying to driveby you in an armored kuruma by blowing them up with a grenade youre a bad sport b stay afk in a tank or some other heavy vehicle and have people drive under you with their own cars and explode as a result youre a bad sport c have your game crash during a multiplayer session due to gta vs notorious memory leak youre a bad sport d own a couple of guys in fair deathmatches or similar over the thousands of hours you spent in gta v and have them spam reports against you with no legitimacy to them whatsoever youre a bad sport  i thought this was a beta thing at first perhaps a myth or something exclusively on the console but one faithful day when i just finished a mission and was outside my apartment fiddling with my settings a guy rams into my car from behind using an armored kuruma and proceeds to try and mow me down with an smg i pull out a sticky bomb slap it onto his windshield drive away and proceed to detonate the bomb as he continues trying to kill me boom he dies along with his armored kuruma which is nigh impossible to only kill the players within using guns and you have been flagged as a badsport bye bye playing with friends bye bye actual multiplayer as everyone who is a bad sport just waits their time out or jumps onto another accountplays offline bye bye gta online as a whole the first ban youll get will be 23 days 4872 hours that cannot be reduced used to be possible by getting awards etc not anymore next one will be weeks then months then years and they will be that much more easy to get after your first one the timer can be extended if you continue being a bad sport by blowing up peoples cars and it will very frequently get stuck as well sometimes even resetting if you do certain jobs missions or activities it is one of the most hated functions of gta v online and rockstar does absolutely nothing about it httppuushhh6w198d8bc19dfpng it is even a walking contradiction itself as the design goal of it is to dissuade people from doing and i quote here doing unsanctioned mayhem the problem here is that there is no system or detection method inplace to even remotely determine if a certain mayhem was sanctioned or not in the game now rockstar have also gone out of their way to disable their anticheat just ugh rip  gta v

unlike a lot of my fellow gamers i was lucky enought to access the game without a lot of problems just creating a new session on windows for it to work because of the bug concerning letters used in your windows name but i still cant really play it and why is that  because as a lot of other gamers ive got terrible stuttering problems fact is that when the game is launched it seems to have a memory leak problem for a lot of us that makes your ram usage build up and up and upuntil its full and your hard drive has to take up the role of virtual ram so there you are 100% hdd usage cpu and gpu are just useless cause theyre waiting for their partners ram and hdd to do the job wich they cant do because the game is metaphorically a boat leaking from all other the place for them and that they have to get the water off to let the cpu and gpu drive the boat as they want and they cant do that cause the game keep sending damn tsunamis in their faces and dont even give them buckets to throw the water off short story  the game is a great game it has a lot of improval other console versions and it is very very enjoyable but as it is today you have 12 chance for it not to work  as it can not even launch or give you this stuttering problem that ruins the game after a couple of minutes it is then not a lottery ticket worth 60 for me and i totally regret spending that much money for preload and playing quickly for a game that doesnt seems to be really tested for problems like those ones sorry rockstar i believed you could do it and rise up to the challenge of releasing a game on pc without that many problems you couldnt dont know if you tried hard enought or if its just not possible considering the platform

total  dont waste your money 426 after some beta drivers and a patch the game runs as it should have from launch campaign is the same as it was on consoles dont expect anything new online is at the very least laggy and filled with some unfortunate problems 510  game the payout for heists are terrible everyone is driving around in unkillable cars with money they hacked into the game the guns that got made for the pc release require no skill cost nothing and are available to anyone with a pulse the heist setup missions are harder than the actual heists and pay jack  everyone in the community is a butthurt 12yr old who will either pursue you unendingly for denting their car or a brain dead  that cant figure out the simplest of instructions the car physics are  the handing is  good luck flying a helicopter the graphics are pretty much the only good thing about this game but if you put anything above low the game will just crash for no reason what so ever tons of people are still experienceing fps problems all of which is related to a memory leak in the game delayed for  coding just to release with even ier coding dont even get me started on the loading they should just rename the game grand loading simulator takes 5 minutes to load when you start load missions you join oh everyone left or crashed load back into the world oh wait we are putting you in a new world load some more load into a heist someone in the crew dies load some more just to load back into the heist to die some more and load some more on and ing on the crew system barely works at all good luck playing with your friends instead youll just get stuck in instancesheistsmissions with hacking russians that speak no english and still cant play the game worth a single  i regret buying this game on the pc it was fun on the console maybe its due to the fact that this is my second go around but i have maybe had 35 hours of fun and the rest has been forcing myself to play a broken crappy pcport so i can justify to myself that i spent $60 on it

let me start with the harsh part harsh but most important in the current state now little over 30 hours after release this game is far away from 60 worth why besides all the problems people had even to install the game granted some people are to be blamed for their rigs but the majority of the problems lies on rockstar there are so many other things that should not even have been issues want to play online with your friends forget about it most of the time youre in a session alone you can try and join other sessions but 9 out of 10 times youll just be put in a new empty session is it a port problem no some times you do get into a session with other people and its great well right until you try to do a job with your friends then the errors begin friends cant join you quit the job  aaaaand youre back in an empty session and you cannot join your friends session does a restart of the game help nope ok so you paid 60 to play this game with your friends cause come on nobody pays that kind amount for a single player game these days anyway granted the single player campaign is about 2530 hours long what else is there to do well you can do quick jobs with complete strangers oh and did i mention they had this online issue on xbox one as well and has had it since release and it is still not fixed yes that is correct so lets us sum it up you paid 60 for an online game that doesnt work very well online which has the same online issues on other platforms that never got fixed will it get fixed for pc at least probably not hopefully but dont expect it so in this current state i advice you not to buy this and if you do and you get frustrated about the fact that online play doesnt really work then i suggest you get the refund steam are offering you know when steam starts offering refunds then its bad  really bad just dont buy it in current state its a waste of your money

if you ever thought about playing this online  you could also throw your money out of the window the game has insane loading times even with ssd and high end connection it lags like everybody plays on a 56k modem and also theres tons of bad gameplay elements running such like having armored vehicles while the owner of that car can shoot trough armored glasses u cannot shoot him in example having cheats aka controller aimbots also helps you to just 1 shot whatever by just abusing the aim system then you got tons of inputlag in the game  its not fluid or any close to be well done there are also alot of bugs crashes and you might get thrown into a online lobby wich throws you out within a second makes you sit in a loadingscreen 50 years again at the end this game earns a 100% frustration and should gain the worst developement award after how many years delay of the pc version  that game also if you ever have thought about playing with your friends  forget that aswell theres always some1 to be kicked from the servers the server itself kicks all players off it and the result once again is a ing god damn loading screen

warning do not buy this game unless you have a high end pc i have a decent gaming laptop  i run assetto corsa maxed out i play new games on high to ultra settings but in gtav i have to downgrade to low and mid my gameplay looks like san andreas also if you already played the ps3360ps4xb1 version dont waste your time or money cons this game is not well optimized it requires a very very strong pc to run it to have enjoyable gameplay unless you have a very very very good pc dont expect too even get past ps3 visuals and forget about 60fp at 1080 this game also requires you to have a rockstar socialclub account and if you dont already know rs socialclub is horrible you get locked out for hours and even days if you dont typed your password correctly a few times this is the same game as for the consoles so as stated before if you already played this on you console dont bother with this pro its gta and it has 1st person view

total  dont waste your money 426 after some beta drivers and a patch the game runs as it should have from launch campaign is the same as it was on consoles dont expect anything new online is at the very least laggy and filled with some unfortunate problems 510  game the payout for heists are terrible everyone is driving around in unkillable cars with money they hacked into the game the guns that got made for the pc release require no skill cost nothing and are available to anyone with a pulse the heist setup missions are harder than the actual heists and pay jack  everyone in the community is a butthurt 12yr old who will either pursue you unendingly for denting their car or a brain dead  that cant figure out the simplest of instructions the car physics are  the handing is  good luck flying a helicopter the graphics are pretty much the only good thing about this game but if you put anything above low the game will just crash for no reason what so ever tons of people are still experienceing fps problems all of which is related to a memory leak in the game delayed for  coding just to release with even ier coding dont even get me started on the loading they should just rename the game grand loading simulator takes 5 minutes to load when you start load missions you join oh everyone left or crashed load back into the world oh wait we are putting you in a new world load some more load into a heist someone in the crew dies load some more just to load back into the heist to die some more and load some more on and ing on the crew system barely works at all good luck playing with your friends instead youll just get stuck in instancesheistsmissions with hacking russians that speak no english and still cant play the game worth a single  i regret buying this game on the pc it was fun on the console maybe its due to the fact that this is my second go around but i have maybe had 35 hours of fun and the rest has been forcing myself to play a broken crappy pcport so i can justify to myself that i spent $60 on it

not worth the hassle not worth full price and most certainly not worth 2 years of additional delay gtav online is a broken poorly planned piece of spaghetti garbage there are no server broswers instead you have to automatically load lobbies so you can load job setups so yo can load missions then something disconnects happens a lot and you get the load a new world so you can load a lew setup so you can load anew lobby then this missions takes 4 minutes to complete and you get to spend 10 more minutes loading this game is not well balanced it is illconceived the netcode is absolutely horrible unless you like playing with russians with 400 ping there is nothing good about it i cant believe i got fooled into buying it twice once on ps3 when there was no online and now on pc where online is just bad avoid this pos game the best part about the online experience is discover why videogames have introduced over the last 20 years abstract and advanced concepts such as parties lobbies server browsers and notloadingtheentiregamejusttopickagamemode seriously this game sucks its amazing that it sucks so much considering the unbelievable amount of work put into its world there are so many things to see in los santos so many places npcs its a beautiful world but playing in it is an absolute drag if you want gameplay look elsewhere the is the most beautiful gta ever made its also the worse avoid

my gtav pc story went to game stop bought gta 5 pc card downloaded it for the next 18 hours sometimes the game stops downloading if afk so i set my pc never to turn off 3 days later it finishes downloading i load up the game it dosent load properly so i restart it it works about 2 weeks later i see a mod trainer mod i go to download it i do it a few days later i get banned 1010 would not reccomend  you rockstar were not peasants who bend over every time you screw us please stop being bad people ps fix your ing eula

now i know everyone believes gta 5 is amazing and it is but the fact that using mods and then going online without uninstalling them gets you banned is ing  i recommend just not buying it on the pc because the whole ing point of pc gaming is too mod the  out of games sp and sure i get it you know some mods are able to work online thats rockstars ing problem but of course they dont actually care theyre money s just another sell out business and they dont ing care about their gaming community they dont so torrent the game  actually buying it for the third ing time

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

you can get banned for using a single player mod lets be honest the fps fov is utter s%^t why people think having 70 fov or less is a good thing on pc is a total idget i cant play like that as well as others in most games i need 100 fov or even higher at times cough chivalry cough not only that but what if people want to use a trainer like they have in gta iv ban from online there too even if its for singleplayer tom foolery hey rockstar heres a idea why not make online and singleplayer 2 different f%$king games that way people can mod the singleplayer without having to worry about online god knows how this is gonna go when a lspdfr gets released for online or how about this make some sort of program that tracks all the mods you have for singleplayer and instead of just flat out banning you strip them away from online then when you exit the game or go back to singleplayer it gives you them back i hope they fix this its ridiculous banning everyone because they play singleplayer with mods but dont use them online is stupid screw online singleplayer is where its at mo fos

something you should know about this before buying on some system it will crash every few hours most likely when you are finishing long sp mission or online heist online you will be connected to servers that has highest ping on races you will be connected to host that has so bad connection that other cars will literary spawn right in front of you or other players lag so badly that even when you got close to them they will lag ram you to the other side on the map but it wont affect them by any way what so ever then there are modded vehicles lets just compress it to this you cant win races because you dont have modded vehicle you cant have modded vehicle because you havent won races i do not recommend this game to others

gtaonlineonly review ingame time 65h loadingscreentime  time in lobby waiting for other players atleast 25 of those 65hs loading times are just as on console a terrible joke it takes forever for the game to start up and finally put you into a lobby when doing heists you wait for 15 minutes for 3 other people that arent some sub lv10  that jump right into heists without even knowing the game properly just so you get stuck in infinite loading screens right after you found some mates and started or finished the heist the weaponwheel is so incredibly terrible you use tab to open the weaponwheel your move your mouse into the direction of the gun you want if you dont currently aim you use your mousewheel to scroll through weapons if you do aim and use mousewheel up then it zooms in whenever you want to quickly get out a weapon then zoom right in the weaponwheel opens up again and everything just gets confusing af and gets you killed community is split into 2 factions the people that came over from consoles & know how to play  pc gamers that quickly learn and scrub that has the iq of someone with down syndrome you do a heist tell people a million times what to do and yet they completely ignore the chat and all the stuff you told them as if theyre mentally  they die  you off and make you want to punch them through your monitor i lost count on how many times i tried communicating with people via the text chat and nobody seemed to care about answering showing me that they saw it or we its like they dont know where the chat key is oh and speaking about heists rockstar showed heistfootage in the trailer of gta v months before it was released in 2013 now they released heists more than 2 years later and what did they do with the time they had  they created heists that get you into infinite loading screens at the first heist google up fleeca heist garage bug or something similar controls for airplaneshelicopters bikes & boats are terrible you use wasd  numpad 456 & 8  your mouse to look around and shoot like freaking really do i look like i have 3 hands or what  only upsides of the pc version are way better graphics than on ps3xbox360 especially the reflection detail is doing a great job higher frames  resolution of course aswell i strongly recommend playing this game with an xbox360 gamepad everything else makes you frustrate like crazy

cant play the game as rockstar support takes several days to fix things will update when or if fixed so dont have a broken game or else you scoundrel who spent 60 dollars on a game and dares to complain when it doesnt work update 1 week later and rockstar still havent even addressed my problem yet next day update ive had my problem escalated to the correct department either fix my problem or give me a refund rockstar update3 months later no response from rockstar so i guess im never playing this game and i cant get a refund because having the launcher open counts as time spent on the game so i have 13 hours trying to fix it and now my 60 dollars is in rockstars pocket and i will never play the game or get that money back
not recommended
unfortunately first person view and the ability to fly around as a bird are not enough of a reason to pay $60 for a new version of a game i already have on the ps3 and most certainly not enough of a reason to buy it on pc since rockstar hates modders 45 minutes in and already want a refund dont even care to try online

i regret my purchase grand theft auto v is a masterpiece by its self but that doesnt set it apart from its less than mediocre port and the many bugs that litter the online section of the game which i play exclusively you would think that after 2 years the game would be refined to its maximum state but that is not the case i dont think ive played a heist yet than hasnt caused my game to crash andor blotched the mission but the online bugs arent the only thing holding it back i run a gtx 980 and a i7 4790k and cant maintain 60 fps outside of cities it needs more work yes the game that has been in development for 5 years  2 years supported after release is still a bit of a mess not recommended

waited 2 years to buy this game on pc at full release price just to have it crash on me randomly the game looks good but not good enough to justify a full price tag after the game being 2 years old the game runs well until it crashes out of nowhere if youve waited 2 years to buy this game on pc id wait a little longer for the price to drop as it is not currently worth it

there are serious problems with this game for laptops that have an intel cpu and an amd gpu even if your pc easily exceeds requirements the first few weeks the game wouldnt even start and at this moment frame rates are so bad the game isnt playable rockstar support is slow and inadequate to help the issue is consider the game a waste of money at this moment for people who have a similar setup i feel really cheated out of 60 euros

i went through total hell with this game and it would take me several hours to write down exactly what went wrong and what i had to do in order to fix the problem so i am going to give you the short version needless to say i just like so many of us have waited about 2 years to play this game rather than buy it for either my ps4 or xbox one i chose to do the time and wait until this supposedly much superior version of gtav is to be released for the pc i waited and waited and waited until the day had finally come for me to experience the gta universe in 4k resolution at 60fps naturally i predownloaded it which forced me to look at the v icon sitting on my desktop just daring me to double clikc it when the moment of truth arrived i double clicked the taunting v icon and was rewarded with a disc error message asking me to uninstall and reinstall it i did which took roughly 35 hours when i was finished all i had to do was log in to my goodfornothing rockstar socialclub of which i care absolutely nothing about and happily begin playing gta v hehe man was i in for an unfortunate chain of events that would take me 24 hours plus some to find a solution to my dilema not to my surprise there were an extaordinary ammount of other unfortunate souls experiencing the same problem according to all of the forums that i had read the last day and a half there are several different problems that are keeping gta v from either installing or launching and to each one of those several different problems there are several different individual solutions to fix the problems understanding what was ahead of me and what i had to do was judt mind numbing i was going to have to try each different fix and hope that one of them fixed the problem i was having i got right to it some fixes i tries several different times like making a different admin account for windows live i tried that one i actually made 8 different seperate windows live accounts all of which i had to create a new email for talk about time consuming and boring i also tried several file changeups file rearrangements and other different fixes that people said would work finally aftera whole day of sitting at my computer and waisting time i had determined that i wouldnt stand for anymore of the bull $hit that i was putting myself through i grabbed my keys walked out of my house slamming every door behind me got in my car and raced like a demon to my local best buy to purchase a physical copy of gta v it didnt help when the young girl said that they were out of it and i had to drive 9 miles to the next closest best buy after i had the box in my hand i quicky returned home and opened the box only to realise that the game was 7 discs seven disks there goes another couple of hours or it seemed like it anyways finally when the game finished i logged into rockstar socialclub with a new account to be safe and crossed my fingers it worked but now i had to wait another hour for rockstar to upload a new update when all is said and done my solution of buying a hard copy worked gta v is absolutely gorgeous at 4k resolution and 60fps only when it decides to work though i have a highend system that well exceeds the suggested specs majorly well exceeds my system runs perfect i 3dmark my rig every other day and manualy defrag each hard drive every 2 days i download all of my music movies and anything other than games on my laptop i have never had a problem with any game running at ultra or super high specs never gta v is the first game that has given me any type of trouble believe me when the game is running it is beautiful and unlike anything i have ever experienced in a game the are no glitches and it runs smooth as butter like i said this is when it runs gta v decides to crash on me a lot it usually happens right after i complete a mission when the game trys to auto save boom like clock work usually ill play a mission it will crash i will replay the mission it will save i will play the next mission and it will crash again its a pattern as for everything else the controls are tight almost too tight in 1st person driving mode super sensative the wind blows and you are moving across 3 lanes of traffic 1st person feels like it is right at home its comparable to good fps titles the graphics are amazing and anyone with the capabilities of 4k res at 60fps is gonna be in video game heaven everything looks so real especially the lighting and shadow effects the pier at night is extraordinary with its glowing neon boardwalk i am sure that when all of the bugs are fixed that this game will be well worth $60 but right now unless you are a complete diehard gta fan and do not care about hassles bugs and glitches as long as you get to play gta v even a little bit i wouldnt but it i am a diehard gta fan so to me it was worth it ill continue to play through the crashes and eventuall it will hopefully be fixed thank god steam refunded me my money back though if that didnt happen i would have been extremely heated i do understand what it is like now to spend money on a game and the game not working at all i will no longer judge others who gripe and get really mad when something like that happens it was an awful experience that i hope never happens again you just feel so damn cheated and jipped like no one cares that you spent your hard earned cash for nothing its a feeling i will never forget

this game is a bad game yes this game is a really really bad game this game has alot of cons and a handful of pros now i know i dont have many hours on this game but ive spent most of my time on this game either sitting on a loading screen or getting frustruated that i can barely join my friends game and maybe get lucky if i dont disconnect within 5 minutes of game play now im just going to get to the point of this review and why i will never play this game again cons hackers 10 minute loading screens unstable servers that disconnect you within 5 minutes of gameplay game breaking glitches more modders low frames while driving when i have a computer than can max this game out easily cant join the session that my friends or crew members are in pros lots of cool content and guns cool gameplay mechanics the game is really good when i get a lobby without any hackers which has never happened and probably wont happen ever i can hardly play with my crew because of unstable server connections which leads me to the conclusion that this game is a really really really bad game and it is also why i refuse to play this game until rockstar fixes their servers for the modders they will never disappear because they like to ruin the game for other people just so that they can have fun

the game itself would be great but since it crashes with a d3d initialization error between after 2 minutes up to a couple hours of gameplay i cannot really enjoy it heck it managed to freeze my entire system multiple times edit after 10 more hours of bugfixing i just got the same canned response from rockstar games support as 2 weeks ago i am now trying to get a refund via steam as the game is not working for thousands of players and r doesnt even have the decency to acknowledge the bug another edit after more than two months i gave the game another chance it ran stable for about 20 minutes and still the same old crash broken beyond repair and still only getting canned responses from rockstar

online play consists of hours watching a freakin loading screen even though the game is installed on an ssd then multiple hours looking at your apartment if you own one for some reason because hey you need to see the outside of your apartment then youll try to join a matchheistraceetc and be told your targeting is a different mode because thats really important to you not and then itll tell you the session is full because it just wasted your time saying your targeting is different this sends you back to watching another loading screen and if youre lucky the game will crash@@$@$ if you are able to play online youll quickly find your garage is the bain of your existence it will think one of your cars is actually two and overwrite one slot with the same ing car then itll just miraculously forget you spent all your cash on a really expensive car leaving you broke as a joke lulx jokes on you n00b before you say omg its only been out for a week these are issues that have existed since console launch 2 years ago lol awesome game tar trying to go the way of ea and not fix bugs apparently

i was really exicited for the launch of grand theft auto 5 i even preordered it and preloaded it as soon as it was avalible the port was an alright job but the multiplayer is shocking the tools are unintuitive making kicking and invitiing players iincredibly difficult the matchmaking system is flawed and the incredible wait times is horrendous most of the community seem horrible as well with most dropping out during missions and thus requiring a restart if you are wanting to buy this game wait till rockstar finish what the started they had 2 whole years to do something and all it looks like they did was create a new camera angle how impressive

doesnt work seriously rockstar did you even test gtav on any different types of computers the launcher is rediculous and should be built into the actual game itself instead of being a horrible nonfunctional peice of software do i like gtav yes very much its a shame the devs never considered that people have different pc setups the launch of this game was a disaster rockstar has yet to respond to a single post on their site with my same issue and ive pretty much wasted my money on a bricked game potential buyers especially those with dual or amd graphics cards beware

rockstar has horrible support i have waited a day and havent even had a confirmation of them looking at my problem social club is incredibly flawed and if they had just used steamworks instead of forcing thier own matchmaking software on the game maybe we wouldnt have these obsurd connection issues otherwise excellent port story mode works great and its a great game

waste of time and money it asked for my cd key to unlock gta v on social club once unlocked it gave me a gta setup tool once my steam account was linked to social club it asked for my cd key again to unlock it a second time sadly it was already used to unlock it in the first place this is why pc people torrent games good thing i got a refund to this crap

this game has a fov field of view of around 85 in first person of course and this would be acceptable if you were to play the game on a tv at a distance however this is not high enough for most people who play at monitor and are much closer to it while rockstar has yet to offer a solution modders have already brought out mods that fix this problem which would be great the problem is the game is banning people for using these mods even in single player rockstar either needs to fix their anticheat to allow players to use fov mods or they need to update their own fov slider that goes above 85 to around 100110 as well as they must remove the bans they have on people who modded their game for a higher field of view if you want to get the game believe me it is a fantastic game just be warned any type of modification for at least the moment will risk you getting banned this does include single player as well

this game is good while you dont use online part i spent 1 hour with some b1tch with nickname like spartan he killed me 30 times and i couldnt do anything because i only respawned after this i must to relogin and to wait 15 minutes for playing again i like all gta versions bought them but this part is  since this part of gta i havent want to play any games on my computer and i havent want to buy them  rockstar you killed my interest to games for ever

played ps3 version and now pc version i love the game it alot of fun and they put great work in it but the match making system is for  the racing is fun but theres only 1 car in each class worth owning and it takes for ever to get a group you sit in lobbies waiting and waiting for a 1v1 race or you get in a missionhiest and nobody has headsets can you make it to search only people with headsets there is alot lacking in the server set system that is just so slow then it disconnects sends you to gtav then have to reload to back online its annoying fix it

paid 600 euro for a game that barely is playable i got a super beefy pc yet the game crashes hundreds of times  regardless of the grapficinterface settings it can crash in the middle of a big mission when youre trying to save but most commonly when youre trying to start up the game i expected much more then i recieved gameplay is still amazing tho the storyline is really wellwritten voice actors are on point and everything in between is great really amazing game but due to the previously mentioned issues im gonna give it a thumbs down its just too unstable

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

love the game its fun as hell and beautiful they need to work on gta5 online however it has lots of random bugs with connection etc it has a huge effect on heists in particular if 1 of the 4 players loses connection etc the heist fails and you have to restart completely rehost it get players in from the beginning which is ridiculous considering the issues with gta 5 online

the singleplayer is fantastic and everything you would look for to entertain yourself for a long time the only problem is that the game leaves you in a mind  where instead of doing heists and interesting missions you just follow orders from fib clowns whom you had many many chances to just shoot and end it the multiplayer this is where the issues lay might as well call this loading simulator 2015 the matchmaking is absolutely terrible it takes you 20 seconds to join a match which is likely empty as well and then 30 seconds to reload free roam because you are unable to hop from match to match the community is another issue most people are wandering psychopaths just looking to blow your car up for the jollies when attempting to start a heist setup you usually have to wait 5 minutes minimum for players which tend to be low level mute idiots who cant follow orders cant shoot straight cant not hit the ing rotors on the plane ending the heist cant communicate in the slightest the only thing they can do is die and then ragequit which makes playing heists with friends almost mandatory to give you a bit of background last night i spend 8 ing hours looking for decent players who wouldnt die on the series a coke setup this is a personal gripe of mine when you load up the heist lobby why the  cant you turn the  dubstep off its bad enough i have to sit here seeing randoms be mentally disabled when someone anyone finally joins but then i have to listen to crappily thrown together dubshit for 8 hours rockstar you trying to put me into rage induced acoma overall i find the singleplayer quite pleasing but the multiplayer well dont touch that  with a 10 foot pole unless you just plan on ing around this review is primarily only for multiplayer and such it is rated for multiplayer

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

 great game but  move by making it $8000

good game everything youd expect but its broken as  you can connect online half the time and when you do youre in a lobby with a cheater that just teleports you across the map sadly rockstar being an indie studio means they have a lot less resources and money to buy functional servers with the very low price of the game and absence of microtransactions they cant possibly afford competent staff to fix bugs or afford reliable servers until they fix their game thats been out for a ing while dont buy this

im having a activation code error everytime i try to play

sadly i am going to give this a negative review it is so majorly polluted with hackers they ban some for 2 weeks and a bypass hack comes out along with god mode and no you cant go passive to ignore them they will still kill you single player is great and private lobby also but if you have nobody else to play with at any given time and try joining others it gets ruined by more hackers rockstar needs to fix this crap start perma banning idiots

bought this game pre release and i was really looking forward to it turns out i can barely play this 3year old console game on my high end pc as it has horrible memory dump issues among other issues not only that but they pulled some  marketting tactics over the steam summer sales 1010 would recommend spending money elsewhere on a game that actually runs

this game is boring as hell same old heists and  missions now the situation on pc online is that no one even joins the heists or mission so basically in gta v online you join and  around by driving in random places not to mention you get spammed by  prison break heists invitation gta v offline is worse best gta story mode was in gta 3 which really had a story this story mode has no story in it and full of racism and adult content now they have openely added hookers and strippers that show their boobs in the game and you can literally  them worst part is that if you want to enjoy all the features like $10 million plane etc then one thing is guaranteed that you can never make that much money by playing heists especially when no one joins them if you try to use trainers to get money so that you can explore all the features of the game then rockstar bans you for so called cheating how the hell a game who fundamental concept is cheating and crime can ban you for cheating basically they dont want you to enjoy the game the way you want to i am really disappointed with this game i dont recommend anyone to buy it

buy game go through single player cant relate to any of the characters one is a thug and as stereotypically black as you can get another is a complete psychopath the one i guess youre supposed to relate to is a complete dbag everyone in the game is rude to the point you just want to stab a baby the only time anyone is nice to you is when you return someones wallet and 90% of the time its better to just keep it even driving around the city other drivers will hit you curse you out and try to kill you switching between 3 characters all with their own inventory and cars is a pain in the butt the most enjoyable thing to do is steal a plane and cruise around at night where its peaceful and beautiful finish story mode crap ending lets try multiplayer die repeatedly to s 100x levels above you with rocket launchers and chainguns set yourself in passive mode and then die repeatedly to modders who put campfires on you and throw you in the air so you suicide watch as modders duplicate your character 100 times until it crashes the game on you wait another 10 minutes to get back in online mode because even installed on two ssds in raid0 on a system that can play every game on ultra the game is so poorly optimized it takes forever to load and connect get back online and immediately die due to modders have all your ammo and weapons removed and then watch as everyone in the lobby repeatedly explodes wait 5 minutes to join a new lobby repeat the fun of modders destroying your gameplay and rockstar not caring decide to just join a private invite only lobby and try to join peoples heists a 12 year old throws a fit halfway through the heist because he wanted to be on the insurgent gun he leaves youre kicked from the game and wait 10 minutes to get back into a session join another heist and someone gets bored during the opening rp cinematic and youre kicked again and have to wait another 10 minutes join another heist and manage to complete it but at the very end you fail for no reason at all and everyone leaves out of frustration join a crew in hopes of having better people to play with and realize most of them are trolls they just run you over with their car and kill you repeatedly and laugh at you realize that everyones bored of the game and just trolling need 3 dedicated friends to accomplish anything in the game ends with some modder dropping a few million on my head getting me banned 2 weeks for cheating would only recommend if you are a complete sadist and prefer it rough without lube when youre abused

never have i played an open world game this linear honestly the most missplaced money in months they try to give you a sense of decision making but it all really boils down to the exact same thing boring missions that makes it feel like im grinding world of warcraft quests only to get to the good part you get the same feeling as though when youve orderd a pizza and you know the delivery will be here any second and youre absolutly starving youre waiting and waiting but he never comes still youre 100% sure he will and before you know it the game ends not only is the story one of the most linear stories ive played since call of duty mw3 but it is repetetive aswell all of those who have played mobas know the feeling when youre supposed to gather 5 flowers yes these kind of quests sums up this game pretty well actionwise is this game slowphased cutscenes are continuously breaking the immersion and rockstar refuses to let you play through any events at all to give you an example of how things would be you press w for awhile to move to a specific destination where the cutscene is programmed to start explotion your character runs to cover and now youll have to press w for abit longer only to get to the next cutscene they could have done us all a favor and made a movie out of this instead so that i could have watched it for free tossing money down the drain when excpecting a game when really its just a movie that forces you to reach for the keyboard to continue the main thing they can sell this game on is the characters you follow three different characters who are very different from eachother rockstar have obviously tried to make their personalities as interesting as possible as though youd fall in love with one of them and there by also start to like this game i cant really come up with another explenation to why the singleplayer mode was created at all on the upside it has alot of modding capabilities and online mode that i still see some potential in ive been a massive geek of lsrp in samp for a long time and when rp servers will start developing their stuff in gta v and maby even converting their entire establishments to this new clean engine id finaly see a purpose for the 50 i tossed in to this game if youre over 18 and acctualy have experience from the era when games were good id mark this game with a big red do not buy stamp but if youre a kid who just found his way to the gaming scene and finds graphics as the most important aspect of a game then gohead ask your parents to buy it for you

i have encountered more than one game breaking bug that has existed for years on console versions of this game despite many open tickets from countless users rockstar has yet to post a single working solution to the problem on either consoles or pcs this is unacceptable theyve had plenty of time to address this im powerless to hold them accountable the only thing i can do is post a bad review so here it is

its good for old gta fans and i have to admit that i loved san andreas the only downishgt is that rockstar will charge you 60 bucks for a game which might look better than gta iv but is still kinda the same map i like the map but that is definatly not  times as big as san andreas san fiero las venturas and larger parts of the desert are missing advertising with a awsome and new big map is simply wrong the map is awsome youll have a beatuifull la rebuilt and awsome desert and idyllic woodlands but the size is nt that overwhelming hwever its ok customisation gta v offers a lot of customisation options and thats what i truly like exspecially in online multiplayer i have my own house my on fully customisable character and my own collection of tuned and untuned cars awsome storyonlinemissions gta v offers an realy interesting story some awsome missions and a really great new multiplayer its inovative fun and entertaining modsupport there is one big problem in the game mod support since gta v hopped on the dlctrain and is now selling ingame money for real cash therefore makes it kinda hard to get some more money ig rockstar declared war to mod support i cant believe that a company which sold more then 50percent of their copys due to awsome mods like lcfr els apocaliptic car snow mods decided to do everything possiblem against modding not only that recently released patchnotes dont contain any statement to justify their current movements they are even patching the game to the ground people from the console versions might still now the customizable beatuifull sheriff suv you could get as your own car in the online mode you might still remember wearing uniforms and all now that was some awsome time exspecially if you are into any sort of rp editing whatever but nope not with rockstar the suv has been removed as all police cars have been from your garageeven from the policestations  if they are not beeing called out and the uniform has been patched not let me ask you one question why would you force people away from police rp if this is  the main reason for quite a few people to buy your overly expensive and delayed game  the only reason people would quit on trying to mod their own things together if you dont want them to do that  a thing which made gta better then it was and kept its awsomeness up beyond the story and the first days of realease and why is there not a single statement justifying those changes i would be really interested whatever reasons have caused this madness of course this game has been released recently but since it release rockstar has removed features and denied and slowed down mod support so for all people waiting for the next lcfrsafr better wait a bit if not longer

so then was gta v worth the wait im afraid not not only does this look worse on console but the port needs massive work as i cant excuse the fact that may a10 apu runs worse than a ps4 memory wise because of this the game looks like the worse i have in my steam libary im being 100% serious my copy of xiii runs better and looks better than this now then other than that what is there diffrent im afraid not enough to justify the cost if you are running an apu like me because apprently the video card only has 724mb and that is a pile of crap not only that but i cant change the graphical options because im already over the limit why should i buy this game im afraid at this point in time there is none unless you can stand 3d graphics that look like an awful version than wolfenstien you think im making this up im being 100% serious a game from the 1990s looks better than this on the lowest settings it can run and for that and many other stupid idiotic decisions from rockstar i will no longer be giving them another chance on trying to persuade me to buy any of there lazy games again go ahead rockstar prove me wrong improve your port and i will reconsider this review however for the time being because this game looks like a game thats one of the first 3d games invented its a full on no for me if you have an apu dont even think of buying this pile of crap 110 the 1 is for finally being on pc

amazing game the story and characters are great online mode is very fun the problem is that if stutters and crashes very frequently making online missions especially longer ones such as heists impossible to complete not everyone has problems but many many people do and you will find them on every forum that talks about gta 5 ive done everything i can from update drivers to a total malware purge and yes i meet the recommended specs rockstars support team has been neglecting and rockstar doesnt acknowledge that theres a problem on their end i would absolutely not recommend buying this until the crashing issues are patched if you do i pray youre one of the lucky ones

the singleplayer story is great however running into constant double client drm issues being banned for soft modding in singleplayer lack of multiplayer features and rockstar games support being utter  30 days for a total of 5999 is enough for me to downvote this game all together at least for now

i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful
