50 hours into your latest save all is going well only 3 leaders left gandhi caesar and washington you draft an end game plan in your mind you will make friends with gandhi for obvious reasons hes chill then procede to befriend caesar then you will take out washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior he must pay 20 turns later all is going to plan we are now on washingtons doorstep gandhi and caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation all we need to do is eliminate the pesky americans and ith all our military now on american soil this should not take long then after the swift invasion of america we will make a vote for world peace at the un in rome of course with our new found indian and roman brethren it is a sure win but all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start quickly they become louder and louder what is this you think to yourself a false alarm you shrug it off maybe caesae bombing a city state the game pauses gandhi appears on the screen with a sinister grin he shouts war in your face only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight the camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy the capital of your glorious nation you then hear a rumble just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine you realise it is too late you can only watch as the missle closes in as your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people then silence before what had just occurred had sunk in before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears suddenly countless stealth bombers appear seemingly out of no where soon the sky is blackened by planes the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains you faint from the shock of what is unfolding you awake shortly after gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire now with giant death robots making the most of his seemingly never ending turn as gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes whats left of your broken nation all you can do is weep your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn why oh why did you turn of autosave did it really speed your game up was it worth it ghandi is a complete  he acts like your friend but will nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself 1010

my review is mostly related to the single player part and the ai of the game which i both consider to be very relevant in this game first of all with the bnw addon the civ5 game gained new potential especially in lategame the game has become a lot better however civilization 5 still lacks a lot of the strategic component of former installments of civ or alpha centauri one of my alltime favourite games especially without gk and bnw the game is very simplistic and strategically nonchallenging offering few ways to win and few actual decisionmaking this is a shame especially when comparing the game to its predecessors with bnw the strategic component got a lot better allowing many different paths to victory exploring new strategies and finally giving culture an actual purpose and allowing you to win with culture a downside however is that the different civilizations and leaders are poorly balanced for example when playing at the last two difficulties it seem almost impossible to win unless you use specific ai and gameplay exploits this is mostly the case because it is generally not possible to keep up with the rapid technology advance and army production of the ai the ai can do this because it receives massive bonusses and you receive a massive handicap as an effect of the research and construction speed handicap you will very often find yourself in a situation where you cannot build certain wonders in your game even with an ultimately optimised building strategy and a perfect starting position  which is quite frustrating and will limit your selection of feasible strategies in higher difficulties to a small selection  most of which are based on exploiting the overall weak choices the ai makes in wars the ai also often reacts irrational and seems random for example the way it changes from being your best friend to backstabbing you and siding with your enemy in just one turn or when they declare war on you despite the immediate outcome being obviously negative for that civilisation as well as already having another enemy at its neck the options for diplomatic interaction are overall weak my main point of criticism is that the ai is dumb to the point that it can only be seen as challenging by that it produces a lot of military units and advances a lot faster in technology than you this also means that you inevitably have to prepare for often long wars against an ridiculously large stream of enemy units that you might often destroy easily due to the ais weak decisionmaking while attacking often you can only win with perfect start position and by exploiting certain game mechanics and the mentioned lack of ai tactics this is what makes this game of little interest to me a strategy game that offers a lot of different ways to win needs a good ai and not one that acts as militaryunit factory for example games with the difficulty setting at which the ai has the same handicaps as you feel like a ponyride to any halfway experienced player even when there are lots of rivaling civilisations on the map however once you play at higher difficulties the ai plays with the exact some behavior and underlying intelligence but can manage to be ahead of you at all times in matters of creating wonders researching technologies producing culture and army at the king difficulty where you already have penalties i found it possible to win pretty much any game at any starting position with any civilisations or leaders but at the last two difficulties the ai advantage becomes clearly unfair the intelligence of the ai however is still not any better it is apparent that the ai knows what goes on on the entire map and will use this knowledge to its advantage in addition the advantages it receives are not possible to be compensate using smart decisions for example at deity difficulty firaxis basically throws you into a gladiator fight where you play a limbless and slow person you fight against dumb aggressive and cheating brutes that will turn hostile at some point no matter what sounds more fun than it is i found it to be still possible to win at deity but you are will find yourself limited to a very very small set of tactics and choices and even leaders the most likely option to win is militaristically you have to wait for your enemys rare appearance of a weakness at which point you have to attack with your limbless body hitting the enemy gladiator continuously which will feel like cracking a hard nutshell with a rubber spoon until the target slowly turns into a puddinglike consistency you will have to forget all the other tactics and playstyles you might have previously liked to use once you play in that arena you have to stick with what the little thats left being severly crippled in your abilities and fighting against dumb hostile brutes thumbs down for the ai
