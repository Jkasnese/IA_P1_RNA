it doesnt matter how good you are any more you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory you should have one of your several karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware youre being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own your stats are irrelevant now most people arent even aware that the tab key actually has a function in game it doesnt matter if you dont know what eco means fuck team work you have a boom awp in your inventory as long as you have $4750 cash in game youre buying an awp you will mock anyone who decided to give their nova the walnut skin same goes for people who give their famas the doomkitty skin you will only equip stattrak weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on afk players in order to pad the stats so you dont look like a total n00b whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire an exceedingly rare special item disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise wouldve by buying this directly from the market its only your parents money after all besides your birthday is next month and christmaseaster[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you wont have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods you will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon your easy peasy and ninjas in pyjamas stickers totally dont look ridiculous whatsoever you will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in you dont own an ak or an m4 any more you only own weapons with names like xxx og snoop dogg and dubstep warrior you now have all the knowledge required to start playing csgo go forth and procure many skins of great value

im bored and have slow internet might as well make a review i dont even know if this is a review > spends 1 hour writing this > nobody reads > c counterstrike global offensive is a pretty great game  first things first the basic rules in csgo  you have the choice to play five official gamemodes arms race deathmatch demolition casual competitive  summary of gamemodes in arms race the player gets weapons not by the money but by killing people each two kills get you a new weapon at the final stage of the weapon you will get the gold knife kill someone with it and you win  deathmatch yes in deathmatch it is like a warmup or practice mode for me at least in this gamemode you join a server and you just kill everybody you see except your teammates you can get weapons for free there are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points and if you want to use that particular weapon you press g by default the person who gets the most points wins  so next in the list is demolition it is set to be a 5 vs 5 match it also has 20 rounds the first team to get 11 rounds wins and it can even finish with a tie in the first half you play as a set team in the second you play as the other team you cannot buy any weapons but instead you get weapons by killing people just like in arms race money is also not rewarded but this is different lets make a scenario in round 1 you kill an enemy the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round but what if you kill two in one round you still get to advance to the next weapon but you get a bonus grenade for example 2 kills next wep  bonus grenade 3 kills next wep  2 bonus grenades get the pattern yeah  what next oh yeah its casual casual is a 10vs10 game with 15 rounds the first team to get 8 wins wins the match it is split into two subgamemodes bomb defusal iirc and hostage sorry i dont know the exact names in bomb defusal there are two bomb sites a and b the counterterrorists always have the defusal kit equipped even if they didnt buy it the kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds the terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in the bomb iirc has a 45 second timer when defusing  planting the bomb it makes a noise of course the cts are trying to stop them counterterrorists can win in two ways killing all of the ts before they plant the bomb or defusing the bomb for the terrorists its the same killing all of the cts or making the bomb explode so in hostage the roles are switched the terrorists are now the defending side and viceversa as the gamemode says the ts are holding some people hostage and it is up to the cts to get the hostages or kill all of the ts  finally competitive the competitive gamemode is much like the casual gamemode except a few differences  each kill has 2x more money reward than in casual  defusal kits  rescue kits cost money and they dont get equipped automatically for free  its a 5v5  competitive has 30 rounds  each half has 15 rounds and in both halves you get to play as cts and ts  like the demolition gamemode the match can end in a tie  people are much more serious   blyat  so here is my thoughts csgo offers a large variety of gamemodes and you can just see that ive written about all of them phew that took a lot of time anyway csgo is a very entertaining game and each match has a different experience yes csgo can be a bit too serious but it is also a fun game the community is not just a single person you know there are people who dont like you and some dont care but some will make your day better go is a game with a high skill ceiling there is a huge learning curve to go in this game its like chess easy to learn hard to master ive met a huge amount of my friends in csgo and i still talk to them some i dont yeah theyll be grumpy at times but they inspire me there are some bugs in this game but not too gamebreaking just a few small ones dont expect to enjoy this game if you have  internet ping matters i hope you know that csgo is available for consoles too in fact valve talked about having crossplatform multiplayer but that would be unfair for the console players cause they have a delay in controls i am 100% sure that valve completely abandoned global offensive in the console the competitive scene is pretty huge too and a tournament even reached more than a million viewers online and in the tournament itself its only two years old and its already a big game valve may not be the most listening but they try except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to  like the awp they reduced the movement speed while scoping there are also skins in csgo some care about it some dont just a matter of personal preference i think theyre part of why this game is popular the most negative opinion i have though is about the competitive gamemode sure no game is perfect and the real fun is there yeah but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of you know just a few tweaks like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone it is pretty unforgiving for who doesnt know you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times or leaving the game if someone abandons your team you can surrender not permanent bans though the vac valve anticheat system also needs some fixing to be done some cheats arent fully detected so the hacker doesnt get vaced from my experiences i still havent encountered a hacker but thats probably because im a silver some people can be real s so thats my review hoped you like it edit i missed a few points thanks > skareo about the netcode of csgo truth be told it has been really bad for a few weeks now in fact i go up to a guy and spray him but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal take note thats in close quarters no thats not horrible aim in the words of a truly horrible player omfg 64tick sucks volvo pls 128tick eh doesnt really suck just well mixed in global offensive there are a few advantages some on the t side and some on the ct side hm whats it called yeah the perspective take this for an example the left shoulder advantage  httpiimgurcomkvpjgjpg1  heres an explanation the player models hold guns on the right side therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed thewarowl has this video to make advantage of your perspective  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5e8hzqf3cyk  and thats well unfair just like in real life should i see your eyes you will see mine too as i said earlier vac needs some fixing its terrible but again i still havent played with any cheaters so i cant fully review this part yet thanks final conclusion an excellent game theres bugs and glitches but its a fine piece of work go get it if you havent already have it already do well whatre you doing reading this review go play btw csgo has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved thanks valve tldr ayy lmao

i bought this game for the chickens and was not disappointed after exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide i realized their population was growing too large the chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world such as nuclear plants and offices without cafeterias i knew what had to be done i bought a flip knife off of the steam market and called peta i listened to in the arms of an angel in my microsoft professional deluxe gaming chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response so i decided to take matters into my own hands i loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery i cried harder that night than i have ever before the next morning with tears in my eyes i loaded up counterstrike global chicken and i saw a new item waiting in my inventory my flip knife had turned into a flip knife slaughter at that moment i realized what a horrible thing i had done with my hand shaking i navigated my mouse and uninstalled counterstrike global chicken i regret everything i have done i am writing this review to warn you about the chickens and to let you know i have made a full recovery and that i have started my new journey in goat simulator thank you and farewell

csgo is a nearperfect multiplayer shooter unlike the previous versions which were often difficult to get in to this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels it has a large community and a well supported workshop ensuring that this discountpriced game will be around for years to come in short you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster its been around for years and has spawned many imitators the game isnt much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original half life 2 was however valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis is it worth getting if you already own counter strike source yes css was always counter strike shoehorned into the source engine csgo feels far more like a standalone game valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game the best feature must be the competitive play you cannot leave these matches or youll suffer a temporary ban from the feature after 10 wins in this mode youll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level these matches are exciting occasionally scary or frustrating but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game ever there are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join really if i was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice its bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come something that cant be said for the call of duty franchise which is probably its closest rival remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year fragmenting the community plus you can customise your weapon skins in csgo surely thats the most important feature all they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in csgo

must buy if you love fps games this game is all about personal progression since it comes with a high learning curve its not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun its about you that has to learn the game is updated almost once a week with new features and content match making is great when you are playing with friends the real game for people that love to play competitively with a team or just solo there are also casual game modes available for the people that dont like to play competitively such as arms race deathmatch hostage and defusual missions which can be played on casual style or mostly known as public or community servers these modes are great to learn the game and improve your play pros match making  skill levels and ranks play against players of your own skill level  competitive scene with ladders and tournaments  the cs feeling transition from older cs games to csgo isnt that hard  most old maps from cs are in the game  no perks and other unnecessary clutter  great spectator sport easily to understand and interesting to watch  no pay to win model all items are purely cosmetic cons match making 64 tick servers stability could be improved  game could use some optimization here and there  cheaters now and then but thats online gaming for you rip desert eagle as we once knew it if you are looking to improve your aim skills try out these maps httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid243702660 httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid330746573 httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid379868494

counter strike global offensive the remake of the classic cs games and not to our surprise the devs did a good job one of the lovely things about it that of had not been kept i seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently it keeps the mechanics from the classic cs and css and adds a few of its own that the original cs and css games could have done with css weak point was always the graphics the original games were based of the hl1 engine which i am sure all you are aware is reasonably old although its added a new range of updated maps including two operations the most recent being operation bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as dlc and once again valve have decided to take the generous approach to this an example is that if the lobby leader has the operation bravo pass and no one else does everyone can play op bravo good job valve you did it again what was missingwrong with this game has been fixed by valve which is fantastic items have been added you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature although many think its turning into tf2 which is a valid point but valve need there money if you take a look at the price of the game its not exactly the same as cod ew which has a hefty price tag of 40 $60 i think and csgo managed to do fine at 12 which i think is $15 in the us sadly i did not play the original cs i have however obviously seen gameplay and watched friends play it i have played a small amount of css and compared it to csgo which was considerably easy some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games havehad have been completely eradicated from csgo which is brilliant such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games such as the saving mechanic in cs if you die you lose all your weapons they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and youre still alive you simply gain $0 the csgo match making system is an exceptional feature the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank here are all the current ranks available in game httpwwwprohlcomimagesprohlcsgo_ranksjpg many people seem to think that this is like cod you simply rank up from playing the game no this is not true you rank up as your skill improved if you play well for a few weeks and you finally get the gold nova youve been wanting for ages and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly its for the best you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game this is in now way ground breaking its been done by other games before but they have there issues although i have not got round to actually trying out this feature i have been told that it appears to be working considerably well the watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful awp shot or got that 5kill ace i would like to say in this final paragraph of the 250 hours i have played of this game i have seriously enjoyed almost every moment of it sure there are some hackers but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with all the factors about this game are good but as all games go by they have there problems sure if csgo has improved graphics that would be nice and if breathes in heavily valve would add 128 tick match making servers this has caused some annoyance for me in match making if you dont understand whats so bad about 64 tick i suggest you watch this video httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvj6u26ytpif0 anyway i highly suggest you buy this game apart from my small rant at the end and game is fine good game mechanics graphics are sort of good i supposed most of the maps are well balanced there are a few that i suggest you shouldnt play though the game has a small price tag which i am sure will attract you to it even more especially when its on sale at 75% of hope you enjoyed reading my game review of counter strike global offensive and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not i would appreciate it if you left a comment about what you thought about this was is a bad review why was that whats wrong with it

once upon a time on de_inferno there existed a single chicken on a site i must get to my family said the father chicken navagating through all the stained karambits and battlescarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge as the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right he scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next there are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow he sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace i cant believe it i may actually live to see my family on b site fishing in the koi pond awp shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there as he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana who the hell drove a taxi down here says the chicken he makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family they are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov i i i cant belive thiboom a cheeky ct sits in his spawn with an awp as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood please i beg of you these chickens are endangered creatures and risk thier lives to venture through the city just to meet thier family again

at its core global offensivecounter strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken microsoft mouses the emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around it creates an atmosphere that games like battlefield and call of duty hasnt been able to reproduce on the outside counter strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned fps gamer the game is simply tactful its brilliant when youre alive and even when youre dead the game is still fun to watch other players global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one although for casual gamers its probably better to find community servers over valve servers theres a huge market place now for the items in csgo and not only that theres third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these ingame items have created you will also find on twitch csgo is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions if you need any convincing watch a stream watch a competitive match and see for yourself this game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself

maybe the only fps where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill no t perks or kill streaks no autoturrets no air strikes if you want to win in counterstrike you have to learn the maps play smart and have fast reflexes since you work for each and every kill its much more satisfying than other current gen shooters

growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years for the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continues

the spiritual successor to the secret of monkey island titled csgo is one of my personal favourite point and click adventures of all time wether its the engaging puzzles or intricate story this game is always sure to provide hours upon hours of family friendly fun the games premise is that youre either a ct or a countertroublemaker whos job is to stop the ts or troublemakers shenanigans such as graffiti egging houses or the such all these are of course now animated comparative to the simplicity of the secret of monkey island all in all a great game and tons of fun but its kind of a rough port and id reccomend purchase on ps3 810

date of review 9272014 csgo is a competitive team based shooter with highly refined mechanics the good  gunplay is based on skill knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight  all weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time situation or role that they should be used in  movement is fluid and precise and if mastered can give you a competitive advantage  the competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind  competitive isnt the only game mode there are also community servers which host a variety of game types that are fun and interesting  game overall takes skill to do well its not so easy to learn and very difficult to master this makes it pretty addicting when youre trying to improve your skills in the game the bad honestly theres not really anything negative about the game in my opinion but ill just address the common complaints of csgo  csgo is hard seems like every bullet misses when youre aiming right at the guy this is where you would take the time to learn the game but otherwise a common complaint from people  hitreg is messed up i always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit this is just a problem with the default 64 ticks server you can join other servers with 128 tick to get better hitreg anyways its still better than the 10 or 30 tick rate that battlefield and call of duty has though well thats all the good and bad i could think of for csgo ack4orge rating 1010 perfect with the perfect tweaks to the gunplay maps movement and gun balance it refines the already highly refined gameplay of the past counterstrikes thats been out since 1999 making this one of the best competitive teambased firstperson shooters on the market

counterstrike global offensive review by delicioushotschmoes release date august 21 2012 genre firstperson shooter developers valve corporation hidden path entertainment platforms pc ps3 xbox 360 os x linux the review both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire steam library csgo has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly as ive enjoyed over hundreds of hours playing this joyous game from the teamwork player rankings campaigns competitive gameplay music replay value and much more this game is a king amongst most modern multiplayer fps games and still going strong even over just a measly three years just like its predecessors the player assumes the role of either a counterterrorist or a terrorist both with their own unique missions depending on the campaign in general the newly added campaigns deathmatch and arms race is a great exclusive extra if youre just a casual player whereas theres the competitive session for the more experienced intense and determined players out there with every match starting youre brought into freeze time where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal just ready to be bought either with the money youve earned by killing opponents or indeed losing a match respectively still giving the losing team a winning chance while with your team you could stick together as there are power in numbers or go alone to face your opposing enemies i wouldnt talk for every individual player out there as ive seen power in experienced players trust me i have witnessed a russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents all in the same vicinityand yes he was a rageful one indeed i also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments definitely pushing the source engine to its absolute limits but doesnt go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game the gameplay the gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect as you can easily navigate along with the controls are fast and sometimes responsive on the other hand the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious numbered team just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming as it does help much more the original music used is also a big step up as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match each time around from the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is and with an added bonus with the steam music player at its peak in popularity the update with the musical kit useable ingame was a great move as you can listen to classic music as you slaughter your opponents joyfully ive also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the reallife history and origin in a very formal informative and creative way the statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to secondhand pistols when reloading your main gun that takes precious time along with how they flesh out damage with a great controlled accuracy as you can tell this game serves many different ideas strategies preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other and yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple yet fast updates the homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest csgo news such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe or special deal offers on those elusive cases if youre ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins you can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back but my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to bethe community yes a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional but im not talking about those great people im talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunningkruger affect where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players in a much more biased fashion it gets annoying pretty quickly so i would usually block the most revolting swines who do this all in all this game is a big big big recommendation from me and if you think im lying just check topselling games list at the start of the steam page theres a reason why this game is on the high ranking list and thats due to its high and successful popularity

great game that can teach you many things such as 1 the russian language 2 how to be a tough guy that is afraid of nothing behind a screen 3 how to be racist and sexist 4 how to be spoiled as  5 how awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch 6 how to be disappointed in human beings 7 how to socialise in a civilised and calm manner s and last but not least how to be a complete  for no reason at all aside from that if youre willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game it has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible you could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all it is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic harsh and often rude as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose its a good game and i do recommend it as long as youre willing to ignore the admittedly plenty of things that are wrong with this game even if you dont it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilise if you got the balls really selfdeprecation humour

the third game in the critically acclaimed first person shooter series that have shaped the pc gaming industry for years originally a mod for halflife turned into a standalone had a soruce sequel and now global offensive counterstrike 16 has long been one of the most played steam titles seeing as the entire steam platform was created with counterstrike in mind today global offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base something that counterstrike source failed to achieve i was never a hardcore counterstrike fan i always had a buddy or two that were better than me therefore i cant tell you the perspective from a experienced cs player a lot of players were disappointed in counterstrike source because it did change too much of the core mechanics others were disappointed that the game did not change enough global offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way some core 16 players like it and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers of course there are still players who disagre and still value 16 or even css better counterstrike global offensive offers the same team based versus mode where you spawn buy items and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players the maps are never too big and you always spawn in the same area the main objective is to kill all enemy opponents but theres also the classic objective of planting the bomb or saving the hostages  depending on the map once you die you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well same goes for most of the classic weapons awp m4a4 ak47 etc beside the classic competetive team vs team theres arms race and demolition arms race is a adoption of the classic gun game game mode from the original counterstrike where the players are in a team deathmatch and each kill will level up your weapon to the better demolition is a cross between arms race and classic plant the bombobjective just on smaller maps there are also timespecific events such as operation payback and bravo where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators just like any other modern valve title this game comes with all the steam features including steam workshop where people can share their created weapon skins and maps just like dota 2 the items does not change the gameplay in any way only cosmetic stuff there is also weapon drops in game that players can get with different range of rarities  to bring the team fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive as well as casual multiplayeronly firstperson shooter there is plenty of room yet to learn this game even if it seems hard at first

this game has a feature were you can turn $250 into 10 then you bet that 10 skin you just got on csgo lounge to try and make your money back but then lose the bet outraged you decide to buy another key hoping that this will make up your money by pulling a knife only to find that you got another 10 skin hundreds of dollars later finally you think you have learnt your lesson to not buy keys and decide to buy a skin straight off the market for full price being still resonably new to the game you click the unknown link unaware of what is going on you later realise that you have been scammed thats right that skin you bought more expensive then the game and all 10 skins you have purchased for $250 are gone outraged once again you start this process all over this time knowing the chances of you pulling a knife and making your money back are extremely slim but you feel that this will be the one lol nope get rekt son 69 skin

really good game very simple yet complex at the same time for first time players do not let the games recoil mechanics scare you away it will take some time to get used to but once you do it is a great game pros [] great community compared to some other games frequent updates tradable stuff source engine means that players from gmod cs 16source etc wont or at least shouldnt have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics very competitive at higher levels tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps weapon skins multiple modes for casual or competitive and more high fps on almost any pc great optimization cons [] skins can be expensive or worthless skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it recoil is not very easy to get used to no aiming down sights for new people calm down vets cooldowns can be handed out unfairly low graphic qualitydetail compared to other games it is source calm down mp only if you are reading this you most likely have internet at home there is a bots only option hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels callouts are not that easy to learn for beginners overall get it if it is on sale csgo is an even better deal the recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots perfect for traders casual fps players competitive fps players and workshop content creators rating 9510

when i reviewed counterstrike source a few years ago i called it things like immortal and the definitive multiplayer fps the awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble  i really like the balance and precise feel of the awp the rest of the weapons feel really good  there is much more variety here we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team this is one of the areas where csgo shines and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of global offensive the game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating this is done similar to the matchmaking in dota 2 while not perfect i find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate  it is rarely a cakewalk always be wary of the player community for this game  this community has some sick and twisted people tons of trolls smack talkers hack accusers mic spammers and cry babies lol fortunately you can mute players and if you are so inclined can vote them off the game  nice trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well one of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it its insane but some items sell for over $400 usd csgo is on the rise reaching peaks near 300000 players there are huge tournaments played and with each passing month the game sees positive growth i think its safe to say this is the new definitive multiplayer fps 910

i bought this game for the chickens and was not disappointed after exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide i realized their population was growing too large the chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world such as nuclear plants and offices without cafeterias i knew what had to be done i bought a flip knife off of the steam market and called peta i listened to in the arms of an angel in my microsoft professional deluxe gaming chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response so i decided to take matters into my own hands i loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery i cried harder that night than i have ever before the next morning with tears in my eyes i loaded up counterstrike global chicken and i saw a new item waiting in my inventory my flip knife had turned into a flip knife slaughter at that moment i realized what a horrible thing i had done with my hand shaking i navigated my mouse and uninstalled counterstrike global chicken i regret everything i have done i am writing this review to warn you about the chickens and to let you know i have made a full recovery and that i have started my new journey in goat simulator thank you and farewell

years of playing overrated aaa shooting games with lens flares blood on the corners of your vision and blue everything have since taken me away from the good old primative day of filling in the shoes of generic swat teams fighting generic terrorists of which both groups lack the ability to look down the sights of all but a few weapons then i found counterstrike global offensive being set eight years after the events of the previous game there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time for example the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they cant walk on their own moreover both the terrorists and counterterrorists adpoted newfound language ability finally as weve evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color the world of source has evolved drasticly in its graphics in the eightyear gap between games among the new things introduced are atomwide ledges birds of superavian strength and a modernized russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful fun to play with and polite players of the motherland finally counter strike global offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant aaa title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post2008 economy bravo ive only played a bit of it but i will reward this game with a 910 for its advanced chicken ai and the hyperrealistic sounds they make when you caress them with knifes in a fashion akin to spreading butter

so ive been playing this game for long enough that it deserves an honest review after playing a lot of tf2 i bought csgo and it was a relatively smooth transition for me due to my tf2 experience csgo easily became my favorite game to play i originally got ranked at silver 4 and started my climb from there over the course of roughly a year ive made plenty of friends and learned a lot about the game ill separate this into two groups below the actual game csgo is a game that for me bridges the gap between a competitive game and a game i can play all day just to have fun with csgos matchmaking it is quite easy to get into a 5v5 competitive game with people of equal skill as you matchmaking is a great way to start playing competitive csgo but it is not ideal if you want to improve if you want to take csgo more seriously you have to use 3rd party services such as faceit cevo or esea where you will face players that have a higher skill level than in matchmakingnot really faceit faceit is the entrylevel service at least in north america so it has a lot of newer players unfortunately valves matchmaking system is flawed and has smurfs in low ranks and hackers in high ranks so most people that want to improve or play seriously tend to use 3rd party services also csgo has community servers just like any other source game these community servers run different mods and feature special communitymade gamemodes such as kz bhop minigames retakes awp only scoutzknives and many others these various gamemeodes supply me with hours of casual fun with my friends when i just feel like relaxing tradingskins trading has effected csgo both positively and negatively with the addition of weapon skins into the game csgo grew rapidly csgo trading brought a lot of tf2 traders over to csgo and started an ingame economy similar to tf2 also skin betting on csgolounge was added betting skins on professional matches lets you put skins on your favorite teams to cheer them on to victory the thing is that many people take betting way too seriouslydeath threats to players ddosing matches etc etc csgolounge betting has had way more negative impacts on the game than positive in my opinion i personally try to stay away from trading because it is honestly too stressful for me and i have no patience thats all i have to say about csgo right now i would recommend csgo to everybody that plays any type of shooter game a mere $15 has given me nearly 2000 hours of enjoyment and it will continue to supply more fun for me for a long time

it has been nearly 6 months since my review so i felt it was time to update my review with my current thoughts csgo is a very good game for its simplicity the game is your standard fps no im not saying its the same as a free to play first person shooter but im talking about its base platform its a first person shooter that is strongly built around search and destroy though by entering the casual scene you can join servers for zombie zombie escape and many other custom types of game modes counterstrike global offensive is not your average fps like call of duty you will have a hard time if you think you can join the game and have accuracy when moving ffs p90 once change you will need to make when switching to csgo is to stop when shooting counterstrike global offensive has a skin system that if you are a gambler then i feel sorry for your wallet skins can be earned by playing matches and once the game ends you have a chance at skins skins from cases will not drop at the end of games these can only be received via market or cases cases also drop sometimes after games if you receive a case you can spend a few dollars to open to it the case spins as it shows the guns and the line will eventually stop on a gun skin that is the gun skin you will receive if you are lucky you will get a knife that can be valued at a very high price depending on the knife an alternative to cases and free drops is the market which can be access via steam search counterstrike global offensive section to via all gun skins gun skins are purely cosmetics and provide no advantages at all counter strike global offensive has three play styles casual match making esports players looking for fun with friends without dedication to 6090 minute games or players who like fun modes likes zombie are considered casual players match making is where are new player should start if counterstrike is a new game to the player this allows the users to get a general feel of the game get put into a skill group after 10 games and eventually learn the maps and calls match making is the place to start even if you plan to get into esports eventually match making is considered the 64 tick servers which you will hear people cry about a lot but dont worry about it too much once you get the basics down you can make your way over to faceit cevo or esea for competitive 124 tick servers and if your good enough jumping into the esports scene i dont suggest esea for players without experience because esea is where a lot of pros and very skilled players go once you think you are ready for esports then form a team with friends or make your way over to cevo forums reddit ect to form a team and start practicing this will take time and dedication to prefect but if you have what it takes youll get there lets get to the final review shall we my numbers are actually very high as posted i never give 1010 unless the game is near perfect gameplay 810 graphics 710 customizable 710 community 610 pros  can customize guns with skins  offers enough gameplay for any type of fps gamer  ingame voice chat  has a fairly large esports scene  64 tick for lower end computersinternet users  124 tick server for esports and some casual servers  large pro scene followers cons  toxic players this isnt all the time but is often enough to say there are a bunch  smurfs users who are at a higher skill level and buy a second account to play with lower levels only reason this is a con is because it may be the reason for your deranking in mm if that matters to you  hackers now this isnt a game with a million hackers but the game goes on sale so often that hacker accounts are bought at cheap in mass bulks

the game is great for everyone calm polite and wonderful people in any tactical shooter i not encountered such a large number of really smart capable lively yet substantive discussion of people particularly worthy of attention should be paid to the russians who dominated in the field of communication in different languages russian friends always help me and uplift so im happy with my purchase also pay attention to the other side of the coin negligible but it is tiny disgust of course im talking about western colleagues who are often very rude and noisy broken crackling microphones did not improve reception of voice messages in my headphones fortunately the russians were always cheerful and entertaining atmosphere with cheerful jokes making a person feel that has not lost one hour at the computer to fill time counterstrike global offensive so if youre calm kind and wonderful man then this game is simply for you

that type of game which could relate to sweet old times of 90s when games were both challenging and simple enough to offer thousands of hours of gametime and still not being completely satiated csgo puts the cs title back on top of the competetive games and is a rightful king with undefeated throne for a long long time the skillcap of this game ranges from a total casual player to a hardcore pro and cannot be described be words how many factors differentiate a pro from a noob this is the true and only fps online game to play in 2014 onwards

its surely the best cs so far if you can overlook the fact that competitive matchmaking ranks mean nearly nothing as well as if you can deal with being kicked and consequentially put in matchmaking cooldown by a team of four people you can also invest few thousands of dollars to buy fancy weapons a good game in the end but only if you play it with friends edit 31 may 2015 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv54i480dw23g

pros  skins you love them  stickers some are pretty  competitive matches they can make you 1337  life time support and updates confirmed operations tournamnts and other future contents  reasonable price minus low discount rates for those want another copy  cheapest steam trading cards on steam market  still a classic fps game in terms of gameplay  source engine is not power hungry and thus the game is widely accessible for lots of players regardless of their computer setups this is one of the important factors to be a popular game cons  skins you cant have all because rarity monies life issues et cetera  stickers some are ugly  competitive matches they can rekt your mind  it is somewhat hard to find and make a correct teabag position to desecrate fallen foes and allies due to ragdoll physics being client sided you often see teabaggers teabagging side by dead bodies not exactly on the bodies teabaggagement must be well practiced with rich malintent and delicacy in order to execute and demonstrate a successful teabaggary to variety of audiences  you cant kill hostages anymore unlike in previous counterstrike games  you miss the arctic avengers and terrorists in the green jackets  multigpu setups sli or cf can potentially cause stuttering issues and even some fps drop  awp needed nerf 3312015 update  stattrak swap tool 3312015 update  our money magically disappears from time to time  time goes too fast  addiction final remarks valve  recommended

wow just wow smurfs jerks and hackers do not play this game competetive if you want to have fun  unless fun to you is getting aggravated being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game if you wish to gain a good rank join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money as for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competetive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you you then learned nothing  that makes it a team game i guess that way you can gain team points per rounds win and that is all  kill  death ratio doesnt matter anymore you are as good or as crap as your team is level up with your freinds or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as silver hell good luck getting out of that because it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit dont know what they are doing againt players who purchased a secondary account and posess the seemingly pro skills you do not when youre wanting to learn and get better at competetive gameplay youll just end up getting killed by them your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss becuse you cannot abandon a match without receiving a cooldown time an you will learn nothing these higly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called smurfs they are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own dks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better all the while smufrs are calling you names aggravating you and causing team moral to drop soon your whole team is yelling at you and practially forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing do yourself a favor and dont pay for mental anguish glhf good luck have fun which this game is neither update 1 yes a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is one part i agree with pete the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5 as in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward no one plays comp to purposely loose unless youre trolling or want to derank your account but why face it loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game that way when you pull together as a team utilize your grenades well pay attention to positioning and aim you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two players alive only then it could be made into a monster d good luck and try to have fun update 2 thanks for all the responses everyone the rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word is bonkers d i actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better its just something ive gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the css division of a multigaming clan back in those days one other thing recently occurred to me while playing csgo is that hours played and kill  death ratio should also come into factor for instance when i started out in csgo i was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of nova2 to master guardian ranks ive quickly received my silver master elite rank which i went onto advance into the mid nova range solo queing and just general messing around once the game was an inevitable loss i have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range i keep performing in the mid range of the score board also but its by choice because ive came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back when im asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team i just cant help but be frustrated when i do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank glhf but most importantly have fun because thats up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken

this newest iteration of the series that singlehandedly sparked global interest in competitive gaming leaves little to be desired while its beginnings were bumpy the developers have listened to the community and are still listening regularly making the game more enjoyable and beginnerspectatorfriendly while still maintaining the integrity of the competitiveness of the game i have high hopes that counter strike will be seeing a comeback in popularity if you enjoy competitive gameplay and bettering yourself against greater opponents you should have no doubts when choosing to buy this game it took me over 500 hours of gameplay to get to a skill level that i feel content with i am currently the secondhighest matchmaking rank thanks to global offensives ranking system even a lone player can have satisfying matches in the matchmaking system and grow in skill on their own yes the occasional blips happen where youre put with unreliable teammates or put against unreal opponents but these are only opportunities to better yourself and learn what you can do as a player to increase your odds when you do decide to buy counter strike global offensive i encourage you to put your all into learning about the game and bettering yourself research what you can do to train your aim what you can do to train your recoil control and watch pro players to learn about game sense for a game in which you often times find yourself waging the same battles at the same chokepoints it is remarkable how every battle can be just as tense as the first one you ever participated in tldr the skill cap to this game is ridiculous if you like competition you should pick it up

please read before voting this down i cannot recommend it because this game destroys people its a good game but at a terrible cost no im not some antigaming freak i love games but truth said this is a great game but it will kill you inside matchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team when its easy and you wreck havoc its too easy boring unsatisfying if its challenging and hard or youre loosing you keep worrying about your stats skill and rank you are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry either at yourself or the rest of your teamthat other happens more often if you live in europe this game will only make you racist you will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you or refusing to communicate with you maybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually dont care but once you try competetive you look at casual with disgust the better you get the more hateful towards other players you will be you will not remember how bad you used to be you will hate all the noobs skrubs and casuals you will judge people by their skins weapons of choice and headshot ratio everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater where is the fun in all this i ask you can be proud of yourself when you win or survive in an action where you were meant to die but each and every accomplishment youll get will make you crave for more and at one point you wont feel much from winning but you will feel a lot from loosing

dont play csgo if you cant tolerate cheaters racism hatred amongst players even your own teammates and under average servers focusing on the quality of servers my experience has been a 510 satisfaction with them even though my connection is less than 50 ping with minimal packet loss choke and var i have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a full clip now you might say im just bad but ive been playing this game for almost 2 monthsyes thats more than 1400 hours and the games physics are like my third hand by now this is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad youre better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as esea that have decent servers and more often than not cooperative teammates moreover the competitive servers are full of edgy underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own regardless of your skill there is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you cant communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round nevertheless thats bound to happen in any game but its been on the rise on csgo servers since its debut in august 2012 however if you can ignore all of which ive told you so far and youre fond of shooters different from call of duty and battlefield then this game is for you

i grew up on the series love and hate but it always had some magic and made me come back when i got the opportunity to play the csgo closed beta it was amazing top notch stuff guns had a great feel back then no stupid stickers or skins no failed updates even the final product released a year ago was good since the introducing of the skins performance went to the drain bear in mind the source engine is 10 years old now stability is a word of a past and the cod effect among newcomers is at an alltime high this is not even remotely satisfying if you find 16 or css dear dont swap otherwise you will live to regret it youll become a twisted shadow of your former self incapable of gaming on that proper level ever again when you go back out of frustration the number of cheaters and the way the supportdev team does not care about this product  makes me want to vomit welcome to community tested payed beta 71014 update if your behinds hurt i feel sorry for you focus on getting them random headshots we all get but never admit and no i do not mean the ones that kill us but the ones that we frag mid air mid run which should not even happen but yes you call that skill cause it hurts the ego

i really want to recommend this game its a more immersive shooter than any of the call of duty series and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates when the game goes well its buckets of fun unfortunately i cannot recommend this game to newcomers there are many reasons for this first of all unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesserplayed game modes so anything but casualcompetitive youre going to die a lot and then you wait you watch your uncooperative anonymous russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion if you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head literally tracing the bullet into their cranium only to see that it doesnt register the hit due to the substandard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers andor your west country internet connection thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation if your internet connection is not the problem you may try using esea or faceit to play your competitive matches with so you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers or faff about on faceit waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round after a few bad experiences ive decided that faceit isnt worth the hassle playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers but mainly these things called smurfs put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account then make secondthirdfourth accounts to play against easier opponents its that simple yet its infuriating and gamedestroying for us lower ranked players and when you discover this in a competitive game your only choices are to stay there and endure it gradually losing your sanity or take a competitive ban if youre lucky enough to have decent friends they may just kick you from the game sparing you of either choice having played almost 3 solid weeks worth of the game in total i have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain but we still play together for the social side this is when i can recommend the game when youve already played a lot of csgo and have many friends that also play the game if youre new and have less patience than a special forces marksman youre going to hate this game i hope that if you decide to play this game you can take my advice with a pinch of salt as i am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment however if you too go ape you only have yourself to blame also look out for skin collecting ive been caught by it it saps a lot of your money and is literally an addiction not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine one thats ultimately utterly pointless

over 600 hours on csgo over 13 years playing cs in general in older versions of cs if you are high skilled you can easily take down 5 low skilled players in this version you are lucky to get onto the 3rd guy game is all about luck not skill based like all previous versions of the game ranked up to dmg with over 200 wins in competetive and i can say this game should be released as a 5 person coop you should only play comp when you have 4 other friends who you know wont troll you regardless of their skill level its better to have that than random teammates the hit reg in this game is absolutely nothing compared to previous versions due to the low bandwidth allocated to the gaming servers setup by valve the skin system is nothing but a huge money grabbing scheme which no doubt has earnt a huge amount more than the game sales alone as with all games you can trade in this one is full of scammers constantly daily trying to scam your high value items from you procede with extreme caution when making trades with anyone you dont know this game promotes gambling to under 18s with the skin drop system costing each skin a certain price with a possible return on investment gambling sites are regulated and usually offer around 85% return on your gambling in the long run i believe there is no regulation of this system and theres plenty of 12yr old kids out there throwing away hundreds into this system alot of reviews have complained about cheaters this isnt such a bad problem nowa days as the overwatch system has taken over vac in the competetive section of the game blatent cheaters are caught and banned for 1 year quite quickly and the players that support and judge in this system are to thank overall the game its self has a great system but just isnt being used to its full potential allocate more time and money please valve rating vs previous versions 310 rating vs other fps games 810 community rating 310 price rating 310 even on sale this should be f2p with a subscription to comp games with vip benefits

ive held this view of csgo for quite some time but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts ive been playing cs for many many years  starting in the early 2000s through to present day this time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages enjoying leveling my character in wc3 mods smashing heads in deathmatch surfing backwards longjumping bhopping played in quals for wcg competed in cevo and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments ive enjoyed cs from 11 to 16 cz css and also csgo no this does not make me a better player than you and no this does not mean i know everything it simply means that i have spent a lot of time playing different titles of counterstrike have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases there are a handful of things that really upset me with csgo and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after i have first played the game these issues i consider to be gamebreaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play i enjoy cs because there is a skill curve if you want to be the best at the game you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent  this was certainly true in all other cs games i have played but not csgo csgo feels like it is a game of luck and chance as the game stands it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or mm is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game hitboxes are not lagcompensated to follow the model of a player when jumping hitboxes are not lagcompensated to follow the model of a player when crouching hitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb aimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lagcompensated if you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick server this is how most events will play out you see an enemy jump you shoot the enemy and get no hits you see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle you shoot thin air blood appears and you get a headshot kill you see an enemy standing there you shoot his chest you get no hit and then he crouches instantly you see an enemy standing there you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot because he was crouching on the server you see an enemy shoot first die and get no hits watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof you are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb you crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times slowly one by one you get no hits and die all of these aspects of the game i consider extremely gamebreaking the fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves yeah that has happened to me on a number of occasions just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed in its current state the game rewards people for not aiming  aka good players in the game need only aim at the ground run and shoot and theyll likely get a headshot because as long as you dont aim at the model that you see there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit the only one of these bugs that existed in counterstrike source pre2010 ob update was the hitboxes on the planting animation an example of a bug that i do not consider gamebreaking but extremely frustrating is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player for some reason after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this a feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch that is a huge disappointment people standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them but the players screen will be completely black this was an unintentional metachange when trying to fix oneway smokes and this new issue has existed for months now the game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them throw a smoke down wait until it starts to fade teammate resmokes  rinse repeat and run down the timer retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who cant capitalise on the blindcriple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible what a horrible meta change why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago 3d sound is nonexistent in csgo it is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind this game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny i find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems i see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable itd be nice if people were able to draw the devs attention to these issues and press for a resolution

intro so i gave a thought for long time about what im going to write down on this review since its one of my favourite games on steam gameplay rating so far i can tell that the gameplay really makes fun especially the gungame  deathmatch mode and the normal casual stuff developers definetly achieved to create a varied and half way balanced game elements in this fps game they still do some updates and make some changes by and then just to appear it more interesting  from the point of technical aspects they succed so far  at least in my opinion   because all different weapons can be used for certain situation so there arent many weapons which are superior to others in addition you can balance this by teamwork and strategic actions yes this game is not only about skill its more relying on teamwork  which is also an interesting fact about this game because high skill doesnt mean anything to this game competetive or not  for me there are only two sides of this game  competetive and non competetive for the non competetive part i can give a recommendation  because it bonds a lot of fun and variation for players  in contrast for the competetive part  unfortunatly i cant give a recommendation  you sure ask why the reason is the community itself its poisoned with pathetic low selfesteem people who create smurf accounts in order to hack and ruin the game and as if its not enough they also insult for no reason  they probably do it to strenghten their selfesteem or maybe they need mental help i dont know  somehow or other its really bad almost every match i only read on the chat  look on my main account im insert here high rank  so if this is the case why are they even owning a second account then and making hacks appear so obvious i really dont know and before people come to me and to label me as a low player my highest rank so far was legendary eagle but i dont care about such stuff it just ruins my mood to encounter obvious frauds who also try to insult you via mic or chat just because they dont have got any balls in real life thats why it is so pathetic in addition some random players in your team also do some mistakes on purpose to ruin your day more i mean i play this game to get rid of my stress and all i get in return is only more stress i wouldnt even care if i would lose all the time when i could be sure that they arent hacking or insulting each other like 10 years old kids its also a sad fact that people think big of them by hacking and cant even speak a single word in english like if they are some uneducated people or anything  i will still play this game probably because i still have faith in humanity but so far i only got disappointed to cut a long story short recommendation for non competetive games  yes recommendation for competetive matches no the decision is still up to you

counterstrike is a good game that is past its time the recent addition of weapon skins as prize drops does not improve it as much as it cheapens the overall experience as much fun as ive had playing counterstrike over the years i now feel that new games such as insurgency improve upon the formula and offer a similar but richer experience

no just no i love this game its really good but im giving it a thumbs down not just is the matchmaking system broken and the community is full of russians and 10 year olds there are countless cheater and smurfers oh you wanted to play a game without constant unbalance and wallhacking jerks well youre in the wrong place the community is toxic wanting to kick you because you decide to save or make one single mistake when you ask to get kicked for having to go or whatnot nobody gives a  and youre doomed with your ban make one small mistake like accidentically flicking your mouse and boom kicked the smurfers are stealing kills and ruining the game everytime i play with one im just planting the bomb while he gets aces and if im lucky i get to kill one player per second round or so when theres a hacker on my team and i insist to kick him my teammates give two  and wont kick him for the sake of winning also vac and overwatch ing sucks i see hackers everyday and vac takes it sweet  time and lets them ruin the game for as many players as possible before they get banned on which they create a new account to continue cheating dont even let me begin with knives ing $300 for a knife i do agree in the skins looking cool and all that but seriously why not spend that money on upgrading your computer so you can admire your knives in better quality and the case unboxing is ridiculous i cannot count how many negevs i have gotten from spending $50 on cases on top of that the matchmaking always puts me with 12 year olds im sick of kids saying fokk yau bish in the worst accent possible the workshop is also horrible theres nothing but awps aks and m4s most skins doesnt even have a purple variant and i honestly dont see why there are 6 covert awps and 0 covert mac10s overall great gameplay nice graphics and performace interesting game modes toxic community constant smurfers & hackers unstable matchmaking ridiculous anticheat system 410 im going back to tf2 at least people are mature there and hacking is pointless

when i first got this game i thought it was going to be an amazing anime rpg i turned on the game and i was so excited for whatever weird reason it wouldnt let me customize my character whatever i thought and joined a server thinking maybe it would show up when i joined the server no character customization was to be found nor a tutorial nor was naruto pikachu or ash i then decided i would ask the helpful community unfortunately for me i was globally offended when i asked people where naruto was people immediately told me to kill myself over the mic this drove me into a deep depression i couldnt watch dragon ball z or seinfeld again d 6910 would not cut myself from the suicide messages again

in my opinion this game is still very young and undeveloped and all the hate against russians is stupid i mean im not one to talk here i hate them sometimes aswell i realised something when i was playing one day the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game where rank is more importand than having fun how valve changed cs for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing cs 16 or css back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the servers where flooded with ads i really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with now people only care about how big your rank is and how expensive your skins are where are the good old times to me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustnt recommend it for players from cs 16 or css sure there are different mods but people mostly play competitive and try to force their rank down your throat

i bought this game with high hopes and regards from the commmunity yes i may only have 8 hours into this game but that doesnt mean i can not give my opinion community i bought this game on a whim i heard from everybody about how good it is so i decided to give it a try my first game i had to listen to some guy yell at me because i did not know what i was doing i quickly just brushed it off and went to another lobby after the game i encountered the same exact thing the community complains about how outsiders look at the game and that is because the community drives them away dont get me wrong there is the occasional nice guygirl that will help new people but they are few and far between do not even get me started on the cash grab that they call crates and weapon skins gameplay  the game has a steep learning curve which i enjoyed at first but then the errors of the game became a little more clear there were obvious hitbox issues when i played which of course people will say is due to skill and the shot registration just felt sub par for a game held on such a high pedestal gamemodes  the gamemodes are simplistic and easy to grasp onto it took me a round or two to understand the objective i have no complaints about the gamemodes price  yes i understand thast this game was just $15 but you can not defend a game just because you didnt pay full price that is like if somebody goes out to eat and they have a gift card and then all of the sudden the food isnt as good as they usually make it because he is paying less there is no justifiable reason verdict  i gave this game a chance i would say that 8 hours is plenty long enough to come up with an opinion i never go home and think to myself lets go play some counter strike if i do play it is because my friends pester me about it i can see where people can enjoy the game but it is just not the game for me

i love all counterstirkes this one is pretty good personaly there are so many mechanical flaws that desrupt the whole game all together this game can become rage inducing to certain extents one notable flaw is the poor lag compensation and certain match making glitches for competitive mode for the past 2 weeks this game has been brutal with high pings on every single server i join im getting banned for weeks just for having a poweroutage some teamates accidentally either walk infront of you fireing a weapon a few times or walking into a he grenade and you get a bankick for their own fault i enjoy this game at very few times but not enough to be worth what it is i regret buying this game

an intense storydriven game written by the community brought down by glaring flaws the plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs hack wars commence scams are carried out and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible as one of the many players of this war you must choose your allegiances properly will you simply be another casual and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance race sex etc will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment unfortunately your character is outnumbered and outgunned he must be a hyperactive drug addict as he can run around at speeds that would make a ferrari blush with nearinstant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life he can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill god rather than the other humans shooting back at him fortunately your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy of course a lot of times much higherskilled players posing as lowtier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies these people are called smurfs they function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking of course there are also hackers some are possible to beat others are not they have added advantages such as xray vision computerized aiming and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds have fun with that the soundtrack is poor as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack dlc which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7 this is a very shameful business practice and one has to wonder why ea gets fluff for this but not valve the graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original xbox and lifeless environments this is said to make the game competitively playable but everyone knows good video games like call of duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision the optimization is rather poor as well on my stateoftheart 2011 laptop loaded with an intel hd 3000 the finest in graphics card technology it gets a pitiful 25 fps in menus with performance usually worse ingame this leads to frustrating deaths as i see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face or i suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face in which they will usually taunt me with expletives this is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade my computer can run crysis the loot system in this game however has much potential the guns you can get nearly rival borderlands the presequel in originality design and neon colors however unlike borderlands the presequel the guns cost real money on either the outsidegame service steam community market or by opening cases which cost $249 per attempt and usually only yield commongrade loot this is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base gearbox clearly has it right as unlike valve they never release overpriced dlc for their borderlands series as valve have shown they cannot design games they should hand off halflife 3 to gearbox software instead overall this game is outdated treats customers like crap has little content unintiuitive gameplay a terrible community bad level design and more stay away and buy call of duty modern warfare 17 instead 69420

too many things are wrong in this gamemovement is not smooth awp and deagle are innacurate and not fun to play anymore p90 and running is  flashes are not efective nades are not accurate limited wallbanging and  ammo limitation on m4 maps cluttered with unexpected props and corners to slow you down certain areas are not wide enough and causes acidental tk on rushes and inability to rush fast as an whole and the most important recoil does not allow you to kill multiple enemies in 1 magazine in a short period of time you are limited to short bursts and take cover and that removes the ability to clutch rounds which was the most fun aspect in other versions it prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of css maps like inferno and train and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking on the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos and other misc stuff like the gui matchmaking and de_nuke balanced and i would rather play go with this problems fixed than going back to 16 anyday but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay i only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore and most people have to eat it up this game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad but after it many people started playing it to earn skins so most of the players dont care about the game they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge they dont actually care about the game it is a sad truth and its clear that hidden path will never update this game to proper conditions

this game was the best tactical game i had ever played the community was good people were mature sportsmanship was very well presented but all of that changed when the skins came the community of counter strike that we knew and loved got shattered in an instant this community is turning into tf2 but instead of hats it is skins its a pathetic excuse from valve to build an economy to make more money off of virtual items really valve you are turning this game into tf2 and its a joke more immature underage children are playing this game now and i dont like and i am certain that i am not the only one who thinks this way first off the community now is a disgrace you could be playing with someone become really good friends with them and then they ask for one of your good skins to borrow bam skins stolen and your hard work has meant nothing it increases the scamming within this steam community second the competitive mode is great it is challenging and very teamwork based but all that can change with a steam sale hackers banned well then lets price counter strike global offensive to 350 oh boy that was a good idea right a steam sale on this game is not only hurting us but steam as well people also buy counter strike global offensive on a different account so that means if you are a low rank in competitive not only are you against a higher rank but you are also at a high chance to lose its a complete and utter disaster when it happens it needs to end thirdly cases are ridiculous you literally have a 001% chance to get a rare special item knife people waste so much money on cases when at the end of the day its a virtual item you could go out and buy a real knife for about 50 at highest while the highest in this game is about 600 the economy is terrible community is terrible skins are a joke and steam are probably laughing at you as you go out and waste money on cases fourthly and lastly is the hit detection this game has a pretty bad hit detection system valve could go out and buy 124 tick servers but nope they go out and be cheapskates and buy 64 tick servers which is god awful i mean valve come on you make millions of  and $ why cant you actually just think about your game instead of how much money you take a bath in this game is great once you get into it and if you find a decent server 124 tick it is pretty fun one other thing i forgot to mention is when you play competitive there is a cooldown if you leave kill a teammate kick too many players or even if your power cuts during a match you only have 3 minutes to return to the match abandon the match ok sir we give you a 7 day ban a ban ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours to 24 hours to finally 7 days it is a bit unfair the banning system it is automatic so it cannot be revoked please valve fix your game and your community before it wrecks itself 610 for gameplay 210 for skins 310 for community 010 for competitive cooldown

i loved this game i hate it now its riddled with smurfs hackers and outright trolls im sick of it on top of all this my ranking system is ed along with my matchmaking i get placed with a team of trolls and idiots whilst the other team consists of 3 smurfs dmg on main ing cheers valve this game is unique and the gameplay and mechanics are fantastic however the game is dragged down by screaming children and trolls im silver 3 with 97 wins and about 90% of my friends that are terrible at the game are a higher rank im not amazing but im pretty decent i top frag every game and i still dont rank up yesterday i played one game my team were a bunch of 12 year olds and trolls and i was up against 2 smurfs thanks i get kicked because the trolls think its funny to kick people for no reason and then guess what the rank i just worked 40 wins to get is gone ing gone im done with this game my ranking system is glitcheded and my matchmaking system is  why am i so unlucky just why ing unbelievable

nice graphics new maps weapons and models but developers should listen to the customers a bit more developers you are focused too much on things that are not important at all you should focus on changing the tick rate of the match making servers to 128 and improving vac a lot those two are what customers really want and you should focus on not stickers ui and hud changes or skins and stop messing around with the weapons

i try to make this as short as possible but there will still be some lines of text i bought this game near the date of the release my account is more than 11 years old i bought more than 250 games recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them i joined them it was a hell lot of fun but  i was banned a so called cooldown for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an antismurf feature after winning 2 matches you will get banned they call it cooldown but you will actually get banned naming a ban cooldown doesnt change the effect valve faq says to you this is no big deal you can play the other game modes like casual or against bots yeah that changes everything not the competitive mode is the only reason i started playing csgo again and so will many others you have to keep in mind you bought the game and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around but they do the exact opposite i will explain that later in this review i cant say the words here i want to cause that would remove this review instantly i am so frustrated seeing my friends play all night long knowing it is so much fun yes the gameplay is fantastic intense fun but why in world isnt there some kind of filter i probably spent several 1000 of euros on steam the only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game and guess what thats what smurfs actually do to summarize smurfs buy several copies legit people dont so multiple accounts give an advantage to smurfs compared to legit customers this logic must come from one real brainiac at valve and the best thing i just experienced even the draws count as a win so if you would play very close matches which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system and you always get draws you would get banned everyday for 21 hours thats because you need 10 wins to get ranked and only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system this can take like forever even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session this would take at least 10 days beeing a normal worker you cant even play everyday having a family or other rl responsibilities makes this a real torture you have to play a month here and there single sessions for 23 games than quittinggetting banned waiting at least one day your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do playing another 23 games and this until you reach 10 wins this is absolutely rediculous a real shame by the way contacting the valve support ends up in getting an automatic response saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system maybe valve invests more time in counting money these days

ive wasted a lot of time in this game i think i finally can say my own opinion first of all this game doesnt have an optimisation even though you have a very powerful computer it still will be lagging as  as its possible secondly vac anticheat doesnt work properly there are many cheaters and whats very important valve doesnt give a  in addition the rank system in this game is totally unfair you can be deranked for no reason also there can be some people who have very low rank but they still can play like the global elite players i dont mean about people who have the second account with low rank furthermore the real community of this game consists of the ing idiots who cannot play well and they can only complain for some  as well as annoying and pulling whole team down can be made by them unfortunately its really hard to find someone who can play well and without any doubt show the real meaning of teamplay by the way about those things like the skins or something like this that dont make any sense valve is trying to get some money in the different ways especially its associated to the ing crates and keys i completely dont recommend you to buy them youll actually lose money in conclusion this game definitely sucks and it can lead you to get a brain cancer whats really funny that i will never stop playing this  probably i am already addicted here is a small advice for valve valve you are supposed to do something useful for this game that can really improve it

as usual there isnt a promosing gameplay behind counter strike  global offensive they hid all the bugs hacks mechanical issues and conectivity problems behind and cheap  microtransaction system in which they brainwash you to think that the problem with matchmaking connection and overall gameplay is regular and normal if you were looking for a competitive experience where learning from your mistakes aids you you really havent found anything of the sort here from direct hits with visual blood splatter not registering to lag hacks this game has it all youre gameplay will be as miserable as modern warfare 3s spawning was on release pitiful and a bunch of drivel their matchmaking system is as broken as michael jacksons face is natural youre being matched with people with far more experience than you its like their playing against bots your gameplay not only will be completely counterintuitive if you are not a regular in the fps world but it will be shattered by the amount of regurgitation you call the community people with 5year veteran badges to hackers claiming they trickshotz plz omg ur bad noob pros modern warfare in a nutshell cons counter strike source not only has better content but the gameplay is far more superior  connectivity issues  constant hackers with almost no patches to fix the issue ing hell at least nexon publishes patches to rid the hackers for a week or so mechanical issues in this game are so dumbfoundingly common and ridiculous youd have a better chance of getting a headshot if you smashed your  on the keyboard  microtransactions do nothing but cover up the wrong the game is worth less than counter strike source on sale at its current state the community is rambunctiously annoying egotistical and flat out mentally challenged

tldr dont play unless you can stand the hoards of idiots if you dont like getting kicked from matches that are 2 rounds off finishing this game may not be for you the game itself is alright perhaps not as good as 16 or even source but its solid the problem lies within the community which is the gaming equivelent of ebola for every decent person you pass there are 200 small racist children ive never heard the n word used so much in my many thousands of hour gaming as csgo players constantly kick you for being simply not good at the game even if you arent doing badly the kick function in both competitive and casual is abused to high hell in the competitive side of the game if you have no team to play with you are out of luck because of the shear number of blockheads and racists who scream while playing the community is often compaired to that of leauge of legands but im going to say that it is in fact worse i know this may be hard for some of you to invision but if you play this game you will understand why if you do want to buy this game i would suggest ignoring valve servers entirly and just finding some nice community server to play on dont get me wrong here the game aint half bad but jfc the playerbase

if you ever wondered where the worst and utter scum of all living things since the origins of this planet is dwelling search no more the answer is in this game and its such a high concentration of flaming 8yr olds trolls cheaters leavers teamkillers and s it makes me ponder if perhaps we should just sentence everyone playing to death by lethal injection the world would be a wonderful place you know isis is actually scared  of the csgo community they fear them for their complete lack of brains which makes them dangerous enemies you cant really kill them with headshots or beheadings if things are well in your life and you desperately want to be depressed and have all that you hold dear destroyed then download this game and after only a few weeks your life will be hell on earth not to mention of course everyone who ever touched this game is the worst racist sexist and homophobic  you can think of in fact it gets to a point where their stupidity becomes a parody of its own if your hopes in the human race are not yet lost which makes me question the content of your skull honestly this is the absolute and definite proof that mankind has no place on this or any other planet and will hopefully wiped out rather sooner than later by a natural catastrophy of some sort or just animals picking up fullyautomatic guns and killing every human and ape they can find a dozen atomic bombs would also do nicely

this version is a shame to the counter strike franchise terrible map design where all ways to the bombsites are extremely claustrophobic and makes the game extremely ct sided together with powerfull smokes and fire grenades not to mention useless flashbangs dont help the t side at all bullet spread is completely wrong and overdone you can spray 30 bullets into an opponent and only hit 1 or 2 bullets and skilled players are no longer able to clutch 1 vs x situations compared to cs 16 unbalanced weapons like mag7 and p90 wallbanging was for the most part removed and sound positioning is terrible too there are just too many wrong things with this game if it wasnt for the skins and market system and valve spending money on tournaments this game would have never become popular hope this game stops being supported and valve releases a new proper version with help of the competitive community

you call this csgo well i call it csbad cmon valve you should rename this game to cs stopplaying it cuz its bad bad things about this game this game is total trash out of all the variety of unique weapons people only use m4a4m4a1s ak47 or awp in this game the shooting mechanics and recoil is too much and mostly hard for newbies on this useless game the sounds of this game is a copy from mw3 cod engine and the gun sounds are too wubby and trappy 4 me smgs should be called small marshmellow gun shooters the damage of smgs are worse than trying to knife someone the damage point blank up close on the chest takes 10000000 bullets while you only need lucky headshots on these small tf2 hitboxes you can get more kills with the lowest tier pistol than an smg the only smg that is decent is p90 you see noob spray that pee pee gun around and spam it to your death mp7 should have no recoil like cod mw3 and real life unrealistic game shotguns are worse its the 100% nerf on cod shotguns it seems like the bullets are freakin hasbro nerf darts made from nike sweatshops in china up close point blank with any shotgun  no kill dont bother about using lmg why is it called light machine guns when its more heavy than a oversize truck full of my diarrhea ak47 is more op compared to the m4a4 with damage and 1 hit headshots from any range to even shoot accurately you have to stand still and memorize the tarded spray pattern if you move 1 mm the bullets fly up to the sky then the scout sniper rifle is a joke its only a hitmarker unless its a headshot the silenced weapons do more damage and are more accurate i seriously dont get how big the recoils are for every weapon its like the counter terrorists are some scrawny 16 year olds and can barely hold the gun and the terrorists are some recruited isis 12 year olds with towels on their head dumb talibans im surprised the terrorists doesnt have an rpg wouldnt matter anyway since it would only do 01 damage the bullets must not do damage or just dissapear in thin air since most of the shots doesnt register saying you only did 10 damage with 1 bullet gg this is the only game where you need luck and aim for headshots while shooting else where is useless with the armor ohand if you get shot at you move 100000% slower which unrealistic unless its your legs being shot at espeically with all that armor people use hearing like its sitrep pro from cod mw3 which is annoying to preshoot you and crap knfing is useless other than running faster idk why the camos worth 100000000000000000000000 dollars same with any other weapons and their stranges who even uses the zeus the recoil is so horrid it needs to be mentioned again why have a crosshair when you spray you aim the crosshair where should be on the player on the ground so the bullets fly up in the air is now at your target i think these ct were trained in the army so that the recoil and aiming is stupid and the osama bin laden squad is just naturally bad at aiming stormtroopers can aim better than these useless guns with its mechanics jesus the only recoil spread i can master is the awp this game has no killstreaks such wow lame why have the rest of the other unique and well made maps when the only map people play is dust 2 demolition is a new game mode that is trash and similar to gun game from cod casual is what people only play deathmatch is the even worse version of tdm in cod the spawns are worse than mw2 rusti would spawn infront of someone or someone 2 feet away from me and get graped from behind arms race is just plain stupid just a copy of cod mw3 gun game hostage is very unique but only have to rescue one to win how bout the other 2 guys thats right next to each other to pick up plus the terrorists push more than the ct gg competitive is full of tryhard plebians and casual is full of smurfs if you leave a competitive match thats unfinished you get consquences by cant join another comp match for 30 min then 2 hours 24 hours then week or something you get temp banned basicallyi can understand if people ragequit but what if i have to take a dump for 10 hours or my mom nags me to get off or even a sharknado came and hit my house and i got no power this is dumb last time i check this game isnt league of legends a genius way for wasting your hard working mcdonald jobs money they added camos and stickers to guns the only good camos for the only good weapons in the game are like 100000000000 bucks worse than buying hats on tf2 stickers are a rip off you only have 1 time to apply it with a terrible pov inspecting it before you apply it you can scrape it which ruins the quality idk why that is a thing since you cant scrape it off and put it back on with a different spot on your gun just have a remove button instead >> or at least let you reapply stickers the community is terrible you get kicked if youre bad or if someone calls clutch or kick with a lot of ghosters in casual this game is worse than all the cods especially black ops 12 and ghosts no wonder this game costs less than the old counter strike games and still doesnt worth 15 bucks i am a major valve fan owning l4d12 tf2 hl series etcand this game just dissapoints me hidden path either ruined it or valve wanted to took a crap on us and want money so gabe can eat it thinking its celery and losing fat i play video games 247 and never go

fact have played cs series since the first cannot recommend this game very broken  you can do anywhere from 11 to 200 damage when shooting someone with a shotgun no matter how well you aim and how close you are you will see blood pour out of your enemies to have the game tell you you did no damage and you will shoot someone in the head with an assault rifle and do 2 damage when they do 211 with the same rifle despite them having no armour or helmet and you do opinion the recoil pattern feature in this game is also silly as you literally have to aim downwards and draw a t shape while shooting to keep your shots on target yes the patterns are essentially fixed patterns with the crosshair rather than do your best to keep it focussed on them guns which are the same calibre and similar barrel lengths sometimes have longer barrels by far will do alot less damage and penetrate armour worse than more expensive ones doesnt make any sense this game is very broken and i suggest you just play css instead as it is alot more accurate and features 100 tick servers over competitive 64 tick competitive css is also more expensive by 5 bucks because maybe valve knows that csgo is a complete mess tldr csgo isnt a cs about skill it is a cs about rolling the dice everytime you shoot someone if you dont believe me then youtube a video of csgo hit detection i assure you youll be amazed at how bad it is edit turns out the game was originally going to be made for consoles but then valve decided to develop it more for pc instead  game is a console port too

no matter what i put here people are going to vote it down but for those that care been playing the game for about a year and a half the game only gets updated for new skins and knives if it ever gets updated for anything its because its game breaking or a major complaint and even then it takes forever ie the cz75 a pistol was more powerful than the rifles for awhile and it took them over half a year to actually fix it and even then they didnt test it and had to update it again to properly fix it the game was updated more to actually improve the game when it peaked at 20k playing per day

meh game so lacking in depth that the only gameplay in it revolves around exagerated recoil if you are prepared to spend hours shooting each gun at a wall to learn the spray patterns which arent even random then this game is for you this is one of those games that you actually have to study seemingly insignificant factors in order to enjoy in other words you have to work hard to find the fun that there is to be had its one of those games that you only enjoy in hindsight if you have won but you likely will not enjoy the bore of each repetitive round the strategy revolves around being blinded either by a flash bang or smoke so even if you happen to spend the thousands of hours it takes to be consistent with the various weapons there is the issue that this is a team game that is more intensive than dota or lol if you are prepared to deal with casual players in matchmaking claiming that its just a game its ok to lose every time then this game is for you other players will likely ruin your competitive experience or you will ruin theirs then there is the issue of registry there are many hackers many smurfs and many exploiters in this quite popular bore of a game beyond that there are players that exploit their exorbenant ping to get an advantage over you when possible if you are prepared to be a loser because of 64 tick servers ddossers laggers smurfs hackers and terrible teammates then this game is for you then there is the fact that this is a winners game remember when you played winners version of basketball where if you make the shot you go again this game is kind of like that winners get paid losers dont so when you lose you lose hard so hard that you cannot afford weapons the next round and must thus lose again these are called eco rounds when you are saving your economy for the next round which is a gamble as well because if you lose that round you will have to eco again you can understand the stress involved with this game at a competitive level it makes competitive starcraft 2 almost seem trivial yet its game mechanics and depth of gameplay is utterly lacking and uninteresting the reward for having invested 90 minutes of aging stress into a video game where 75% of the time your upset is that you may win and experience temporary joy until the next game that you lose this cycle continues and you always chase the high of a game won no wonder so many players play this game its sort of like growing weed 9 months of growing 2 months of curing and you finally get to smoke it only in this game 5070% of the time your house gets raided by the cops and you have no weed to smoke after your extreme time investment leaving you extremely upset in short this game revolves around blindng players controlling recoil like a 3 year old girl you literally cannot hit what your crosshair is aiming at kind of misleading and you certainly cannot hit what is directly in front of you if you hold the trigger down that being said if your aim is terrible and you arent aimed at your target and you still spray you will likely get headshots and random kills because the bullets dont go where you aim anyways this is why young children like to play this game there is a thrill to be had when experiencing so much luck so if you plan on spending 10000 hours to become an average player at this game with an average rank and win loss ratio be my guest you cannot become great at this game without a great team and the thousands of hours fiddling with recoil with various guns at various distances on various maps against various players who use various techniques that being said with the time investment that it takes to actually enjoy this game and have fun you could likely have gotten laid by numerous women dont be a virgin for life trying to learn how to have fun at a silly game tldr look at my hours i got to dmg thats when i realized this game takes way too much trivial skill to be worth my time ill be playing games like insurgency starcraft 2 gta v and killing floor 2 out of the 600 hours i put into this game i likely enjoyed 10 or so i dont see what all the buzz is about

csgo is easily the worst counter strike game in the franchise which is generally what happens when you toss it off to a new team that has never worked on the game before good bye turtle rock studio hello crap one with some of the worst players in any game ive ever played csgo has the absolute worst toxic community players i have ever witnessed this includes games such as dota lol and any other toxic mobas something i never thought i could say playing competitive is almost unbearable for this reason alone sadly however there any many other reasons why this game is unplayable and serves no purpose in a sane individuals library of games another great reason is from the latest update which results in anyone whom has over 50 ping wanting to rip out their own hair as the hit reg will be so abysmal that there wont even be a reason to play or to even continue living at that point this leaves high ping players deep in the dark not everyone can have great ping especially when you are essentially forced to play on valve only servers which sometimes are super far from your location not to mention the hit reg is just bad as it is to begin with did i mention the recoil system is invisible your gun does not shoot up into the air bullets just magically come out in random directions to the point where if you need to spray you have to aim at the floor to shoot in the sky at this point im sure the devs know this game is awful lets not forget the fact that every comp match has at least 3 smerfs and probably a hacker as well the devs dont care though this game is a money pot which its highly addictive economy with tf2 like skin system makes all the kiddies explode woo moms wallet has never been so empty 12 year old power yeah ok have fun kids everyone goes mad bat  on this game im sure it will continue to do well for many years to come nothing will change the pro scene will keep going and players will keep being awful do your self a favour and dont join the aids network good luck and may god have mercy on your soul if you buy this game 610

i totally not recommend this game and this are my thoughts  60% of community is using espsaimbots that are free and easly found  15% of community is using premium ones for 1520 bucks that are undetectable so they dont even give a  to vac  i played 7 matches in a row and in those matches i meet cheaters one match i got a whole team at my side using esp they didnt even gave a single  for reports or overwatch and i asked them why they told me that the game costs 5 euro  counter strike go lost its fun or competetive look by this total crap and mass of cheaters or russiansi got master guardian 2 ofc i know that this rank is not the biggest but the experience is the same  thank you valve for you totally useless passive vac anticheat system that does crap to those people for ruining so many games  i will never play counter strike go again and to all my friends and people who are playing that crap game dont buy it and dont play it its not worth your time and nerves  i only recommend this game for cheaters since they can cheat other cheaters for fun but for a legit player these days its  this game changed for worse a lot worse even proplayers in leagues are cheating now

csgo has the full potential to be one of the greatest games in the past decade but due to smurf ranking system low price  hacker overload and teammates who refuse to communicate either because of language barrier or just to troll i cannot recommend this game in its current state counter strike has always been the king of computer games unfortunately the king has been slowly beheaded by smurfs 1 out of 5 competitive ranked matches you play will be about teams of equal skill trying to win in which case losing is a process of learning and imporving 4 out of 5 times youre stuck with a wallhacker on the other team a leaver in your own team and two russians shouting gibberish and notsosubtle critisism for a full match of 3090 minutes also the smurf in your team is cancer to the community wondering why everyone else sucks at the lower ranks if valve doesnt start seriously investing their efforts to the nightmare that is current matchmaking and reporting system they might soon be loosing many if not all of the legit players almighty gaben help us win this war on terrorism

this game is fun to play and dont get me wrong when i write this but the game in its current condition is broken the matchmaking could not be worse and even if the matchmaking is right you get a smurf from legendairy eagle in the enemy team and in the lower ranks you get people who dont know hot to use the microphone or they have not a microphone in possesion buying this game is a gamble for rather you will enjoy this game or enjoy it even more when uninstalling

csgo chicken seeker guaranteed offbase is a game where you seek your lost chickens so that you can return to your farm using different mechanics to scare your chickens and herd them to different points on the map point a and point b is the objective of the game youll find that its both fun and challenging to get your chickens there safely unfortunately the multiplayer aspect of this game is full of people who find it fun to disrupt your game its almost impossible to spawn into the game without getting griefed by your fellow players they will try their very best to kill both you and your chickens the game itself is unmoderated and this behavior seems to go unpunished the makers of the game seem to think this behavior is funny and have indulged the joke by coding the bots to grief in much the same way until this very serious problem is addressed i will have to give this a thumbs down only buy this game if you enjoy not being able to play your game due to a toxic community and incompetent developers who think such behavior is funny

classical game gone wrong thats my summary at least if you think the game is even at any point as good as 16 or css think again ill list some pros and cons pros  good looking skins remade maps easy to invite friends to a lobbyget a team farily quick modes like arms race gun game or deathmatch has been made official gamemodes cons  community is rotten way through into the core and back on the other side ranking system is completly broken spraypatterns take long time to learn and master especially ak47 cant select playable character in casualcompetetive gamemodesneither any other people tend to buy the game on a different account leveling up themself with that one so they meet people who are new with themselfs as very skilled players cheating when you see it youll understand changed spraypatterns smaller and somewhat broken hitboxes wallbanging is rare if valve took time and developed a good ranking system this game could have been amazing but no the game is about 6 euros on a steam sale people buy it smurf and destroy for all the other players you need about 5 wins in a row to rank up one rank every god damn time it doesnt matter if you beat nip or heaton himself you wont rank up without 5 wins in a row good luck with that when the matchmaking isnt working properly because someone wanted to rank up twice until valve fixes this problem together with the cheating this game is a big nono stick with 16 or source youll have trice the fun you have here

i really like counter strike and this entry is no exepcion everything is good now and it has a lot more room for expansion but please create an east server so the rest of europe can have more fun while playing for more than 20 game in streak i only listen to russian and since a medium percentage of them hates america they refuse to speak english and this is totally unsocial and breaks the communication in game ending up to a serious problem that leads the player into frustation and despair summing up in a deffeat this is the dark side of the community in the csgo scene and it can be easily resolved by creating a new server with this said im not being racist since im not that and i have friends in all over the world but it hurts the community to see the player personal beliefs and cultural influences get inside a game that is used to relief stress and to socialize a bit more with the world dramatic actions should be insued lord gabe just make it happen

i ignored this game for so long hoping it would get better but it hasnt it shockingly got even worse before i start lets get into the history of counter strike the original cs was a fun competitive game that still remains superior to its sequel cssource cssource was popular mainly because of the large amounts of custom maps that were flooded into the game but killed competitive cs and turned the game into a casual shooter then csgo came this game was made solely for micro transactions but to be honest any game made by valve will be from now on but the game has no major changes from cssource other than skins and cosmetics furthermore these weapon skins and cosmetics feel like something that fits more in tf2 bright pink guns and meme stickers make me want to vomit but hey if you want to spend $300 on a knife skin that you will never use or get a kill on be my guest another problem are the guns none of them are balanced in the game most famous one being the awp the 1 shot 1 kill weapon and last we have the matchmaking it is some of the worst matchmaking i have ever seen any game where it takes over 5min to get into a match fails and csgo has no excuse seeing as how as of this review it is the second most played game on steam and lastly the main reason i hate this game is the community so i was on a server everyone was dead it was me vs the entire other team and as you would guess i died then some squeaker yells over the mic what the fck you idiot and starts a vote kick on me that passed the other way around happened where i hid in a corner no one checked and shot the entire enemy team and won and i get you fcking hacker and get kicked this stuff is normal when you play this game because 75% of everyone playing it is some annoying kid with some kind of meme name on top of that this game is full of russians that like to yell a lot now you would think that when you play on a west coast server russians wouldnt join because bad ping but they do and then you would know russians wouldnt join on an east coast server because it is on the other side of the world and they would get the worst possible ping but they still do its almost as if they are only joining these games so they can yell at people and not play the game at all 30% of all the nearby servers at least where i live are idle servers and even then there arent that many servers to begin with and it confuses me because this game has pretty much the same amount of servers as tf2 even though there are a lot more people who play this at least to what steam says in their stats and lastly this game is full of cheaters and having a ranking system where you get better ranks depending on your kd ratio will always make more dumb kids want to cheat and having next to no defenses against kids cheating because you can almost never confirm if this kid is hacking or just lucky because you pretty much instantly die if you get shot in the head with any weapon this game it is best used just to idle for the chance of getting a drop you can sell for 30$ with that said im done i would like to remind anyone reading this that this is my opinion of the game and everyone has different opinions and yes ik my opinion is sht and im an underagedpleb that clearly knows nothing about video games no need to sprinkle your salt in the comments

if you have a lag stutter for ten seconds the game dcs you and you get 0 dollars for a round or two since ten seconds of lag can disable steam for three minutes the bot ai will buy a glass cannon awp and then run into the enemy no matter how many or even if one person says to hold position you cant surrender until your leaver gets the 5 minute pass and sometimes your autistic allies will try to make the game continue so that you lose rounds and derank more it takes around 15 seconds after death to actuall be able to take control of the bot and to top it all off the game has one of the most infamously bad hit registrations of any modern competetive fps httpiimgurcompgvkzqfjpg taken at cl_interp 0 they made the netcode in defualt matchmaking as absolutly terrible as it could possibly be there are obscure indies that do netcode better than this game if you dont plan to just play eseacevo then avoid this shitheap

there are several things valve should improve and they keep ignoring them for a long time thats why my review is more negative than it could be biggest problems are definitely  vac its poor anticheat  64 tick we cant play this game on those standarts  bad region selection for mm playing with russians all the time nothing personal  we want to see how much percent of players are in each skill group or atleast in top4 which is considered proffessional for sakes of motivation  optimalize the game for more cores especially for amd its not a complete list of the issues but those are really worth a quick solution because only thing valve is now doing is expeding stupid skins and operations which brings almost no new joy to the game valve milks this  hard d 510  keep improving cs is awesome game stop milking skins and give us more unforgetable moments with this game through fluent and fair gameplay based on the skill and not cheats and also you can pump little bit more money into majors

ever played one of those freetoplay shooters with cash shops behold now you can pay $15 for another cash shop shooter now dont get me wrong the cash shop in this game does not give players an advantage over each other thankfully what cheeses me is the fact that we have to pay additional money if we want to enjoy other aspects of our game i paid $15 for the game and now i need to pay extra for locked content thats like selling someone a 12 pack of condoms for 15 bucks only to tell the user that they can only use 4 of them they would have to pay extra for the rest of the condoms it makes no logical sense  this business practise is plaguing the industry and i cant believe the developers bought into it its very disappointing now about the game its nothing special really youve got your typical counterstrike with better graphics the interface is also improved which is a plus gameplay hasnt changed much which is understandable but its really nothing special its pretty much like every freetoplay shooter on the market nowadays youre better off playing a game like cross fire or ghost recon phantoms because it is very similar to those two no singleplayer just multiplayer with your default maps you need to pay if you want more maps honestly its not worth your money im not saying this out of spite this is sheer honesty here i thought i would get more bang for my buck but i was mistaken 510 for me this game is average

counterstrike global offensive has skyrocketed the amount of people interested in the cs community although this game has its own great fame and glory there are still an amount of people in the toxicity area that the community has to deal with cheaters toxic players trolls and even smurfing has become an issue to the game a suggestion would be to bring back the old serverlisted based matches and consider them ranked matches instead of matchmaking lets face it mm sucks  all people care about in this game is their matchmaking rank like seriously valve the system needs to be reestablished like what the  is 7 days ban for abandoning with a cheater on the other team

after going back and playing source for a couple weeks then coming back you can really tell how much source is better than csgo and all the new features are slowly destorying the game

the skins in this game ruined it this game is beatuful skillful competitivebutthe amount of unfair people cheating scamming and doing  is too big in every game you play whatever is your rank you will get mad for the cheaters you face and will be quite impossible to have fun but the problems will come also if you dont play youll receive an amount of friend request from private profile if you have a good skin that will be impossible to substain theyll spam some links to get your good weapons and youll have to block them but even if they dont have a private profile they look like they want to trade they will scam you anyway this game show you the real face of the people in the world dont ever trust anyone dont buy this game is much better to waste money in beer at least you get some fun

this game is filled with hackers  how do i know cuz im one of those hackers hack tools are surprisingly easy to obtain  heres the story  me and 3 of my buddies got  because of 2 consecutive games with a blatant hacker  so we decided to do the same thing we browsed google and finally found a working hack on oldschoolhack csgo < there we used the hackwallaimbotbunnyhop for like a month then finally i got banned  soon as i got banned my friends stopped using the hack and got away safely without any vac  this proves that valve is ing   after i complain pretending that im not a hacker valve said that it was a legit ban and if i still want to play csgo i must purchase the game on a new account  really so from this i can see that valve doesnt really want to fix the hack problem  what they want is that they want people to cheat so they can ban them and make them buy another csgo  its all about business really  but still this proves that valve doesnt give a  about the community

if youre looking for bs this game is full of it 100% full of shi more shi than in india there is literally shi everywhere especially if youve eaten their curry your  will become the colour of jalfrezi curry anyways the cs go review it can be classed as addictive as you just want to rank up and go pro and make some money the ranking system is fucing full of shi doesnt even have one took 5 wins in a row to go up a rank and 2 matches to lose the fucing rank now i get teamed with the shitest players in the world a bunch of dribble cakes just go blah blah blah and dribble comes out of their mouth while talking some people just cant play the game they use the awp and they couldnt hit water if they fell out of a boat most games i am top of the leaderboard which you would have thought you go up a rank by being top of the games right no wins is all you need doesnt matter if youre the worst player in the world and get carried by your team you will go up a rank where as good players who are teamed with  players are penalised and go down ranks so yes the ranking system in this game is nonexistent matchmaking is worse than cod in conclusion this game is not worth the money i would rather be a giraffe and play contagion gg valve

why counter strike global offensive is garbage it is not playable and havent been for 23 months now the things you can do now  play mm aka ranked matches buy items sell items inspect items play with yourself the things you could do before play mm aka ranked matches buy items sell items inspect items play with yourself play casual games like arms race deathmatch defusemissions hostage missions play 3 different maps packs in casual you could play on different server accross custom servers  and the list go on and on atm how it stands it is a waste of 14 euros  15 dollars  12 pounds  you would get more if you were to buy a big family dinner than this garbage you could also donate this kind of money to charity instead you would feel better than buying this thats for sure if valve doesnt do something about this soon  a long time ago i would rate them as worse than ea or very close for me at least

this game would be freaking great if it was not for sorry for bad words ing   who are simply griefing insulting you not cooperating or even better in the start of the match they do not even bother speaking english with you easily they just rundown whole their vocabulary of insults in their mother language instead of telling you info 1010 game 010 people playing it
