very intuitive for creative minds if you love to get creative and if you love the half life series this is the best game for you
recommended
despite its release date this is still one of the best games out there where only your imagination is the limit to what you can do the base game is sandbox with halflife 2 weapons and it supports models from most source engine games such as counterstrike source team fortress 2 and left for dead 2 new features aswell as modifying exisiting ones can be done through modding and the language used in the mods is lua which is very easy to pick up on and learn

garrys mod is a piece of great game developing  that somehow successes to be really fun and creative at the same time i have no idea what the developers were thinking when they were making this pile of greatness  because it lacks absolutely nothing and somehow feels so great  1 0  10 awful ly good  [edit]  ive been getting a lot of love n hate with this review those people that dont understand why i hate gmod but i still recommend it  you have to hover over the black areas to see the text i dont hate gmod thx for all the love

i know i know this game was released almost 9 years ago but its still one of the most played multiplayer games on steam if you say nah its boring i would say hey did you check out the workshop there is everything you need

garrys mod like sandbox has it like adventure has that too like zombie games you can spawn as many bloomin zombies as your heart desires like roll playing there are 1000s of garrys mod roll playing maps at workshop just waiting for you to play on like multiplayer this is where ttt comes from d like modding your game you can do a lot of modding on here eg flying cars nuclear weapons call of duty and csgo guns you will not regret buying this game you can have hours of playtime with your mates or on your own or with complete strangers this game can really let your mind go wild you can weld up a new car or make a rollercoaster much better than minecraft and a lot cheaper too garrys mod  1010

garrys modaah what can we say about this little gem this beautiful notreallyagamegame gives you some of the most open sandbox software ever not only does it give you the power to change physics and spawn gazillion npcs at the same time it has spawned a few of the most brilliant gamemodes such as trouble in terrorist town ttt and prop hunt both are absolutely hilarious these fairly small items already make it an epic piece of software then theres sledding gmod tower and countless others that make it even more amazing gmods a gem dont even hesitate to get this one

what can you say about a mod that has about a million servers and infinite replay value with its own workshop and fanbase well for starters this game has everything to offer due to its unbelieveable amount of mods and mod authors you want to blow things up go download a c4 charge and plant it in a fully destructable building if your computer can handle it want to watch youtube videos in a theatre go to a gmod theatre server want to live a life in a game go to a rp server want to roam around a nuclear wasteland filled with zombies and bandits go to a dayz server or another endoftheworld server want to play sherlock holmes and find the traitor among the innocent or be said traitor find a ttt server my point is you want something theres probably a mod for that if you have a friend that can play with you on a lan server or just a private server get creative in sandbox you could make something you could create scenarios you could pose some ragdolls for some funny or gruesome screenshots or even just send armies of rebels against two antlion guards the choice is yours overall this game gets an 8 out of ten from me the mod is the limit in this game but unless you have friends the servers can be hostile especially the ttt and darkrp servers you can get pretty paranoid in ttt  and singleplayer is only so much fun you really need to be creative to find fun in singleplayer im a bit on the uncreative side so give the game a try yourself just make sure to bring a friend

one day i bought this because it was on sale for about $250 i didnt think much of it but then i started playing i couldnt believe how addicting it was i started losing sleep and skipping meals it started to show on my physical health my family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center lets just say they wont be bugging me anymore but now i dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection ive sold everything i have just to play i cant even go to starbucks and use their wifi because i sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity so basically im writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge my life isnt worth it without this game yet it seems to have ruined my life goodbye world 1010 buy great gift for kids edit march 29 2014 your comments make me lol i might as well make a legit review yes i bought this game for only $250 but if you ask me it is so much more worth it it may not be the most graphical intensive game but ive never had so much fun it is packed with hundreds of hours of pure laughter and randomness you never know what you will find in this game keep this in mind though this is a mod and it is mostly just community made content so it may have its bugs but what game doesnt only thing i can complain about is the ability of making a joinable server i never could make one oh well i reccomend this game to anyone and everyone a true 1010 game ps you should probably buy css counter strike source while youre at it many of the servers require it have fun build responsibly

i really like this game like a lot i mean seriously i have 3000 hours in it i really really like this game the reason why i dont recommend it is because of the community if you like playing public multiplayer dont bother 90% of the community is made up of kids from the age of 514 not even joking its rare to find a 15 year old on this game and even more rare to find a mature one you could always play singleplayer but the problem is that singleplayer gets boring quite quickly actually its pretty hard to find someone who is truely mature in this game and doesnt have anger issues or has a voice which can break a wine glass of course if you dont mind little kiddies or you are one yourself go right ahead and buy this game im sure youll have fun with it i know i did but if you want a mature respectable community dont bother if the community was better i would totally recommend this game

used to be an amazing game you could do whatever you want play however you want create any gamemode etc now the game seems to be infested with servers run by 12 year olds full of 12 year olds and made for 12 year olds anyone over the age of 15 isnt liable to have fun in this game trust me i played this game a lot over 800 hours it used to be a lot of fun and everyone was mature and had a good sense of humor now everything is just a jumbled up mess of lame internet references and god awful memes recited by 1114 year old squeaker kids who probably stole a family members card to purchase the game after seeing poopiepie play it on youtube this is literally garbage now

oh garrys mod 13 why did you have to ruin everything gmod used to be a great sandbox game with a few bugs here and there but then that dreaded day where gmod 13 came out changed everything the game only went downhill by that point for some reason they decided that removing half of the props was a good idea those really cool and useful tools that you use all the time nah were just going to remove them for you got some pesky bugs in your single player map we dont care since gmod is played multiplayer more than singleplayer you used to be able to build pretty much everything imaginable with the old addons and possible extra addons that you could download from eg garrysmodorg but sadly that is now no longer possible obvioulsy you can still have lots of fun with all these new online gamemodes but singleplayer just aint what it used to be anymore

while i had fun in the beginning once you dive into the worlds of cinema and ttt you can see how  and awful community if mics and chat arent being spammed with little kids racist sexist and pornographic content the ing admin abuse is truly something out of the worst horror stories youve heard just now i was on cinema and 3 of these main issues occurred 1 in the lobby a man was spamming his mic with some dank memes like mlady and some really messed up mlp  2 while in the theater the only videos that anyone would request was porn mostly gay or some kind of  fetish 3 and finally when a normal video would come on the ing piece of  admin would blow up everyone in the theater and all those things bring me here to you right now writing this admittedly angry and hostile review so in conclusion i can say 1  this game and 2  this community ps have a nice day

garrys mod just isnt cool anymore it was unique special but its steam simply ran out the most important reason is the now incredibly outdated source engine everyone who creates content like models and maps is moving onto new engines this could be neglected when source was 56 years old but now the very core on which the engine is based on is 10 years old and severely limited not to mention ugly thats relatively speaking of course furthermore the base content is also about 10 years old and i for one am sick and tired of it yet any attempt to use other content fails naturally because of large download sizes and horribly low percentages of people who own for instance episode 2 let alone left 4 dead finally gmod wasnt popular because of sandbox but because of other gamemodes the people who once made gamemodes for gmod because it was relatively easy to do so are now making standalone games for new engines like unreal and unity that make the process dead easy compared to engines about 5 years ago and are amassing huge communities too there were always many kids playing gmod but it is the old guard that simply moved on its only natural because gmods limits have been reached there can be new ideas sure but most avenues have already been explored and seen it was a nice ride and we still can hope for a couple of years of stagnation but in the end like all good but old games gmod will be played by about 100 or so loyal fans living in the past

this is fun and a great gamei remember the time that i played with friends in my server with mods but the time came to the end when garrys mod change to 13 it started to create more errors more missing texture and every 20 minutes it crashs you want to create a server garrys mod 13 asked me i said yes of course then garrys mod 13 said then f your self becouse you cant and the loooooooooooooong looading i need to wait a hour just to open the game i prefer the old garrys mod not 13

while this is clearly an enjoyable game evident of my 4000 hours i wont recommend it for many reasons if you find something you really like here it will be very easy to get lost in it and spent countless hours on it even if youre not doing anything new thats how garrys mod is if you dont have enough free time for this game it can be seriously detrimental to your personal and professional life the community in this game is excellent and terrible there are some fantastic people on this game but there are plenty of stupid children and teenagers as well if you can take the bad people in stride you will like the community the variety in this game is incredible no need to comment on that if youre willing to explore some gamemodes you will probably find something fun for yourself however i would not recommend picking this game up unless you know for a fact you wont get addicted to it or you have very good self restraint because of the majority of people fall into those categories im going to put not recommended

garrys mod is a fun game if you enjoy messing about with the source engine and playing around with models and building contraption however if you use gmod to make artworks or comics then using gmod is an absolute nightmare often time facepunch studio and or steam would release some useless update that throws your setting off and make certain graphic enhancement modification not work third party graphic enhancement mod is essential because without addons like life the graphic is very very grey also the postprocessing tab is atrocious and the options most often make the already bad graphic much worse for some reason after an update all my screenshots got a hideous yellow tint to them all also it seems gary himself is doing everything he can to sabotage the popularity of gmod as you can read above the buggy nature of gmod make producing good work consistently very difficult also facepunch studio the main forum of garrys mod is about as toxic of a community as you can get in sum if you are serious about using gmod to make art dont give gary $10 download sfm instead
not recommended
i remember when gary made that first post that was the day gmod died he talked about a big change to gmod and said he wanted to try to convince us that its great so we should hear him out it has now killed the game garrys mod has now been reduced to cloud mods that must be reviewed and published on a site and you cannot mod another mod due to copyright there is no freedom gmod is now a game based on the game because the only available content is some meme or valve material meant to be laughed at because heh thats cute instead of actually doing great things garrys mod is the game where you point at cute things and smile it used to be the game where you do crazy  after the big switch only 10% of all mods in existence stayed compatible and now a whopping 25% of the previous mods were remade for the new version i lost all of my mods

garrys mod is a good game but theres a major drawback that almost make me regret the amount of hours ive put into it ill list this out in a proscons format pros good and friendly community  at times  lots of mods available on the workshop accessibility and support with mods is integrated into the game very easy to run a laptop from 2005 could run this game at low and manage to get 30 frames lots of variety in terms of game modes zombie survival trouble in terrorist town prop hunt etc open source anyone can create modsput them on the workshop con  the only con for this game and many others is the community the community has an influx of a younger demographic as a result of their favorite youtubers playing this game the children in this game are fine sometimes but usually they can be a nusianceannoyance this can be shown clearly in the comments on a populartrending mod in the workshop although they can be an annoyance it hardly hinders the fun of the game conclusion although garrys mod has its flaws its still a good game if you can tolerate the community on this game go ahead and buy it if youre like me however and cant tolerate a large amount of younger players in video games i would steer clear because of what i just previously said im personally not reccomending the game for anyone who shares the same opinion as me tldr too long didnt read garrys mod is good if you can tolerate massive amounts of children if not stay away from this game

i remember when gary made that first post that was the day gmod died he talked about a big change to gmod and said he wanted to try to convince us that its great so we should hear him out it has now killed the game garrys mod has now been reduced to cloud mods that must be reviewed and published on a site and you cannot mod another mod due to copyright there is no freedom gmod is now a game based on the game because the only available content is some meme or valve material meant to be laughed at because heh thats cute instead of actually doing great things garrys mod is the game where you point at cute things and smile it used to be the game where you do crazy  after the big switch only 10% of all mods in existence stayed compatible and now a whopping 25% of the previous mods were remade for the new version i lost all of my mods

garrys mod is a fun game if you enjoy messing about with the source engine and playing around with models and building contraption however if you use gmod to make artworks or comics then using gmod is an absolute nightmare often time facepunch studio and or steam would release some useless update that throws your setting off and make certain graphic enhancement modification not work third party graphic enhancement mod is essential because without addons like life the graphic is very very grey also the postprocessing tab is atrocious and the options most often make the already bad graphic much worse for some reason after an update all my screenshots got a hideous yellow tint to them all also it seems gary himself is doing everything he can to sabotage the popularity of gmod as you can read above the buggy nature of gmod make producing good work consistently very difficult also facepunch studio the main forum of garrys mod is about as toxic of a community as you can get in sum if you are serious about using gmod to make art dont give gary $10 download sfm instead

i dont really enjoy this game going through the trouble to find a decent map and waiting for things to download is so time consuming i just bought it and played it for 3 hours i did find some games to play but i didnt enjoy them due to the fact that there was no leading way to complete a mission most because you need to download a bunch of god knows to play and then most of the textures arent there and all i see is error signs and purple checkered textures fills everywhere i wish i didnt buy this game and kept my 10 dollars i wouldnt have even paid 1 dollar if i knew it was like this

not reccomending simply becuase garry supports paid workshop why wouldnt he support it though he will be proffiting off of it

the game is alright but the owner thinks that steams implementation of payed workshop mods is a good idea which is worrying

you wont enjoy the game if youre a furry httppuushhdgkraf99dd69eapng look like this group like to make fun and harass anyone thats a furry a friend thats into it found a post that my profile were featured in a thread that was find the worst steam profile ever to be honest i find it offensive even when i wasnt into the forum ive registered and leaved a reply defending myself and look what i got after 2 days i admit something the game is a blast but their community is not just nice

with the recent development of skyrim introducing payed mods garry the maker of garrys mod is thinking of adding payed mods and i am heavily against it the idea will work good for those established commercial servers that get a great amount of donations to run but it will squash the little servers that small amounts of people play on allowing payed mods could ruin the game play of many servers included is the article about garry talking about payed mods httpgarrytv20150424payingformods

garrys mod will literally be of no use when paid mods come update the pay for mods model of skyrim has been removed but the whole debacle showed the idiocy and immaturity of garry himself though i gave skyrim a positive review now im leaving this negative review for garry himself since hes such a  i wish i never bought this game and supported this guy though i admired it from afar once i got it in my hands it really is not that fun anyway note the time played

garry has insulted and attempted to humiliate those who stand against monetising mods for valve and the developers profit if not stopped now he will spread this evil idea to gmod and that will spell the end of a years long community experience i will not support this game as long as garry supports this incredibly vile business practice

pay for mods for a mod my brain

edit im still going to keep this here so paid mods have been removed for now however if they return in the future i have no doubt garry will attempt to have them added to here so i am going to caution people against that also the community here is one of the most obnoxious ive ever seen in the gaming community so dont expect much out of that either v original review v looks to be heading in the paid mods direction of which i want no part of mods make this game typical of that scumbag garry to try capitalize on this too avoid the publisher facepunch at all costs i somehow doubt his cute little company would survive the backlash if this happens unlike bethesda this isnt a massive aaa title company
