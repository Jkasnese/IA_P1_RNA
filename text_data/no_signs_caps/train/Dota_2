the pub support where are wards the pub carry demanded i placed them and they were countered the support began i am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more also possibly sentries to remove their up cour pls the mid hero politely added give savle the carry demanded certainly replies the support using the salve on the carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave so where is mek the carry said after he was ganked due to overextending the support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse again having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards i dont think a 7 minute mek is viable the support replies haha look your level so low noob the carry retorted u have no item xaxa well jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which i attempted to give you the carry the priority over the carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower oblivious to the enemy tp that the support moved away from report support usless the carry cried in allchat in between mentioning various aspects of the supports mothers anatomy instead of reporting and acting like that why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry the support asked as he watched the carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps hah support is for noskill noobs like you

dota 2 is the official sequel to the highly popular mod for blizzards warcraft iii defense of the ancients a mod that has been worked on by many and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong a lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between blizzard and valve last year and it ended to valves favor the dota name and franchise is now legally a part of valve probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of icefrog the year before dota 2 is a realtime strategy game in the subgenre called moba multiplayer online battle arena a genre that has grown rapidly the past few years with different type of alterations in favor of success dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular moba right behind the giant league of legends just like lol dota 2 is gaining success throughout its competetive esport scene and its clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position the latest and biggest tournament was the international 2013 which included a total prize pool of over 28 million us dollars which was the biggest prize pool in esport history gameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master the map consists of 3 lanes that are constantly being pushed by npc creeps you are controlling a hero amongst 4 other in your team and are fighting against 5 in the opposing team the goal is to push your heroes and npc creeps to the enemy base where you have to destroy the ancient it sounds pretty easy but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics plus the over 100 heroes you get to play and face after 300 hours i have only touched what i call the more advanced mechanics and i am not even close to professional level the most experienced players have around 5000 hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past 3 years to dota 2 since the game is extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play these type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players there is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there beware though  the tutorial does not cover any russian dota 2 might be competetive extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap but it is still the game that i have spend the most time playing on steam mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it somehow i keep returning to it so i suppose i am enjoying it you better have people to play with though and you better not be good friends  because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe its  with it until you hate each other only play this if you plan on getting some mental disorder time will fly and you will realize you still suck and people hate you no matter what its free so why do you need a review anyway translations german

i originally played dota when it was merely a ums on wc3 so take this review for what its worth dota 2 is an addictive experience however this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society if that statement is an insufficient description of the game continue reading this game is not for the casual gamer this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game if you play this game i can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard i have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play no matter what you do you will encounter someone who will complain about something youre doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you i can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with so here are what i consider the pros and cons of the game pros this is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing free to play with optional cosmetic costs gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection this in effect increases replayability tremendously wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more this in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game cons this game has a steep learning curve believe me there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance unlike hero customization in league of legends not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either it can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection but thus is dota secondary to the steep learning curve games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team this can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of fundamentals of gameplay video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have suffice to say many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team the player loses gold and the other team gains gold this doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay unlike other video game developers steam does not region lock this brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference you can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when theres a russian only speaker spanish only speaker and a portuguese only speaker on the us west server blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in america unfortunately this is by far the worst aspect of the game the game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future more often than not an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions there is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 1020 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier this review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary of course if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy final rating game 910 game community 310

after wasting my 1500 hours on it i think i can say something about this game first of all this review is not a humorous one im writing it seriously to give information about this game because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters i think this review will be informative for these people gamers who has spent couple of hours like me knows everything i am going to try to tell after this short introduction we can start russians problem is not about being russian due to the games popularity among russian players there are too many bad always swears doesnt play as its a team game doesnt speak english in eu servers etc russian players but there are also too many nice russian players briefly the problem is not about being russian if there are 10 gamers in dota 4 of them will be bad players if there are 1000 400 of them thats the point if you want to play this game to get relaxed dont do it after few matches you will find yourself more depressed angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed the bad players are the reason for it as an illustriation you started a game to get enjoyed looked the picks someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said me mid or me solo etc ok thats right you are still relax you picked a support for your team they somehow fed the enemies ok still you are relaxed they started to argue with each other they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry and then you will lose the game this type of games are not so rare in dota 3 over 10 games are being played according to this nutshell therefore it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota then why people still playing it too much why there is not just bad players in the community now because it is addictive you can not get rid of it if someone trolls your game you want to play again and wish to play with better players if you win the game you want to win again and increase your mmr if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back shortly you will want to play again after every game however if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want this reason is pointless for you meaningless mmr system when i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players however the system is completely meaningless player profile and skills are same at 1k2k and 3k mmr once you get your mmr it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it 25 every lose decrease it 25 and as i said before player profile is same at 1k 2k and 3k when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc it is completely up to your team so how people get too high mmrs they have this mmr at the begining and how they did it there is no clear information about it valve does not announce how it is being calculated for example i played 10 first ranked games with 8 wins i played support and carries buy wards and couriers when i was support i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry but my mmr was 2200 when some people get 4k starting mmr this system also a fact about this games addiction but doesnt help kind players about creating a better environment all in all i dont recommend this game just because of its community the game is a master piece master of mobas it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game it has great graphics etc however it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it on the other hand if you have a great mental power and patience play it i completely recommend it this review was written for normal patience leveled people i dont say dont waste your time go and do some social activities if u want to play video games dont play it go and play more enjoying games lastly i have an advice for valve it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota people who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players as defined at the beginning they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased now it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling i hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends d some suggestions i wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate i lost my will to play dota however then thanks to some sensitive comments i started to play dota only with my friends now i have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as i mentioned in my review months ago as some people say in comments of this review play this game with your friends after writing this review i have rarely played solo games and it feels better participate in some tournaments after lots of bad pub match experiences that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience you can participate in esls or other platforms open tournaments for free finallynever give up you can encounter very kind players as well after a bad pub game performance your teammates maybe say uninstall dota etc but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends just do not give any importance what they say you can see similar things in this reviews comments section there are very kind sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing offensive comments same is true for the player profile in dota just dont give any importance what the haters say final note for the guys who say why dont u recommend the game while playing it too much please read the review again this review is a complete answer to your question good luck & have fun d unfortunately io lost the arcana showdown  edited game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected some suggestions section added thank you all for suggestions comments and rate ups

dota 2 is quickly becoming the most played game on steam and for good reason the blend of wellbalanced multiplayer infinite replayability gorgeous aesthetics and the time and care valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection i simply cannot reccomend dota 2 enough the game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes and each one feels unique and welldesigned in any given match you take control of a singular hero and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team unfortunately the barrier of entry is high quite a lot of research preparation and knowledge is required to be sucessful and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly however tutorials are available to guide new players and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a fiveman black hole or pulling off that perfect blinkpoof combo spectacularly enough the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines dota tv is an ingame spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments including the multimillion dollar international that valve hosts on a yearly basis and all of this for free there are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way they are mostly designed by members of the community and can be purchased or recieved randomly while playing content patches and new heroes are being added all the time dota 2 will continue to grow for years hopefully continuing to find new players interested in a fastpaced online multiplayer experience that is equal parts exhilirating and engaging

dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena moba for short in dota 2 is a pure freetoplay game which means that you dont have to unlock heroes maps or other stuff the only way to be good at dota 2 is to know the game you need to know every single item and hero to become a really good player and thats the reason i like this game so much however this can be a problem for new players you dont know anything about the game when you spawn in your base with 4 teammates so what is this game all about well you play as one of the 105 available heroes and you have to destroy the enemy base sounds easy right well to do that you have to fight your way through towers creeps and of course the other team at the start of the game you just stay in your lane and farm and harass enemies by attacking or even ganking them after this laning stage is completed your team and the enemy team will face eachother in so called teamfights after a while one team will have a large gold and experience advantage and they will push to the other teams base and then of course destroy it verdict  i really enjoyed and still enjoy this game dota 2 isnt a paytowin game which makes this game much more enjoyable dota 2 also has the best esports support you can easily watch a match and select one of the several broadcasters to make watching esport matches more enjoyable the only downside of dota 2 is the fact that youll need a lot of knowledge to be good at this game if you manage to survive all the mean teammates and learn everything about the game youll easily spend 200 hours on dota 2 if not youll quit within 20 hours score 91100

i used to play lol and sunk more money into that game than i care to admit the great thing about dota is every hero is unlocked from the start lol has a limited selection of free champions every week which is fine but your options are limited during drafting i found myself buying champs that were popular in the current meta just to compete i havent played lol in months since getting into dota how can i this game is so much more complex which is daunting at first but the more you learn and play the better it gets every day i learn something new i try a new hero or two and its awesome highly recommend checking out httpwwwredditcomrlearndota2 as well as httpdota2gamepediacomdota_2_wiki  httpwwwdevileskcomdota2appsinteractivemap2 is a great map i may have spent more time watching gameplay vidsstrats and tournaments than actually playing the game the in game spectating client is very well done it even has casters lol is just lol it doesnt compare

imagine for a moment that it is christmas morning your home is abuzz with laughter and the smell of fresh baked goods drifts up from downstairs you race to the tree and begin to open a beautiful present adorned with festive colors and a wrapping scheme that is both dauntingly complex yet also simple in its execution you turn to your mother father and two siblings and smile for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin you go to open your unwrapped box and bwong a horn bellows deafening you out of the box pops a small dwarflike figure wielding a multicultural bat festooned with ecuadorian and peruvian patterns and of russian construction thanks for standing still ganker he shrieks as he wallops young brother timmy in the teeth your mother tuts and scolds him for being out of position the dwarf darts under the tree looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of ratdota gank him  blyat your father roars as he sits on the couch lazily and watches you crawl desperate for your gift of victory over the rat under the tree and he continues to elude you suddenly with a flourish he produces a lighter and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering gg 2 ez and your family sits in the living room muttering garbage team and reported your family home burns down around them and only you escape the engulfing flames accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf downtrodden but not easily bested you begin your walk down the street to your friends house in the hopes that by having christmas at their house you might be able to somehow catch the multicultural dwarf on the second try 1010 best fun and peruvian simulator

dota 2 ranks among few titles that can be classified as truly freetoplay while many other titles label themselves with this distinction there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions while dota 2 has an extensive cash shop all offerings are completely cosmetic hud options voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase all gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of ingame currency once a player has determined that theyre ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates again learn with friends to reduce this aspect dota 2 is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made every match is different and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse its twenty to fortyfive minutes of gladiatorial bliss the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow dota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement and its a title that rewards users for a deep dive heavy investment heavy reward the barrier to entry isnt quite as bad as it was years ago but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesnt have a colossal learning curve as a freetoplay title readily available on steam it offers players a frictionless doorway  but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning playing and enjoying dota 2 the game is in a strong place right now its rewarding and sociable like few other games and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered the next few months will be crucial its currently the best expression of valves progressive attitude towards players and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one were used to just remember to spend your starting cash and make sure someone buys the courier oh and when riki starts showing up in your games just get some sentry wards down and dont run away also you always want a bottle when in midlane and runes spawn at 000 and again every two minutes practice lasthitting before you go online and if youre jungling memorise where the lowlevel creeps are actually you know what forget all that just have fun 4 out of 5

if youre looking for a league of legends clone look elsewhere if youre looking for a moba that you can play for a couple weeks or even months and become good at look elsewhere ive been playing dota 2 for around 10 years since it was dota the warcraft iii custom map and ill tell you right now theres still a lot of room for personal improvement this game boils down to far more than individual skill tactics and teamworkcooperation the author of three lane highway see pcgamercom has called dota an isometric wizardem up game and i think its fitting there are so many aspects to this game so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all itll take you a couple hours and youll still miss some i have played pretty much every single multiplayer online battle arena on the market and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay i always end up coming back to dota if you want to seriously challenge yourself and you have the will and motivation to work towards a lofty goal that many are unable to reach this is the game for you

indepth competitive scientifically proven approved by church of england and american monster truck foundation true mlg review on awardwinning game heroes of league of autists 2 alright guys listen my name is [ig] d[andi] singsing aka wilddigger1998ua and i will throw some of my wild gameplay suggestions in a game that is totally not corrupted by trends pro leagues where people play like lobsters on acid denying your own aegis because you click like a frenzied ape when nothing around is happening and totally not toxic community where every ivan george and pingpongclingclong is a distinguished pro gamer with 200 years of training at icefrogs monastery of enlightement somewhere inbetween tibets asscheeks okay lets go this riding on cat mirana chick with face that looks like she just seen a dolphin putting on a condom her ultimate allows teammates to get invisibility for given time which can for instance save your carry support who is getting dived by frenzied bristleback and enemy mid hero with 2 runes up his butt so just press r  and since they didnt have any dusts  your carry is safe haha no we cant have any of that i need more damage on my arrow that i will miss anyway plus if my allies are dying i can just blame them instead of doing anything if they are russians  just double your blame output okay so we have that hero spector but it doesnt look like this gay guy from bioware game so she has ability to move through obstacles and units has free tons of pure damage cant be reduced by armor on every illusion and map presense with her ultimate that allows her to fight at any given time without leaving her farming spots until necessary and with high enough agility her illusions can just inflict enough damage so your team can fight freely while you patiently taking your farm so what do we do of course we aint gonna do any of that we will get her phase boots because spectral dagger is clearly not enough we will never ever get free damage on carry and we get a bloody skill that blocks and returns damage instead when enemy team has like ugh same damage output as yoursand you have no hp yet anyway get vanguard that just doesnt work because of dota 2s rng programming and then will farm radiance till 50 timemark because expensive aura with items green damage that doesnt work on illusions even though aura does work and can do a lot of good things like blocking enemys blink dagger that will be blocked by your ult in a second anyway is clearly better than statgain or manaburn okay so we have that orange bird guy that can hold solo lane against 2 or 3 people with minimum deaths except some specific combos that just screw up his escape and set of abilities that allows to eviscerate enemy team if your allies have at least anything to hold them in place what are we gonna do with this hero you may ask of course we will put him on a support role and make him buy mekansm so he would never have any mana for his high damage dots that also have ridicilous slow debuff and ult that is easily countered only like by ten heroes out of 150 we have mirana without ultimate to go get all this exp remember alright these situations are obviously too situative so we will talk about global scale meta lets get to most obvious question what hero should we pick the answer is  pudge you need mid  you pick pudge you need support  you pick pudge you need offlane jungler roamer carry social worker girlfriend president of the united states of murrica  just pick pudge why because someone did that on twitchtv you silly noob cheekyscrublord you of course have same skill as pro players so you can just mimic them and game will be magically won you dont need to think about anything just buy recommended items and blame your teammates if something is wrong you got a motherflipping dragonclaw hook afterall if you bought an item that is worth of 3 years of your school lunchboxes  nobody will have enough guts to argue with your divine skill in pressing q button at cursor location to lasthit a creep mute everyone at the start of the game just in case tho next important issue is map presense lane control creep control ability to analyze situation counterwarding and all that important elements of this pseudostrategical map game for all of that just remember these two lines buy wards where the gang it is important that you will never type gank properly this is basically all you need to know about this game remember its not important to win its the whole competetive spirit and sportsmanship that matters everyone has around 50% winrate anyway because of matchmaking and elo system in rankeds is based on wizardscience and tarotfortunetelling its supposed to work only in chess anyway yeah developers may tell you their rating system is not based on elo but can volvo really pull off their own mathematic rating model for the game that after all these years still lags when someone is picking a hero armor rating still doesnt work properly and hero with 320 movespeed can chase down and kill hero with 350 because of model animation oooh i think not anyway i give this game 100 dirty apes out of 100 and encourage you to start playing as fast as possible to join in most viral addiction the world ever saw since taking heroin rectally poping polyethylene packages or throwing water filled condoms out of the window became a thing

ah my dota you are my bliss and you are my sorrow sometimes i wonder how i would feel if i had not met you on that day all those years ago would i be a happier or a sadder man than i am now what is certain is that of all the games i have played i have spent more time with none other than you for those of you who have no idea what im talking about let me introduce you to dota 2 valves faithful sequel to a game that can most easily be described to the uninitiated as a mix between the rts and rpg genres the game consists of two 5man teams with each player choosing a unique hero and fighting to destroy the opposing teams throne it sounds simple enough but once you mix in the seemingly myriad number of heroes to choose from the race to level up faster than your opponents and the vast array of items to buy you have one of the deepest and most competitive games on the planet

i guess i have to review this game because ive banked so many hours into it ill keep it brief dota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created your team will let you down constantly the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most you will never get the hat drops you want and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are or more likely force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more itll turn you into a monster and destroy your life itll murder your loved ones and feed them to you but youll play it anyway youll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way will have no conceivable effect on anything you will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning basically the same feeling you get when you play dota 2 and dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life so the next day youll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame staving off the moment when youll have to face your demons for as long as you can you will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your mmr was or your sunstrike accuracy so what are you waiting for you worthless peons get out there and dance dance for the puppetmaster gabe go earn your hats you craven mongrels 010 would not recommend to anyone but cant stop playing and wont be able to stop you either

dota 2 is a very highly skilled game dont expect to walk in and expect you being very good you are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but thats just the nature of this game dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies anicent if you destory it you win the ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom middle and top you take control of a unit that is a hero many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as crystal maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game you are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players you need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell there is 107 heros in dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the warcraft iii they are categorised into 3 groups strenght which are usually the tanky guys agility most carries are found in this category and intelligence which most of the supports are usually found all these heroes have different skill levels such as invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells he is able to create spells with 4 of his spells creating the other 10 he is able to create tornados which disable enemies meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it just an all round crazy hero viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells passive spells are spells that work all the time you dont need to activate them and 2 other spells which are targetable you can customise your dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include glados and the narrator from the stanley parable you can change your hud to different themes the game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool most of the time it is 25% in 2014 the international is a annual tournment created by valve for dota 2 in 2014 the prize pool for this tournment became 109m dollars first place got 5m dollars if you are into esports then this game will be up your ally dota 2 is a hard game but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot if you arent sure you want to play this game you can pm me and i can teach you how to play i honestly dont mind

this is yet another new release by the company moba you may know this company from their popular games such as league of legends dead island epidemic and dawngate this is a very slow paced first person shooter set in the age after the 3rd great war in which humanity has been set back in the ages where magic was still okay to use in this game you play as an ex soldier trying to defeat the main communist overlord sniper who threatens america as we know it the single player aspect of this game is probably the best experience youll have in this game as the online is currently dead the developers stopped updating this game after league of legends was confirmed to be more balanced and a hell of a lot better they did however unlock a new game mode called compendium in which you simulate reading a book and collect trading cards ill give this game 3 meepos out of 5 its okay but the fact that youre required to be able to speak russian to get this game really lets it down

im only talking from my experience in pubs it feels gratifying when you win it feels frustrating when you lose in dota 2 you will lose alot whether you want it or not what matters in this game isnt your hero or this pointless counter picking your performance is solely dependant on skill experience and reaction time however no matter how good you are defeat is inevitable with a bad team at the beginning when youre matched with new players such as yourself this can be quite infuriating and almost made me stop playing after approximately 10 hours thats why i strongly advise you to play with friends so you actually have a coordinated team about the game itself its a solid moba [enwikipediaorg] with a big diversity of unique heroes the majority of the community is quite unpleasant at times and isnt very beginnerfriendly which can be really offputting if you ignore these people aka muting and just keep doing your thing you will find yourself genuinely having fun after 50 hours 50 hours sounds kinda extreme but it really isnt this is the kind of game you can spend thousands of hours on and you still wont be able to fully master it if youre ready to go through all this hardship and frustration go for it i highly recommend dota 2 if youre looking for a casual multiplayer game that you can get into quickly stay away from this

this game allows you to exert your knowledge and understanding of layered mechanics and exceptions of those game mechanisms onto randomlyselected regional people without their permission or interest heated debates can lead to forged alliances to achieve that common goal or end into displaced frustration projected onto others to substitute ones own failures and inabilities to execute ones characters heroes qualities on the other hand this game allows one to create hero build guides as a pretense to be productive with hisher vexation as well as to fruitlessly raise the standard of expected knowledge of the game through item and ability walkthroughs in hopes that those one encounters in the future rely on these indirect serviced suggestions

the first time you play you will have a very unpleasant experience and most likely uninstall the game within a few days however youll feel an urge to play it youre going to watch videos of pro people teaching you how to play and youre going to think that now youre really good youre wrong over time however things will get better and youll actually start winning then you start losing again but this time its not your fault its your teams fault always remember that nothing is ever your fault your dumbass antimage was complaining that you were stealing his farm but its your farm dammit then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier when the real reason he lost is because he didnt give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5 and they even have the nerve to question your methods then you notice that your dumbass antimage is in the jungle farming because he couldnt farm in lane you know however that he is just a noob eventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s and the game is obviously over this is the time when you give up and sit in base ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up its better if you just quit now while youre waiting in base make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss make sure you type in allchat team noob followed up by report antimage if they ask why you want them to report him ignore them if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves repeatedly say phrases such as lol ur so bad and ur just mad cuz you cant play you could also take the alternative route and say things like    and     yea the game and communtiy can be a  sometimes but its also a super fun game that requires fast paced decision making as well as strategical analysis plus it unifies gamers and conservatives by creating one common hatred russians all in all this game is 90% getting  and 10% feeling like youre on top of the world but that 10% makes you feel sooooo good that it keeps pulling you back

reposting since under the old review system i would be forced to recommend that people play this this game is like a shower fight between you and another naked man youre both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay when you slip over and land painfully on your  the other guy completely by accident gets his soapstained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though its the other way around youre the noob who cant get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try the other guy in the tub is the  from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter antimage puck ursa or some other broken class and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end the guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who even though youre farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them insists youre killing them the wrong way and are therefore an idiot noob the naked shower fight is also a oneway road once you jump in there is virtually no returning you become enslaved and before long all youll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota you wont even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved by dota or lol the video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality people who play mobas and people who dont neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave starcraft and wow in the dust if you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is people will just yell at you because youre terrible at the game and dont consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute individual step taken throughout the game if you want to get good you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference ingame if at all if you do otherwise you will get yelled at every single time without exception to not get yelled at you have to assimilate into the formless mass this is all a part of the selfenslavement process you wont come back ever and within a month youll find yourself just parrotting the same  people were yelling at you for earlier because youll be one of them by that point and you literally will not return youll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language

finally reviewing this game best moba imo if you think you are a kind or calm person try this game out you will discover one of the dark sides of you 99% guaranteed playing this game you would rage blame be a racist person which is typical you would not be kind to a newcomer  them for ruining the game right also you will be proven that hell is real in this game noob hell that is its a high learning curve game if you are a newbie to this kind of genre or this game in particular think carefully about getting into it not just because its very hard to get the basic right but also it will slowly consume your life look at the average player spending their time in this game look at my record gg no refund on your life spent legal addiction despite all this you should enjoy the game once everythings in place this game hands down gives the best feeling of victory ever as well as the worst feeling ever if you get to play with stupid people in your team this game requires skill and teamwork the more you play the better you are it would be ideal to play with your friends so its easier to work together as a team solo is a bit of a gamble the community is toxic if you cant deal with something like this you should avoid it this is quite normal in competitive games victory matters you know there is a mute option too on the racist part some people are branded as noobs depending on the region russian on eu pinoy on sea you will encounter different kinds of bad words again depending on the region some examples are  tangina pota bobo gago lanjiao sohai etc i know all of them including the meaning see play dota 2 for free language course being russian or pinoy doesnt mean you are a noob you should see this more as a joke there are pro russian and pinoy players some rank really high no need for it to be high bracket some can play well so it doesnt mean that its untrue its just true to some extent the game is freetoplay but you would eventually buy cosmetic items for your heroes anyway similar to csgo for some items the price can be ridiculous gl hf dont forget to blame people unreasonably if your team starts losing especially the mid

dota 2 is the semisequelremakerereleaseevolution of the longrunning warcraft 3 mod defense of the ancients which in itself was based on a custom map for starcraft called aeons of strife after the release of the original dota map in 2003 the warcraft 3 community began producing a long line of dota spinoffs sequels and mods just as eul dotas creator had used aos as inspiration for dota itself which culminated in the release of dota allstars by steve guinsoo feak allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the dota maps and mods in 2005 guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic icefrog who has been supporting updating and shaping dota ever since his changes have been the most significant the most popular the mod grew more during his time than ever before and arguably have benefited and enriched dota as a whole by 2010 dota allstars became simply dota and icefrog was showing no signs of stopping later that year dota 2 was formally announced with its development spearheaded by both icefrog and eul both of its most important authors its past and present alike entered a semiclosed beta in late 2011 and was finally officially released in mid2013 and the rest is history history lessons aside dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable over a hundred heroes each with at least four spellbased abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items from a massive arsenal of over a hundred games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes and possibly far more dotas metagame is constantly shifting and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 680 released earlier this year on top of that it is completely free to play with no features locked out to any players whatsoever not even cosmetic items which form the backbone of the games vast microtransactionbased economy these items are freely distributed by valve to all players through levelbased gift drops and randomchance item drops free game updates alter the game balance significantly while introducing new seasonal game modes and far more and thats not even scratching the surface of the games competitive scene with its many tournaments its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines all leading up to the annual valveorganized grand championship the international it may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first but given time patience simple memory and a keen mind anyone can ultimately come to see dota as perhaps the most enjoyable enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived oh and its sort of fun[b]

dota ii is a fun free to play game i have been playing its precursor since it was released as a mod for warcraft iii years ago i have sunk more than a 1000 hours as it never gets boring its a incredibly deep game which intergrates complex gameplay and mechanics its a very popular game when you notice the international competitive scene however be warned that this game has a steep learning curve and i still consider myself a casual gamer type for this game and as most multiplayer game you will encounter abrasive players in the community which could ruin the experience though that can bes fixed by muting or reporting the players

dota 2 is one of if not the most frustrating and aggravating game ever created your teammates will cater the enemy team not back you up and refuse to call missings or place wards the enemy team will always pick combos or  heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick 4 carrys after you randomed phantom assassin and tell you to buy the wards every other game you will get a russian pudge picker that feeds 3 kills mid in 5 minutes and immediately ruins all the work youve done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane youll rage and call gg early and trash talk your teammates but youll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around as things start to finally look good you get bashed 5 times in a row by a faceless void or the ogre magi will get a 4x multicast on you 2 times in a row while the natures prophet is pushing your top barracks but after all the rage inducing pain you keep playing you suffer through it for the chance of that amazing satisfying comeback even though youre 20000 gold behind the enemy team only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient but you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory even so after the game youll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your 60 minutes of pain and suffering when you finally get that mythical youve always wanted valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless its a drug that once hooked to is almost impossible to break you almost dont even realize youre raging and forget that youre telling your best friend how much of a feeding  he is and how this lost game is because of him when youre the one who has 1 kill and 13 deaths you keep playing in hope that youll get good enough where youll be able to play with dendi or the other pros and you know thatll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day i would not wish this addiction on my worst enemy but i cant stop you nor can i stop playing myself

i hate this game so much it hurts so much i cry every time i see a  i am pretty sure after almost 800 hours of dota 2 i have developed a deep understanding of the russian language i even grew wings and taped almost 300 popsicle sticks together and superglued a flashlight to the end of it and starting yelling gibberish with a thick accent

i have been a gamer for my whole life but i never really put a ton of time into any one game in the early 2000s when i had a lot of free time quake 3 elite force jedi knight 2 et cetra all took up a ton of my time but as my age progressed i had less time to dedicate to gaming mass effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me but that was probably the most id invested in many years i currently have around 500 hours of dota 2 and dont plan on stopping anytime soon the gameplay is spectacular the community is great i have made more steam friends on this game than any other the meta is interesting the professional scene is a blast to watch and the game is extremely well supported  especially with the recent wraith nightlegion commander content update the thing is that im not great at dota 2 ive put almost 500 hours in and theres still more for me to learn  there are still some heroes i have yet to play it is a lot of investment but once you get it you will have an absolute blast edit just updating this now that ive put around 1600 hours in i still completely stand by everything that i said previously the game is super fun and im really enjoying playing with all of the friends ive made in it ive also experienced some of the negative parts of the community and theyre unfortunate but i must say that they are far and few between the community is largely welcoming and ive made some fantastic friends through it  ones i hang out with in real life now definitely play the game the learning curve is steep but entirely worth it

when you are done eating thanksgiving dinner at the kids table league of legends dota 2 welcomes you to the grownup table dota 2 has a level of depth and polish that the other moba games out there just hasnt seem to have reached yet what is remarkable is dota 2 has reached this level of depth and polish in a remarkably short amount of time what started as a relatively rough beta has blossomed into a competitive game that entertains captivates and truly engrosses people who are into competitive gaming valve has done a bang up job making this game free and having all of the buy stuff totally optional to those who are interested in it i think the method of giving people drops that they can decide to equip or unlock via unlocking chests is genius i hope they get all of the money

dota stands for defense of the ancients or as i like to call it dota the two is not to refer to the game being a sequel which it is but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game the objective is to turn it into dota 1 in dota you need to defend an ancient which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation since im one and twothirds bhuddist i usually end up defending one of them at random much like all the other players dota is a very unique game in that includes both offense and defense there are lots of characters and all of them are mostly good at different things in my opinion the best part of dota is playing it this is because dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies such as attacking the enemy teams ancient or defending your own ancient the goal of dota much like other games is to win if you become proficient at this skill you will win very often leading to more victories scientists show that six out of every three dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over this is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing dota takes a while to learn though and that is because it is an extremely offensive yet defensive game with many complicated nuances like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good one interesting feature of dota is that dying is really bad in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long like when halo 3 would just beep at you instead of spawning you and youd get really angry except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs defense vs offense why did i write a third position in that last sentence excellent question there are neutral enemies in the game and they usually dont do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral if you dont respect their space however you may find that they beging to fight back much like an offensive form of selfdefense early in a match of dota you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls also called town portal scrolls or town portal scrolls for short why did i mention town portal scrolls multiple times good question that is because there are multiple teams once youve bought items you go kill enemy creeps and they arent people so its ethically sound and completely morally fine to do  once youve spilt some blood or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up that is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points and that usually transfers to you after they die think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system once youve levelled up and gotten rich you can buy better items that make you stronger and then get new abilities like skills active abilities passive abilities or passiveaggressive abilities these abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice once youve become the best allaround person you can be or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average resets between games so you never get bored its time to go tear down the other teams towers those like many buildings in the united states canada or certain us territories will fight back and damage you and then eventually go and destroy their ancient which is what the a stands for in dota that makes your team the winner and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts

much of what you have heard of dota 2 is probably true it is an often cruel tricky to approach and that requires huge amounts of time to master it is these characteristics however to make it a game unique depth and the potential rewards that can give a feeling of conquest actually earned a high price and therefore real tangible all this long to find in a relatively short time a team more or less sets of people with whom it is possible to cooperate and communicate effectively since the nature of the deep tactical gameplay makes it almost impossible to be accompanied by casual players and hope to derive mutual benefit and fun especially in the long term now that dota 2 is available for all the challenge of numbers with the main competitor league of legends can begin in the face of a rock starting even steeper valve from its experience exceptionally balanced and truly free from the need to open your wallet not counting infrastructure for the live broadcast of the games can be the envy of every another developer moba if the work on accessibility will continue in the right direction this could make the confrontation one of the most exciting and interesting in recent years

league of legends has the spanish this has the russians these two games have brought out a racist side in me that i never thought existed while having 1000 hours played in lol and developing a strong hatred for the spanish and any other culture that speaks something close to spanish this game has also made me develop a hatred for the russian community as you can see ive only played 50 odd hours of this game at the time this review was made but if i had to add at least one positive note to this review its this ive mananged to learn russian in only a few hours grasping the most important phrase  blyat this phrase runs through my mind every day of every minute i sometimes even say it to myself in my head irl when i see someone doing something moronic this game is a russian weapon developed by putin himself to enslave the world along with the help of whatever leader brazil has right now while most of the friends i play with play lol i quit that in order to seek refuge from the spanish epidemic there is over there but instead have been sucked into this south americarussian racism simulator wasting most of the extra money i have on steam to buy cosmetic items for heroes ive just played i never liked history when in school i hated it with a passion just like the americans with their hatred for the russians this game has taught me everything i need to know on why to hate russia how to hate russia and question the very existance of that country based on the ape like intelligence that ive seen coming from the country in short if youve always been a saint in your life never swore never hated another culture never thought of abusing everyone you know that doesnt speak english that well then id suggest not playing mobas entirely all jokes aside if cancer had to be a game this would be it without a thought what valve has done is develop a way of making world war 3 possible along with the help of putin and his various ape test subjects that ive encountered in the game 1110 would keep playing

dota 2 is my favorite way the program lets me assume the role of another creature helping me experience our oneness with the universe i like to assume the position of the dinosaurriding lightningwielding halflizard halfman i like to join servers with up to nine other disciples be disruptor as he is called and go to the jungle closing my eyes there i concentrate on my breathing the other disciples woefully always curse at me i usually have to mute them i do so to concentrate on being one with the virtual nature i cant afford to go to national parks so this is the best thing sometimes i see lots of colorful exclamations points and these ping ping ping ping ping sounds occur around my character they are beautiful one time someone said the  level 1 disruptor buy courier you ing  and the truth is there are many players like him they arent at peace with themselves perhaps if he came into the forest and hummed koans with me and he had done so as the giant walking tree then he would see his greater consciousness all the negative energy would leave his body and wed share a moment of experiencing our buddha nature in my experience sessions last about 1020 minutes and initially it did not take long to find a server apparently ive been moved to lowpriority matchmaking but thats okay i just assume the lotus position in my chair and wait patiently the only downside to this is that sometimes i forget to click the accept button

hi i only recommend you this game if you love mobas but i didnt like mobas and now i have 1200 hours in it i was a cod player an mw2 player of course you will not be pro in your first matches to be good you need a lot of training if you played lol and you have 30 lvl its sure you know the basics in this game the most important thing is the last hitting at the start because if you have more gold and xp than your enemy you own the game the game may be boring but if you have friends it wont be i think the boring part is the first 13 lvl because you cant play some gamemodes before that if you are new here you need to complete the training if you are totally new here completing the training will get you a sniper set no the setts doesnt give you any bonus just the enemy can see how rich you are these decorative items have degree common uncommon rare mythical immortal old and arcane this items can be normal auspicious heroic cursed and unusual so these were the decorative items lets talk about the ingame items you start with 625 gold each hero have their own item build i recommend you the healing slave tango and clarity items this items will fill your hp or your mana if you are new or never played that hero before i recommend you the guides up left the book icon i recommend you the greysharkruua builds or purgeeng builds thank you for reading this review p3d0hungariandota2fan

dota or defense of the ancients was the first of its kind and originally started off as a warcraft 3 custom map but it quickly grew to become one of the most popular games in the world as well as spawning a whole new genre which we know today as mobas the game is simple 5v5 3 lanes and both teams objective is to destroy the other teams ancient there are over 100 heroes in the game each with their own unique skills and attributes and forming a well rounded team with synergy is key to victory closing notes  the community can be awful you will get yelled at flamed and even reported for making mistakes if you can overcome this the game is amazing
recommended
massive learning curve i am at the bottom of it but here is my fresh perspective on this game dont get into this game if youre not willing to learn a lot or sacrifice plenty of your time once you reach a high skill level you understand the game at its core and you also find the right people to play with this game is the most enjoyable game you can possibly play that is if you have the patience to get there the community is great overall the game is flawless valve is doing a great job with this one competitive scene is the healthiest ive seen and ive watched countless competitive matches so damn entertaining just look at this httpwwwyoutubecomwatchv8hbr1egx1i better than lol by a long mile

an accurate representation of pubbing in this game would be to imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life each turd represents an average public game now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar it is the best feeling in the world that chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar

i really cant say anything other then this game is ing amazing look at all the hours ive spent in the game you all are probably like well there are these people who have spent thousands of hours in the game so thats not many but do take into account that my total time owning this game hasnt even exceeded a year yet there is not a day i remember since i got this game that i havent at least opened dota 2 usually to play a public game sometimes to play a bot game and sometimes to brush up on hero knowledge and look at guides this game will ruin your life and obliterate all your free time my only warning to new players is that the community it pretty toxic to new players and not everyone speaks english just mute anyone calling you a noob flaming you etc but never do so to the people that legitimately want to help you overall rating 11610

still waiting for volvo to giff diretide fun game better played with friends however becuse the main problem is the community most players you encounter will not speak english so it may benefit you to have a russian portugese and spanish dictionary at your side if you are new to the game do not use the builds you see pros use they build situationally the builds they use are not good for every situation at all also if you do not take criticism well dota2 is not for you the worst player on your team will blame you for everything that goes wrong like seriously if you cant handle an insult play something else these people are  regardless of the community and the lack of diretide overall volvo did a good job on dota graphics are great mechanics are great and it is a fun time overall besides the general rudeness of other there generally are very few bugs with the game and it generally runs very smoothly if you are new i strongly recommend doing training before anything else and playing against bots until you are fairly confident in yourself it takes time for you to fully understand dota and no you can not jump hopefully next update youll be able to wink wink volvo unlike other  mobas cough cough league cough cough you do not have to spend any money on dota the only things there is to buy is cosmetic items which you will be able to get for free as soon as volvo fixes the drop system i strongly recommend dota if you dont have friends a life or any desire to find love as dota will slowly consume your life and always remember  magic  antimage

liked  graphic  gameplay disliked  people who ruin the game on purpose feeding abandoning games etc  people who think heshe is the best and talk bad things to hisher fellow players conclusion i recommend this game as everything came from the game is good enough only the community of players that need to behave properly

one of my favorite games in my library my play time reflects how much time i have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game supports who actually support the team carries who can carry the team to victory and players who can execute a base push as timely as the new york sunway by the way i love subway sandwiches i eat a blt without the t almost every week bacon is the most delicious meat lettuce is like the cup to the tea party you cant have tea without water and you cant hold water without cups unless of course you use your hands or your mouth but lettuce cups are pretty delicious so imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes which while they rhyme with potato dont taste anything similar if potatoes tasted like french fries tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables speaking of wet tables if you put water on tables it gets wet not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated what is 6x6 its like 64 or something which is like 10 if you add them all together what does that mean i am not sure math is hard unlike dota2 which is a great game especially as a carry actually i never played carry before it seems like a pretty easy job thoughjust kill things until you win the game that is a pretty simple job description unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle i mean jungle is a location how is it a job it is more like a forest than a jungle i mean jungles have lions and stuff right forests have angry bears i am not sure where manbirds and horsemen are from though horses arent jungle creatures i think they sound more like mountain creatures to be honest i havent seen a troll before or a gnoll but i bet they are forest creatures as well too so jungle should really be called forest mid is a pretty self explanatory position its the middle of the map lane like if you had 3 lanes he would take the second one or she there are female heroes as well are they called heroines well i wouldnt want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug that would be sexist i mean playing lina is pretty addicting though fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire  its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx thats what lina is which reminds me that pokemon recently came out x and y are pretty popular with my friends so i wamt a 3ds those things cost money though but i head i can trade my items for cash that sounds pretty amazing earning money while palying games its like the american dream for people who dont want actual jobs not that i have a job yet all i do is stay home and read manga which is pronounced mane gah like mango but with an a i sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa so offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane so the dangerous lane as they would call it it isnt very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys its like chinese vampires and running water i dont think they can cross running water many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing one flush of the toilet and the go poof or do they i actually know nothing about chinese vampires i only know vampires from the books my friends lent me it was the twilight saga i really preferred the jacob to the other guy though i was pretty upset when bella made the wrong choice i mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted plus the other guy was like 439434 years old yuck so support is the last job you can play not only do you provide moral support because most teams dont ever have asupport but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy like a slave donkey to carry your items for you he can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price why wouldnt i want another donkey instead of one flying one i am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one i mean how would you even catch a flying donkey it could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror but donkeys are pretty cute so keep them on the ground if donkeys were meant to fly god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic so that is dota its a pretty good game but it has some problems too after all even blts have ts here are the digusting parts of the blt games take a while to finish so if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game a game of dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours like i am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of dota i mean look at my avatar that is my face for like the first 5 minutes of dota before my legs fall asleep and i start getting cramps it also has too many different heroes i think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7 it would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldnt choose any hero it is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero you are literally counterpicked because you chose too early it would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option some game modes take forever like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans sometimes i want to make team electric but then a ban comes up and i accidentally ban mr thunder or the masked electric emo then team thunder is ruined i can understand why bans could be good though cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy he uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death sometimes he tickles you for extra damage what is worse is that he eats you he gets fatter and stronger the biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action but not enough story its like worse than dynasty warriors when it comes to story i could use a few cutscenes telling me why i am teaming up with a giant spider a porcupine a baby rock and a angel man at least there was a reason in dynasty warriors 7 about why i am fighting guan yu with my hated enemies the filthy wu were those filthy wu actually even men the way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians so i think i will give the game a 11014 its a pretty good game but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category i understand that every hero has its own lore but the bigger connection is quite lost when i team up with my biggest rival against my best friend a 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game people play like men instead of filthy wu women but ali why the 14 and not a 17 because the game has that huge tomato and i hate tomatoes i love blts without the t bl is the greatest invention of man till someone introduced the uncessary t i would have bl everyday if i could afford it but i have no job and spend all my time reading manga

if you can get past the initial learning curve and burden of knowledge the game puts on you then dota2 can be extremely rewarding as far as most mobas are concerned this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage the gameplay is as a result solid and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy the ui is a little underpopulated however and doesnt explain much learning how to do some of the functional things like leaving a game thats safe to leave or muting people or reporting people are not super intuitive you have to dig furthermore the options available though very powerful and plentiful are not explained super well as a result its important to toy around with your settings a bit which can be a hassle as far as the f2p model goes its pretty fair you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions the only thing they do is customize your aethetics and happily not to an extreme extent because of this the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear this might dissuade people from buying them because some of the items are barely even visible overall i would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge the game is not easy but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things veterans of the genre will find a lot to like

[today in international dota news] more peruvians are setting their preferred language to english without knowing a single word of it despair is on the rise filipinos are committing mass suicide in ranked matches shouting what frightened onlookers describe as a wew russians agree that the only heroes worth playing in the game are pudge invoker and sniper however russians themselves have no idea how to play these heroes and continue to yell incomprehensible profanities in the chats in other news it seems that mexicans are causing worldwide panic as they do nothing of value refuse to supportinitiatecarry steal vital last hitskills and feed on teams everywhere the mexicans strangely enough cannot see that what they are doing is not only wrong but is also making them look worse as a race and finally the number of english players is decreasing substantially as many take their own lives after losing match after match while on 4 stack teams of foreigners this however will hopefully force the now homeless peruvians and mexicans into joining the russian and filipino servers so they may kill eachother off at last bringing about the death of dota 2 and the start of world peace this has been russell stover with your international dota news and may god have mercy on us all

great moba game if your deciding to start on a moba game your probably going to choose between league of legends and dota 2 both are great games and i think dota 2 is a better expireance in my opinion here is why dota 2 all characters are free so you dont have to waste your time trying to unlock them the game takes more skill imo characters have a bigger learning curve the community is not toxic game allows you to use your mic you can turn off mic volume in less than a minute no micro transactions you can trade item sets aka skins you can combine item sets you can buy item sets on the steam market you can parts of item sets for money this list can go on for another 2000 words the game only has one map so the game probably sounds repititive but its not there is many ways to play the game such as carry support tank jungler etc when you check out this game it probably is going to look boring but definitly check this game out one of my favorite games

if you ever wanted to learn russian then this game is totally the best one to learn basic russian and insults at one place forget about school get dota and play with coldblooded russians which doesnt shrink back to insult you because youre not playing good with a hero which is in their opinion the easiest hero in the whole game well the only thing is that you cannot understand them while theyre talking ingame because theyre mainly talking russian get yourself a dictionary and start learning russian there its the best thing you can do 1010 would play it again

just like its previous installment when it all started back in warcraft 3 as a custom map dota 2 is pretty much the whole same thing with several new additions added to which couldnt happen before as someone whos been playing dota since its beginnings the first thing you may recognize and notice is that many of the games features such as map layout heroes and gameplay is almost exactly the same but with a better and more refined look with updated graphics making the entire map feel more lively and a refresh of old of course thats all good but at the heart of dota as many may know is its gameplay and replayability the amount of hours ive pumped back in the first dota was unforgettable clocking more than 2500 hours of time played just like dota 1 dota 2 shares the exact same formula pick a hero last hit creepsfarm up gold and win team fights to gain victory simple and straight forward right wrong if you played back in dota 1 youd come to realize the more you played it the game had a fairly high skill requirement in order to do well especially if youre pushing to be top in a region or tournament the amount of time and practice makes perfect as you will want to eventually learn every hero how they synergize and working together with your teammates it gets rough but extremely fun and satisfying especially if youre on high level play unfortunately though most people tend to ignore these kinds of games since difficulty is fairly high or they just cant stand to put the effort to actually play the game well and properly otherwise various issues can occur such as getting hate from other players and getting reported for not being able to play well its an immediate turn off and can easily have people packing their bags and finding another game unfortunately again this is thanks to the toxic communities that have spawned across all moba genre games you will always have to deal with these kinds of people who will give you  and you have to bare with it as those kinds of players wont be going away anytime soon i strongly believe competitive games have the highest chance to have ragers compared to other types of games out there and its tough to avoid the negativity that comes with it now with some additions theyve added a store where you can purchase from hero skins ui skins to different voices for the default announcer different couriers and sellingbuying through the steam market the thing that seperates skins here compared to others is that skins come in seperate armor pieces you can equip on a hero meaning you can say keep a helmet and sell the other parts like gloves to someone else on the steam market it goes to show how much control the players have and what they have in their hands the best part of all this is that all heroes are free right off the bat to everyone so no need to spend money and unlock the heroes you want to play it allows us as the players to explore and see what heroes we enjoy playing the most and if youre into cosmetics you also have the option to buy a skin the business model for me personally is fair and likeable as ive had no issues with it whatsoever its equal for both the customer and developer now while the gameplay is still the same and fun at its core what else has been added by valve well we now have various events that take from time to time usually worldwide holidays such as christmas or halloween are some examples these events bring in replay value to want and play the game more such as getting limited skins for heroes ui skins couriers or just straight up rare items that can be sold across the entire steam market so you can get some funds put into your wallet for perhaps other itemsskins on the market or even just saving up to buy another game entirely from either the steam store or ingame store theyve also made several changes to the ui compared to back in warcraft 3 the ui is bigger and straight forward and buying items through the shop are easily seen as everything is now categorized properly and accessing them with a simple click its easily noticeable but just in case you may have noticed some heroes have not been put into the game yet and are missing its mainly due to copyright issues with blizzard seeing as how brewmaster was a pandaren from warcraft and now valve has changed him to a koala beast of some sort in fact every champion for the most part have been changed in their appearance because dota started off by using blizzard races and even some famous lore characters such as thrall disruptor or rexxar beastmaster its certainly slowed down some heroes from being brought back the recent being legion commander male to female and terrorblade no longer the demon hunterillidan valve still has a few more heroes to change and get out such as techies so if youre a big techies fan andor mainer youre going to have to wait a while longer until valve finally pushes him out alright and now my few personal grips about this game other than having a toxic community as i mentioned earlier throughout these types of games i just do not appreciate or enjoy the art style that valve has brought into this game not in terms of quality but art style the quality is fine for some but most heroes i feel lost their identity and instead of something different or unique valve just made most of the heroes look ugly and feel uninspired in my honest opinion i mean now earthshaker now looks like a mutated version of beast from xmen with a mix of a koala similar to the new brewmaster hell i still appreciate blizzards art style so much more in warcraft 3 than this new look look at pudge and slardar they had the look voice and feel back in warcraft 3 but now its just not as strong anymore here even the almighty and fearful zeus doesnt look like an intimidating god anymore but a scientist another thing that i do not find a lot of fun a whole lot anymore is the gameplay itself yes the core gameplay its literally been the same thing over and over nothing new or innovative just a rinse and repeat of picking a hero farming up gold for items and winning team fights maybe its just me after playing thousands of hours in this genre or perhaps if you take a look past the gameplay and look at what it really offers theres really nothing going for it last hitting isnt fun anymore as thats all youre doing most of the time early on with team fights mid to late game unless you personally find it fun the worst part is you will fall behind if you say die a few times to an opponent carry it pigeon holds you because now your team has little to no retaliation or chance of hoping to win since that carry will just roll face your entire team and theres a decent chance someone on your team will call you out meaning more anger and frustration can occur i can safely say as a long time dota 1 playerfan dota is still fun but its not fun if you want to play decently at the average level because the amount of mechanics people know in that level will put you in a disadvantage if you just learn a few because most just dont have time to do it so what can i say i mean in the end this is basically dota 20 with better graphics same gameplay like the original a few added features like events and the ingame store associated with the steam market everything looks great except the art style for most heroes personal opinion and of course the ease of access to newcomers while it may seem straight forward it gets more complicated indepth meaning theres a harder learning curve and barrier to pass through to fully enjoy the game at its fullest meaning youll need to spend some time and practice

the games plot isnt really clear but the way i see it is that it is obviously a game about the problem with rapid assimilation of cultures and how conservativism leads to massive xenophobia causing a war between what i think is the texasmexico border on the rio grande though for some reason its russians and peruvians instead overall it really is a great free singleplayer title that experiments with how much you did or did not slack off in foreign language courses in high school while testing how racist you are capable of being

dota 2 has got to be the best thing ive played since i was born not only are the movement and combat more stable than bruce lee glued to a weeble wobble but ive accumilated over 30 hours and have not seen a single hacker if i could sum it up i would say its like chess rock paper scisors and torchlight 2 thrown into a blender to make the perfect moba playing this game lost me hours of my life that ill never get back and i dont want them back gold medals and cigars to valve once again

dota 2 one of the best mobas to date im very fond of this teambuilding strategy and interactive game dota is what started it all league of legends based off original dota this game is what started the moba hype though the game does have its faults the tutorial is a little rocky not being anything like the actual game and learning little to nothing through it the game is a great f2p title there are no microtransactions that will change the game besides your characters appearance though the dota servers are rough in some regions around the world forcing players from those regions to play on other servers based for other regions causing many problems such as language barriers lag and overall less team cooperation if valve improved some of the servers instead of focusing mainly on na servers this would most likely improve game quality for everyine around the world overall i would give a positive rating of 810

ive had this game in my steam library since beta and occasionally id give it a try to see if i could tap into some of the excitement that continued to elude me for some reason 62 hours later on may 12 2014 today after reading the first 10 headlines in the dota 2 steam forums i promptly uninstalled the game im not one of those dudes who mistakes his opinion for fact so ill just say this game isnt for me rude unfriendly community coupled with an overtly pretentious selfimportant theme and arbitrary unnecessarily difficult online play laning ganking lasthitting really are unappealing to me i suppose the kids prefer the game this way because they feel like theyve accomplished something when they win as opposed to the rest of us who simply play video games as an over30yearold gamer with kids of my own perhaps im just too old for this anyway thumbs down next edit my 9yearold just found out dota 2 is a thing thanks loudmouthed fourth graders so 1 for dota 2 because its one pc game my kids and i can play together and not worry about offcolor game content as long as we play with bots and not foulmouthed angry nerds looks like i might be reinstalling sigh as they say in vegas the house always wins well played valve well played

how to describe this game this is the first valve game where i havent had fun at playing it and made me question their work after a year of gameplay i can easily say that if you dont play it with friends you can end up with a brain tumor or end up in a nuthouse you need to play it with friends because its the only way to enjoy the suffering the artstyle and voices are great but the gameplay can be a little tricky and it can go unbalanced very easily the only time where i found the gameplay balanced was in the greeviling because everyone was in the same level but the gameplay its not the biggest issue with this game the community its really toxic and valve itself suffered this recently they are equal or worse than the cod community the only good thing about this game is the business model the big difference between dota 2 with tf2 and csgo its that those games gives you fun and money this game only gives you money no matter if you win or you lose a match you will always end up with the same bitter taste i only recommend this game for those who lost their minds or just want to make a couple of bucks to buy another game if you are sane please make a restriction order to anyone who invite you to play it

dota 2 was what i thought would be fun it is but if your looking to play people are real jerks who think just because they played longer they have the right to cyber bully and if u wanna leave you get demerit points and it will take you a longer time to find a macth valve should really regulate the chat and allow people to defend why they abandoned a game so for right now dota 2 is run by jerks and  holes

this game is horrible but at the same time good it takes a tonne of time to get the hang of the game and its normally only fun when you win differs from persons i love it but at the same time hate it you really need a party of friends or good players to win in this game you loose if you have one bad player on youre team and if you dont have the right balance of supports and carries semis then you loose l some heros are overpowered and yet some underpowered and for some reason people in low priority are better than in a normal match one of the first mobas ever made when it was made is was very popular on warcraft3 and of course its free most rage enducing game since call of duty you need to play it to understand so enjoy

game was good got terribly broken i quit thats the long story short want a long story long well read ahead then my dear nolifer says the one that spends time writing game reviews in steam so where should i start of course from the start a friend of mine invited me to play this super badass game with him and after days and weeks of pleads i finally bent to his will entered the game all felt fine he was a pro player and guided me through it i am also a sharp person that never does anything if hes unprepared so i read a few tons of guides from dota legends and watched plenty of tournament videos before my first game i started high above all the newbies and my lerning curve was quite fluent this means i rarely got to deal with raging idiots though rarely is not the same as never even i that played at a higher level than my matches got raged at from time to time imagine how a normal player felt brainless super confident brats keep yelling at everyone they dont like even if he is playing well that he is terrible and should uninstall the game heck the best guide ever writen for the game starts with a description on how to mute players and how to shield your psych so yeah nail number one in dotas coffin the terrible playerbase yeah there are some nice guys that survived but their numbers are rapidly dwindling and honestly even the kids at lol are nicer these days well dota could have still sprung out of its coffin if that was all but it isnt things like the terribly broken matchamking system count as well even if you rock you can hardly progress through the ranks and as gamers say leave the trench since all depends on your partners and you mostly get raging kids and gameabandonig russians no racism simply plain facts and statistics hell im a fan of putin you will never be able to roll up enough wins to play with skilled people yeah valve says its fair and it doesnt rank your winslosses but your overall performance in the game but yeah you guessed it thats pure  the heroes see the game has this goat fella named riky that is wrecking public games because of his easyto playiness and he is overpowered as hell to any unexperienced player yeah good ones can counter the  out of him with plenty of heroes so instead of getting this guy nerfed reduce his stats he is getting boosted with every update same goes for plenty of heroes which ruins the game the balancing of heroes and skills is being lost gradually over time and lately if you see a certain hero in a team on a pub game you know he will win and yeah only jerks pick such but thats almost all the players youll meet other heroes that are so fragile and weak like the poor crystal maiden which gets killed 50 times per game are getting nerfed instead and another nail goes in i can keep this up for quite a bit but i realise readers are dropping off from the review like mosquitoes near raid with every line i add so lets cut it here and shoot the word the game is duying and unless it gets a restart it will keep degrading dont bother you lose a lot of time playing it matches take ages at times no one pauses for you if your mom gets a blackout next to you well either help her or lose the game you see its not a good game to play you wont learn russian apart from swears you wont get smarter quite the opposite you wont make cash unless you sacrifice your whole life to play professionally you pour so much nerves time and effort in this game and you get nothing apart from a few and far between games where you actually match with good guys who pick normal heroes and dont spam the mic with swears well the game isnt a  as someone who is on a rage spree might claim its a decent one but its not worth it i would mark it as a 46510 yeah indeed 465 what a nice number and advice you against playing it thats all really excuse my lenghtiness and if you actually read that well go reward yourself with a treat from the fridge

this is basically dota 1 with an upgraded user interface and graphics its still a work in progress but all in all this is what the original dota style gameplay needs if its going to increase its declining marketshare in the moba genre it itself once pioneered the spectator interface for viewing live games is impressive and though it seems the matchmaking algorithm is not really active at the moment for a beta the parts that work do so rather well the attack and spell animations are all reworked and changed in this version so even for old dota 1 vets there is much to learn that only comes with the experience of engaging in the matches themselves if you can get an invite and you like the moba genre you will find far more to like than not but as usual in these types of games it all comes down to how evenly paired both teams are in skill for a game to truly fire on all cylinders

alright listen up instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians im going to tell you how dota 2 really is at its core in a nutshell dota 2 is a great game but a terrible experience at the same time you want to keep going back to it but you also hate to go back why one word community dota 2s community is for the most part rude and hateful and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting moba its unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away at the best of times often its much worse and i would prefer not to go into the details sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you havent actually done anything wrong occasionally though you come across friendly players and when that happens the game is a pure joy to play however since the game is 5v5 coming across four nice players at the same time if youre solo queueing is a rarity why then have i played the game for over 2000 hours the sensation of winning your determination to keep playing despite of the discouraging community is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning that sweet moment when you see the enemy ancient blow up and look back on the match remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying but even a victory can come with a grain of salt many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning there is a mute option but that doesnt stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat people can intentionally feed the enemy team ignore their own team teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player its really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time going ranked doesnt really solve the problem either at least not completely ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill it feels much more professional and tryhardish although you meet nice players more often nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell having played some matches in ranked i can say the mode isnt hate free i had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode another problem with ranked is that like i said its more tryhard many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such but dont get me wrong dota 2 is a great game in itself the core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well no technical issues to speak of not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so of which i have had none myself graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them all the various spells and abilites look great the game is very deep and complex with tons of items skill and item builds and strategies to learn it can be a bit terrifying to beginners but once you get the hang of things its engaging all the playable heroes are well balanced although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being op and free to play from the start thats another thing the game does right all the heroes are free and playable from the start unlike dota 2s undeniably very successful competitor league of legends dota 2s microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff which means there are zero pay to win elements in the game it really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game to put it roughly in perspective its like playing skyrim but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make calling you a fooping idiot every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective failed to kill alduin uninstall skyrim noob dont know how to make dragonbone armor learn to play tard its like that having played the game as long as i have i would say that you are better off not playing dota 2 the game is fun when youre winning because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine which is 50% of the time sometimes not even when youre winning it isnt the losses that make the game unpleasant its the unfriendly people if youre one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you you have a better chance of not finding dota 2 so terrible but realistically why should you even have to videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you cant have fun half of the time the game isnt worth it people will tell you that dota 2 is great but that greatness comes with a price do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view this review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what its really like not just the great things if you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis then youre golden the game is at its best when you play with friends and dont have to worry about getting a stick in the mud player on your team great game with a bad community

i dont really enjoy competitive games as a rule i like the idea of them but i dont play them i have been playing a lot of dota 2 though because i dont think that dota 2 is really a game i sometimes lose a game so badly that i wake days later in a cold sweat at first all i can think is that i am happy to have woken from the nightmare later in a moment of creeping fear i will realise that the real nightmare is how bad i am at dota and yet i cannot stop myself from playing it dota 2 is an endless nightmare from which i cannot wake to install it is to introduce into your life a hellish netherworld one in which close friends are so disappointed in one another that they cannot even express it one in which improvement means only that you will be matched against better opposition all of this horror floats on the constant threat of the low priority queue a stygian hellscape that this review could never hope to describe summary 1010 would play again until my sightless eyes drop from their sunken sockets and the cold grip of death frees my mortal husk from its trap

my favourite game of all time amazingly deep pvp experience that has me still feeling like every game is something new and different after about 23000 hours given between dota 1 and 2 first off a warning this is game is hard to get into it has an insanely large learning curve and a community who mostly dont deal well with learners or anyone not at the top of their game if you push through this which isnt so bad if you have some friends to show you the ropes and get you into it you will have access to a high action strategy game with so many variables to each game that you can always be suprised no matter how long youve played

dota 2  its a kind of game which can easily become a part of your life once you get really interested in it youll never be able to get it out of your head ive never thought that i would be into a game like this its just amazing cuz of many different characters team roles and skills  it gives you a freedom to choose between lots of strategies this game can teach how to play in a team efficiently how to help each other in order to win how to organise your small group if theres nobody to lead it it isnt always easy to manage with all this stuff but it makes the process even more challenging more catching you know dota 2 is so popular and loved game cuz it makes ppl think realize themselves as a part of a team choose the best strategy to achieve their aim  a lot of characters  oceans of items  various game modes  great events  lots of strategies  improvement of your reaction and cooperative skills  an ability to create your own team  random teammates can be absolutely dumb and wryhanded

of the majority of games that feature animal people i dont think any other game of our generation can shout blatant furry culture forcing more than dota 2 ranging from the down and dirty gondar lines like for the right price anything to the drunk pitiful mangix and you thought disney was bad on top of that they even added a character called troll warlord which is obviously a homestuck reference these guys are really milking the fandom department why cant a game just be about boobs like the old day i mean what ever happened to good old christian family values like monopoly and scrabble now weve gotta fill our games with fanservice and sell out to an audience that is somehow greater than ours i dont think so and theres even a character thats a flamboyant homosexual i had to bring my children to therapy after they heard the words puddin pop from one such storm spirit on the topic of inappropriate directive i cant believe a greek gorgon such as medusa would go so far as to talk about her gays this is simply not alright this game is nothing but a manifestation of what our society is becoming and we can only petition to have valve remove funding for this project to save our youth

a very beginner friendly userfriendly videogame with deep insightful characters that have amazing character development which will lead you to tears in some cases like the poor blind guy who finally achieved greatness because his mom said he could _7 it also has a very friendly community that is very helpful to beginners i recommend this game to any and all casual gamers especially fans of light friendly games and their community like club penguin and 4 ch an also characters in this game are very easy to learn and their abilities are easy to utilize allowing easy collaboration with teammates and friends for example meepo the geomancer is a great character for those new to the game and i recommend all new players choose him theres minor drawbacks in useful content though like certain things are outright useless like couriers and support characters and they should be removed from the game to make it perfect and this is coming from a long term investor of this game who has dedicated many hours 1337 to be exact to this extremely fun indie game all in all if youve never played a videogame in your life or have never spent time on the internet dota 2 is right for you this is a very non informative review

finally found a game i really suck at let this be a warning note for all gamers that have been a prisoner of their own style but then again trying to give dota 2 a shot for a change of scene if you are new to moba or just downright have had suck at it for whatever reasons this game wont be any different by any means so let us begin reviewing the game where comeback comes back and hits you in your face more than the taken franchise i know they should have stopped after the first film  the game itself is pretty darn vast with approximately 112 heroes in the roster and just a bunch of different purchasable items to buy from the gold you receive every second and by kills with its your job to figure out the strength and weaknesses of each of the character you are about to take down lead with and set your perks accordingly  objective arent any different for other mobas you take down enemy structures to make the ancient aka the final tower vulnerable and then take it out  the community is definitely one of the most rage induced people piled together in a game where communication and tactical planning are crucial every team i was assigned to there seemed some guy screaming his throat out at me or some other bad player in out team just like an exboyfriend with emotional issues i dont really blame them it is one of the most competitively played games out there  the graphics are better than most and seem well thought out the animations of characters on the lower box really adds to it its well thought out and isnt much flashy should help most people unlike my adhd sufferer cousin and the system requirements arent as much so you should do fine with most potatoes  sounds are quite varying for all items and also visually the effects are quite different that is definitely a mention for the creative team responsible for it  they have drops yep just like csgo you have a chance to get an item drop that can be tradablemarketable some drops do cost a lot and can buy you a game on steam sale cumulative drops if you are dedicated to it  id also like to mention playing with bots will only get you so far in a game against people the tactics people use are nothing like they programmed those binary butts with there is still a lot to conclude in what seems to be a game based on a chessboard turned side ways but i wont ruin it all by discussing it here so spend some money on a better internet and try it for yourself gaben knows youll need it this game did have its moments for me but it just sadly wasnt a meant to be well the opponent team will surely mourn for me for all those victories i snagged them sadly i cant say the same for my friends i hear one of them ended up with tourette syndrome

a really good game let down by the god awful community every game you have someone complaining or swearing on top of that almost every game you have someone feeding basicly giving a free win to the enemy team i cant tell you how many times ive uninstalled this game in rage due to playing with people that are so idiotic that you cant comprehend it

being an old league of legends player i really needed some time off lol since i knew every champion every item and every possible outcome for hero duels i came to dota 2 if you are just like me then i would strongly suggest taking a look at dota 2 it is much more realistic and i can guarantee it once you get to know a little bit the mechanics of the game and if you play it with a friend or two then you will have so much fun no bugs whatsoever very fluid game and most of all very diverse range of heroes the only bad thing there might be from what i have seen is that there is quite a big number of trolls in the game

a true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming this sequel to a genredefiner that is now just bursting in a global scale is a great point of reference to anyone attempting to make a game of this genre great graphics amazing sound and voice design and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make dota 2 great but its major strong point is the depth in its mechanics while dota 2s gameplay might seem daunting at first its one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting other games such as league of legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula but dota 2 kept it intact and makes sure you learn something new everyday not only the core game is strong but also the esport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing with several tournaments going on including valves own the international at the time of release the game looks like a train with no brakes about to crash against its competitors and run them over raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game

more russian than moscow 1010 dota2 is a russian simulator explore the every day life of a russian glued behind his computer screen wondering why these english capitalist dogs do not speak the almighty language of justice enjoy not being able to understand your teammates and swearing at eachother in a variety of spanishfrench very rarely english and most of all russian you can play on the europe west servers with russians american servers with russians or if youre missing out on that full russian experience play on the russian servers no wonder ukraine is not taken yet theyre all too busy playing this game feel free to enjoy solo queue and end up with a group of 3 russians and a spanish 13 year old repeatedly listening to a repeated soliloquy of backwards letters youve only seen once in a chernobyl documentary attempt duo queue and end up with 3 russians which kind of diminishes the full blown russian experience thus i do not recommend you try this or you can play with bots which are surprisingly better teammates than the russians just for good measure ill throw in an extra russians to get the point across enjoy yourself comrad for those of you that do not enjoy the full russian gaming experience there is always csgo which is the softcore version of dota2 disclaimer long exposure to dota2 might cause capitalist ideals to give way to communism

like almost any other moba out there its free unless you want any of your looks customized i only played a handful of matches and being at least semiliterate in both moba uis and old custom warcraft and starcraft maps i can in no way recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of moba fans the ui is unintuitive the shop is a mess to look at if youre new and you will likely get your face smashed in by even the computercontrolled players time and time again while you punishingly learn every little thing it takes to be good at this game if you have never played a moba if you dont have a friend who already plays this and can walk you through what to do do not try this game if you really love mobas and are looking for a new one yes definitely try this and i hope you enjoy it i did not not even remotely

dota 2 is a 5v5 moba game you have a selection out of 108 unique heroes each with a unique skillset every hero is also available from the minute you start no playing x amount of games before this hero becomes available the object of dota 2 is to destroy the other teams ancient to do this you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes top mid or bottom by destroying the outer towers youll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps as the game progresses youll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members communication is a very important aspect of the game i therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that youll be teamed up with wont always show the same willingness to communicate if youre just starting out playing dota 2 i also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself the skill ceiling is also extremely high so every time you play you might learn something new due to the high number of available heroes skills and items you can be sure that every game is unique something to be wary of is the community there are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action flaming is something that could happen often but if youre playing with a team entirely made up of your friends this shouldnt prove to be an issue if this is not the case dont worry you can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful team oriented game

dota 2 a very frustrating game that forces you to play with and against other players youll rely on your team to preform their selected roles and then watch in horror as they completely ignore the game mechanics and just chase down kills rarely successfully you build in game items during the match to enhance your characters role and then hope and pray your team doesnt feed the opposition too much team fights normally 5v5 tend not to happen as you watch your fellow team members run to meet their fate and be a hero sadly this ends up throwing the game and you lose i would still recommend this game purely for those few matches when the your whole teams synergy is in harmony watch as the gold floods in the towers crumble and the opposition blame each other for their loss

a message to my fellow conservatives all is lost a message to my fellow classical economists were all keynesians now with the release of how to train your dragon 2 which mightve been more suitably named how to be a dictator 2 communist influence has been seeded into the minds of the children destroying the potential for a perfect laissez faire economy for future generations how to train your dragon 2 is a story of a young shaggy rogers discovering the wonders of sandwiches for the first time with the rottweiler he owned before scooby our protagonist a rebellious socialist who never came to grasp the true meaning of republican motherhood is a frequenter of the parks motivating the homeless by promising them peace and beating them until they promise to get a job or preaching to the innocent picnickers about the evils of animal cruelty a subtheme of gun control is dished out discreetly as the script writers encourage us to do better than what game theorists think we are capable of with flawed moral consciences in the same way viewers are assured that we have learned from the days of the arms race by subtly bringing up the marilyn monroejfk scandal obnoxious and unorginal the production draws content heavily from the movies et and avatar indicating that it could have been funded by a collective effort between peta james cameron the public health institute heidi fleiss and joseph stalin in the end the main characters tyrannical liberalminded father boards a boat to russia under heavy artillery fire by social darwinists portrayed as defiant and unruly teenagers that want nothing but an end to civilization i can say with certainty that any child who watches this film will become a democrat at some point in their lives and like the movie suggests the only way to prevent the disease from spreading is to contain it oh and dota 2 is a pretty good game too

i cant really write a good review for the everchanging landscape that is dota2 but i will say the following generic things dota2 is not a simple team game there are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online you come into dota to have fun with tools every character is a different tool they move different they turn different they attack differently if you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange then this is for you if you come from any fighting game for example you can get into this like really into this what makes dota2 different from other mobas depth dota offers much more variety much more freedom to experiment other mobas shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools you have items that give you more movement options that take away movement options from the opponent even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically in other games you will find these options baked into a character they try to guide you into learning how a character should be played dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment as a reminder its never anyones fault when you fail to build your tool properly this is a game have fun most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle and valve facilitates this but you dont have to everything depends in dota2 should you try dota2 yes but remember to have fun you will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match enjoy smile a lot of people forget this if youre not enjoying dota2 uninstall

has a steep learning curve because the community punishes new players expect loads of trash talk but its worth it if you play with friends who can teach you teamwork is essential in this game keep practicing and eventually you will develop good decisionmaking skills which you might also be able to use in real life much better than league of legends in terms of objective depth which is the reason why i prefer this game over other mobas

when you play for the first time all this game seems like is just a bunch of wierd colored creatures punching each other with sticks it seems really stupid but you suck it up and play through the tutorial then you stupidly decide to play your first game of real dota put short you fed badly after going 030 your first game you kinda hate dota but you stupidly decide to play another and chances are you lost again and this keeps happening until you discover your first newb hero drow seems so op doesnt she afterwards you decide to play this hero again and again and doesnt it feel good to win 50 games deep youll hate noobstomp heroes like riki sniper drow and bloodseeker obvisously these heroes are really op 100 games deep and youll find yourself trying out some new heroes tidehunters ravange is pretty epic you have to agree 200 games deep and youll have played every hero with the exception to earth spirt how the hell do you play that guy i dont get it 300 games deep and those newb stomp heroes dont seem so bad anymore manfight riki stand right next to drow get blademail for sniper and buy a tp for bloodseeker and dont forget to buy dust 400 games in you will know how to ward rune control stack and pull and play a support you will understand the basics of having one person farm while another supports and harrasses holy  youve made it to 500 games remeber your first match if only you could see yourself now by this point you understand the basics of dota remeber to dodge the sunstrike 600 games in and youll realize that for the past months dota is the only game you have played like the only game because once you start playing dota you never come back unless your power dies by 700 games youll start playing against trilanes now as an offlaner you have to do your best to not die and get some farm hide in the trees and sap xp where you can by 800 your tempted to buy that arcana not saying you will but it sure does look tempting by 900 you know what to buy and you get what every hero can do you know where to be and when and you get the feeling when there smoke ganking and roshing gamesense op by 1000 games you hit a milestone the game doesnt seem like colored creatures punching eachother welcome to dota 2 noob advice read guides when your trying out new heroes practice in bots and dont stick to one hero play them all and stick in there your first 10 games will suck purge has some great guides that you really should watch before you even step into your first game and also play with friends otherwise you might have to put up with peruvians who keep screaming noob in chat when you make one mistake people who have to rage at everything thats why theres reports and russians who will play uber aggresive all the time which to be fair on there part works half of the time welcome to dota 2 oh yeah and nerf void

welcome to dota 2 the hotel california of online gaming late last march i was naive enough to dip a toe in its beguiling waters and today 450 hours of gameplay later i return as a semifunctional human to regale you with tales from its realm dota 2 is unlike any other game ive ever played both in its nature and history it started off as a starcraft mod popular enough to be ported to warcraft 3 which then exploded into a kaleidoscope of playermade variants and eventually coalesced again into a single entity titled defense of the ancients allstars there is no single author of dota though all the anonymous contributors whove made it what it is have come from the community that first started playing the mods as such dota is the very definition of grassroots game development the idea of a game made by the people for the people as a certain american president might put it fills me with a particularly warm and fuzzy sensation of course i knew none of this when i first picked up dota a friend recommended it because its free and im cheap i understood that the game had a teambased format where killing the other guys was a good thing like with firstperson shooters but your character also leveled up through the course of a match as in roleplaying games that seemed like a recipe for unbalanced gameplay but as it turns out its precisely dotas balance that makes it so unbelievably addictive you start off as a member of a ragtag group of five heroes intent on destroying the enemys base which is embodied by the titular ancient structure through a series of skirmishes against the other team their defensive towers and waves of autonomous creeps you gain experience and gold the latter of which can be spent on items that make you stronger swifter and deadlier the more you kill the more you make the more you buy the more you kill rinse repeat and make sure to say gg at the end learning a language might be quicker than mastering the full breadth of dota excuse me if im making this sound simple because it really isnt dota 2 has a roster of over 100 heroes to choose from and the combinations of items they can obtain is an order of magnitude greater still each hero has four or more unique abilities and to have any hope of defeating a skilled opponent you have to know what those are what items he or she is carrying and how they affect your chances of survival ignoring all of that nuance i jumped straight into the game with the juggernaut and was promptly beaten into a pulp of samurai sushi a dozen humbling  whoopings later i was online and reading the dota fire hero guides dota 2 choices the key reassurance i can offer is that all of these intricacies are in fact worth learning as daunting as dotas complexity may be without it the game just wouldnt be as rewarding my way of rising to the high bar of basic skill required was to pick the last enemy hero to destroy me thus i went from playing juggernaut to bounty hunter to bloodseeker to ursa to spirit breaker each time i was sure i had the right hero a better player would come along expose my weaknesses and teach me something new im the worst loser i know and yet i played dota 2 for nearly 100 hours before i could get my winning percentage above 50 maybe if i could actually see that i was being dominated by 14yearold kids listening to darudes sandstorm on repeat i might have felt sufficiently embarrassed to retreat in shame i stuck through it though because in the immortal words of agent smith as a species human beings define their reality through suffering and misery and dota delivers both with just enough victory to keep me titillated and once i had a couple of hundred hours of experience under my belt i too started passing on the sacred knowledge of dota through the timehonored tradition of owning noobs im the worst loser i know and im addicted to a game that keeps kicking my  this is not a game for the impatient success in dota 2 requires the strategic forethought of chess the unselfish teamwork of basketball and the steely nerves of poker none of those skills are acquired with ease and theres no magic number of matches or hours played to achieve dota competence its a lot like learning a language i never felt discrete upgrades in my knowledge and skill but eventually i got to the point where i could tell you every typo in the games hero descriptions and every corner of its single asymmetric map just know that the commitment required is on a whole different scale to other games you could complete the epic mass effect trilogy plus all of its expansion packs in less time than it takes the average dota player to familiarize himself with everything from abbadons aphotic shield to zeuss lightning bolt but thats really the point mastering this game in 50 hours wouldnt feel anywhere near as satisfying as taking a good 500

with over 110 heroes to choose from dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of all the games available on steam many players find that even after 100 hours of gameplay they feel incompetent at the game while this is probably dota 2s greatest downfall it is also the aspect that makes the game as great as it is there is just so much to learn in this game that it will provide fans with countless hours of playtime verdict dota 2 is an extremely difficult game and that is what makes it most rewarding yes the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an average player may take well over 100 hours however if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term dota 2 may just be the best game you can currently find  and it is free

ing piece of  addictive  game

 dota 2  dota 2 is a wonderful game for teamplay if you love games like destroying the enemy base and five heroes vs five heroes you would definitely love this game the game works like this that there are two teams first team is called radiant  second team is called dire and each team will have a base that base is called ancient  then to win this game you have to destroy there base so basically the first one to destroy the enemys ancient wins but before that you must go through the enemys towers theres three tower on each lane so you cant destroy their ancient if you dont destroy the three towers and you cant advance to the second tower or third tower you must destroy the first second and third then finally their ancient last thing is  each team will have five players so you and your teammate must cooperate if not you guys will lose instantly the game then each player will have a to pick a their role there are 10 roles after you guys pick a roles there will be three lanes theres mid  top  and bottom  so it can be like this 1 in the mid 2 at the top and 2 at the bottom 10 roles carry  will bring victory if he levels up faster and makes gold faster support  will provide wards and courier also will upgrade the courier lane support  useful even without farm and can go to other lanes to help others initiator  will start the teamfight jungle  can get gold in the jungle so the other teammate can solo topbottom pusher  can push faster through first second and third tower escape  can bait the enemy or bring the enemy to your trap disabler  will stun the enemy or cancel the enemys spell cast durable  will tankshield the teamfight so hes teammates wont die fast nuker  will bring massive damage too the enemy this the common role in game if you have this team you have 5050 chance of winning player 1 carry this role will kill all the enemys and finish the game player 2 support this role will help the carry to farm because the other team will try to kill your carry player 3 durable this role will help in the teamfight he will take all the damage of the enemy so the carry will live player 4 initiator this role will start the teamfight so you guys will have an advantage of the enemy player 5 disabler this role will stun the enemy so the enemy cant cast spell or attack i hope you like it and i really recommend this game so good luck and had fun  pls like my review originally posted by author  steven baes aka stefphen

have an urge to review this game with its latest situation we had a down time during christmas time and lately it seems that the players were more frustating than before closed beta inviteonly period also the leavers and the disconnected players are more rampant now which make this game more and more unenjoyable now noobcalling negative notteamplayers and the blame games involved yes those kind that you have to expect when playing with total strangers youll be wasting 3045 or even 60 minutes of your life thanks to them losing easily so this time around you have to prepare yourself mentally to face those kinds d good thing is that they have implemented the local lobby feature so that you can actually play locally within your lan should be a very good game worthy of having a lan party again i like the balance changes they put into the game the item changes and things that make the early games more fun but im putting this as a no for those who play only with a friend or two you better play this with a full fivepersonteam to fully enjoy this game and the time not wasted or perhaps due to its current state players similar to me might not have the reasons on how to fully enjoy this game hope valve and the team can continue to improve on this game more

i dont usually write reviews but this is a game that i played really much because i enjoy the genre and tried many games in it to compare dota 2 with basically in tems of speed dota 2 along with strife which is basically dota 2 in graphics style of lol with a petitem system which you can level up by playing is average so if you think a moba should be slower you should try league of legends and if you think it should be faster you should try heroes of newerth if you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try heroes of the storm since you dont have to learn as many item effects dota 2 in a nutshell after 2400h of playtime new players if interested in cosmetic items will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious if you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for you cant sell the items since volvo put a trademarket cooldown 2 months i think on every new item that gets released yay so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest rng is strong in this one youre better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market volvo greed simulator the old loot system in which you could acutally gain items after a game for dota 2 profile levels and a leveling chest you had in your inventory which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later was successfully reworked into greedmode the chances to get any items after a game are as low as getting a legendary or higher before sure they drop entire sets now but most of them are common to rare which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both item quantity and value maybe you should try some never change a running system in this particular function mostly developersupport abandoned game the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releasespatches are just really really rare special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% countbasednot reviewed by support employes for example if you express your annoyance towardslets say russiansfor not being able to communicate in english on eu servers you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a eu game 3 probably more are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english these days russianinfested to the max810 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam even though they have their own servers because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language thanks volvo for letting that happen maybe one day the eu servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual eu will have to play on american servers after all d editin addition to the listed issues the game servers are now absolute  1415 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasnt possible conclusion if you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing in terms of cosmetic effects andor profile progression this probably is not the right choice anymore because as stated you dont get level rewards or similar stuff anymore just really rare item drops probably in the 02% range if you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be your gamechoice 1 the community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is not your game for some serious gametime at least not in solo matchmaking i didnt check the other games these days but the community in hon was much more friendly and less russian in my personal opinion dota 2 isnt playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly without being annoyed by trolls or russians gameplaybalance 910 community 2510 rewards system 110

you see as a true christian i was raised to to believe the true saviour gaben but when i heard about this game i said this game has everything i need religion no sinners and a very casual experience i praised the lord for this mighty gift from the highest heights of heaven so like any other true christian would i decided to play and not stray away from the reightous path but when i loaded up the game the loading screens were riddled with satanic images and meanings i was outraged by this atrocity more than when my son told me he had sinned by doing some dispicable acts as matthew mcconau said in chapter 169 thou hou slay thou demonic presence shou nourish in the heighest points of heaven so after i got away from them satanic signs i started to become somewhat suspicious of this game i pressed play and began to sweat as the jesus juices excreted from my body i crossed my heart and prayed to god to forgive me for this act of satanism and waited for the match to started upon the game starting i was stunned by the amount of pagon rituals and signs that were in the game i closed my eyes and picked a random hero only to discover something truly horrifying my beer had run out my bacon stained sweat soaked vest had ripped the russians were here they were everywhere my ears started to bleed as the russian flame began i tried to continue on the righteous path but sin was inevitable i pressed enter i started to flame back my fingers were numb and then i realised i had sinned my heart stopped i could hear god reaching down to me but even he could not stop this i had become the thing i dreaded most more than a gay person a dota 2 player

their sanity ill shatter their dreams of conquest ill destroy of warcrafts custom maps one stood a little taller than the rest defense of the ancients here the heroes of azeroth freed from the tedious management of cities and armies could fight as they were meant to with weapons and experience teamwork and tactics all unadulterated by some abstract general and convoluted mission a vast pool of heroes pulled into one map normalized and equalized through patches armed with improved weaponry combined to cement a gameplay experience that appealed to our encyclopedic minds our fantastical tendencies and our social impulse here was an unthinkable union of knowledge skill mythology role playing individuality and balance here dota matured to perfection but this perfection was uneven the brilliance lay there but burdened by the crust and grime of history the games greatest hero ice frog was a player who saw in dota a wondrous achievement and vowed not to let that masterpiece deteriorate and die seeing the game as a growing process owned by a community ever meant to experiment and improve ice frogs leadership kept dota alive suffocated by a dated engine and forgotten game he and his team worked with the legion of adoring fans to nourish what could be saved and eradicate what could not but even tenacity has limits and in order for dota to break free it needed a new body a new platform in which to siege the world here as ever an angel swooped from above it was valve and they released the building pressure of dota into the atmosphere of mainstream gaming steam that would finally power the community it deserved the rest is history adopting the ftp model utilizing the source engine and steam community dota has its outlet dota 2 players marvel at the games sheer number of balanced heroes how it feels difficult yet strangely compelling sophisticated in its strategy but gleeful in its murder at times silly but still dark oppressive but always promising emancipation if you practice hard and reflect often so reliant on your allies often complete strangers that autonomous action can never rival teamwork like members of a symphony clashing with your enemies in near perfect tugandwar entailing chesslike prediction and fpslike twitching your team fights together wins together and dies together never before except in professional sports has your weakest link dragged you down or raised you up but drag you down they do even in the most porcelain masks do we see blemishes and dota 2 has its fair share teams can and do exploit the weakest member of the opposite team bullying with a savagery only seen in competitive gaming because of this exploitation and the difficult nature of the game as a whole frustration often runs high in the experience losses feel more painful than wins feel enjoyable and the hope for those rare games in which perfect harmony among both teams leads to razorsharp tactics and thrilling plays can be ruined by the cruel hand of fate where a single hero out of position or a single rng move can turn the tide of battle dota 2 is paradoxically rarely satisfying but when it is players never forget that feeling of triumph video games more than any other art rely on us to deliver an experience whether they tell a story or present puzzles to solve games need us to be competent and attentive dota 2 takes this to new heights and presents us with an outlet where the more we pour into it the more it gives back eventually our exhaustion clouds the luster somewhat but we shouldnt judge the game by our own limitations feral profound and terrifically challenging dota 2 is competitive teambased gaming in its prime

the neverending story skills never achieved at best and very hard game to learn many mistakes can be reason of losing game and game one of the hardest with opportunities which requires the years of effort and practice community full of all type of people from global players can report each other and happens often get reported by player because of his own mistakes also you must be smart and strong to survive people harassment definitely harder than league of legends world of warcraft and many others games game play improved by many years of development and will be improved until dota exist community loves professional players and players playing most of time very good at games but hates beginners or people not playing good enough better you play harder you will win games alone one of the best games for playing with real life friends solo or with teams

i hate this game i mothering hate this game hell i hate every moba there is on this universe so much its actually among the feeeew games that truly makes me rage i hate its players too you can all go  yourselves ing  still its a pretty well made game albeit like every moba poorly balanced when it claims to be why do i play it i dunno i keep coming back to this now and then just to be paired with noobs russians  or rage quitters this game is like drugs it s you up and you can never come back this game will probably be the reason of heart attacks or strokes for many of you out there it is good if you are a masochist a  that cant survive in ranked and goes to casual matches or if you are good at the game and have a good team cuz you cant carry 4 noobs around the whole game i ing dare you you cant just play this game without raging at least once right oh yeah by the way i also got basically forced to play this game back then and i just kept getting ganked 247 i dunno how i managed to play this much it also has items and being the hoarder that i am i just cant stay away from it its too late 10 rages out of mothering 10

this is an excellnt game if you want a really dynamic playstyle and a unique item shop which offers much variation the reason i choose dota over lol is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when theyre telling me i shouldnt be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great id give it a solid 710 just beacuse its such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still cant do it properly i hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because its very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health lol yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games

i recommend this game if you have actual friends to play with and have fun playing together or you are a person who doesnt give a dam about anything and just turn on music and plays game without saying anything like me 3  if you go solo  1 at start you get flamed all the time because you are not really skilled  even when others do x10 times worst  2 when you get good you start to flame newbie players because they arent skilled and its because you get treated like that when you started and its a high possibility that it will be seen in your actual life now or later on 3 you can get pretty fast addicted to this game  you can see in other reviews or just look at there played time which may make you unsocial person  if you werent before  4 tons of russians even if you select other regions you still gonna get them  if you are person like in first sentence or dont care anything what came after if you go solo they you may like this game

i dont get it league of legends i eventually got but this this is a game with way too many mechanics and with no idea how to use them all there is just too much  to think about in an average game too much to juggle to much to much to much cut out the stuff that isnt mission critical to the actual experience and the clash of skills between two sides and you would get league though so i suppose there is a place for this also valve is a much better dev team than riot is hands down its just a shame that the games they own arent reversed

if you enjoy dedicating your life to this game while at the same time ignoring your family friends and any sort of social interaction then you will certainly enjoy fighting with your teammates over who will support or who will buy courier by playing this glorious game you will also learn how to speak several languages as for some reason russians and mexicans like to join the us east and west servers when they have servers in their own country im sure you are already sold by this point but just to add on one more thing about this game is that you will also learn how seriously people take this game and realize truly how terrible you are at this game because you are a noob with less than 3000 hours on a game

there i was ready for a classic game of late night dota with renowned hustler joshua marc baillie harkening back to our good old days  a well spent youth of boisterous cheer and plays a plenty then our world was sht upon by the powers that be gaben and icefraud both nigh on untouchable behind their shroud of lies and broken promises we queued ready for the action the thrill the skill to survive and thrive in a high skilled scenario wed spent over a thousand hours training for this this was our moment we chose our heroes heroes we have always enjoyed playing heroes that happen to be op this patch our spirits were higher than snoop dogg in a forest fire we hit play i entered the game josh did not my brotherinarms had fallen nay been tripped at the first hurdle gaben would simply not allow him access his dota would restart and hed spam the play button again and again but to no avail this sordid process went on for 5 minutes 5 minutes i will never forget the worst 5 minutes of my life eventually josh gave up uninstalled and played poker night and in that moment i remembered the hundreds of pounds i have poured into valve the armory of virtual hats i have treasured and loathed in the pursuit of cosmetic gratification and a great rage swelled within me a rage that threatened to burst upon volvo customer support in a dire tide of expletives and jokes about hl3 but i contained this anger because i still had a game to win in honour of my betrayed comrade i will not forget the injustices i have seen this day and the hats might find themselves getting rather short of company in the months to come justice4josh pray4josh ti4godssake gameisbroken biginternetwords watchyourselves kappa

a team game were over 90% of people dont want to cooperate play as a team talk plan do strats and so on game looks good at first but at the end of the day its just a horrible online experience if you have a 5 man stack with good game knowledge good coordination yeah matches can be decent but i recommend setting up inhouse matches with another 5 man stack if you dont have a 5 man stack its a pub train all day or just plain badnoobish you win 505 then you lose 457 then you win 4117 then you lose 6028 and so on its all about the lucky roll of the dice named matchmaking most players that play this game have lvl 01 accounts with only dota or other free to play games so dont think if you report them they care they just make another account to troll feed or we also alot of people play this game drunk stoned or just very tired that can be ok i guess in a 1v1 game or a 2v2 with one of their buddies but in a 5v5 team game its not nice they just ruin the experience for alot of other people most people use their own language chatting or writing teamspeak or just skype is not on their menu so most russians will speak russian most turks will speak turkish and so on there is no region lock again for a 1v1 game maybe that could work but for a game like dota having a player from australia or peru joining the euro server with 300400 ping is not cool and alot of people just check more servers for faster queue times and also check more languages so if you check eu west or us east and expect all people to have good pings and speak english think again  at least some of the dota 2 players played wc3 or dota 1 dont even get me started with the other mobas its the only genre that makes me feel ive wasted my time in most cases when i play the game bonus people either flamecurse etc or just dont know what the hell they are doing in most cases both ^_^ so i recommend using your free time  gaming time playing other games and stay away from all free to play team games  mmos they are a magnet for trolls kids or just noobs that dont care and you know why bcuz they can make 1000 accounts so if they get banned or their ranking has gone down its no problem new acc on the way its kinda sad game could have been fun but its not and thigs will never change bcuz of all the reasons ive stated above the game at its core is good but the overall online experience is bad cant recommend this for a new player a true newbie cant recommend this either for an old skool rts player these guys online dont even look at the minimap so most of the time the gamesmatches wont be good and fun even most of the wins are fun just bcuz you had fun  a good talk or we with a real life friend that you had on skype or a gaming friend that you laned with not bcuz of the dota match tbh so just go and drink beer with that mate or just play other games with himthem with this concept of f2p and team gameplay i cant see valve fixing this so i cant see a reason to recommend this sure you can get random good matches but after all my experience playing this i think you are better off without this game  genre completely peace

one of the worst games ive ever played valve doesnt know how to play it so they recommend  items on a lot of heroes which ends up screwing me because i only get people who have terminal autism on my team and have to be plugged into a machine to ing breathe and always build  items like bfury on gondar  game only gets you mad its only fun if youre a  who 5 stacks all your games and pick heroes icefraud decided to make op like ing drow and you win all game but youre still a no life  210 better stiking to tic tac toe with your grandma if you want to have fun because otherwise have fun getting brazillians and russians with the iq of a rock queuing with you and you cant win because its 1v9 and no hero can take that on unless the enemy literally takes there hands off the keyboard and mouse and just go read a book because reading a book is more productive than playing this   game by the way if you suck your friends will make you play the support  every time and that is literally the worst role because all you do is get ed at because your carry cant carry because he has downs so much hes in ing china and all you do is get insta gibbed every fight because enemy is guaranteed to have a svendrowmagnusbounty hunter on the enemy team and are too poor to get any sort of item other than wards which just get countered immediately overall this game just makes you angry and its just like stealing a star from someone in mario party your friends will just whine and youll get angry at them and then remove them over this  game because of skill difference tldr  you this game sucks you should probably get secret of the magic crystals instead

its worth maybe somewhere between 1000  1500 hours but once you become fairly decent at the game you realize theres not much to it its neither complicated nor possesses too much variety the most fun portion of this game is irking the other players actually it also becomes fairly monotonous as you find players who dont even know what last hitting is despite attempting to employ advanced tactics however the game ios intrinsically bad not in result of the players like i said once you get somewhere between 1000  1500 hours of playing every character it becomes boring they end up playing too much like one another i never feel a difference between playing lion lina vengeful cm etc as support sure the abilities vary but the use of those abilities dont youre still going to stun when you need to youre going to harass when you need to etc its all the same unfortunately a majority of people ive met who are actually social are the ones whom ive seen play dota frequently

a very confusing game that strives to continue where heroes of legends left off but resorts a bit too often to slavic jumpscares to create an immersive slendermanlike experience current main issues pros  a friendly and positive community  possibility to make friends and discuss delicate topics with new people from various ethnic backgrounds chat comes with emoticons and other essential stuff  strong focus for learning new languages  full of fun minigames if the main game is not compelling like the shopkeepers quiz buying stuff from the valve shop ingame advertisement clicking guessgames for dota 2 network offline times etc cons  i picked the sniper class but had trouble aiming in the first person mode needs to be fixed asap  playing the game with oculus rift resulted in nausea  low replayability after their first game everone i know has practically reached their skill cap  basic things like ingame quicksave and quickload functionality is missing  raid bosses like roshan and troll warlord are hard to understand and severely imbalanced  steam achievements were teased but are still not working i already ate my 500th tree but didnt get the achievement  the crafting system is confusing and unintuitive  want to create a drum well you need a robe and a bracer of course want to create a buckler yep you guessed it you need a chainmail shirt armor and a branch  hitboxes are off and often clipping for example i bought a bigger sword for the sven class but game doesnt register hits that clearly happen against smaller models like the phantom assassin  npcs like the mud golem and the shopkeeper only have few lazy dialogue lines i was more interested in hearing their immersive part of the story while constructing a hut in a nearby forest out of treebranches  rts system for building or repairing base components are limited to only a few heroes and could use a revamp  character wipes happen a bit too often in the servers ive been at without going into too many spoilers finishing the campaign left me with more questions than satisfying answers for example why was the evil dragon knight so eager to hurt the seemingly innocent creeps for monetary gain why did the mysterious drow ranger attack our valiant hero why does axe look like a tomato so many questions yet so few answers overall the game is ok for an early access fpsrpg hybrid but doesnt entertain the more hardcore gamers for very long for a smalltime indie developer team i guess its acceptable but id wait for more available dlc expansions before paying anything for the main game

its a good game and all but it has so many flaws first off the pros the game is getting massive content every now and so and it feels fresh the map is fantastic and simple to learn same with the heroes too and the community made content is fantastic but the cons where do i begin now i love this game and everything but the community is just what ruins it ive been into games and i have over 800 hours plus and still being called an noob and everything and blames me there is some situations that i couldnt do anything and my friend keeps trying to help and no one else trys to come to the lane and im the one getting blamed also the game seriously need either more servers or region locks because i am sick and tired of being matched with peruvians portugese russians etc and not to mention if youre in a parties more chances youre gonna find some stupid clan team that does nothing but just does stun stacks while we just wanna have fun the worse of all is the people who always spam umadbro and take insults from  but seriously its impossible to not be frustrated in a video game espacilly dota seriously its just sad that these kind of communities just ruin a game and i can no longer have fun to me the game is just not fun anymore some heroes are broken as hell heck valve tried to nerf riki but they just buffed him more instead well gg

simply put this game is misogynitic it does nothing but further harmful female stereotypes and it celebrates patriarchy and he mental emotional and mostly physical abuse of women >all of the female characters are supports >they make less money than the men and are expected to support the male characters who achieve everything >the one female carry a strong independent brown transwoman is banned from tournaments because her mere existence threatens weak white cishets this is why dota will never be taken seriously

ive played 70ish hours and heres my impression the game is quite good but the community is pure toxic waste you cant surrender or leave their games because their client punishes you so youre forced to play it out with the little gremlins i might quit if i cant find some regulars to queue with who arent so bad hasnt happened yet though i dont play much any more however ever want to have a teammate call you a lil  after you say hi ever want to farm for 20 minutes in the lategame because theres no stalemate breaking mechanic ever want to get cussed out for calling somebody out for bullying a teammate ever want to play with teams who will not speak to each other to save their lives except for insults ever want to leave a game filled with people like this but not want to deal with whatever punishment valve has come up with for leavers then it might be the game for you i really do wish it werent so since the game itself is otherwise great when its not crashing

i dont get this game its like civilization every one picks one of the 108 country but its a 5v5 game the diplomatic exchanges with your team mates are limited because you can trade a limited amount of luxuries and you have to spend a big amount of gold to upgrade your country there is no research feature also the spying are realy limited as you can only place wards wich replace spys in this game on the map but they are usless they are city states but they just stand here and hit whats in range and never come to help you when you are far from them finaly there a only 3 era early mid and late but it dont change much the gameplay and some country are too op in the late era and you cant buy atomic bomb to nuke them 210 this game lacks a lot of content to pretend to be a civlizationlike

ive played this game since it was a mod for warcraft and i have to say its one of my favorite games however much like tf2 it has its fair share of problems for starters this game has a stupidly high learning curve theres no one true way to play any of the 100 heroes and it can get very frustrating very fast trying to find what you can easily work with for any of them with the gigantic selection of items other than a small pool of heroes that im confident enough with to pick on a regular basis the largest part of the roster is alien to me with my success {or lack thereof which is normally the case} depending largely on the skill level of the enemy team and my teammates which brings us to the next point 90% of the people who play this game are stupid now i dont claim to be good at this im slightly above average at best however its hard to play on anything outside of solo bot servers when youre constantly thrown in with stupid people first timers people who dont speak the server regions language people who are only there to prance around in costumes or dont want to follow simple ordersuse common sense or any combination of the above meanwhile you can rest assured that your opponents will almost always have their act together and be an unstoppable force that you futilely try to at least hinder which is made even harder when your teammates insist on throwing themselves into unwinnable battles further feeding them until the point where theres a 10 level gap between you and the lowest leveled enemy on the other hand you might go up against a team thats super bad as in its a game that lasts less than 20 minutes in which case youve learned nothing and your time is wasted just as thoroughly as it would be against people out of your league or on the occasion that you get teammates that know what theyre doing you can expect them to whine about your choice of hero your starting itemsabilities your lane choice or god forbid your costume at which point 910 of these people will purposefully feed the enemy or go afk and then either rage quit or stop when youve ceased your apparently unforgivable behavior or they might report you to try and get you thrown into low priority which is dotas equivalent of hell and unlike tf2 you cant just drop out whenever you wish without taking a heavy penalty for doing so so have fun being in matches where there will be almost no fun a majority of the time now there is a report system which in theory is supposed to shoo away the vermin that dont need to be playing this in the first place in practice its horribly broken due to being automated doing amazingly good but youre the odd man out in a peruvian 4 stack that youve somehow managed to offend expect to have the low priority message pop up when you exit to the menu after the match or maybe you want to report that 025 treant that refused to do his job and started purposely dying to feed the enemy the entire server could report him but he could still easily slip through without getting lp in all seriousness its down to luck if it does work when you want it to and doesnt when its being abused up next hero balance thankfully this isnt quite as bad as it could be but there is still silliness here and there some heroes have one or two overpowered abilities while others are all around unbalanced and others still are in sore need of buffing at the same time some heroes are nicely balanced but are easily outclassed by other heroes who can perform the same role only much better and easier why pick legion commander and eventually out damage the enemy team using skill when you can pick ursa and out damage them from level 3 onwards and rarely have to press more than one button why pick weaver and alternate between your 2 escapes when you can pick storm spirit and have an escape with no cooldown why pick centaur warrunner to be durable when you can pick axe and not only be durable but be so durable the lane gets locked down for your enemy theres tons of examples like this also youll see some heroes almost every match {pudge sniper zeus who all have skills that can be more or less mindlessly spammedhave low risk high reward play styles} but lots are seen either rarely or rarely outside of comp play {io meepo dark seer who all take some degree of skillhave high risk decent reward play styles} what it sadly boils down to is why play a hero where you have more than 1 button to press and risk being overwhelmed but have a more rewarding experience when you can pick a hero that more or less does the same thing but with less complexity as with tf2 valve is slowly but surely turning this into another hat simulator i played a ton of the original dota and i sure dont remember any customization because that would have been silly this game is hard enough without being distracted by someones super pimped out loadout or worrying if youre going to get a nice drop {if any only 23 people usually get drops at the end of the round} the main problem with character customization though is that much like tf2 it attracts half wits that only want to play the super easy classes and dress them up then look down on everyone else who isnt wearing a 20c wolf hat yeah take your little wolf hat into a ranked match see how they like it also like tf2 valve focuses more on cosmetic items than the game itself which started off small but in recent months has led to them 1 canceling popular game modes in order to {in their own words} focus more on cosmetic sets 2 building entire game modes around expensive sets {although in fairness said sets only enhanced the modestracked stats for them but still} or just flat out making new modes pay to win {the year beast brawl was p2w to the point that disgusting amounts of money and cheap tactics trumped genuine skill almost 100% of the time} 3 doing inane things like changing the perfectly fine models of heroes and then using that as an excuse to make more money {shadow fiends model was just fine but then he got a redesign that looked like an angsty 12 year old made it and a $35 cosmetic that looked like an even more angsty 10 year old designed it} 4 possibly the worst outright ignoring critical server issues to focus on cosmetic item bugs overall the game would be greatly improved if valve would do the following things 1 mandatory region locking for everyone to heavily cut down on the language barrier 2 a proper {and required} tutorial for new players 3 rather than adding new cosmetics every week finally adding the remaining heroes from the mod as well as much needed balancing for all the heroes as fun as this game is i reccomend it to no one other than someone willing to go through absolute misery to occasionally have fun

dota 2 is a very intensive video game that is just as good as league of legends although it is somewhat lacking in its misogynistic protrayal of women where all the female heroes are highly sexualized and often oppressed by the patriarchal standards of the game there is only one strong female character both metaphorically and literally named legion commander and even she is highly sexualized and often the target of pornographic parodies although they are perfectly equal in the terms of gameplay valve has quite a ways to go before they reach the same plethora of wellcharacterized and nonsexualized female characters as riot games managed to do in league of legends therefore although the game is reasonably fun i cannot honestly recommend it to any mature gamers out there

nothing has improved gameplay wise from the original dota while some heroes have changed a lot visual artwork is garbage worst colour palette ive ever seen and hero models are so generic that you cant distinguish them from lane minions community is more toxic and hostile than ever before leaversafkersquiters run rampant i mean seriously how is it possible not to have a decent report system in 2015 that can handle these players my advice if you are a true fan of dota just play the original warcraft 3 custom map either that or move to lolhonsmite this game is a disgracereally shame

ok a lot of mlg pros and fanboys were butthurt at my original dota review so heres my edit i guess my main reason for hatred towards dota 2 is aside from it being just another ing moba game is this valve picked creating this game over many many others keep in mind gabe newell and valve overall picked this game over stars of blood they picked this game over half life 3 they picked this game over left 4 dead 3 and this is just kinda spitballing but they picked this game over maybe ing portal and team fortress 3 thats my honest reason on why i hate dota 2 its just a generic moba game when valve had tons of other decisions i expected more out of valve i expected more out of gabe newell when you finally start working your fat  on said games instead ofthisill respect you again but even still i will never forgive your ing decision

most games reward the player to some degree when they have sunk hundreds of hours into them dota 2 is the only time sink i have experienced where you get absolutely nowhere for your troubles thanks to a heavily broken matchmaking system that can take forever to queue up a game as i am writing this a 5 stack for a ranked match can take up to 20 minutes dota 2 is less about how skilled you are and more about who you know if you dont have at least a dozen experienced friends who are consistently competent prepare to queue with some of the worst players you have ever played a multiplayer game with as an added bonus you will often get players who do not speak your language  even in ranked games i have often wished that i never started playing this game

dota 2 prefectly inherited the play style and cs feeling of dota the game flows pretty well with the new visual upgrade and getting rid of the old warcraft3 system its entirely a nice try however it is an embarrassing situation dota 2 and its valve behind it are facing first the same old problem of dotaits just too hard for new players to play even a seasoned player of warcraft3 find it pretty hard and need months of practicing to become an ordinary player not to mention those young players who never touched warcraft3 before second for old dota players the old and familiar sound of each hero vanquishes instead are newly created heroes that lack the lore backup them from warcraft i dont know how other old gamers feel about it to me its a completely different game lost the contest by his young and more energetic grandsonleague of legends sorry to say but the golden age of dota has faded dota 2 is merely a replacement of the greater past when we play it what haunts in our head are the night beckonsus here to obeyim here as always nonot really you are not always here farewell

i only recommend this game based on the fact that this is the most generous free2play title youre ever going to find the amount of content and support here is insane theres a reason why seemingly millions of people play this game for years on end chances are youll like it if youre looking for a free game but if youre looking for a free game chances are youre young unemployed with tons of time to kill which is what most of the fanbase here is it also happens to be the only kind of person who can learn this game properly youll need months and hundreds of hours before youre any good i want to say that besides all that its a great game but i cant ive dabbled in dota when it was just starting to get attention it was the only reason i installed warcraft 3 a second time my overall distaste for rts games is actually not a factor here as dota has very little in common with the game it was built on top of no my problem with the game is almost every core mechanic it expects you to learn is not fun at all to implement into your sessions i disagree completely with the tasks at hand that are in every moba out there i dont like the pointless constant neverending flow of creeps i dont like how everything is a race to earn exp at the fastest rate instead of using actual tactics and if you die or leave the proximity of a fight for 60 seconds youll never catch up to the enemy leveling so you better just give up the item shops are super convoluted and have nonsensical upgrade paths i dont like the essential systems of last hits and denying as they make no god damned sense killing your own infantry so that the enemy doesnt get the exp is ludicrous its the dumbest videogame logic i have ever witnessed and i cant get behind it if all this stupid crap were removed i feel like we would be left with a fun game but perhaps that game has already been done elsewhere like the pvp arena battles in guild wars i just feel like if this were simplified down to heroes battling each other directly with their core abilities id have a good time its so beautiful so well crafted so much innovation in the networking features presentation is tops epic as all hell everything you could want its a shame that all this is pasted onto a core game that is incredibly busted and dumb

do not play this game unless you have already been playing it for 2 years or more as a new player you will get matched against players with 2000 games or more experience and you will get matched with players who have 100 games or less even after years of playing and no matter how good or bad you are you will still lose about 50% of the time unless you have 4 more friends who play with you every game this game is just as bad as lol and hon in every aspect people will rage quit go afk feed on purpose give up after first blood the game is so well balanced most games will have 1 team with less than 50% of the other teams score not just in kills but in experience and gold earned also if you are thinking of switching to dota 2 from lol or hon do not waste your time it is the same game with the same issues and you will be 2 years behind the learning curve if you have never played a moba before do not waste your time more experienced dota 2 players will just treat you like garbage for your first 300500 games and make you want to not play

alright listen up instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians im going to tell you how dota 2 really is at its core in a nutshell dota 2 is a great game but a terrible experience at the same time you want to keep going back to it but you also hate to go back why one word community dota 2s community is for the most part rude and hateful and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting moba its unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away at the best of times often its much worse and i would prefer not to go into the details sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you havent actually done anything wrong occasionally though you come across friendly players and when that happens the game is a pure joy to play however since the game is 5v5 coming across four nice players at the same time if youre solo queueing is a rarity why then have i played the game for over 1300 hours the sensation of winning your determination to keep playing despite of the discouraging community is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning that sweet moment when you see the enemy ancient blow up and look back on the match remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying but even a victory can come with a grain of salt many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning there is a mute option but that doesnt stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat people can intentionally feed the enemy team ignore their own team teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player its really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time going ranked doesnt really solve the problem either at least not completely ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill it feels much more professional and tryhardish although you meet nice players more often nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell having played some matches in ranked i can say the mode isnt hate free i had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode another problem with ranked is that like i said its more tryhard many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such but dont get me wrong dota 2 is a great game in itself the core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well no technical issues to speak of not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so of which i have had none myself graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them all the various spells and abilites look great the game is very deep and complex with tons of items skill and item builds and strategies to learn it can be a bit terrifying to beginners but once you get the hang of things its engaging all the playable heroes are well balanced although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being op and free to play from the start thats another thing the game does right all the heroes are free and playable from the start unlike dota 2s undeniably very successful competitor league of legends dota 2s microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff which means there are zero pay to win elements in the game it really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game to put it roughly in perspective its like playing skyrim but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make calling you a fooping idiot every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective failed to kill alduin uninstall skyrim noob dont know how to make dragonbone armor learn to play tard its like that having played the game as long as i have i would say that you are better off not playing dota 2 the game is fun when youre winning because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine which is 50% of the time sometimes not even when youre winning it isnt the losses that make the game unpleasant its the unfriendly people if youre one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you you have a better chance of not finding dota 2 so terrible but realistically why should you even have to videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you cant have fun half of the time the game isnt worth it people will tell you that dota 2 is great but that greatness comes with a price do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view this review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what its really like not just the great things if you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis then youre golden the game is at its best when you play with friends and dont have to worry about getting a stick in the mud player on your team great game with a bad community

the game is a very cool and addictive concept however the community is terrible i would say about 3% of all of the people with whom ive played have not been annoying 85% of the community on the useast yes american servers are mexicans that do not speak english which makes it difficult to communicate 10% are russian s 97% of the people feed have terrible grammar and are all around annoying stupid and egocentric the game is fun but due to the terrible community i will not play it again

i hate dota 2 i hate it with a passion > it is not that the game itself is bad  really it is rather fun albeit somewhat repetitive given the lack of change in the battlemap  same map every time same hidespots same store locations etc  though during events sometimes some minor artistic features will be changed in any case a simple game as far as setting variety or lack thereof goes but a neat idea lots of variation with the heroes though some are considerably more powerful than others  not the best job balancing them in my opinion the problem with dota 2 is really the community which is lolstyle atrocious in all the times i played dota 2 i met a grand total of 2 friendly people both in bot matches i met a massive number of people who were just downright nasty pushy demanding immature not in the fun way unnecessarily combative just unpleasant to work with  not that there ever seemed to be much teamwork in this team game i suspect the atrocious community is why steam added the reporting system but really that just made things worse the system is frequently abused leading to players constantly reporting each other for made up things just because or out of bitterness at losing or because you dont switch upon their demand to speaking spanishrussian in the englishlanguagefiltered server etc this overreporting wouldnt be an issue if steam actually followed up to see if the reports had any merit and maybe removed the reporting option from players who constantly sling false accusations  but from what ive seen there appears to be no such oversight hardly surprising  there really is no incentive for valve to follow up getting reported kicks you into low priority matches which basically means that you have to go up against humans other players in this awful community who have also been reported and kicked into low priority there is a certain number of matches you must play in low priority before you are free to once more play the matches you want also locks you out of bot matches there doesnt seem to be any appeals process for this oh you can also get shuttled into low priority for spending too long without getting experience so if you are playing techies one of the heroes and want to go out and spend a few minutes planting mines the game may just decide that you have abandoned and kick you into low priority anyway i think ive wasted about enough of my time warning you off its a free game last i checked so i imagine youll download and play it anyway be my guest maybe these things wont bother you

felt like giving dota 2 a try and like most other moba games its very addicting i played a fair amount of the game as well as going through training the heros were interesting and had a lot of diversity selecting the lane you preferring in hero select was a nice feature thats the end of the good things i have to say about the game now for the bad still full of bugs no good information on how to cancel auto buy resulting in odd issues with ui which you cant tell if its a bug that prevents you from buying things and putting a large item icon on your screen an insane amount of leavers during games then when you attempt to disconnect when its safe taking minutes for it to give you the disconnect screen region ques seem to be a joke always selected just the two north american ques and one in three matches getting multiple people who do not speak english pretty rediculus when this is supposed to be a game where you need to communicate with your team this is also in addition to the very long que times more time spent in que today then actually playing the game this ultimately made me quit playing in digust summary some great heros with unique abilities ui has great features when they work correctly drop system that keeps you wanting to play worst community i have ever had the displeasure of playing with que times far too long picking a region to play in doesnt seem to matter though its out of beta still a large amount of bugs training system needs some work

i can not stress how bad this game is no words can describe this crap that was put together by someones five year old kid and said hell my kid smurt haha lul and then valve secretly buys this game and improves on it tell me how in the world do you improve feces well you dont and valve will never know that because they released games like csgo which is just a reskinned version of css also they added hat simulator aspects to get people addicted and shoving this  down your friends throats will dota 2 ever have a downfall you say well frankly it has russians are allowed everywhere and brazilians and africans and spacemen but why stop there why not add a reskin of a reskin oh wait they have and do they even have different voiceovers i cant stress how stupid the community is everyone who has 3 hours is already trying to find a simmilar if not better game that looks like dota for example league of legends which is a good game if not great game shunned by the dota 2 community as evil hell i have seen dota 2 fans hate starcraft 2 because it was a rts game it makes no god damn sense i actually did like one thing about dota 2 and that was uninstalling it i had so much fun you guys should try it too but really this game is running on so much swag and yolo it will be more hated than the actually it is one of the most hated game aready if you remove halo and cod out of the way at least trace ps this game is bad and you all should feel very bad

yes dota 2 is a true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming yes dota 2 is one of the best mmo  mmorpg game and it is true that it is one of the games that have awesome heroes with their awesome abilities and lores it is all true what they say defense of the ancients may be the best game in existent i can actually say that dota 2 was one of the most addictive awesomest and best experience in my gaming life but it may be also one of the worst guess what there are over 108  112 heroes and over 20 difficult heroes 40 relied heroes 40 carries in which you will be expected to be excellent in fact when you first enter the game you are already expected to be excellent and skilled in that game even now i am playing this game and may be planning to quit it but it is not the game i blame it into nope i have been through hundreds of heavy or light games from super mario to pacman to minecraft to zelda to call of duty left 4 dead and every possible heavy game you might even know yes i have been through dying games like crossfire mercenaries twelve sky dead game and world of tanks and i recommend for you not to play this game why its community is one of the worst im not talking only about the russians which most people are probably too concerned about im talking about everybody in generalized everyone repeat everyone will bring you down once you cling to this game this game may have lots of good recommendations but i beg to differ those people are the ones who will also tear you apart from this game trash talking coarse words harsh statements bullying its just like school only 100x worse and they tell you not to play the game if you cant take it its like saying dont bother living life if you cant take the hurtful words not to mention the imaginary boundaries between choosing heroes people tend to choose the less skilled ones even though they wanted to practice hard ones because they might bring the team down its that feeling when you want to use an invoker a very hard hero to use where people expect you to be good at him when you use it but you say nevermind just to avoid being blamed for loss people tend to treat this game as their life and may change their characters just because of certain problems with their peers this is one of the most ungodly and evil games yes i am a filipino and i am not proud of my trash talking inhibitants and neighbors in fact i am ashamed of it there will probably even more of them who will comment on this review adding more insults to me yes they might say i am weak or noob just because i cant play the game the way i want it to doesnt mean i have to give a bad recommendation no i have the right to speak my fellow brothers let us enjoy the game like we enjoyed minecraft and super mario let us embrace loss welcome our fellow newbies teach them our ways if they fail to do so give way to them let us respect our professionals embrace this game as one love our enemies as mentioned in the bible love our teammates forget trashtalking it doesnt bring you any good i just hope that this message will be viewed to all to remind them of what true gaming is like god bless happy gaming

the core mechanics of this game are fantastic and the diversity of gameplay is a strong selling point however it is a multiplayer game and the matchmaking is one of the worst i have ever come across it does not matter how long youve played or what level you are level is a good indicator of timeexperience you will be matched with complete noobs and elite players alike this is an attempt to balance the teams but all it does is create a scenario in which 95% or more no exaggeration of the games played are one sided stomps theres already been numerous complains about region locking i will not expand upon anything said by others it is a team game that requires communication and yes its difficult when a team mate does not speak the same language as you regardless of that language is not the main problem the main problem with dota 2 matchmaking is the enforced 50% winrate valve fanboys and other people will claim it does not exist but anybody who has played the game long enough knows otherwise it works by judging your skill level in one game and placing you with appropriate players in the next game if you do very well you may be matched with 4 very inexperienced players if you do poorly you may be matched with 4 very experienced players this wouldnt be a problem if dota 2 was not such a complicated game new players will be absolutely destroyed due to their lack of knowledge at the time of writing this i am level 50 in the game this has taken me over 1000 hours to achieve to put my next point in perspective as i said most games are onesided stomps and to prove this i usually check out the levels of every player before or after the game in games that i win my team usually consists of players lvl 50300 in games that i lose my team usually consists of players lvl 150 yes ive actually had a few games with lvl 1 players while i was lvl 30 when the total level of players on one team is hundreds higher than the other something is clearly wrong with the matchmaking system when one team has a few thousand more total hours played than the other something is clearly wrong with the matchmaking system playing well in one game will almost certainly cause you to lose the next game unless you are on what i like to call a valve permitted streak wherein the matchmaking decides to pair you with good players or awful players for a number of games in a row yes valve actually punishes players for doing too well and rewards players for losing too much a typical week of dota2 matches might look something like this wwwwwlwlwlwllllll repeating there can be longer or shorter streaks this is just an example this is not to alleviate myself or any player of fault everybody makes mistakes and we are not all professional players however when the teams are grossly imbalanced as explained above the fate of the match is decided before it even begins the reason i keep playing is those 5% of games where both teams are equally matched and the game is actually funchallenging winning a game in under 20min because the other team are mostly noobs not fun same goes for losing when its your turn on the noob team if valve ever fixed the matchmaking this game would be amazing both mechanically and socially that will probably never happen because dota2 has a lot of players and matchmaking isnt easy to begin with but please anything would be better than the 50% enforced winrate that is ruining my and many others desire to play this game if i know im going to losewin every game for the next 3 days why bother playing at all ps the community is notoriously toxic i would recommend avoiding if you have thin skin or get frustrated easily

oh man dota 2 dont get me wrong here at the negative review hear me out first i say with confidence that dota 2 is an addicting moba game with great gameplay and fun then why the negative review you say well for one the community is scarcely better than russia under stalin if you play on any server you must be 100% prepared for racism s jerks and 12 year olds not only that but even if you put your language preference as english half the players you play with are obnoxious peruvians this does not make the game unplayable but can seriously  you off if you have played this game as long or longer than me you will understand this another bad thing is that i would willingly compare playing this game to a adrug addiction you literally cant stop playing it when you start and when life interrupts you you will start to think dota 2 is more important that my friends is when you quit the game i had to wean myself off of it for like weeks until i couldnt stand looking at the icon anymore needless to say i uninstalled my advice for new playes get a friend to play it with you and dont become addicted that is all

ive been playing dota since dota 1 came up a decade ago in dota 2 the game mechanic is quite balanced every hero has its own strengths and weaknesses just like in the previous one definitely not a p2w kind of game however the solo mmr pairing is really awful i dropped from 3k to 2k in just a week and forever stuck in this level no matter how hard i play heres a few suggestions that i could think of they should also consider hours of playing and kda ratio instead of just mmr level to balance the pairing players who got into low priority should get more severe punishment eg longer period and add extra requirements to get away from low priority so they would think twice before they trashtalk and not obidient at this rate a skill in par with ti players is the only way to break out unfortunately you need to play a lot to get there if youre really lucky you could be paired with decent players and thats a one big if a casual gamer like me has no place in this game

edit 1 of course you would nerf wisps stun to slow yes because io is the hero who is totally op in every single game you play its not huskar its not pa its not sniper who need to be nerfed if that should be necessary at all never would such idiocy even slightly tickle my ans now that io finally recieved a more or less reasonable skillset dota 2 is the most balanced game in the whole universe edit 2 hey icefrog i came up with a totally cool idea but first let me lay down to problem for you you know all these poor people who only want to pick and play their totally imbalanced heroes they actually have to go through loads of serious trouble believe me until they can finally become overpowered beyond reason   that sucks so why on earth not provide them with a bit of a starting bonus right look at poor old huskar for example a possible maximum of 98% magic resistance so if i may ask you dear developers how to make up for those missing 2% heres where my idea comes into play why not just give huskar a set of six hearts before start so he can casually drain away half of his enemies health with one single burning spear at lv1 but this time without having to worry about maybe loosing an eighth of his own etc 010 worse than league of legends disclaimer review suitable for pub scrubs only not suitable for players of mmr >1000

poorly balanced lots of rng like runes and skills with chances to do certain things heros that are clearly op and yet somehow the developers icefrog and co thinks are balanced then you have the childish community who i dont have enough reports in the world for much more frustrating and emotionally taxing then any other game ive played its really not worth it just go play something else not to mention the new ranked matchmaking which is just a glorified pub with numbers attached to it its no different and you will get russians and  teammates as usual the game is  plain and simple

dota 2 has a horrible community that makes the game far less enjoyable than it could be new players are turned away because of this and older players have a worse time leading to further negativity towards other players the graphics arent the worst but they arent that good for a game that thrives on detailed teamplay and champion strategies it stunts the potential the only reason this game could be considered as more difficult than other games in this genre would be the graphics and lingering hero gameplay the graphics make it difficult to see what exactly is going on and doesnt get much easier as you progress pretty much every hero has at least one ability that will rootstunslow ect for around 4 seconds when a game has that kind of kill security it doesnt matter if the champions are balanced ive played many other game in this genre and they were all much more enjoyable than dota 2 when i first played a game or two it was extremely easy compared to league of legends or other similar games it may be more difficult to see whats going on but the spells are so overpowered on all the heroes that it was easy coming from game that have underpowered spells the worst thing about dota 2 would be the item system that has been implemented its just ridiculous how its not user friendly at all this game has such a bad ingame and community experience that players uninstall it after playing 13 matchesat me after 1000 matchesit was just sadim ing done with this game 610 edit ok ok i cant stop play it xd
