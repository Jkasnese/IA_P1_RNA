my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

one of the best freetoplay game out there and one of the best multiplayer experiences incredibly well balanced and very fun especially when exploring the abilities of each class both the coop and the versus modes are incredibly fun and unique in their one way i highly recommend it edit i disagree with those saying the game is pay to win all weapons can be found in game through playing the only items that cannot be found with a free to play account are cosmetics such as hats and accessories

this is a well made stylized team based first person shooter teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers there are 9 classes to choose from each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team this provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels the game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes at the time of this review there are two official modes of play player versus player and mann versus machine player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players within this mode there are different types of maps each type of map has its own objective or objectives for each team to achieve mann versus machine is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots players collect money from destroyed bots the money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots the pay to play submode mann up gives rewards upon completing a tour in addition to the official modes of play there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as versus saxton hale where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named saxton hale dodge ball where two teams of players playing as pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive zombie mod where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players to name just a few of the many player made mods available in addition to game play players will randomly receive free items from the game some of the free items given out are weapons hats and crates hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class crates can be opened with a key keys can be purchased from the mann co store or from the steam community market or traded for from another player most crates will list which items can be found within them the game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for the game is easy to pick up and play either alone or with friends yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly the dynamics between the different classes weapons play styles skill levels modes and maps provides content for many hours of play i have been playing since november 2007 and i still return to the game on a regular basis

theres a point where i can write a review that can be both amazing yet bias at the same time i hope i dont try to influence anyone by this review alone when i first got team fortress 2 it was an experience that cant be beat this firstperson shooter cant go to say that this is probably the greatest in gaming history from trading to crafting this game will keep you on th edge of your seat until you know its ready to stop playing there are 9 classes each that is unique and makes the game fairly balanced making th game experience even more fun with all the updates there are some positive and negative effects than can affect the team fortress 2 trading community as a whole but the whole aspect is to game have fun and enjoy your time on this game its your decision to buy from the store its your decision to craft metal and hats its your decision to play idle or even be a teammate and balance the rosters the community is just like this game random so if you wish to stop playing other fps titles and take a break from imbalanced games then your choice is this you wont be dissapointed

i was so excited to load up team fortress 2 a cool wacky fps that was team based and had many variations awesome i said to myself this must be way better than call of duty as the download was running i sat on my chair eager to play the game i started searching up some videos on the game and basic gameplay mechanics so i could get the edge on the competition i learned many things that i could apply in battle before i knew it the download was complete awesome i sat there as the game loaded up eager to get into a server i saw a map called ctf_2fort that map sounds fun i exclaimed i joined the server and was greeted with a class selection screen i figured i should play the sniper since my experience in other fps would help me through my first ever spawn i promptly walked forward out of the doorway and was greeted by a demoman camping spawn with his stickybomb launcher i died 1010

i should have probably written a recommendation for this game a long time ago as it is literally the most fun ive ever had in an online game playing with or without a team of friends competitive or casual this game delivers consistent fun that never really gets old the dynamics and balance of classbased shooter gameplay that exists in this game is unparalleled anywhere else that ive seen with no one way to play being superior the paytoadvance mechanics in other freemium games arent present here as aside from a few utility unlocks and different play styles the stock weapons are largely the best for every character with the microtransation and trading economies being largely cosmetic and for non gameplayaffecting in nature the support for competitive play is amazing with all levels of skill supported and many servers dedicated to skill improvement in addition to casual gaming the community is also amazing with no shortage of community content media artwork and a plethora of gaming networks that bring the tf2niverse to life outside the game and into the rest of the world still waiting for the civilian bobblehead from meet the sniper there is also a virtual macro economy with valves random item distribution system leading to a diverse market for all things tf2 within tf2 hats specialty weapons memorabilia items that can all be used ingame to customize your character and add depth to your actions ingame and within the steam community the bugs due to lack of optimization and occasional grief caused by players abusing voterelated moderation systems are the only two things that i can complain about with this game as its good wholesome fun regardless if youre just starting or are a competitive pro even though this game is nearly 7 years old the community that plays it really brings it to life once you get into it and with the nonstop fun that it provides its one of the genuinely few online games that i can wholeheartedly give my seal of approval to do i reccomend this game of course theres no boring tedium of waiting around for your opponent to act and hardset roles and proceedures that needs to be adhered to lest your teams fun gets ruined thanks to one person slipping up like in many of the other games these days heck you can charge at a rocket launcherwielding enemy with a claymore sword and kill him if you pull it off correctly i think it allows for more personal expression and playstyles than i think exist in a lot of games 9510 for doing everything right that can be done in an online shooter and actually listening to the concerns of the community also for providing not just something fun to play but a universe to be part of

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just

get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review

technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

team fortress 2 is not just a really fun free to play first person shooter with a very large variety of gameplay styles an awesomely distinct artstyle and rather comedic storyline it also breaks a lot of conventions in the genre and has continued to be a proving ground for what a game is truly capable of for the past five years or so tf2 has consistently evolved through a series of major updates introducing new gameplay elementsminor patches for bugs are issued at least biweekly and occasionally festive seasonal updates that make tf2 more eventful unlike a lot of fps out there team fortress provides plenty of things to do other than just shot bullet tf2 has a really nice replay feature which you can direct star in edit and render in ber qualityregardless of system specs your own wartime films that can be posted to youtube via ingame function tf2 was also one of the first fps to have a tradeable item drop system which has produced a very large and viable trading community and market where loot found or crafted in the game is exchanged for other ingame valuables like fancy apparel rare itemsweapons games from the steam store or even real world $ on the blackmarket this microeconomic metagame is what will essentially help support the game indefinitely and rewards players for there time spent playing the game and making it a worthy investment for learning the game the only downside i can note about team fortress 2 is that it is currently over 12 gigabytes in size and it will eventually get much larger if it continues on this upgrading trend being the king of free to play games i give team fortress 2 a perfect score 10 out of 10

this game used to be fun team fortress 2 used to have the friendliest community where people would help eachother learn how to rocket jump and give an engineer tips on sentry placement now its got hordes of lime green and pink scouts running in killing everything that moves and putting git gud scrub in chat with a keybind this game used to be fun for some it may still be fun to play for others its a way to pass the time and some people only still play because it has become routine to do so and for many the ingame economy has actually become a job a business even if they dont work for valve or any other software developer if valve were to remove metal and cosmetics entirely many people would lose hundreds or thousands of dollars this isnt even a game anymore people who play tf2 say that many aspects of this game need fixing why would you nerf the heavy and not the demman i would say that the whole thing needs fixing specifically the community this game used to be fun the community used to be fun to be a part of a few months ago it has become just as bad as the call of duty fanbase and community you may still find it fun to play this game you may somehow find the patience to deal with another toxic community my patience is shot i can deal with no more if any of you need me ill be playing a single player game i can actually play those without being told git gud noob or get rekt scrub after every death the npcs of a singleplayer game like fallout or metro are certainly friendlier than the real people who play team fortress 2 edit after about two months to think i believe ive put too much into this game to simply give it up entirely i believe ive found a little subcommunity thats still got the kindness i missed my opinion still stands as there are a multitude of subcommunities that promote behavior like this in exchange for donations looking at you saigns and nighteam and your pay to win admin slots ive also found a way to make sure that i dont get hit by phisher and scam bots play with the community that i trust and stay away from quickplay every friend request i get now i also tell them to prove to me that they arent a bot

before i start this is a good game the people however are not of the nicer catagory often when i get on servers there are at least 10 people swearing throught the voice chat or pasting inapropriate sprays and the comunity is so based around hats rather than playing graphics are just fine gameplay is fun bunches of maps and guns comunity has no repect people who swear all the time outnumber those who dont 31 do not get this game if you are under 10 please have a good life haveing a good life is a good thing 910 i do not recomend playing it though it is a fun game mute players and disable sprays and go free to play and you wont lose your life or money

i used to love tf2 but i dont think i can recommend it in its current state the community is awful the focus of the game is completely lost and it has become a fashion show for people and their collectables its hard to find people in random servers that just want to actually try and play the game anymore there is almost always one guy that just wants you to stand still and look at his stupid hat or rare gun most demomen now just want to run around with a sword and an axe and get kills instead of actually helping the team by destroying sentries like their class is supposed to do it is no longer a shooter people play to win at a casual level but more of a virtual hangout for weird kids i just want it to go back to what it was in 2007

well i honestly thank this game for a lot of my friends which help formed more of my personality but  this game is bland now that i actually see it from a logical point of veiw economy is now garbage the gameplay for me is just meh you play one game and youve played all of them excluding modded servers this game is old i respect it still but valve please lay it to rest its 7 years old work on something new or atleast give updates you get millions of dollars from csgo and tf2 keys new gamemode you say end of the line oh yes but wait its too advanced for new players lets take that from valve servers point being i honestly dont see how people play it for thousands of hours i really loved this game but as an outsider looking in its not good anymore its all the same

this game was cool used to have nice cooperative and competitive gameplay the original gameplay for the base game was enjoyable use certain weaponsclasses with a degree of teamwork against the enemy team with a decent plan of attack or tactics and score a win for your team thats what this game used to be now the game is all about the microtransactions for flashy weapons and useless cosmetics it has been transformed into a virtual shopping mall for kids and autistic manchildren

i know that tf2 had always a market with hats and stuff but why add the csgo skin system to it that wont get more people to play it will most likely scare them away tf2 just got d out by valve and im angry at them for this wasnt there enough money made already with all the crates and ducks and  and not to talk about the balance changes they simply suck the sense of most weapons got just ed in  like caber for example liberty launcher will be the new lochnload and the only flaregun pyros will use is the scorch shot 1010 balance valve maybe you should ask icefrog to rebalance tf2

a great game ruined by being made f2p it went from a great example of how classbased teamwork is a great thing to a bunch of idiots going around flaunting stupid hats and overpriced taunts i just played a game of mvm where instead of preparing for the match they spent the whole preparation period dancing a  conga dance every few months i forget why i quit playing this game and it only takes half an hour to remind me in 2008 i would have suggested this game to everyone today not a chance

team fortress 2 used to be so much fun hence my hours played then with a combination of freetoplay micro transaction  and hats becoming more important and more frequently added than new weapons this game became one of the worst experiences a player can have not the mention the spawn of so many dumb internet memes that mouthbreathing fans of this game just cant get enough of a personal complaint of mine is the lack of any highlander or 6v6 matchmaking but that isnt for everyone if you want a great experience pick up team fortress classic or quake world team fortress

ive quit this game ever since before the eotl update pretty much when they started nerfing buffing and adding weapons the game became somewhat dull and continuously repetitive despite the updates it was getting only thing stats changes did was to  up the balance and make me want to play it less then there is the updates which added new weapons really didnt helped at all it ed the game even more valve saw their precious tf2 that got them so much money from the mann co microtransactions is dying and they thought adding more stuff to it will make it more interesting and that people will come back running to it because of the new content wrong move today the gun mettle uptade was release from now on 3 july 2015 will mark the day when the tf2 we all knew and loved has died and was replaced with a more cartoonish version of counter strike good job valve good job edit some users might agree with this here maybe others not but im pretty sure the only way valve will ever have some of the old tf2 players back in the game is to launch a damn update that removes all this new weapons stats changes and csgo crap or atleast some official valve servers for vannila gameplay without this  updates some of use like then some dont why would you try to get new fans by adding all this  when you had a really huge community backing all of you up you had supporters people that actually loved the game the vannila one without all this new updates that completely changed the games feeling or is it that you saw the game is slowly dying and thought adding new stuff will make it last longer wrong move the game is soon becoming as old as 8 years what made you think a game like this will not eventually die it happens you cant avoid it in learn that your game is dying and you people are not able to bring it back alive with all this updates which add new content to it i still do like and support you valve you make great games and all that but sometimes you make some the most horrific and staggering decisions one could make and i dont wish for you to become like ea or anything close to them i want you to be the company we all know and love thats all stop thinking you can bring tf2 back to popularity with all this new additions

after seeing the f2p update i was glad because i wanted the game so badly but when time progresses the community gets more hostile towards you and it has been changed a lot the tf2 community is friendly in the old days but now its full of morons who are hostile towards you all these depressions i played against ty unbalanced stuff i decided to quit playing tf2 not entirely and forget all those idiotic moments i have if valve cared enough of their community then this wouldnt happen but  hits the fan by the eotl update instead the community complained that valve just made the update sucked and cutting the new map that has this reason too complicated or too challenging for new players facepalm valve are you trying to mock your community because you cut cp_snowplow with that reason if so why cp_steel is there thats too complicated and too challenging too and now you care about the $$$ and not the community goodbye tf2 youre good in the past and valve is gonna milk the game because they now care the money

alright there might be some people with some problems with my opinion this game was good until updates just came by and stuffed tf2s er3ctum with hats i mean so far ive only seen hats then some more hats but then maybe by a little chance some weapons but also trading it screwed my life over i started with trading a bit later and it was fun til i actually got this massive drop from mvm and got scammed by someone so i started with the real serious trading i traded for a year to get one single worthless unusual and people trying to scam me all of the time and if i didnt accept someone offer they kept calling me for a scammersharker in my opinion is this game was a good game once but it isnt anymore im leaving this game forever it have wasted so much of my life that there isnt a single chance that i will jump back into the hole of darkness my last words will be so long suckers bahahaha not seriously bye

for this review i will provide a timeline of the game that also explains where the game was and where it is now but beware if you are expecting a game that is a complex team and class based first person shooter with an excellent and dedicated community that was this game back in 2011 or earlier if you are a 9gag user or a lolsofunyrite gmod lover go ahead and play the game youll love it 2007 this game was super super fun vanilla tf2 was a revolutionary and addictive game silly and fun but also with quite a bit of depth to it great game 2008 new weapons are added to the game that add depth and variety to the already variable 9 classes new gamemodes and maps are produced adding variety although this is team game so community makes a good portion of maps since release gmod machinima is made by the community for the game and other source titles which is primitive stupid but still funny for those of us growing up great game 2009 more weapons maps and gamemodes cosmetic items hats are added okay not very interesting but added a way of differentiating from dedicated players and not dedicated players adding to the silly nature of the game bragging rights is always cool great game 2010 weapons are starting to get unbalanced or have skewed statistics mannconomy is introduced which was wierd yes it allowed the cool concept of steam wallet but it was a radical step away from the traditional payment model of the game didnt impact things too much but the differentiation between dedicated and non dedicated players started to crumble community starts to take a downturn for the worse as gmod machinima has become extremely run of the mill and new users still thinking its and tf2s silly nature is the bees knees item drops are rare but when you get something you can trade it for almost anything still a good game and great servers and gaming communities can be easily found early 2011 replay update added a really interesting feature of the game even if it was nothing revolutionary refreshed the content generated by the machinima community a little but only by a little the gmod community at this point is stale and the only things worth mentioning are a few diamonds in the rough game is good june 2011 uber update is released cool new weapons added game goes free to play as of this point existing community is entirely unsure of what is going to happen to the game the ingame economy has gotten stupidly complex there are way too many cosmetic items said cosmetic items have some stupidly high value that does absolutely nothing for anyone since bragging rights have since crumbled after item drops became common and manconomy update game is okay but some existing game communities manage to hold it together 2012 hopes that free to play would do good for the game where not heeded yes the game was more popular than ever but has become a time and moneysink because of community that is rapidly starting to corrupt since it went free to play free to play users become the overwhelmingly dominant playerbase and make a case to belittle older players when possible and drink in the support valve constantly throws them on the other side of the coin the immense number of free to play users are people who originally did not want to pay for this game and or are of a younger audience and half of them cant or wont even hold a decent ingame conversation chatting becomes largely pointless and unfruitful lots of screaming prepubescents and people who dont speak english on voice chat it is apparent that the switch to free to play was the nail in the coffin for many older users whom are alienated and feel betrayed for paying for a game that has slowly over time become a game it was originally not well thats not too bad right lots of new players isnt necesarrily a bad thing change is good right well the problem lies in that the incoming playerbase is hyped up on a game that realizes all the cool and lolsofunnyrite and lolsorandom gmod videos which have become purely revolting and uninteresting same exact stuff since 2007 folks of their dreams and act like it in the game its sort of like every incoming user was from 9gag the hosting community is not helped since many of the existing gaming communities radically change their policies and hosting format to comply with new matchmaking protocols and keep up with free to play making the old style of hosting community maps dead in favor of official maps this simultaneously limits the map pool to things old players have done millions of times and are dead tired of and destroys any motivation to make new interesting maps for tf2 which the mapmaking community used to make a point out of many communities and organizations that were formerly excellent bastions become obsessed with only generating revenue and gaining playercount and playtime statistics mirroring the degredation of the cosmetic bragging rights aspect of the game weapon balancing is not improved either since old classics are completely reworked and debuffed and newer weapons are not balanced and have ridiculous statistics allowing some users with certain loadouts to easily outperform an entire enemy team as such since 2011 a good portion of the original pre2011 playerbase has stopped playing the game or plays it much less frequently at this point i as well stopped playing the game 2013 and on game has continued to degrade but i have not since played the game and feel that it is a completely different product than what i originally paid for the lowdown if you are expecting a game that is a complex team and class based first person shooter with an excellent and dedicated community that was this game back in 2011 or earlier what the game is now is a free to play party shooter with lots of cosmetic items and a giant completely pointless ingame economy that is enivitably a giant time and or moneysink if you want to participate in it the community is complete garbage id be surprised if you found any gaming community worth sticking around for if anything this review can be summed up as this is game is not team fortress 2 it is team fortress 73 or something

i have mixed feelings about this game it is amazing in some aspects yet not too much in others lets first start off with the pros the game is free if you have a computer then you have no real excuse not to have this game you say that you may not be able to run it it runs on the source engine i run it great with my 32mb intel hd graphics card no excuse to not have it also there is a healthy player base in spite of the games age it also recieves updates still to this day the game also has a good amount of pvp game modes however there is an excellent pve mode in the game as well namely mann vs machine grab your friends because you are going to have a blast trying to beat some of the insanely chaotic levels such as ghost town at round 66666 or something like that on top of that you can also buy many weapons in the steam community market or from crates wait buying that kind of stuff lets move into some cons this game can suck you right in to buying weapons for your ingame character firearms arent the only thing though there are also many collectible hats before i rant on for ages about the market lets move on for many classes the weapons just do not feel nice for instance the heavys minigun is bad for 1v1 situations due to its massive spread though it is great for mowing down a whole group it is rather hard to just pickupandplay as well as it takes plenty of experimenting to find the right class for you also some of the classes are somewhat unbalanced the sniper is a great example 1hit kills al over the place for him enemy gets too close he pulls out a very rapidfiring smg and the enginner is a nightmare just plant equipment everywhere and begin the trolling a lot of the community is rude as well just because i drop the briefcase this one person just begins blurting out many 4letter words at me the final score 78100 conclusion this is a good game to play simply for mann vs machine i do not feel that this game has any other value than that mode

my story of the game when i first had it it was fun very fun i would play for ages then after afew months it got easyer repetitive and kinda boring the game was dieing proberly still is so they made a desperate update with csgo features the update wasnt 100% bad they fixed afew things that took them 5months 410
not recommended
why why would you fix that which that isnt broken i am fine with the weapon skins and all that crap doesnt bother me lazy very but didnt bother me but these ballances have just ruined the game the dead ringer is now unusalbe the enforcer has completely lost its flair heavies are rediculous now and the list goes on and on but i wont rant as its all already been said and ignored maybe i can come back to it one day after you mutilate its barely breathing corpse some more or maybe youll listen to your fans and atleast add servers that revert the update but then you never were one for listening were you valvethank you though for consulting your community on this update and thank you for allowing me to enjoy over 1900 hours of my life on this game before you ruined it all in all if youre new to the game go for it i hope you enjoy veterans like me i think its time we move on and try to find a new nonserious fps dirty bomb is looking promising as is overwatch and before its asked no i am not giving away my items i intend to hold onto them as fond memories from before tf2 hollowed out

maybe its because ive played this game for so long and because of that i view things differently that being said im beginning to see the community fall apart ingame at least and it is becomming difficult for me to enjoy this game very frequently have i had to leave a server due to the teams being very deliberately stacked for those that dont know what the term stacked means it is when one team has very skilled or cheap players and the other team has players of a much lower skilllevel quite a few people will switch teams midgame to join what they percieve as the team most likely to win or if they know a person on the other team this is a scourge on valve servers in particular speaking of scourges there are way too many little kids playing this game now what bothers me is not the fact that they tend to abuse the microphone function of the game with their highpitched voices they are sometimes called squeakers because of it but the fact that so many little kids are playing a ratedm game you hear that parents team fortress 2 is a ratedm video game it is not for little kids i probably shouldnt even bother calling this out though the parents probably arent even paying attention to what their children are doing online this indicates even worse problems though for a firstperson shooter isnt the worst thing a little kid could find on the internet i know that there are other multiplayer fpss out there that also have this problem but team fortress 2 is the only one ive found that i consider to be worth playing as i have said before maybe it is just because i know the game well but i am noticing that players are resorting to cheap tactics much more frequently than they have in the past this includes abuse of the demonmans stickybomb launcher stickyspamming staying near the opponents spawnpoint to kill them the moment they leave their base spawncamping and glitch abuse on a related note i cannot find as many fun players as i was once able to usually i myself have to flush them out by messing around in the middle of the map at my expense pootis pow all of the previous issues ive noted would be tolerable if they were the only issues present the issue that tips the scales for me is the everwidening skill gap amongst players there are some players that could very well take on an entire enemy team of relatively unskilled players singlehandedly now imagive that one team has several of these people yeah the other team isnt really going to have a lot of fun assuming they do not have any saxton hale solders of their own there are also some players that just downright stink at this game like me with the exception of the medic class maybe they have shaky hands like me maybe they have a bad internet connection maybe they have slow reflexes but the point is they are helpless when pitted against a skilled player i am having trouble finding players that have just modest skill much like the usa tf2s middleclass is eroding like a piece of calcium in an acid bath to conclude i believe that team fortress 2 is beginning to go through some turbulent times with respect to its players i am finding it difficult to continue playing the game due to team stacking a swarm of little kids cheap tatics and a wide skill gap amongst players tf2 certainly isnt down for the count but its taking quite a few hard punches

i wish i could recommend this game because i got alot of enjoyment out of it a couple years backbut i cant recommend this game with a clear conscience  my biggest complaint is that the community has gone downhill so much from when i had previously played it that its just not enjoyable anymore i used to play an hour or so every time i had a day off work people were generally nice and the toxicity you normally see in online communities that kills the enjoyment of matches was an easily avoidable rarity not a norm the community was generally supportive of new and underperforming players guiding rather than berating when there was too muchlittle of a class people would ask and someone would switch over even if they were admittadly not as good with that class it was easy to get good because it was rewarding to get good it wasnt uncommon to get complimented back then myself expecially when i played pyro or engineer however since i recently returned to the game its now the opposite its rare that i dont see a few people insulting and berating eachother as a result teamwork is typically limited and you typically wont see more than one or two medicsengineers combined if anyone bothers to play them at all with all the griefing the community now more closely resembles that of world of warcraft in that aspect the slowdown in valve adding new content is also a negative factor to consider verdict try it if you like it might be good to kill a few hours but dont expect to feel the same attachment to this game that others had experienced its definitely not what it used to be

the game itself is awesome and i loved it when it came out i had an awesome time but now its the type of people on the game that has ruined it ie racist uneducated kids and some adults too language used hackers consistant abuse of other players and heres another question for you if its free to play for a game that was m15 when it came out where do the kids get the funding to get items from the store or market i look at the parenting ive tried to like the game and boy have i tried too like it since it went to free to play i just cant stand it so many young kids playing a game when it first came out it was a m15 game hackers galore is another issue i still play it from time to time but i just cant recommend this game at all have a lot of friends play it and they swear by it but yet they still show me hackers and kids doing stupid things on the game till its reduced dramaticly i will stand by this

stay as far away from this game as you can what was once a fun peaceful game has become an ad riddled money grab bs game if and when you can join a server through quick play all you get is bs donator perks and endless ads from money hungry server owners i have always felt if you need players to pay for your server you dont need to run it but now valve doesnt feel that way and allows them to run ads through quickplay while the report server function is broken so you have no choice but to play with ads and bs perks or play on empty servers unless you want a stupid game mode like some pony crap or vs saxton hale bs fix the problems before adding more valve and maybe this game wont die off in a blaze of ads and money grabbing

creative bankruptcy is plugging in an eight year old game into the unregulated market of minutely different yet wildly expensive images applied to 3d meshes that has been so profitable to that companys other multiplayer first person shooter the beauty is that much like hats and weapon designs they wont even need to hire artists to develop these assets after a whilebecause they just pay the community less than actual employees to do it for them it is true that gun skins and tour crates do not have an effect on gameplay however i would think gameplay would be an important part of an update to a game especially when its the big selling point of that update and im not saying this will kill tf2 it wont ive played this game on and off since it came out and you had to pay money to even get the game and it still hasnt died even if the glory days are over you can sit down and still have a decent round or two if you are dying to but if any company that didnt have the mythology that valve has as being the company thats different from all the rest released an update to a long standing game that required you to pay not once but twice to access its contentwith the inevitability of future payments confirmedthe digital ink bemoaning the practice on message boards across the web wouldnt be able to dry fast enough

words are below if you dont like long reviews move on if you do please take a moment to read mine take a look at my hours ive spent several months playing this game those times i enjoyed it now its just another grayed out game that ive undownloaded they call it a hat simulator for a reason its a steam profit house when you unbox an unusual and everyone needs a hat otherwise you are deemed a noob by the screeching five year olds or a no life by the people that have spent longer hours than you have the guns have their own stats and everything its not like your call of duty game where its a different gun with the same rate of fire and a small upgrade from your last weapon hence why this game doesnt appeal to many of those players its a fun game because its different and not realistic you can rocket jump for crying out loud what more is there to say as all that goes the game sounds like it should be fun and there is a ton of things i wont explain but as i said i undownloaded it and here is why the latest update gun mettle has made every gun you owned into a pea shooter or a nuclear weapon they loaded all the good weapons with stuffed teddie bears and made every formerly worse weapon into a davy crockett you remember that weapon that did an extra 15 damage at the target but had a slower reloading time lets reduce the damage by twenty and keep it at a slow reloading time all while adding this extra pointless buff the crates stay the same you still toss money on those keys while hoping to get a dance from a stripper when you unbox it only to find the newest crates closely noting the csgo crates and weapons yes ladies and gentlemen that means skins theyve just made all the default weapons have new skins to them much like counter strike i had faith that they would keep the game like it was and not incorporate another system from another game into it surely enough people put these weapons up for outrageously cheap or overpriced to everest but then again so were aussies multiplayer and mvm are still alright though its still the same gamemodes its just like i said though the games are full of kids morphing into dinosaurs and proclaiming they are the best gamer ever but some things never change the new weapon buffs really downgrade everything because now those weapons that everyone got rid of because they were bad everyone is going to want if you play csgo and never really wanted this game because it wasnt like it at all nows your chance its a f2p game that now has all the comforts from counter strike aside from it not taking two bullets to kill someone i would have rated this game about an 8910 but with the recent update that i hope stays for only three months like it says its going down to a 4310 that sums up all that there really is to know about this game i had faith valve i really did

bet this is gonna get downvoted to hell but i dont care already turned into a game of rock paper scissors so many update changes that fix issues after 7 months minimum and the lack of the developers commitment to the game id think they are all playing dota or csgo at this point constantly shifting community that everyone leaves and comes leaves and comes at this point it is only a field for new players who just installed the game and people who have too many valuables on this game that are afraid to admit their investment is lost every class is limited to only engaging enemies in only one way and thats it also weapons like liberty launcher tide turner phlog baby face blaster are only there for the sake of opening more possibilities for the players to learn something the wrong way but at this point there isnt much point to learn if all you are supposed to do is just airblast spin up and shoot playing tower defense using a noskill class only focused on making the player feel special as if they are good at sneaking there is not much point to the game i dont even care what anyone says about what i am saying because i want to keep this short but still descriptive enough to express that i have been in every situation that happens in tf2 but come to think of it the game is repetitive sure every games are duh but every class is so blindfolded into only one type of engagement that it is really questionable the only class that seems to be capable of slightly more types of engagements must be soldier unique weapons are not any better the only good unique weapons are the ones that has the least amount of difference compared to stock that is enough  so the game not really advanced or that good at all at this point just an inbred of quake and the few other valve titles but if you have things to counterargue against this comment why bother reviews are there for people who dont even have the game installed and yet a person who plays the game can also come and look for negative reviews to argue against them in the end it is all personal preference by the way also a  community this game has spawned so ill only recommend this if you like roleplaying like a toddler also that desperate attempt from valve to try to resurrect the corpse of this game with mixing it with an other game

im going to be upfront for this review team fortress 2 is just a shell of its former self its really fallen from grace over the last few years ill start with whatever positives it has left gameplaywise its really good the vast amount of weapons and the nine classes can open different gameplay styles and invoke different strategies the different game modes create a variety of things to do ingame both versus and coop mann vs machine requiring strong teamwork and rewarding your efforts is quite nice too however thats where the positives end where theres the good the negatives arent far behind the proverbial trail the game becoming freetoplay itself initially had potential but as the community grew it became increasingly venomous towards one another almost everyone has the mindset where if you dont own a cosmetic youre deemed the scum of the earth in their eyes and dont deserve to hang out with them cosmetics are just that cosmetics they dont have any effect on gameplay besides having your avatar with a piece of headwear the other downside to freetoplay is that anyone can play the game that includes the likes of kids are young teens who are below the required age to play this game the game is rated pegi 16 or rated m for mature for western audiences yet theres a huge influx of people so young that it questions if parents these days even look at the age ratings anymore or if they just dont care these kids are hanging around with adult gamers which if the worst case scenario that if either party owns a microphone it can potentially lead to harrassment griefing and bullying the servers are generally good but sometimes the server owners set up rules which are very questionable for example i got banned from a vs saxton hale server for just crafting a measly cosmetic its a really trivial thing to react to and handing somebody a ban for another issue is that most server admins abuse their powers and cant handle an ounce of constructive criticism it puts a bad impression on themselves and on their own server lastly i previously praised mann vs machine for its cooperative play and requirement of strong teamwork but it is also without its flaws youve got nine classes to choose from each having their unique advantages that make them a force to be reckoned with if the right upgrades are applied however theres usually a group of people who will ban or threaten to ban someone if youre not the class they want you to be for example sniper is potentially a deadly class with explosive headshots that can take out mobs and guarentee the money being picked up but there are those who take offense to simply seeing snipers portrait in the hud and demand you either change class or leave the server with or without force it really sours the experience especially if youre an excellent sniper player another issue is people will overreact if the team is unable to get the bonuses after each round if the team misses even 1 credit most people will storm out of the server immediately instead of just swallowing their pride and moving on team fortress 2 was a game i once enjoyed but unfortunately the damage has been done its a lost cause and valve themselves dont see any passion in their product anymore just using it as a cash cow instead of catering to their most devoted audiences or fixing the issues present in the game i cant recommend playing team fortress 2 regularly anymore but i wont stop anyone if they want to give it a go

i have over 2000 hours in tf2 i love this game ive never actually written a review but this latest update gun mettle is a gigantic slap in the face from valve to the few dedicated people who still play this game after all of valves crappy updates valve doesnt listen to the tf2 community when they release updates the people who decide what content goes into the game clearly dont even play it end of the line has received enough critism im sure that valve is aware of how much of a $@& up that was but gun mettle is simply too much ive tried csgo many times because of how many of my friends play it i dont like it valve had to different niches filled with tf2 and csgo my question is why the $@& vale decided to turn tf2 into csgo we dont need weapon skins we have hats and unusuals and strange weapons why do we need stattraks and weapon wear and challenge coins seriously why do you do things like this valve who did you design this update for was anyone and i mean anyone asking for this no tf2 is dead most people are talking about overwatch coming out but for anyone who cant wait dirty bomb is a much better game whose developers are actually aware of the fact that there are people who play their game

i have a lot of time and effort put into this game after 6 years of playing and how i experience games these days wasnt worth it this game in my opinion is horrible many people are addicted to it but if they saw what i see many would agree this game is poorly balanced and developed the only way to possibly have fun in this game is by being those players with tons of expensive items and infinite skill with topnotch computers usually these people also take advantage of cheap flaws in the games as well soldier in my opinion is the most absolutely overpowered class i say this because its always that class experienced players play since soldier has pretty much no downsides when played well nothing can touch them then there are snipers that never miss sporting their unusual and professional killstreak sniper rifle sticky spamming demos that taunt after every kill combo pyros demoknights so on and so forth now everyone can agree that these are a part of the game but they get rediculous the only way tf2 is fun for me at least is by actually being able to be successful unfortunately for me i have adhd and stuff so that makes it much harder especially when there are servers full of unusualwearing players who absolutely destroooy everything and take advantage of public servers full of learning players it makes this game unbearable and kills any aspect of fun when instead of doing a role or playing for fun all youre doing is trying to outwar that one player who is ruining the game lately for me mvm seems to be the only thing i can consider always fun about tf2 however you have to pay for a rewarding experience that wouldnt be so bad if free mvm games werent dead or full of people who havent yet learned the rocket jumper deals no damage and such while on the topic i feel like mann up should have tour match ups so players with few tours only find games with players with few tours and the same for people with higher tours since mvm is basically kicking that no tour pyro whos using the degreaser i used to have sooo much fun with this game and i was addicted sadly i feel like this game has become nothing more than a money harvester for valve since you see things that give profit to them get added 100x more often than something the players have fun with i understand maps and weapons have to be tested and balanced though although i feel many weapons have failed their tests and were added anyway my main reason for this review was that i wish team fortress 2 was about just what its called team fortress instead it is freetoplay team carried by advanced players fortress at the end of the day the only people who have fun are the ones who are beyond professional and valve being professional takes time but some people cant catch up to that point and its not fair for new players or those who struggle with the game i only wish the game was more balanced for newer players and had more about the game itself and less about hats and valves profit i miss my old team fortress 2

rereview so i played this game for about 560 hours or close to it and i have to say i was not entirely enjoyable from the time i began to now there has certainly been a degrading quality in the communitymarket and game on the community aspect it seems that for the unfortunate turn many have left and those who remain have no real business in playing anything well case and point mvm the market has crashed essentaliy putting my 2 years of trading work going to the dumpster and of course everyone moved to the csgo market the game overall has had little content changes and barely anything new concerning gameplay of course valves hat fetish has gotten the best of them i can honestly say that while this game is free to play i spent quite a bit on it and i really do regret it

dont bother spending your time in this game its unbalanced has terrible net code and the community is one of the worst because they cant take any criticism of the game i played in all forms of competitive casual and everything inbetween and the experience always left me feeling hollow its not fun to die because a pyro walks at you its not fun to die because of sudorng its not fun to try and do work for your team only to discover that you are the only person thats not a sniper or spy i used to enjoy it but it has grown to the point where it plainly infuriates me if you dont have any other games go for it but your time would be much better off spent on a better game

this game is a must have for 12 year olds with low self esteem seriously if you have the maturity of a 12 year old child and want the opportunity to make yourself feel better about your crummy life by belittling people on an online multiplayer fps game then download this game right now i have experienced many times on this game absolutely disgusting behaviour from other players in the community it is sad it is sad knowing that there are so many children growing up in this world who show complete and utter ignorance unprovoked to people they do not even know for instance a kid said this to a friend of mine while in a match hey liked how i wrecked you last round no reply from my friend oh what you got nothing to say must be too poor to buy a mic so poor yet he owns a computer right i then attempt to kick this child from the game for his ignorance random other guy who must have been this childs friend starts what the f$% you trying to do my vote to kick the initial child fails they try and kick me shouts kick this f@$^% out of here hes trying to send me pictures of his d$%^ i get kicked now i dont care about being kicked out of a game there are many other lobbies i can join to play and try to have fun on what i care about is how completely toxic the community is on this game yeah i get it it is the internet you have to at some point accept the reality that there are many trolls and immature children out there the problem for me is not ignoring it and moving on the problem is when i like many others sit down to relax in their spare time and try to have fun playing a team based game get put into situations of unpleasant abusive conflict constantly it becomes something besides fun and enjoyment but rather stressful and disturbing literally every server will have people on that have nothing better to say besides overused insults there is absolutely no need for it there is not a single thing that requires someone to be a complete piece of trash in order to have fun or even be good at a video game it ruins everything video games are meant to be about besides the absolutely toxic community in which you cannot really change in anyway there are other issues the game is goofy with its cartoon style which is a hint that you should not take it too seriously if you find yourself taking tf2 seriously then that is the point in time that you should uninstall it trust me once you start taking the game seriously you will degrade yourself by involving yourself with the toxic players you will lose money you will lose friends and you will no longer enjoy something you once did i realized this after seeing how much i spent on the game the situation i explained above and when i started to become frustrated at people dancing around the spawn wasting time which should be the fun of it yet it became annoying looking at the lucrative micro transaction style system involved it is at least how i see it addicting who wants to use ugly stock weapons when they can open crates to get fancy shiny ones or simply buy them constantly buying more keys to open more crates in the hopes of getting something valuable to get your money back or make a profit it hardly ever happens it is exactly like gambling and the risk is greater than the reward you may get an unusual hat but what does that actually do for you can you sell it and make a profit yes can you withdraw that money and buy yourself a bike or a baseball bat or pay the rent and bills nope every dime you spend on this game is forever invested into steam so you dont really make anything off of buying and trading these types of virtual items and they do not improve your skills in the game or increase your enjoyment it gives you this false sense that you did but in the end it eats your money and that is its only purpose spending money on games like this is okay if you really feel like it will bring you enjoyment but fair warning it can end up costing you a significant amount of money especially if you do not know what you are doing i let myself became consumed in this system and have spent much more than i should ever have with next to nothing to show for in the end i regret spending any money on this game on the virtual items especially now that i have lost my enjoyment of the game overall i had fun 800 hours on a free to play game in my opinion made it worth it what i realize now though is that games like this are only as fun as the people you play them with i started seeing a significant amount of toxic players no matter what server i was on and that killed my enjoyment listening to people constantly insult each other over nothing gets tiring i guess maybe i am just at an age where i have to move on to another saga of gaming to find more enjoyment will i miss playing tf2 probably not now that i have expanded my game library will i play it again likely but only for an hour or two here and there just to have fun i will never invest my time like i used to back into this game because it is really not worth it i would recommend if you want to have some fun 100500 hours try team fortress 2 out but my warning and the point of my review do not invest a significant amount of time andor money into this game it is really not worth it once you become tired of the toxic community everything you worked on getting will increase your disappointment when you make the decision to stop playing the game

i realize i came late to the review party but i might as well give it a shot too team fortress 2 is the f2p team based shooter that many know and play and has a long and interesting history in the gaming world below ill list the pros and cons of the game which are based on my personal experiences and the experiences of others while playing agree or disagree feel free to post why in the comments and as always i included a tldr version at the bottom now lets begin the pros  9 different character classes each offering a unique gameplay experience each class has a different base role but you can specialize and change up your playing style in many different ways thanks to the many different weapons available in the game  a variety of game modes to mix up the gameplay these are mostly objective based and do their job well in keeping the game from becoming stale  mann vs machine mvm for short this is a special game mode completely different from the others it pits you and 5 other players into a tower defense styled game where you are pitted against a robot army very fun to play but its hard to find a proper team unless youre playing the payable version with tickets  the game is f2p free to play a great thing about this game is that you can download it try it out and even play it for your desired length of time for free please note that the game is free to play and not free for everything it has to offer  not p2w pay to win theres little difference between a free and a premium player if you lack a desired weapon you can earn it as an achievement craft it or find it in one of the many random drops you get each week  cosmetics i chopped a demonic airplane pilot assassins head off with a golf club as a one eyed black scottish demolitions expert wearing traditional japanese samurai armor before i was smacked to death by a giant russian santa claus wielding a large piece of ham as a weapon who was was being healed by a german chef doctor screaming about oktoberfest and dispensers you may have to dish some money out depending on what you want though  you dont have to make an account aside from your existing steam account to be able to play click download wait for it to install play the game  emphasis on team gameplay knowing your role and cooperating with your team while still being allowed to do and play what you want is what makes this game so unique and fun and theres nothing quite like the feeling of satisfaction after you change the tide of the round and bring victory for yout team  trading turn your tf2 into an economy simulator become a merchant and sell your stuff to others for profit invest carefully and you can actually make some real life profit with this the cons  class andor weapon imbalances not going into detail here since in the end its all a matter of peoples different opinions and beliefs and it also depends which map and game mode is being played but i think that we can all agree that theres no such thing as perfect game balance no matter how hard the developers try  random crits some love them and some hate them a crit in most cases means an insta kill even if youre at full health with only a few exceptions they make the game much more chaotic and unpredictable to the point where they can completely turn the tide of a round around you will get them too but for every crit kill you will get killed right back by them tenfold  communitys attitude towards f2p players not pointing fingers at anyone here but from what ive seen new players and f2ps in general are being treated badly and have a hard time being accepted into tf2s community im not saying everyone is like that though as there are also people out there who welcome new players with open arms gladly helping and advising them when necessary  hackers with both steam and tf2 being free you can often find hackers on official servers ruining your fun it takes a few days for the ban to apply even after theyre reported and there is nothing stopping a hacker from simply creating a new account after he gets banned and continue right where he left off  hit registration sometimes it works properly but for the most part its just awful especialy noticeable when using meele weapons where you get the hitsound and you see your weapon hit but no damage will be dealt works the other way as well where hitting the empty space next to your opponent will score a hit  lag compensation getting headshot by a sniper after youre already out of his line of sight behind a corner is always fun  bugs and glitches every game has these so theyre unavoidable but i often feel that a lot of them could be prevented by better testing before updating andor patching them up already especialy the ones that have gone for years without getting a proper fix  valve the developer doesnt care anymore the amount of content and updates that this game receives is slowly declining the updates bring us cosmetics and crates nowadays with the occassional weapon here and there the end of the line a major update that the community was expecting for a long time was a huge dissapointment for me and others alike for example additionally valve deciding to rerelase some very rare limited items in a new set of crates while also raising the prices of keys and other items in their mann co store makes me think theyre converting tf2 into nothing but a money milking machine now the conclusion tf2 is still a great and unique game even with its age but overall i cannot say that the pros outweigh the cons and therefore i sadly cannot give it a positive recommendation it remains one of my favorite games of all time and as a longtime player i will keep playing it but i cant advise new players to do the same you can install it and try it out for yourself and then create and mould your own decision from what you experience if you dont intend to play much or for long then stick with your free account if you decide to go for the long term investment then pay what little it takes to get a premium membership but dont spend more money on it afterwards i realize ill get a lot of hate from the negative aspects of this review by angry fans but someone has to speak up for once this review would have easily received a positive recommendation if valve would just show that they still care i still have hope and in the case that things really do change ill gladly edit this review to a big thumbs up i apologize for any mistakes in spelling and grammar and i hope this review helps you tldr version game is still good but nowhere near as good as it was before it has a lot of issues the developers dont seem to care anymore and its turning into nothing but a money milker

i know this game is free and all but valve have gotten a lot of money off this game a lot and youd think that as a thanks for handing over your dosh for virtual hats we might get an update that was carefully thought out had a lot of community interaction added many new interesting maps weapons or mechanics or maybe even fixes some problems and balances some things not anymore the latest update gun mettle probably had zero thought put into it lets put in skins cases and mission coins straight from csgo and maybe  up a couple weapons with balance changes honestly i feel as though all valve want now is our money if you keep releasing good updates people will continue to play and put more money in releasing moneygrabber updates that add in nothing but stuff that you have to pay for noone would want to play and put money into game that only gets updates including just that when i saw gun mettle the only thing that looked even remotely cool were the new maps that was it most of the balance changes were stupid and unneeded like why nerf the powerjack if you want to play a game that gets no love from its devs has a  community there are very few nice and fun people and is also slowly dying admit it it is dying sure why not get this game i used to love this game but valve literally dont even give a  anymore its like theyre about to abandon this game but theyre trying to get as much money as possible before they do

tf2 at this point has become effectively counter strike global offensive in terms of cosmetics with the gun mettle update valve is bleeding over the cosmetics system for weapons from csgo and putting it in this game i hate this ideathere is no benefit to the player from this if anything this will drive the community the further apart than it already is sure its cosmetic but this is a game where if you dont have a hat youre a talentless noob ive enjoyed this game so far i probably wont play it anymore after gun mettle tf2 is basically trying to be something it isnt the game has turned into counter fortress 2 the quest for more money edit another question why do we need two cosmetic systems in one game we already have hats and this community assumes the level of your hat uniqueunusual is your measure of skill im very suprised valve didnt ask themselves is this a good idea again no benefit to the player only to valve edit 2 seeing alot of people not getting the point of this review valve is taking you all for a ride if any other dev were to do the same thing that valve is currently doing you would be getting your pitchforks and torches out is it because you think you owe valve something you owe valve nothing putting in a cosmetic system while it already has one is bad enough putting in a cosmetic system that messes with the economy of cosmetics already in the game is even worse edit 3 this update isnt so much the death of tf2 tf2 will always endure no matter what its the fact that the update feel like a big middle finger from valve weve already got hats weve already got australium weapons along with festive weapons we do not need call of duty esque camos even worse some of the major weapon changes made previously viable weapons into literal piece of garbage gun mettle is one of the worst updates in tf2s history and this is coming from a guy who liked every other update thus far shame

a mess of a game that creates pointless unwanted stress and a moronic care for virtual hats rather than a focus on gameplay this has become a mess of asshats wanting virtual hats and using whatever means they can to acquire them while innocent people are left stressed and depressed with nobody being actually able to play the ing game if you can manage to actually find servers where people actually play while somehow avoiding the asshats whom sadly ravage this game then consider yourself lucky but im personally done with this game i may return to it here and there just to  around but full time playing and trading have just become ugly things

after loving this game for almost 1900 hours of playtime i dont even know what to say to the last update gun mettle except this where is team fortress 2 because when i loaded this game up after the update i could swear csgo or cod started up instead oh wait this is team fortress 2 i was already wondering why i couldnt kill people with 2 smg headshots jokes aside if you want team fortress go look up fortress forever because this game is completely mutiliated it hardly is team fortress anymore trust me
