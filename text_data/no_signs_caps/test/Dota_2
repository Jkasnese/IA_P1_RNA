a maelstrom of anger fear disillusionment and sheer ecstasy dota 2 is all these things and more youll learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes an average match takes in that short amount of time grudges will be born heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a g r r martin epic and yet for all its emotional drama both the highs and the lows youll still yearn for more just learning to play is an adventure into masochism everyone begins as a dreaded n00b unable to contribute anything but gold and xp to the opposing team a few weeks later and theyll have learned a few tricks where to place wards how to turn off auto attack in the options and crucially the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting give it a few months and theyll be rolling with the regulars double stacking recrowing and ggwp will become part of their vernacular immunity to the insults will be delivered to them upon chins which have since grown thick with stubble and caloused skin theyll have succesfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the worlds burgeoning esports scene consider the football metaphor pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots strips and footballs rooney messi and neymar use in packed stadiums full of shouting people if all of the above sounds a bit much ask yourself whats the point of playing if you dont feel something in the end dota 2 delivers passion and fury in spades and like all great games its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego just dont look at the item store your partnerparentscommon sense will never understand why you spent $35 on some virtual eye candy for your favourite hero

dota 2 is a first person mmo rpg survival horror game developed by ea and ea only where you have to fight to survive in the drunken robot zombie apocalypse with nothing but your bare feet as your hands are too preoccupied taking off your panties in excitement for this sick filth the main protagonist is you jakob you are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy jakobs model really matches his personality a hipster emo gothic sexdriven male paired with the voice acting of morgan freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable the storyline is great i love how the developers have a completely separate prologue chapter for the story explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell thats not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game you start out in the middle of  er russia spending time with your beloved family and find out you are really really attracted to your cousin you take her out to show her the world when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you your cousin falls into the crevice you are devastated you try to rush home but then all of a sudden you hear a big  er plop you look behind you and there are robot zombies all drinking vodka you then turn all around and find yourself surrounded and ill stop there otherwise i may end up spoiling the prologue the pvp in this game is spot on its like the developers know that youre the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the getgo its brilliant need i say more fine i shall just like the amazingness that was dungeon keeper mobile you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into eas pockets its fantastic the best part too its free             um what i meant to say was it doesnt even cost a dime overall i would say this game is a 1010 a musthave game ea has really shown how to create such a game im just waiting on the dlc to come out later since surprisingly there was no dayone dlc

lovely game its an amazing game  technically outstanding showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail especially in the allimportant multiplayer aspects the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying it took me a long time to warm up to but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends if you can spare the time  play it

a game that isnt for the faint of heart while not matching the level of gore or horror in other game dota 2 and other mobas will get your heart and blood pumping like no other games its highly competetive nature is both its best and worst feature though as people sometimes cant get over the fact they just got owned by another player or are about as graceful as a dancing hippo when they own another player im not entirely bothered either way this is a great game with insanly compelling mechanics at the low low price of nothing this is a must try a more detailed look at dota 2 its history and its significance can be found in my review of it on my blog httpmouseandcontrollerblogspotcom201308dota2html

i dont like mobas this was my very first reaction when a buddy of mine was trying to convince me to play dota2 at that moment i didnt want to but for the sake of friendship i decided to give it a shot at first the game seemed hella confusing the only thing i liked back then was the main menu music and how ironic the menu and heroes looked p we played it through and through and ultimately there came a time when the confusion came to an end and thats when the addiction started as of the game its a strategy based moba game difficult to understand all at once but easy when broken into segments you have to choose a hero from a pool of 100 heroes each and every hero is unique in their own way having different abilitiespowers etc your main goal is to destroy the oppositions home base building ancient in order to secure win it sounds easy but  always hits the fan xd you are given a shop from where you can purchase items to upgrade your heros abilities and attributes my experience with this game sucked at the start but turned opposite as of now the competetion is real hard theres also a leveling system for the casual record along with a ranking system for competetive moderanked match called mmr or match making rating just like counter strike global offensive theres a match making system which helps each and every player of similar skillz to compete with each other so id say to download this game asap because i already regret for not playing it from the start p remember i was one of those who said dota sucks and now its an integral part of my life above all theres something calm about this game unlike csgo xd its always fun to play few kids

well there is no need to tell you much about this game its just so popular many people consider this game as a piece of artwork true is that it needs a lot of skills to be good in it to be honest its just not my type of game anyway i recommend to try 
recommended
well i played dota 2 just 30 minutes  1 match  and heres what i think about that game even when people think or say that people in dota arent friendly theyre probably wrong i wont decline the fact that there are some of them but angry gamers are in every game possible y know even when ive played with a plague of dota 2 and csgo  russians ive heard 56 swears and mostly because they were amused about the game itself gameplay may seem a bit hard for the first time but after you play tutorial  some matches youll get familiar with it its quite fun and teamworkish nothing here is possible without teamwork  and creeps  plus its this kind of a games where you have to be sliced in a half and complete some objectives while farming for some exp and gold the match is getting real somewhere around 17 minute of a game both teams got heroes with special attacks new items more creeps thats where it starts when you bash through a horde of creeps and kill a sniper who was about to use a shrapnel then attack creeps from behind and you push through towers and even more creeps with your teammates sadly but this game was so negatively reviewed for most of the time but everybody has an opinion right try it out by yourself youll like it

playing dota 2 is like playing monopoly with my girlfriend whenever i make a good move she talks  on me whenever she makes a good move she trash talks me how bad i am when i win its because insert random reason affects her play when i lose its because i cant play the game properly also we both have a lot of russian co workers recomended for people with masochistic tendencies russians andor people with 4 friends who dont know how to teamplay

pros  1 free 2 most played game on steam guarantees you can play this game 24x7 when the world is asleep dota players are raging at their noob teammates or being a noob themselves 3 low system requirements means your 3rd world friend with a  pclaptop would be able to play the game cons 1 most toxic community of any game you know you are doing well in the game as a noob if you arent asked to uninstall the game 2 selfish players that take heros that make no sense considering the enemy draft 5 carry teams or 5 support teams are not too uncommon 3 you are guaranteed to rage at the same noobs that you were when you start getting good at the game not recommended for heart patients or pregnant woman

dota2 often claimed to be the hardest moba there is and that is because the game is very complex which is why there is a 10 hour tutorial trying to breakdown the game mechanics into little pieces and if you want to get faster and easier into it you cant avoid watching videos for more tipsntricks which makes this game very time consuming not to mention that an average game is between 30 and 50 minutes long however when you dig yourself through the wall of dota2 and got to the point where you start understanding what you are doing wrong then the game gets very rewarding and fun playing dota2 is a combination of strategy  which hero to pick where to lane what items to buy and satisfying combat one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability which is the heros strongest ability for newbies there are a lot of heros with passives and few abilities something which i dont usually mention in reviews is the voice acting this game although it has 108 different characters has really good voice acting for every single hero although the game is getting to get a bit older now its graphics are definetly up to date and personally i really like the water it looks really good overall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic indepth game go for it it is free and you have excess to all heroes from level 0 on this game gets a g for gooda>g>o

the game is great except that the game rapidly snowballs into an unwinnable position if you get off to a bad start and they brutally punish you if you leave before the game is over even if its the 20 minute mark your team has died 40 times and your opponents are all untouched you just have to pretend youre still playing until your opponents decide to end it which theyll often hesitate to do opting instead to spend 30 more minutes taunting and toying with you

defense of the ancients 2  known more colloquially as dota 2  is a masterpiece of modern video game design harkening back to the ageold starcraft 1 custom map aeon of strife dota 2 nearly perfects the elements introduce in that original mod the mechanics and gameplay are ageless simple in their implementation and flawless in their execution everything about dota 2 is a triumph of engineering  the individual heroes have fantastic character designs both thematically and mechanically and the game is perfectly balanced around its seemingly lack of scaling and at times stagnant nature it is a game where levels and planning take precedent over gold advantage and items and teamwork is a union  a celebration even  of independent player skill this variety of complex mechanics themes and interactions that coalesce into a truly unique experience i recall the time i forgot to ward bot rune and when mid lost illusion to a pudge from top lane i was only blamed four times as opposed to dozens in other similar competing games this unparalelled level of community benevolence and powerful inclination towards skillful play make dota 2 the best game on the market if not all of human history four hundred years from now when the paragon hyperscholars are uploading digiedu to the modbrains of the neo bourgeoisie dota 2 will forever be imbedded in the siliconcortex as the zenith of prehuman ingenuity 010 it sucks

when i hear the phrase dota 2 is good just look at how many people play it i cant help but make myself blue from facepalming so hard call of duty has millions of players the thing is theyre all 12 year olds with tourrettes and particularly ignorant mothers the gaming society is so fanatic about numbers that they forget that criticism and praise are reflections of an individuals formed beliefs that being said dota 2 is a terrible game and thats not an opinion its the truth valves fear of the number 3 has thrown them afar by pushing number 2s yes i did just say that laugh it up of all their other series portal 2 left 4 dead 2 and half life 2 as well as half life 2 episode 2 but now they are doing it to games they dont originally own repetition is useful in debates and extremely rarely in games a lesson valve is eagerly forgetting to the point where dota 2 doesnt even have multiple maps to change things up i see its up to the players to pose new situations how inadvertently lethargic i cannot comprehend how players can have over 3000 hours doing the same thing let alone 5 to put this in todays terms dota 2 is so stupid your mum asked me what i was doing and when i replied im playing defense of the ancients she freaked out believing that i was attempting to prevent her murder i weep for future generations that when asked to list 10 goods things about the 21st century can only find numerous references to swag justin bieber and the mindset that a large amount of players in a game means everyone in the whole world should enjoy it and before you ask yes i did just put a your mum is so old joke in an analysis thanks for noticing

i think people who gush over this game do so because its not league of legends this often strikes me as being the same as the person who plays say the secret world and bashes those that play world of warcraft where world of warcraft is accessible easy and enjoyable for the masses secret world is deep complex and very rewarding to those who really enjoy the minutae of figuring out how to get the most out of an mmo dota 2 is the game you play when you dont want to the handholding comfortable ease that league of legends has brought to the moba world i found dota 2 to be overly awkward and not particularly rewarding but for those in the mood for the more hardcore experience this is where to be i just wont be there with you
