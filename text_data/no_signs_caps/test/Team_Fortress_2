sometimes you just want a game that doesnt need too much thinking other times you just want a game where winning and losing the round means nothing but the fact that youve just had loads of fun and a good laugh and there are still times when you just want to play something that washes away all the  youve taken all day for all these times you need team fortress 2

team fortress 2 review by delicioushotschmoes release date october 9 2007 genre firstperson shooter developers valve corporation platforms pc ps3 xbox 360 os x linux the review all the way from 2007 and still going strong when i say going strong i usually like to think so in the community workshop and hat section but on a serious note this game is absolutely sensational fun and arguably flawless so whats the best of it now well its totally free and definitely worthy of the quote the most fun you can have online coming from the editors of pc gamer magazine the game has a wide and diverse selection of 9 different classes ranging from their own unique abilities and strategies that can be performed against the opposing team similiar to a rock paper scissors scenario where everything is fair and there are no overpowered classes the fast bostontalking and even more fast running scout to the towering minigunwielding hulk of a russian man known as the heavy every character class usually represents a soldier in a common fps of some sort what i truly love about these characters is the fact that valve has openly breathed life vibrant personalities characteristics and nationalities into this ragtag bunch i also enjoyed the customization of weapons and accessories named after the witty puns along with the slight ethnic slur and referenced culture of that said character this really brings out the comedic flare within the game and shows that humour can mix amusement in along with entertainment the players from around the globe can express and relate to depending on the gamers nationality when it comes to the plot of the game the elements of storytelling isnt entirely shown into clear perception it mainly focuses on the two competitive industries of red reliable excavation demolition and blu builders league united who both subsequently conquer half of the world known as the badlands each corporation administers its half of the world with a multidisciplined army of paper pushers one of those paper pushers is you and your whole team when playing this game a fantastic thing to note in this game is the fact that its holiday themed either new campaigns modeled after a specific holiday down to the newly cashed in fan made hats are launched to the public to bring in funds for both valve and the original creator at hand halloween christmas easter just to name a few are a great example and addition to the games growing campaign and community its also important to note that the game is getting updated at a steady pace with the occasional ui updates and other fun concepts such as poses and character interactions being frequently implemented to wet the appetites of the individual players preference i dont have much to complain about this game other than the fact that majority of the servers you connect to youll most likely encounter 13yearolds who constantly nag and try their luck to command the rest of the whole team which sometimes resorts to foreigneastern european person nagging about the 13yearolds nagging so its not rare to see a big kick off between young kids and ignorant foreign kids going absolute bonkers on a connected match its more fun to not say a word at this point in time and just watch the ultimate climax between the raging two forces i definitely recommend this game not just down to the fact that its free but because it still remains fun to this day and constant updates on campaigns and official hat accessories keep this game alive making the game overall timelesswhich doesnt affect the games mechanics at all but only along the lines of taunts and so on and so forth
