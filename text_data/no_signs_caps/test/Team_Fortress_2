sometimes you just want a game that doesnt need too much thinking other times you just want a game where winning and losing the round means nothing but the fact that youve just had loads of fun and a good laugh and there are still times when you just want to play something that washes away all the  youve taken all day for all these times you need team fortress 2

team fortress 2 review by delicioushotschmoes release date october 9 2007 genre firstperson shooter developers valve corporation platforms pc ps3 xbox 360 os x linux the review all the way from 2007 and still going strong when i say going strong i usually like to think so in the community workshop and hat section but on a serious note this game is absolutely sensational fun and arguably flawless so whats the best of it now well its totally free and definitely worthy of the quote the most fun you can have online coming from the editors of pc gamer magazine the game has a wide and diverse selection of 9 different classes ranging from their own unique abilities and strategies that can be performed against the opposing team similiar to a rock paper scissors scenario where everything is fair and there are no overpowered classes the fast bostontalking and even more fast running scout to the towering minigunwielding hulk of a russian man known as the heavy every character class usually represents a soldier in a common fps of some sort what i truly love about these characters is the fact that valve has openly breathed life vibrant personalities characteristics and nationalities into this ragtag bunch i also enjoyed the customization of weapons and accessories named after the witty puns along with the slight ethnic slur and referenced culture of that said character this really brings out the comedic flare within the game and shows that humour can mix amusement in along with entertainment the players from around the globe can express and relate to depending on the gamers nationality when it comes to the plot of the game the elements of storytelling isnt entirely shown into clear perception it mainly focuses on the two competitive industries of red reliable excavation demolition and blu builders league united who both subsequently conquer half of the world known as the badlands each corporation administers its half of the world with a multidisciplined army of paper pushers one of those paper pushers is you and your whole team when playing this game a fantastic thing to note in this game is the fact that its holiday themed either new campaigns modeled after a specific holiday down to the newly cashed in fan made hats are launched to the public to bring in funds for both valve and the original creator at hand halloween christmas easter just to name a few are a great example and addition to the games growing campaign and community its also important to note that the game is getting updated at a steady pace with the occasional ui updates and other fun concepts such as poses and character interactions being frequently implemented to wet the appetites of the individual players preference i dont have much to complain about this game other than the fact that majority of the servers you connect to youll most likely encounter 13yearolds who constantly nag and try their luck to command the rest of the whole team which sometimes resorts to foreigneastern european person nagging about the 13yearolds nagging so its not rare to see a big kick off between young kids and ignorant foreign kids going absolute bonkers on a connected match its more fun to not say a word at this point in time and just watch the ultimate climax between the raging two forces i definitely recommend this game not just down to the fact that its free but because it still remains fun to this day and constant updates on campaigns and official hat accessories keep this game alive making the game overall timelesswhich doesnt affect the games mechanics at all but only along the lines of taunts and so on and so forth

tf2 worst game ever wasted my time and money just for hats 1010 will keep playing on a more serious note this is a wonderful and amazing game ive spent hundreds of hours playing this and i dont regret it at all it never gets old because no two matches are the same something will always be different as soon as those spawn doors open and you run out onto the front lines there are many fun and interesting weapons that you can combine together that suit your play style and strategies along with finding the perfect class or classes that just fit your style of play and keep you coming back for more there are are many fun game modes official and custom that you can play as well as tons of fun official and custom maps to enjoy my personal favorite game mode would by capture the flag on my favorite map 2fort even though tf2 is 7 years old its still very active and keeps getting update with minor as well as major updates which add all sorts of new content usually the major updates are pretty good but there are times when they can fall flat but that doesnt happen too often bonus ducks and of course i wouldnt dare to end this without mentioning the hats the many hats and misc items for every class allow you to stand out among your fellow players and make you look unique there are tons of unique interesting and ridiculous combination you can make by combining the wide assortment of cosmetic items and i simply love it this game is awesome and overall unique compared to the other multiplayer fpss i have played and thats what makes it so great its different and thats the way i like it also the pyro is a light bulb until proven otherwise and even if he is proven to be otherwise disregard it and continue believing he is a light bulb because he is a light bulb thank you

team fortress 2 is a really stupendously addictive and fun fps game the game revolves around a set of 9 classes each of which have strengths and weaknesses and counters whose duty it is to conquer the opposition the thing about tf2 at least for me is the artstyle the comic cartoonyness of the characters and world is incredibly fun and light its the perfect game to blow off some steam and relax after a long day the players at least in my experience are all generally really nice i feel this is because being bad at tf2 is not really a factor regardless of your skill level how much time youve spent on tf2 or how much money everyone can contribute and everyone can have a great time one of the strongest parts of the game is that losing dying or being killed doesnt lead to hate or anger or frustration a game in tf2 can last from 3 to 10 minutes and these short rounds contribute to a lack of concern if you lose not in a bad way not in a way which results in you not caring about the game in general but in a way where if you lose you dont blame yourself or your team mates for the loss its refreshing and fantastic hugely recommended from myself ive spent about 550 hours in the game am in no way a master halfdecent maybe and i have no reason to stop playing the game is consistently updated with new maps items lore and content and i look forward to many more hundreds of hours of gameplay nilesy

lost my money to this game 1010 has conga i pray to gaben every night hoping to see if hell release a good tf2 update eventually gibus is op plz nerf it costs $400000 to feed gaben for 12 seconds spycrabs genuine spycrabs sandvich eating heavies phlog still has yet to be removed from the game sleep who needs sleep when you got tf2 merasmus needs to get the bonus ducks back cause ducks are awesome hats which makes you 10x better at the game overall 710 not realistic cant aim down sights cant noscope headshot soldiers helmet doesnt protect you from headshots and pistols dont instant kill an enemy when aimed at the head so in conclusion its an okay gameign

i was only 13 years old i loved tf2 so much i was always at the bottom of servers i pray to gaben every night hoping i would get a hat someday gaben is love i said gaben is life my dad overhears me and calls me a wm1 i know hes just jealous that i got recruited into faze clan i call him a bodyshotter my dad airshots me and sends me to my room as i feel my numb face i turn on my pc and log into steam my hands are shivering as i click on the play button to open up tf2 ill show that airshotter i said i open up the steam market place and purchase 20 half life 3 cases and keys 10 minutes have passed by and ive unboxed 19 strange neon annihilators as i move my cursor over to the final case i click and select open my cursor moves even slower as i move it towards the giant green use key button i click the button i cant look i said to myself my dad will bodyshot me when he sees that ive spent six grand on super exclusive and rare half life 3 cases and keys i close my eyes and listen as i hear gaben laughing over me as if i am almost certain that i did not get a hat i open my eyes a large clump of feces leaves my  very quick as my eyes look at the item i have just been given by the holy gaben himself another clump starts sliding out as i stand up to run to my dad to tell him that ive just unboxed a ghastly gibus my dad cries as he suddenly gets his steam account hacked by optic i wear my new hat and noscopes his face i then walk into my room take my pants off and thrust my pelvic region into the air imagining gaben with me gaben is love gaben is life

this game started as a classbased combat simulator capturing the control points stealing the intelligence from the enemy moving a bombholding cart then it moved onto a hat simulator game only hats mattered it was a competition to see who had the best hat recently team fortress 2 transformed into a bread simulator you could spawn bread with a teleporter bread was amazing even bread weapons were released but now it is a conga simulator one conga is enough to ruin a server 1010 must conga harder

a long time ago i told everyone who asked me to play tf2  youre never going to see me play tf2 i will never play tf2 with you  but one day one of my friends was feeling down and hes really into tf2 so i offered to play with him and it made him happy and not sad and that was good then another one of my friends told me that if i played 70 hours of tf2 hed buy me skyrim i dont have my own money to buy things online with all the money i make online goes to my friends paypals so i said yes and i started logging hours it was slow going at first i said to him its a good game but im really bad at it and i guess thats okay  everyones kinda bad at it but ill never be like you and my other friends who play this you wont get me addicted to tf2 im doing this for skyrim after i got skyrim it became my bae and i was the clingy girlfriend as my burning passion for being a male lizardbeast died down i started playing tf2 mostly because being f2p many of my friends played and still play it so we played tf2 it was gradual my downfall but it was inevitable and in hindsight even predictable i want to say im not addicted to tf2 but then id be lying because once i played for six hours straight to achieve a score of 420 and i didnt stop til i hit that eight hour mark i played tf2 for more than six in hours man i couldve stopped at 420 no i couldve stopped an hour or two in and yet i didnt i started playing tf2 regularly sometimes for long periods of time i wont say that that was my aforementioned downfall no it would have to be me being around tf2 bloggers on tumblr i watched and learned about other fans and their interests but let me just say playing tf2 is one thing playing tf2 often is part of that one thing but reading and writing shipping fanfiction about tf2 getting innocents into shipping fanfiction about tf2 well i wish i didnt fall into this black hole of gay but its too late now im sorry play tf2 but do so carefully so as not to become what i have[b]

team fortress 2 the only hat simulator that will allow 23 people to drop their weapons and start dancing their heart out until a short texan in a crooked tophat comes along and murders everyone with a wrench to which confetti a thropy and a guitar riff will appear above his head he will then deploy a sentry gun hit it with his wrench a couple of times until someone destroys it and kills him he then respawns walks around in circles and leaves the server only in tf2 good game

once upon a time in a server far away there was a blue scout that shouted bonk when he hurt people this scout was facing a dilemma the scout shouted i need a dispensah over ere however the engineer was facing problems of his own a spy is sappin my sentry the engineer shouted back the scout could see no red spy unfortunately this lead to his downfall as the scout was then backstabbed by the spy before the scout completely died the spy whispered into his ear i did your mother as the spy walked out of the room he disguised himself as the recently fallen scout until he got hit by the snipers jarate this drew the attention of a red soldier i think his mate saw me the sniper whispered to himself a rocket to the face only proved that fact

the biography of the tf2 soldier a highlytrained weapon specialist soldier that went on a killing spree in ww2 world war 2 that presently wields an rpg for a primary weapon joined a team of mercenaries to defeat another team of mercenaries exactly like them soon became roomates with a wizard that can spawn pumpkin headed headless horsemans a giant eyeball that shoots exploding miniature eyeballs a magic book that casts bomb spells soon turned against the soldier and one day while on a camp fire he saw a comet that literally landed in front of him only to see that inside the comet was an interdimensional particle smasher that he soon used as a weapon and also one day a crazed man built an entire army of robots to take down the mercenaries exactly in the likenesses of the mercenaries themselves so technically he can defeat his own self with his own weapons but in the form of metal batteries and also probably about 5 times his own size oh and he also survived a winter cold day completely naked while wrestling a bear while he is covered in honey and when i say completely naked i mean completely including no underwear oh and also he shoots his own rockets at his feet to propel himself in the air have you ever heard of him surviving being under fire comepltely filled with led bullets while covered in urine yes covered in urine and also he used a shovel to fight a fat man holding a minigun point blank while the soldier is in midair who won obviously the man with a shovel i think thats probably nuff said theres still more buut im gonna stop here

team fortress 2 is the best fps that i ever played in my life this game is a mustplay the cartoon feeling combined with the combat makes this game a different one from the other fps games what also makes tf2 also a unique fps is that it is a multiplayer only video game tf2 is one of the games that you dont have a pro to enjoy the game for other fps games such as cod  you would have to be a pro at the game in order to get the other weapons for tf2 you just have to play a certain amount of time and then later you will acquire some new items if youre lucky you could get a misc or even a hat there are many different qualities for items and weapons in the game they are normal unique strange vintage genuine unusual haunted collector community and selfmade there are 9 classes which are the scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and spy these classes are divided into 3 categories they are offensive defense and support each class specalise in a particular area the scout can double jump and is the fastest out of all class which means he can escape from danger with no diffculty the soldier can rocket jump to get into higher areas pyro can burn enemies and can do compression blast which blasts projectiles away such as rockets and grenades the demoman is able to make traps for enemies heavy is able to take a lot of damage and has the most health engineers are able to construct buildings such as a sentry gun to defend points and support the rest of the team medics can heal fellow teammates so they are able to survive in battle longer sniper can do a significant amount of damage with sniper rifle spy can disguise as the enemy team and can sap engineers buildings to disable them as you start team fortress 2 there are detailed tutorials that teaches you how to play the particular class efficently when you finished these tutorials there is a training mode which enables you to sharpen your skills on bots training mode also has several diffculties tf2 has many gamemodes some examples are capture the flag king of the hill and payload each gamemode has a certain objective and requires everyone in the team to contribute team fortress 2 is one of those games that requires a lot of teamwork if there is no teamwork the team is unable to advance to the next point a unique gamemode called mann vs machine is when 6 players work as a team to prevent waves of invading robots deploying a bomb at a certain point as you advance through the waves of robots begin to get increasingly more diffcult there is also a mann up version this is the official version of mann vs machine played on offical valve mann up servers in order to get into these servers you would need to purchase a tour of duty ticket after you complete a mission  you earn a pile of loot which you get at the end when it is victory time when you complete a tour of duty you would get normal weapons botkiller weapons killstreak kit an australium weapon and many more tf2 has also many custom mod servers which consist of unoffical gamemodes some of these mods are tf2ware and versus saxton hale the best feature of team fortress 2 is that there is always update which contain new items weaponsweapons changes maps gamemodes and they are all free of charge this says when you go on team fortress 2 there is always new content to enjoy tf2 also celebrates special events such as halloween and particular maps change their looks to match the event in these events they are special event only items that you can acquire team fortress 2 are just those games that get very hard to bored of they can get so addicting that you would just play them all day not to forget its also about the hats tf2 is an absolute masterpiece i give this game overall 100000000010

team fortress 2 is a fps with cartoonish graphics and heavy reliance on teamwork it used to be paid but it went free to play in 2011 the graphics despite being a bit old already still look good and stylish the maps are usually welldesigned and interesting to look at the gameplay stands out from your other fps games for being very different than conventional shooters out there you can pick from nine different classes offensive scout soldier pyro defensive demo heavy engineer and support medic sniper spy each with their own unique tools style strengths and weaknesses this forces you to work with your teammates to cover each others weakpoints and emerge victorious there are two main gamemodes pvp and mvm the former has a lot of submodes such as payload control points attack  defense king of the hill or capture the flag the latter on the other hand pits a team of six players in a coop tower defense mode against hordes of bloodthirsty robots with the objective of preventing them from delivering a bomb to the end of the map there is a lot of unlockable weapons which allow you to customize and change your gameplay style as well as a ton and i mean a ton  of cosmetic items which serve no purpose besides looking cool the music while it cant be heard outside of main menu or promotional videos is very good and fun to listen to even outside the game unfortunately this game also has cons due to the amount of hats content the game is very heavy so computers that arent brandnew might experience some performance issues also due to it being free to play pub servers are often filled with noobs who have no idea what theyre doing which can destroy your gaming experience considering the game is teamworkreliant multiple snipers and spies is a common occurence the community is also well not the worst but one of the worst just a quick glance at the forums reveals a ton of unusual and australiumtoting git gud elitists who arent very pleasant to talk to if youre new or in general however that doesnt mean there arent any people who are actually helpful towards newcomers overall i highly recommend this game to everyone fps veterans however should be prepared for a drastically different experience

good afternoon dear gentlemen and gentlewomen it is a pleasure to perceive that one such as yourself would partake in my review of this most splendorous game i say this for it is the most honest and veritable truth quite close to the objective idea of truth to estimate it properly at first i held the opinion that collective fortification ii was merely another dull boring and uninteresting ludum of the general significance and craftsmanship as summoning of obligation however this was in advance of the actual attempt at undergoing the experience of collective fortification ii which is in hindsight presumptuous and bold contrary to whatever estimation i conferred to collective fortification ii in the past before mind you partaking in the adventure that is collective fortification ii i must declare with due expertise that this ludum is marvelous in this ludum one will find a most engaging experience worthy of eternal estimation in the irrefutable and absolute realm of do desire certainly anyone who would claim that this ludum is not worthy of said realm would be a scoundrel a fraud and a lout yes the sheer dillydallying that is facilitated in this ludum is thus charming that one such as i one who could be described as paresseux comme baise would scribe a true pinnacle of summitous apexity in the latitudes of criticisms and thus at the decisive terminal of this criticism i would implore you my venerable gentleman or gentlewoman to amuse yourself with this ludum of exceptional excellence now my treasured asinine experience the wonder that is collective fortification ii with your personal senses by embarking on the quest that is this ludum godspeed and have a good evening by now best regards mlanonymous

this review is very lengthy as i have a lot to say about this game so sit tight you are in for a long ride lets get the verdict out of the way before getting to the real talk i recommend this game i have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on it is it worth playing yes is it worth investing your time for a deeper experience probably not i already predict a lot of hate for this review but i need to get it off my chest and explain the issues i have with this game once again those are my own opinions that a lot of people happen to share it is completely fine if you want to argue against it i will just ask you to be honest and less defensive because tf2 is in a critical state first of all id like to point out that ive spent 1780 hours which might be low for some high for others i started playing in late 2009early 2010 in intervals of several months between late 2010 and early 2012 i enjoyed this game a lot since it was a fresh change from the fps games i used to play back in the days cod 24 or cs it was extremely fun and trust me i do not regret a single minute ive spent on this game before early 2014 at least im not really the shakespeare of game reviews and english doesnt happen to be my first language but ill do my best to explain my points clearly im going to spend some time explaining each major part imo of tf2 competitive trading community and updates i  competitive why do i want to list this subject first simply because this will be a quick talk competitive tf2 is basically the best place where you can fully enjoy tf2 the competitive community is mostly made of good and helpful people you will play the game the way it shouldve been played whether its a lobby pug or a ugc match for my part i didnt really want to get into ugc because unfortunately i was already getting into csgo and couldnt get the time to look for a team even though i played pugs with and against silvergold teams ii  trading we had the good part now the not so gooddecent part barely spent anytime there i never got interested in it mainly because im not patient and i can get the thing i need directly without spending 3 years working for a bigger backpack most of tf2 is usually into trading whether they spend 1 hour a month or 23 hours a day in a trading websiteserver the trading community is really mixed it has good people in it but it also has scammers and some selfcentered losers yet this is where i got to meet a lot of good friends and where ive been amazed by a lot of idiots thinking they have the networth of the 1% in their inventory at the current state of the game according to many professional traders unless you have some insane item you wont make any profit with all the useless hats added the supply of cosmetics is insanely high the demand is scattered and the value the currency holds keeps dropping dragging everything down with it in short trade if you want but watch out for scammers and sharks and stick with the good people there arent many but they are out there trading wouldve been one of the strengths of tf2 if valve and the heads of some communities didnt ruin it iii  community its really mixed you can find good people if you go to the right pubs as well as s who will instantly kick you if you arent a friendly heavy or ruin the conga or we i wasnt lucky with valve servers as well most of the times i played in those servers i was left with autistic meme spouters 300 ping brazilians or  who will call you a tryhard if you simply try to play the game as intended some people also blame bronies or furries for making it worse i honestly dont care about both i had to witness a lot of pubs with regulars ive enjoyed playing with dying and if there is something to blame it is not one of the games communities such as the ones cited above but rather the direction the game is currently taking iv  updates the game is making a terrible turn it went from a game that couldve been a success in esports to a casual cashgrabber made to attract more people into steam they keep on adding useless lorebreaking cosmetics aswell as useless weapons that keep on making the game worse many want valve to add more weapons to the game  i dont you have to understand that the point of unlocks are or were to be very situational items and could also act as a costly alternative such as the gunboats some weapons now are either completely useless such as the new grenade launcher or the back scatter or completely random such as the base jumper or the tide turner many people are complaining about eotl for being one of the worst updates possible to the game it was overhyped by you guys because you couldnt understand that this was the way valve wants the game to be dont blame those who made eotl the ones to blame are those in charge of tf2 they had then to throw in a broken  game mode that seemed to be coded within a day as well as a couple of useless weapons or taunts to calm the community down after the disasterthe sad part is that it worked the game is now 8 years old and still a success for the wrong reasons but how long is it going to last before more and more people get tired by the way valve handles the game once again most of these are based on my opinions as well as the opinions of others i hope this might be useful for some i had to write it to unleash the anger i had against the incompetent team supposed to replace the original developers so go ahead enjoy the game play it as its fullest if youve never played this game you are missing something so do it now while it lasts thank you for your time

tf2 is that unique type of fps that rarely comes around more of like a one of a kind its a extremely different type of fps instead of rehashing content like certain other series tf2 mostly gets updated with brand new content a few times a month or even hints to upcoming updates which makes it alot more mysteriousfun tf2 at its core is a very balancedsimple severalgamemode game with all the classes ranging from scout all the way to spy they all show alot of personality almost all of them unique from the insane medic all the way to the baby yelling heavy its modding community is very well known aswell sick of the default gamemodes try some community ones such as parkour fortress zombie fortress dodgeball prophunt hidden freak fortress and so much more but whats the catch i hear you say none really but there are some downsides such as some of its community and some if not most competitive players that scream at you for bodyshotting them or mocking you because you are a f2p all in all tf2 is a one of a kind gem by valve go play it its good

ah tf2 best game ive ever seen in my life when i started playing tf2 i only played it for the gameplay it was and still is real fun to play but after some months i discovered trading the wonderful trading after months of trading i learned a lot about it and now i do it almost every day it will always be my hobby c its even a great way to earn money d i have to say there arent that much weapons there are more cosmetics then weapons im not really a fan of cosmetics i prefer have weapons thats why i almost have them all except 5 and when there comes new items during an update then that are only cosmeticsreskins of weaponsweapons in an other quality for now the qualities that are coming more of strange and collectors collectors is a new and pretty expensive quality but not really diffirent then the unique quality and strange is a quality that counts killspointsetc that you made with the weaponmisc thats in this quality im a truly fan of strange weapons and i own 41 out of 120 this is except australiums botkillers and festives because that are just reskins someday ill buy the rest of them too d alright i told pretty much i guess and i hope this review was useful for you thanks for reading and enjoy playing tf2  wario_16 2014

team fortress 2 is a weird game and it is not only a fps game anymore i would describe it more as a social hub for people to hang out this game have two teams that are supposed to fight each other but only in team fortress 2 with two people of the opposite team giving each other high fives stop fighting during the game and walk around crouching or dance together there are nine classes divided into three groups offense defense and support but team fortress 2 have changed so much since release that it does not really mean anything anymore pretty much every class can function as any of the three groups with the right loadout but they are still very different from each other you got a fast scout with little health and a slow heavy with a lot of health and anything inbetween that there is no way you will not find a class you prefer sticking to valve never added a new class but they added tons of weapons some of them are really silly punch an enemy in the back to make him stop and laugh a great way to get silly taunt kills while others generally are a big improvement over the stock weapons like the degreaser however most of the weapons are very situational and i prefer the stock weapons there are many game modes to play capture the point capture the flag payload where you push a cart through the map while the other team try preventing you from doing it and if youre a fan of tower defense you will enjoy mann vs machine youre a team of up to six people who are supposed to kill a huge army of robots before they move their bomb to your base some of them are small others are big and really hurts and others are big and runs fast but what really makes this game mode different from the more traditional team fortress 2 is you can upgrade your weapons fire speed damage reload speed damage resistances running speed jump speed and so on it is really fun and if you are lucky you can win a huge prize for completing a tour cosmetic items are a huge deal for many people hats there are so many hats in this game and they are all so different there is no way you are not going to find one you like and will wear and be proud to wear every time you play many of the cosmetics can also be painted into your favourite colour team fortress 2 is free to play is it pay to win no all the weapons you see in the store are weapons you can get simply by playing or you can use items to craft the weapon you want if you buy premium you will receive weapons faster your backpack will be larger so you can keep more items and you can trade with others trading is a good way to get the weapon youre looking for it is a lot of fun it is fun to play the actual game or just hanging out with people ingame like you can not do in any other game this is the game where you make friends ^____^

team fortress 2 is a great game for a wide variety of gamers it has a diversity of fun and original characters each with their own playstyle and even within each class you can attune the items in your loadout to your preferences the game combines competitiveness with silliness in a very balanced way the characters insult their opponents upon killing them in such a facetious and amusing way they can barely even be considered offensive and yet they can drive your mind nuts about that one scout that is just too fast for you that spy that keeps sneaking past your offensive front or that soldier that lands on your head outta freakin nowhere what tops this all off is the dominationrevenge system which induces a sharp focus on killing tough opponents granting great satisfaction whenever you get your revenge or better when you get to dominate that pesky little pain in the behind that keeps bugging you throughout the round pros  completely free to play you can make it as expensive as you want though  original witty and funny characters with great voice acting  silly yet competitive in a very balanced way  wide variety of playstyles to suit everyones preferences  a lot of different weapons why cant i hold all these weapons  weapon qualities that give specific properties strange weapons that count kills strange parts that count other achievements with a weapon killstreak kits with an increased showofflevel etc keep the game interesting and always give you a target to play for  great graphics and animations simplicity suits this game perfectly  hats hats everywhere  it has the conga i love the conga need i say more cons  too damn addicting  votekick system bugs which allows trolls and cheaters to throw off an entire game luckily only happens seldomly overall rating solid 1010 would hat again so if youre bored and looking for something cheap and fun to play dont look any further  try tf2 its free so you have nothing to lose except for your free time once you start d

probably the worst fps of all time where your chance of winning is decided by the amount of headwear one can use and as the heavys head is the biggest he is obviously the most op class scout is a manifestation of postmarxism homosexual propaganda masked with a boston accent to calm the italians soldier does not only suffer from heavy mental retardation he is also a extremely nationalistic american basically male sarah palin the demoman is a antistereotypical to the point that it becomes offensive trying to detract from his african american origin as much as possible the pyro is the gimp from pulp fiction with a flamethrower not only is that copyright infringement but also damaging the image of latex fetishists all around the world the sniper is the most incorrect character since 1 he is not a kangaroo and 2 he isnt upside down the medic is a nazi the heavy is a false display of an incredibly overweight putin with an insuffurable amount of brain cells the spy is a meek attempt at poking at the french which fails by him not actually being offensive at all 1010 best game ever

this game is fascinating i remember i tried playing it a year ago but i sucked  so i gave up on it even though i played for about fifteen minutes i tried it again this year because i read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive id laugh it off thinking it cant be that bad after almost two months of playing i can confirm yeah its that bad perhaps worse the first few weeks the liking was soft i liked the game the meet the videos were amusing and really drew me to the game but i was extremely bad at first 15 kills 10 deaths type of bad i dominated just one player every two rounds and i even got really excited when i got a revenge jesus its embarrassing to admit thats how bad and even n00by i was i was coming back to online pc gaming after six years of sticking to console so that wasnt helping but then when i started playing a little bit more when it was a domination after domination when id become friends with my pocket medics or the people i was a pocket medic to life changed this game literally consumed me i wanted to use a portion of my birthday money to buy myself some cosmetics just for my medic make him beautiful yakno and i ended up spending all of it in cosmetics for many of the classes id stay up extremely late at night playing sleep little to then wake up early to play again now its gotten to the point in which ive played 12 hours straight of tf2 with little rest inbetween two days ago it was fourteen hours with a lot of effort i got up my  to work out today just to not be too sedentary and it was exasperating because i wanted to play the games just special like that yaknow its fun its unique creative and i love the small details like the angry faces the classes make when theyre shooting or fighting the happy faces on the partnertaunts the faces of agony when theyre with low health details like that make it special and its just generally very addictive my point this game is fcking terrible i dont give a crp if its free dont install it it will consume you and ruin you fcking run run while you still can i still recommend it though just because youll have a lot of fun now if youll excuse me ill get back to playing

team fortress 2 is definitely one of the best fps ever made this does nothing but confirm the supremacy of valve software for this sort although many people think that the lack of interactivity and respect of physics in the game can be a big flaw ultimately would prove to be an important aspect for all gamers who want to have fun without too much energy

easily and i mean this easily the best comedic fps there is on steam you can play from a hyped scout kid that seems like hes on coke a dumb in the head soldier a crazed pyro who thinks burning people is like spitting rainbows at fairies a drunken demoman an adorable yet horrifying heavy a chill engineer who drinks on the job a crazy headed medic who does live surgery a professional sniper and a classy spy who gets the job done point is this game is very well developed and has had a lot of effort put into it though there are only 9 characters there are hundreds of weapons that you can use too once you get further into the game its more addiction and entertaining in the start it may seem boring but you just have to get a bit further into the game you may be thinking how do you get far into a game without a story well i meant once you get more items and learn about the game you can play many different game modes lots of community made game modes on the community servers and trade servers theres payload race control points intel missions prop hunt death run and many more missions all this for a free to play game get it

pros  hats  free to play  strong community  graphics and caricatures  bunch of usergenerated contents  lifetime support and updates confirmed it is valve cons  hats sick of them  lack of tribute to id and quake  more players means inevitably more kids and toxic players too statistically speaking final remarks i preordered the orange box back in 2007 and i have watched from the start how team fortress 2 tf2 evolved into something perpetual thingy and valves flagship of their both economically and experimentally successful multiplayer game now of course dota2 and csgo have risen to stand along and they all pretty much surpassed it do you realize how monumental this game was and seemingly still is to gamers and even to valve themselves steam achievement and later drop system along with hats were first introduced for tf2 i remember when hat phenomenon was all over the place and everyone wanted fancy fedora so much here is one fun story about the game a guy from sourceop known as drunken f00l got vacbanned for making idling tool for tf2 and for cheating an event item known as golden wrench including him people who used idling tool got their hats and items taken away meanwhile all other active tf2 players were awarded with halo hats for not using the tool but after sometime the ban on the sourceop guy was lifted and he officially started working at valve for his tf2 backpack and something more well that guy had talent and valve definitely knew about it so they decided to hire him in spite of all violations of user agreements as a steam user it reminds me of the fbi hiring a genius financial fraudster and there is even a movie about it so much drama over tf2 aye you see this game just has so many interesting stories to tell when tf2 switched to f2p model the community even got bigger and stronger than ever before and it is still growing even after many years have passed all official updates and endless usercreated contents enrich the game more drops more hats more weapons more maps more halloween and holiday events more updates more everything and now skins just like in csgo omg volvo and its market is being sustained on its own economy quite amazing i personally no longer play this game anymore because i already played enough of it but it is easily understandable why this game is still one of the most played games on steam  recommended

alright little boys and girls of steam gather round the campfire and let ol psi tell you a story it all began back in 2011 when i was but a young lad one day i heard multiple people discussing the game team fortress 2 at the time what i heard was beyond belief a game where i could ruthlessly murder the friends i didnt have with the friends i didnt have sign me up now at the time my pockets were filled with nothing but air  lint and broken dreams so i was delighted to hear that this experience was being offered to me for the low low price of absolutely nothing once the lengthy download was complete i wasted no time learning the ins and outs of the game i practiced for quite some time against bots and once i felt i was ready to get murdered in style  i ventured out into servers filled with actual people all of them hellbent on killing each other my response i simply picked up a sniper rifle flashed a murderous grin and uttered beneath my breath lets freakin go i then proceeded to get shot in the face 50 times before registering my first kill over the next 3 years i was whisked away on a thrill ride that featured pyromania robots weapon nerfs comics bakery goods and of course hats by this time ive spent well over 400 hours of my life playing the game and making my teammates angry by failing to snipe stationary heavies 3 long years without a single regret whats that you kids wanna experience what ol psis been through well im not stopping ya just head down to the steam store search for team fortress 2 and give it a download youve got nothing to lose but countless hours of your precious little lives

game is fun and easy going lots of playable characters to choose from and they are all different in abilities i like to play as support class and i am very happy that three support class characters are so different and so i can do different things while still playing support there are so many different maps to choose from to play in that i am sure everyone would like at last one they enjoy lots and lots of fun and really good game that i cant believe is free i have had to pay for games that were not as good as team fortress 2 i was not sure if i would give thumbs up or not because while the game is really good i dont think player base is good maybe i have had bad luck but i have run in to very rude people that did not make the game feel like fun this game is very fun when playing with friends but going to random server always ended to me with being thrown rude comments at comments about me being bad at game i could take because i have played so little that i can not compare to veterans but i think that does not need foul language or people calling me with rude names and going to personal stuff i had to see others be treated rude too and rudest comments were always given to people who play offense i recommend the game but i do not recommend the community

this is the single most entertaining online fps on the market right now team fortress 2 is a freetoplay online classbased first person shooter which pits two teams of nine classes against each other in various game modes and challenges players can unlock weapons and cosmetic items by completing achievements or winning them through death though this is random and has a limit which is reset each week while some bonus weapons are borderline direct upgrades the unfortunate scout is still extremely powerful with his stock weaponry for example these extra weapons are more comparable to variations than upgrades  most of them are designed as sidegrades the only example i can think that is really overpowered is the medics bersaw but why the hell would you get close to a medic anyway his normal bonesaw can tear you to shreds just as easily if not easier  my point is that unlike other freetoplay games you can have plenty of variety and do just as well as a similarlyskilled player with your normal or bonus weapons lets talk about the classes there are 9 in total with at least 3 weapons each they are divided by 3 groups the offense the defense and the support but these groups are useless labels ill play by valves rules though lets see on the offense we have the scout the fastascrap annoying wad who can kill you easily while up close he can also doublejump meanwhile hes borderline useless at long range next up the soldier he has a rocket launcher the rockets damage degrade over distance so longrange spamming isnt a huge deal he is slow as  on his own but since he can rocket jump he is literally one of the most mobile classes in the game lastly the pyro he burns you a lot he also can extinguish friendlies on fire with his flamethrowers compression blast which is also useful to reflect enemy projectiles not including bullets of course this is a huge feature that makes the pyro really stand out educate yourself on the pyro and hes far more useful than just his job of burning enemy spies lets check out the defense first off we have the demoman as his name suggests he is a demolitions man and he can blow  up easily he has a grenade launcher and a stickybomb launcher and the latter needs to have its projectiles blown up ondemand he can have 8 sticky grenades or stickies active at once this class is really good at defending an area and blowing up buildings by the engineer before the hardhat we have the big tub of russian meat called the heavy he has a minigun which will tear you a new one up close boasting the largest default health pool in the game he is a force to be reckoned with however by himself just like anyone else he is pretty useless so dont get too confident now we have the engineer one of the most unique classes in this game aside from his shotgun  pistol he has a wrench and 2 pdas for construction and destruction respectively he can build a sentry gun a dispenser and a teleport entranceexit they all can be upgraded up to level 3 which improves their peformance finally we have the support classes this is probably the least misleading label because they are support classes therefore you dont need a million of them at once lets start with my favourite class the medic hohoho boy seen as a pansy man of medicine he has a syringe gun which can really hurt a careless someone and a bonesaw which really hurts too his greatest power however is the medigun with it the medic can heal a person up to 150% of their health and once his ubercharge meter is filled he can turn himself and his healing target invincible for 8 seconds he can also heal two targets quickly while deploying his ubercharge to have them both invincible aswell but the duration of the uber will be decreased to 5 seconds if youre even faster you can have 3 people on godmode too but itll be over so soon that its not worth it now we have the sniper as his name suggests he has a sniper rifle the only stock weapon in the game that can headshot people i dont have much to say about this one just have good judgment please this class is nearly useless in some situations  if the situation demands it swap there are just too many sniper teams that lose so easily to teams with varied classes another overused class is the spy also a very unique character he can cloak aswell as backstab people with his knife for a guaranteed instant kill given they arent ubercharged by the default medigun he also has a sapper which disables engineer buildings and after a while they blow up when used correctly and sparsely he is an extremely dangerous fellow again solo judgment please if you already have more than two of these in your team in normal 12x12 games dont switch to a spy that takes care of the classes what about the maps oh good lord there are so many official and custom maps that itd be impossible to describe them all there are quite a few official modes aswell control points cp payload pl king of the hill koth capture the flag ctf special delivery sd payload race plr and mann vs machine mvm in cp it depends there are attackdefense maps which has blu attacking the red control points and there are 5cp maps in which both teams need to be in control of all of the control points to win in payload the blu team needs to push a railed cart into the red base to win of course red needs to stop them in king of the hill you have a central point which needs to be captured by one team and held for 3 total minutes its pretty much the same as koth in other games in capture the flag the team needs to go get the enemys briefcase and bring it to their briefcases spawn point its the same as every other ctf game but the flags are briefcases and their returns are timed  you cant grab your own briefcase to return it special delivery is a 1point ctf mode where one team needs to go get the briefcase somewhere in the central edges of the map and bring it to the opposite central edge like in normal ctf the return is timed and only one team can have control of the briefcase at a time payload race is an absurd one both teams need to push their own cart while stopping the enemy from pushing their cart it gets pretty crazy and its quite fun in mann vs machine you have one team against an army of robots based on the classes and a tank they come in waves and its the only mode where you can upgrade your weapons and have a special canteen to hold bonuses there are custom game modes aswell such as warioware minigames surf 1v1 mge training team deathmatch vs saxton hale a juggernaut1 versus everyone else mode etc once youve gotten pretty good at the game you can try out competitive tf2 where youll learn a much higher degree of teamwork coordination and combat in comparison to normal public servers and the weapons good lord there are so many that id lose count lets leave them as a surprise yes my only nitpick with this game is its optimization its not that well optimized at all actually this is due to the overabundance of updates since the last 4 years but luckily you can get custom configuration files to fix this problem somewhat ive also heard if your game gets cluttered with custom content you can reinstall it for a fresh new start and have the game running amazingly but i have never tried it sounds like fun im sure it does and it gets better when you start playing so what are you waiting for some final words a numerical value several ones maybe fine but ill get you just one heres your damn score tf2 gets a score of 910 its extremely fun and it never gets old it is counterintuitive at first but when you get used to it its awesome

tf2 is a free fps by valve it is fun to play and it free is if you havent played it try it and if you dont like it all you have done is lose time rather than money there is never a time when i have not been able to join a game after it had searched the servers i never lag unless im downloading something while playing if you like it all you have to do is spend as little as 003 in the steam market or buy something from the mann co store and you will be premium i also belive you can trade with a premium player and you can get premium sometimes it can be really annoying when the other team spawn traps or when a spy instakills you alot but apart from that the game is regularly bug checked and there is no hacking unless your on a un vac secured server great game 910 pitty some of the items in the store are really over priced and occasionally you into a tf2 proh who thinks their owsum and your a

gameplay  1010 team fotress 2 is an critically acclaim shooter that takes some of its formular from a fastpaced games such as quake & unreal tournament it is considered to be one of the best free 2 play games ever made next to dota 2 did i not mentioned that these two games is published by valve  yup anything that valve made is a masterpiece the game had a total of nine classes ranging from sniperdemomanscoutheavyengineersoldierpyromedic & spy each of the classes had their own role and different play style each of the classes had their own charming personality and likeable characteristics you can also taunt to kill your enemy if you are lucky the games provide a massive tons of modes and it rare to see in a first person shooter game just look at these list  httpwikiteamfortresscomwikilist_of_game_modes you get numerous weapondifferent parts of outfits as you play through many matches there is also a crafting system where you combined different parts of weapon & scrap to obtained a much more powerful weapon each of the weapon provides different types of ability & stats most of it have their own pros & cons the game requires a lot of teamwork sometimes depending on what modes you are playing also medic  heavy  ownage graphics  1010 for a game that come out in 2007it age extremely well and still to these days the cartoonish artstyle impress me a lot a lot of the texture are well details as well as the character models each of the maps provide different variety of background & well thought out level design the animations perform from each character are well done and doesnt look like crap this game also have blood & gore in it too and it is pretty well detailed too audio  1010 the soundtrack for this game is superb especially the main theme songs all of them are done in an orchestral theme while they dont go for a realistic sound effects since it doesnt fit in with the game themethey go for a much more funny approach in making all of sound effects that really blend in with the feels of the games the voice acting for each of the classes is excellent  except for pyro cause he mostly mumble random stuff  each of them have their own unique taunts & quote longlasting appeal  1010 this games provides more modes than any first person shooter game does along with an ongoing update with every 23 weeks or so there is a huge amount of items you collect during your gameplay sessions not to mentioned there is a bunch of custom map that you download & play on it even much more fun if you have friends to play with you adding a ton of enjoyment into the game you will never get bored with each of the class since there is always a challenge when dealing with certain type of situation not to mentioned the amount of achievement you can get just by playing the game is huge so this will keep you busy for a long times final verdict  1010 really recommended for everyone especially to those who are not a fan of first person shooter game every game that valve made have their own special momentsinnovative gameplay & unique style a truly masterpiece of arts grade  s  masterpiece

absolutely awesome game a great range of classes to choose from scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective capture the flag pushing cart and just generally annoying people soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer a shotgun and a entrenching tool shovel soldier is one of the main damage dealers in team fortress 2 the pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower a shotgun and a fire axe pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead heshe uses hishers flame thrower to burn enemies alive the demolitions man demo man is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher a sticky bomb launcher manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc and a bottle the demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk xd the heavy weapons guy is as you guess a guy with big  weapons he carries a minigun a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people heavy is the god of damage dealing he can kill all the other classes quite easily but be careful heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind the engineer the engineer is a defence class that creates sentry guns to defend he can upgrade his sentry 3 times level 1 being a normal sentry level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top the medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help the medic is the second fastest class in team fortress 2 he also has a thing called uber charge which is you and the person youre healing have a few seconds of invulnerability the sniper is a long ranged damage dealer he uses a powerful sniper rifle a smg and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head the spy is a very different class the silent assassin the spy carries a revolver a knife and a electrosapper the electrosapper is used for destroying enemy engineers sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesnt mean that you cant backstab him an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them that is all the classes in team fotress 2 i hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server good bye jarhead

ive put more hours into team fortress 2 than any other game ive ever played and yet i can still pick up the game and have fun to this day its become the standard for online multplayer fps games for me and its going to be hard to ever find a game that comes close to matching it

radically different from the going fps standard a gem gameplay wise its free theres no excuse not to give it a try that was the short version if that didnt convince you yet move along the mechanics the 9 playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique while one class is able to perform a mariostyle doublejump another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners faces and then theres a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets knockback  just to graze a third of the available characters the variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them and believe me whether youre going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk does make a difference talking about unlocks a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being pay to win options  not in team fortress 2 owning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage either all their upsides are balanced by negative sideeffects or they are purely cosmetic this makes the game very beginner friendly because it prevents new players from being straightdown outgunned additionally all of the gameplayrelevant stuff is easily obtainable for everyone you recieve a free item every 40 minutes of playtime while it also allows advanced players to customize their characters to both visually and gameplaywise better meet their taste combat itself too breaks away from the norm in many positive ways theres a static health pool instead of the genreestablished regenerative system and although revolving around midranged combat this game shows a complete lack of assaultrifles of any kind i guess the most noticable difference to other games of the multiplayerfpsgenre though is that confrontations between players typically last significantly longer with fights designed around the recieving party nearly always having a chance to react  which is something i greatly appreciate for thats what i personally feel titles like call of duty are lacking theres only few negative things to mention about the gameplay mechanics minor annoyances such as the randomness damagemodifier and an at times wonky melee hit registration though thats a flaw shared by literally every multiplayer game there is are just that minor annoyances eventually they dont spoil your overall expirience although 7 years old the game still is steadily growing and updated regularily with bug fixes balance patches new maps items and gamemodes being released every month or two ensuring you wont end up bored so to recap whether you are casually or competitively motivated whether you like proving your skill against other players or prefer fighting alongside them against hordes of robots whether you like stealth traps mobilitybased combat or sniping whether you want to beat your foes by setting up turrets or slapping them with fish you _will_ find something to enjoy in this game and yeah the only thing it costs you is the time it takes to download 9510 would will play again

this game is free and yet it is one of the most popular games on steam that says something i definitely recommend playing tf2 or at least trying it out however i believe that to fully enjoy this game you cannot play for a short period of time my reason for this belief is that when i first started playing tf2 i played for around an hour and didnt really like it however i decided to try playing again around a month after my first try and i slowly began to enjoy it over time i began to understand how to play as each of the characters and unlocked many gamechanging items tf2 is fairly easy to play once you get used to it but when you first start playing its like entering a whole new world tf2 is unlike any other game and it will take a bit of time to fully understand it but once you do it becomes one amazingly fun multiplayer game

this shooting game where cosmetics are more important than weapons introduces the player to a world where two teams of mercenaries fight each other in various modes like king of the hill payload race and capture the flag there is also the mann vs machine mode where a small team fights giant hordes of robots play as the 9 different mercenaries each with their own abilities and personality quirks no matter your skill or playing style theres a class that suits it youll surely enjoy this game that never gets old thanks to the frequent updates that bring new content such as hats maps weapons and gamemodes and the best part is that its not pay to win since the game is well balanced and you can get weapons for free fairly easily your only concern will be getting more cosmetics team fortress 2 is pure multiplayer fun and one of the best games ive ever played

on do i its wonderful it creates the rainbows in the skies it makes my unicorn fly bam  noobfriendly > i started out as a gaming noob barely knowing anything about steam or team fortress my friend recommended team fortress 2 as my first tryout and i got hooked not long after > they have a training mode to shape you up in and out even an option to request a coach  100% human plox they offer amazing training grounds  offline practices  if you cant get a hang of team fortress 2 after playing it for a week im judging you jokes but its really noobfriendly and i recommend this for firsttime fps players > youll get tired of your first ever game easily false i still play team fortress 2 and im loving it even more than when i just started out  sweet graphics & animation > got a thing for realistic nottoogorey and somewhatcute graphics yo this the thing for you bro > as a firsttime fps player promoting myself from maplestory and being a scaredygirl im scared of extreme gore and blood team fortress 2s graphics are awesome to me as theres just enough gore and blood  pretty much tolerable and sometimes even funny also if youre finding a fps game with 100% no gore and blood first off i dont even think theres such a game secondly youre not gonna have as much fun sad face lastly its an experience  various types of gameplay plots maps > from payload races to capture the flag from control points to mann vs machine theres probably as many plots as or more than the fingers on your hands > every plot has a different style of playing strategies and players  if youre good at finding something and probably have a good way of running away capture the flag is for you hate computers and how smart they are or if you just want to rage at multiple objects which are stupider than you mann vs machine is there for you to cast all your sorrows > team fortress 2 gives us so many choices its hard to stick to one its like reading a book youll get bored if you keep reading the same story over and over again but you still love the writing style of the writer thus you read the other books by the same writer same logic  various classes > as someone who just popped in and promoted from maplestory i like the idea of having my character suited for different situations  for example although the heavy is great at clearing maps it gets annoying when a sniper from the other team takes advantage of your slow movements and spam kills you what do you do change to a scout and crash that snipers brains > different classes are great at different maps it complements the gameplay to the max  multiplayer features > theres a chat system for you to communicate with your teammates  by typing or speaking  > but people are so annoying no worries you can vote to mute kick and ban players on team fortress 2 thank god for this  character customization > the mann co catalog fanciful huh > you can get different hats and weapons to customize your characters and make them the way you want them to be  recommended for hipsters who are trying to escape the mainstream to be honest i feel more encouraged after i get a new look is it just me  market > you can buy sell and trade for hats and weapons to customize your character it gets irritating when you see someone having this awesome weapon you want and yet you cant get the drop theres the market for you  buy it from the mann co or the steam community market it isnt very expensive either considering most of the items are roughly $099  > when you have no idea where the spend your steam wallet and want to train your business skills  teamwork > lets get to the social part shall we team fortress like its name strengthens players sense of teamwork  im pretty sure your parents or teachers screwed into your brain how important teamwork is so i wouldnt get on that > example time youre playing control points and theres an engineer from your opponents team that has been building sentry guns for forever hes wiping out anyone who steps near the control point so you cant capture it what do you do conspire with a spy to sap the engineers sentry and have everyone else rush forward to capture the control point teamwork at its best  community > the community is fun to be in  and ill just say the developer has a great sense of humour  just take a look at their youtube channel ive never laughed so hard at characters from an online game if youve ever watched meet the _____ youll realize that the classes have their own personalities and their own backgrounds its very entertaining to watch and laugh at > team fortress 2 has a wonderful amount of artists  take a look at the fan art some are cute some are gorey all just plain amazing with a capital a > dont know how to play good heavens there are so many guides written by the professional players >  i may have missed out one or two points but you get my point team fortress 2 is far more than amazing for a freetoplay game so ill say 910 will get it gives developer a hug and kiss

i got the game along with the orange box back in 2007 of course team fortress classic was like portal just a side character where the protagonist was really halflife 2 episode two before i begin on team fortress 2 allow me to spend a paragraph or two on its predecessor skip the next 2 paragraphs if you are not interested more than a decade ago during the era of 56kbps internet and much frustration for both the internet users and phone callers alike i bought a disc which contains a number of halflife mods including the alltime famous counterstrike 15 i was very fond of this little piece of gem back then as downloading a 500mb file is near impossible little did i know that i will be spending most of my time on something else that i have no idea what it as back then a mod that goes by the name of team fortress classic team fortress classic has one of the most versatile firstpersonshooter gameplay back then when compared to contenders such as counterstrike although the original concept of team fortress is based upon the battle between two teams with nine different classes i am more personally attached to the partystyle gameplay which its custom maps have to offer with over a thousand of maps to choose from it is possible for me to find myself in the most peculiar yet fascinating maps and situations i could be playing volleyball or basketball using rockets or partying in a pub while trying to sneak pass a heavyweapondudebouncer i could be roaming around osaka or sahara i could be defending or capturing a point massacring or being massacred by a heavy or even laughing my butt off yes it was fun and it was hell of an epic party each night that was more than a decade ago and then came team fortress 2 sitting with its peers in an orange package the question is not whether the game is good or not but whether can it continue its predecessors legacy it has been 7 years since its release and time did tell that team fortress 2 is more than competent in continuing its predecessors legacy though the effect was not immediate as with most online multiplayer serverbased first person shooters team fortress 2 started off as something that is quite weak and linear the community for team fortress 2 was still building up back then and there isnt much communitymade customizations back then something that is very important in laying a foundation of a multiplayer game so that its longevity can be sustained the only major improvements between team fortress classic and team fortress 2 is that the later has an improved cartoonlike skin which is more suiting for its partylike gameplay nature and an item system which was pretty weak back then the rest are pretty much the same time pass and the community grew as the old source engine becomes outdated a larger variety of weapons begin to appear and the community start coming up with a variety of mods from saxton hale campaigns boss fights to prop hunts hide and seek and then to the official mann vs machine mods coop gameplay the legacy of team fortress classic begins to take form within team fortress 2 at a foundation which is even more solid than its predecessor team fortress 2 stood the testament of time and the size of the community surged this is even truer when the game went free ive had my share of fun laughter and tears due to laughter and i have met my clique of friends where whom i have remained intimate as we journeyed through different games while transcending beyond the boundary of steam team fortress 2 has came a long way and although the results might not be immediate it sure is worth your investment of time oh and if you are wondering hats are never my interest

i was gonna write a review but i assumed it would be too confusing for new players instead heres the wikipedia entry for ducks duck is the common name for a large number of species in the anatidae family of birds which also includes swans and geese the ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the anatidae family they do not represent a monophyletic group the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species but a form taxon since swans and geese are not considered ducks ducks are mostly aquatic birds mostly smaller than the swans and geese and may be found in both fresh water and sea water ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms such as loons or divers grebes gallinules and coots the word duck comes from old english dce diver a derivative of the verb dcan to duck bend down low as if to get under something or dive because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending compare with dutch duiken and german tauchen to dive this word replaced old english enednid duck possibly to avoid confusion with other old english words like ende end with similar forms other germanic languages still have similar words for duck for example dutch eend duck and german ente duck the word enednid was inherited from protoindoeuropean compare latin anas duck lithuanian ntis duck ancient greek nssantta   duck and sanskrit t water bird among others a duckling is a young duck in downy plumage[1] or baby duck[2] but in the food trade young adult ducks ready for roasting are sometimes labelled duckling[citation needed] a male duck is called a drake and the female duck is called a duck or in ornithology a hen the overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad and the ducks are also relatively longnecked albeit not as longnecked as the geese and swans the body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded the bill is usually broad and contains serrated lamellae which are particularly well defined in the filterfeeding species in the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly serrated the scaled legs are strong and well developed and generally set far back on the body more so in the highly aquatic species the wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes requiring in turn strong wing muscles three species of steamer duck are almost flightless however many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period this moult typically precedes migration the drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage but that is moulted in summer to give a more femalelike appearance the eclipse plumage southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism although there are exceptions like the paradise shelduck of new zealand which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and where the females plumage is brighter than that of the male the plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female you must pay $5 usd to continue reading

team fortress 2 is a firstperson shooter game from valve the gameplay is somewhat similar to counterstrike but with more variety of game modes class based player and unlike counterstrike in terms of gameplay this game is more casual rather than competitive at least for me everyone can play it from kids teens to parents everyone can play the game is very well balanced each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore you can get item drops as you play and the more play the more you can get items can be crafted for another better items too or trade them for other items and the best thing about his game is hats yes hats most every damn people here on steam loves them you can show off your hats craft it or even sell them many people make profit from it many people collect it team fortress 2 graphics is 3d but with cartoon style even though the graphics is cartoon team fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effects all effect from explosion weapons fire rockets everything are cartoonized this is great free to play game for me i highly recommend it play it now rating 910

ah tf2 one of the most wellknown and popular fps games out there on steam especially since it became free to play on the steam store ever since a friend got me into this game ive been playing it nonstop for more than 200 play hours in total and i would like to take the time to give my own thoughts on the game as a whole and some tips for newcomers to help them on their way to enjoy the game and not ragequit within the first 20 minutes of jumping right into it first off gameplaywise the game is a typical multiplayerbased fps game where the core goal is very simplistic hop on either the red or blue team and kill the opposing team and secure victory however the methods of accomplishing this range per match type and usually good teamwork and class diversity are required to win the match as for said class diversity the game offers you 9 different playable class characters to choose from all with their unique advantages and disadvantages and its a key requirement for any player to learn the limits and strengths of those classes in order to play the class effectively and to be of benefit to your team as a whole thankfully the game has a alright tutorial on a few classes specifically the demoman spy engineer and soldier but there are many tricks for a class that the game doesnt often directly tell you but rather clues you in through the ingame loading screen tips section when you go to a match picking a class that suits your playstyle is often the first thing many new players struggle with but the classes all range from fairly easy to pick up and play decently with to far more tricky and fragile ones that require the player to be familiar with the mechanics and overall gameplay before they can effectively use them in combat such examples are the heavy soldier and pyro which in my opinion are some of the more easily accessable classes for new players to experiment around with and engineer sniper and spy for the more experienced players when they feel confident enough it has something for every kind of fps gamer regardless of skill level which is what i really like about this game atmospherewise the game is very visually pleasing with alot of intricate map design accomodating the various matchtypes and is designed so that players who are unfamiliar with the map and its pathways are given visual cues on where to go like if theyre on the red team a red arrow sign will point in the general direction where they need to head to as well as various signs detailing a missions objective and locations like intelligence for the intel briefcase on capture the flag battlements for the general middle area where most of the combat will take place etc the classes all have dynamic personalities that make them a blast to play as and youll often chuckle at their lines regarding the situation which really gives this game alot of personality i personally really enjoy the pyro because the character itself wears a gas mask which makes most of his lines almost inaudiable but if you listen carefully you can make out a few key lines that he screams out besides the games addictive core gameplay theres alot of side content to it like customizable loadouts to your class arsenal cosmetic clothing and different taunts which you usually have to acquire through specific unlocking methods crafting from metal which you get from turning additional weapons into metal which you obtain from random weapon drops during gameplay or trading with other players trading is one of the key mechanics of interacting with other players and interacting with other players is oftentimes a good way of getting to meet a nice friend on steam wether its someone on your team or someone you encounter while on a specific trade server and who might be able to trade or even gift you some stuff if youre friendly to the player and and heshe is friendly to you in return just be careful of annoying or pushy players who are out for your items and will offer either nothing or nearly worthless items in return though if you happen to encounter those just ignore them there is also a mann vs machine coop game mode in where you get to work together with 5 other players being the limit against a horde of powerful robots trying to defend your area from a bomb they will attempt to deliver at all costs this game mode is much more intense than regular multiplayer tf2 and you can earn nice cosmetic item rewards for your weapons in the mann up mode but the bootcamp mode is free to play and a good way for practice but mann vs machine is very tough and is not recommended for newcomers of tf2 to try out immediately with that all out of the way here are a few tips i would recommend everybody whos going to try this game out to follow if they want to have a pleasant experience playing this game in the long run  always stay friendly to other players and dont act obnoxious or selfrighteous to others the name of the game is team fortress 2 meaning that in order to win you need to work together as a team and not go out there thinking you can take the entire team on yourself which will oftentimes lead to you getting killed over and over again communicate with your fellow team members over the situation and what youre planning to do or regarding plans or tactics that the enemy team is using through the default y normal ingame chat and u team membersonly chat window buttons your team members will appreciate it if youre friendly and will be much more likely to cooperate alongside with you towards completing the objective if you do so sure the game can get very hectic and is easy to get annoyed over a supposed cheap kill from a enemy player but overall try to maintain a friendly atmosphere in the game  if nessecary do offline training on maps that youre unfamiliar with and explore the maps so youll know the shortcuts and side routes into enemy territory this is a key factor into becoming a more skilled player over time as there are many side routes that are often easy to miss or not pay attention to that the developers of the maps implemented in order to balance the game and make it possible for a team to overcome the other if theyre being pressured or having difficulty breaking through chokepoints if the enemy team is spawncamping try to take a different spawn exit and flank them from behind if the main route into their base is heavily guarded look for a alternate pathway to take and inform your teammates about it  play classes that suit the current situation this is a common mistake that i see occuring alot on many servers i play on as quite alot of players seem to not grasp the limits of a class and oftentimes like to stick to one class only just because they like playing as that certain class and refuse to play anything else that the team might benefit more at that specific point during the match players need to observe the situation and pick classes whose advantages are required at the time to give a good example payload is a match type in where the red team needs to defend the bomb from being delivered by the blue team and as such will be spawncamping right off the bat during the start of the match yet alot of times there tend to be about 2 or 3 spy andor sniper players in a team of roughly 9 to 12 players on blue those 2 classes can only take out 1 enemy at a time normally and will be killed easily youll need a strong offensive class like heavy or soldier to pressure and kill the enemy team and if your team doesnt have a medic be one medic isnt a easy class but your team members will benefit from the healing so they wont have to retreat to the supply closet often class diversity and good communication about class choices midgame can go a long way in winning the match thanks for reading this and hope it was insightful i definetely recommend this game

i dont really feel it is necessary to talk about whats good about tf2 on a wide basis because we all know what is good about it its updated from time to time it doesnt feel abandoned like most multiplayers and it has a large pool of creative fans plus custom game mods like slender fortress freak fortress and death run make the game twice as better so ill just point out the negatives explosive spam it is understood in a 30 player server that spam is existant and will forever stay that way kudos short circuit it was fun while it lasted crutch weaponsshields and overall annoyance black boxconcheror darwins shield reserve shooter beggars bazooka vaccinator pairs degreaser combos despite naming these i bet all of us use them anyway so i guess you should all feel horrible about yourselves minisentries it sets up in less than 3 seconds the engineer has the ability to pick up his gear why not force him to ulitize a push with his teammates instead its a server killer when youre on a team that doesnt feel like destroying them constantly its dead melee system you may run into some issues with hit registration not going your way like hearing your melee weapon make its hit sound but no actual registration pocket medics this can go both ways and its understandable to heal just that one power class thats getting most of the dirty work done we get it but what you dont get is that youre gaining much assistance as well from the rest of your teammates that is providing much said and needed push do the team a favour heal everyone at least those who respect you people not understanding the difference between boot camp and mann up mode the essence of mann up mode is to use the most effective loadouts have a organized team of each class and to get through wave by wave if you want to mess around there is boot camp lag compensation this takes the cake shots will seem off and youll most definitely have those moments where you either got sniped through a wall or railed through the wall by the heavys curving minigun bullets you thought you got past that wall but you didnt on their screen seeing as i play scout its something i notice on a daily basis specifically against heavies its just all lag compensation curious to know more about it i recommend googling it critical hits its either you get lucky or outlucked if its a issue for players youll have to search for those servers that host noncrit settings as the known popular public servers dont there can be humor in it but not when its so frequent either way critical hits are random pokes of not fun and it ruin the results of good matches servers not tolerating class balance not everyone wants to play in a server infested with engineers and minisentriessentries all over the place or more than 23 demomen spamming stickies everywhere whatever the scenario is this slides right into lack of teamwork and coordination things may never get done the right way so your best bet is to probably just find another server try to get a fair team scramble going and all of the average to good players may quickly go to spectator mode to restack again we are no angels to that who doesnt want to be on the better team closing comments although all of that is whats to dislike about tf2 youll somehow just find a way to see pass through it all and enjoy the game for what it is make some friends find a favorite server and avoid the awful memes if you can

a game that will not only get you addicted to hats but also hyped up about bread team fortress is the king of freetoplay games in this multiplayer video game filled with humor you can choose a team redblu the goal in this firstperson shooter is to beat the other team in 8 different official game modes king of the hill capturetheflag pushlittlecart while in a team you can select one of nine classes with each class having its strength and weakness making sure therell be a game style that will fit you you can also play coop where you team up with 6 people to kill robots besides these official game types there are many others created by the communitysuch as a medieval prophunt etc but even if you ever get bored with playing you can always hang out and start collecting hats by trading reason why its often referred to as the number one hatsimulator before this game i myself wouldnt even have considered playing any cartoonlike games im glad someone converted me its a game that will not get you bored easily but more importantly its free why shouldnt you give it a try at least even if this game has been out there for a while its still being updated on a regular basis new game modes and hats created by the developers and community are regularly being pushed forward and major events are happening at halloween christmas and easter there is only one downside i can think of its quite large in size so make sure you have enough disk space

you will laugh you will cry you will think youre just going to get one hat and then you have 400000 dollas put into this game also there are guys that call you a horseer thats your cue to laugh fo srs pros lots of variety for classes if you dont like playing a color swap military man with a different gun one half of the community is nice and sees you with open armsno homo art style is very good lots of community content for more variety with game modes isnt neccesarily pay to win moreover its a pay to get that medic to uber you and your fancy hat mvm is good if you want to kill capitalist robits cons other half of the community is a cesspool of rich s that will make fun of you for not spending 400000 dollars on a hat with an orbiting benis spinning around it very demanding for a constant framerate usually needs a config to get one pyros are f@ggots 45 kill all the m2 pyros

first of all i dont really understand why this game isnt as popular as for example cs cause its basically the same genre but tf2 disposes of much more diversified gameplay part where ingame scenarios are very variable due to 9 classes available for playing maybe some people dont like animationstyle graphics but apart from this questionable part it is perfect multiplayer fps game i ever played or heard about highly recommended for all cs nerds tired of the bomb has been planted

its a warbased firstperson shooter that isnt a bloody modern military shooter henceforth referred to as mms whats not to like granted the game has become overtaken with hats but id say thats one of the reasons valve decided to make the game freetoplay theyve received enough money from it thus far and they dont need to rely on the money from every purchase to keep the game going unlike most mms games this one isnt rereleased every single year with 1 or 2 minor changes and with a new name slapped on it this game undergoes just like other valve games and a lot of other steam games for that matter perpetual evolution without the need to be rereleased sure it has no singleplayer campaign but theres the portal and halflife series of games for that its a varied game with plenty of game modes that all run on the same sort of infrastructure but are different in varying ways its a good game id recommend it

team fortress 2 a game long joked about being a warthemed hat simulator should be praised and here is why team fortress 2 is a game i believe can really fit with all kinds of gamers from all kinds of scenes whether youre into mobas already into fpss or just a general player of games tf2 can find some way to work itself into your heart part 1 the classes the classes in team fortress 2 are all wellbalanced characters that fit into a special role of a team their wellcraftedness leaves the real struggle to the player to make the class shine above all others the roles of each class dont even stop at what the class could really do there are so many subclasses and builds and weapons that change how the entire game functions its versatility expands far beyond just what its labelled as the classes and their wonderfully fleshedout personalities with different backgrounds helps you to invest in them and really become a part of them and possibly have them become a part of you part 2 the weapons weapons in tf2 arent really improvements to the stock which makes it different than alot of other games theyre another type of playstyle another way to play the game want the heavy to be even more of a damage dealer use the brass beast want a reward for all those headshots youre getting as sniper use the bazaar bargain the weapons help broaden the possibilities and types of play of the game chances are you wont meet players with the same loadout and even better chances you wont find them using the same kind of playstyle all in all i know there might be some sour apples in the bunch but the range of weapons and the manners in which you can use them is spectacular and helps others find classes they like part 3 the hats you knew this was coming admit it the games cosmetic system isnt all that there is but its one hell of a huge chunk ever since the first few hats were added it changed the game from the beginning it was one for one a hat for a hat but soon the seed of economy was planted the economy grew and flourished values were established currencies were made and the true spirit of the warthemed hat simulator came to fruition the economy is a real shining gem in this game while prices may seem absurd it really is astonishing how a video game managed to grow an economy that easily translates virtual goods into monetary value with the unboxing of a crate the community lives around this creation molds it creates it they coexist peacefully and abide by one anothers rules not only does the market shine but the cosmetics themselves too each piece can be equipped together in no specific order aside from some restrictions with clipping of course meaning a bunch of combinations for your signature unique look this furthers the customization from weapons and really helps to make you you overall in the end tf2s a flexible game no matter what genre of game youre most accustomed to tf2 will have a place in your heart interesting quirky characters set in the middle of nowhere fighting over whoknowswhat plenty of methods of customization to make it fit you a community thats pretty darn great and a good bunch of prettylooking hats this game more than earns my 1010 for as much as it counts ps its flippin free

this game could potentially be a life long friend of mine yearly christmas & halloween updates large to medium content updates throughout the year bugs crushed within weeks and smaller updates sprinkled in this games longevity is certainly one of its many strengths as an fps with so many weapons and features it remains extremely comprehensive and balanced regardless of what most players say weapons are added every now and then and current weapons stats are always under inspection for balance issues the control is extremely tight as all source games are movement always seems fluent and never clunky the skill ceiling for movementmobility is extremely high and allows for lots of very tricky moves eg rocketsticky jumping sentry jumping strafing etc generally the skill ceiling for tf2 is very very high with almost 3000 hours at the time of posting this i am nowhere near the skill level of more experianced players the community is still strong and persistant as the game ages and brings in new players an overall friendly and welcoming community awaits new players as well as a thriving competitive scene in both europe and the states not to mention the incredible fancreated artwork and short films on youtube and other sites tf2 has an incredibly involved trading scene which was born from the staggering amount of hats and cosmetic items that you can get the trading scene can be brutal at times but nothing quite stands up to the feeling of getting a sweet new item after spending time trading up for it oh and did i mention you can sell tf2 items for paypal cash if youre advanced enough in summation team fortress 2 is a game for the ages this game has something for everyone if you look for it and youll undoubtedly meet some amazing people and make new friends

so youre looking at the hat simulator 2 reviews eh tf2 is fine as wine an important point before we begin looking good > being good with a few hours shy of 900 hours on this game its about time i wrote a decent review for this black hole which has consumed my entire social life here it goes now you will most likely be eying up the big three valve games at the moment counter strike global offensive hat simulator tf2 and dota 2 all three are unique and have little in common but all great none the less if you have tried the other two and looking towards tf2 you have definitely come to the right game my personal opinion would be in favor of tf2 over cs dota and most other steam games this is primarily because of the games community more than any other reason the smooth and fun gameplay is also likeable tf2 only has a tenth of the hackers private profile scum smurfs and trollers than csgo does so a preferred choice if you are against any of the player types listed the community is so clean gaben must have used flash professional floor cleaner on it i havent played much of dota 2 so i cant say anything about their community besides the infamous stereotype of angry competitive russians destroying the game dont take this the wrong way though tf2 does have its share of toxic players but nowhere as near as bad as csgos 20 year outofdate pickle jar level of toxicity tf2s is more like a lukewarm glass of milk out in the sun sorry counter strike the atmosphere in tf2 is perfect 80% of games are enjoyable and the entire team gets along well or just doesnt fight this game is a guaranteed good time and you can leave at any time if it isnt enjoyable this is another aspect which sets it apart from other competitive games you will never be stuck in a game you dont want to be in in comparison tf2 is very laid back and games are comical and have a degree of stupidcrazy fun if you arent a very serious gamer filthy casual this will most likely be your cup of tea also enjoyable for the more competitive among you as there are teams you can join and highlander tournaments sadly no ranked matchmaking tf2 is well made and all weapons are balanced and unique besides you fithy lock and load 3 pills gaben how could you dont get me started on the minisentry it can take more of a beating than an overhealed heavy  to be fair the game is more or less balanced and no areas of the game are off limits to the f2p scum players besides the almighty hats which everyone craves are the true core of the game some important commonplace rules of thumb could include  hat  skill  no hat  no skill  unusual hat  gud player  gibus  noob f2p unless its painted australium gold that makes you the swaggest of them all  f2p  headshot kill  noob hacker those are a few needtoknow terms in surviving the pub chat there are many more i cant mention them all if played with mates there shallith by significant banter and a good time 10  10  mlg snoypah clan xxfiddyclarkfanbasexxfaze gaben plz bless my soul with gud unboxes this review was terrible i will edit later im sorry you had to view it in this state

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

have you even wondered why does the pyro play the air guitar on his axe why does the medic pretend that his saw is a violin whats up with the corny texan guitar why the hell is there a dance dance immolation achievement thats because you are not in on the ruse tf2 is not a shooter game its a rhythm game you can have excellent reflex and aim and still get outplayed by a player with a better timing who through his understanding of the game mechanics and his immediate environment will force you to play to his tune someone who will forestall your attack and press on intuitively and instinctively without leaving you any room for action other than a panicked defense this may sound familiar to a seasoned gamer and should not be surprising in xvii century miyamoto musashi writes in the book of five rings there is timing in everything timing in strategy cannot be mastered without a great deal of practice [] timing and rhythm are involved in the military arts shooting bows and guns and riding horses [] there is timing in the whole life of the warrior in his thriving and declining in his harmony and discord the book of five rings describes ni ten ichi ryu or the way of strategy as applied to sword fighting the focus of this school is a straightforward thoroughly utilitarian style relying on timing strength and throwing the opponent offbalance lets take a look how some of its techniques apply to tf2 attitude noattitude whenever you parry hit spring strike or touch the enemys cutting sword you must cut the enemy in the same movement it is essential to attain this if you think only of hitting springing striking or touching the enemy you will not be able actually to cut him more than anything you must be thinking of carrying your movement through to cutting him as applied to tf2 you should instinctively choose the right weapon to counter the enemy and make every ammo count the difference between one well and one poorly placed shotgun shot is half of your life make sure it counts ken no sen advance with as strong a spirit as possible and when you reach the enemy move with your feet a little quicker than normal unsettling him and overwhelming him sharply  a good example is a pyro attacking with the powerjack or soldier with the concheror inexperienced players will panic when faced with such a threat tai no sen when the enemy attacks remain undisturbed but feign weakness as the enemy reaches you suddenly move away indicating that you intend to jump aside then dash in attacking strongly as soon as you see the enemy relax convenient in confined spaces feign retreat for a medkit turn around the corner and renew your attack also relevant for triplejumping scouts and stairstabbing spies tai tai no sen when the enemy makes a quick attack you must attack strongly and calmly aim for his weak point as he draws near and strongly defeat him or if the enemy attacks calmly you must observe his movements and with your body rather floating join in with his movements as he draws near move quickly and cut him strongly  important for amby spies and huntsman snipers dont panic maintain your distance and aim for the head or go for a sidestabbushwacka crit while timing your movement appropriately to hit the enemy in one timing when you have closed with the enemy to hit him as quickly and directly as possible while you see that he is still undecided the timing of hitting before the enemy decides to withdraw break or hit is this in one timing note that this is not ambushing this is about taking initiative automatically without overthinking when your enemy has not yet responded the body in place of the long sword according to the enemys cutting method you can dash against him with your body first and afterwards cut with the sword do not use the melee only as the last resort if your opponent is momentarily disoriented close in and attack with the melee to confuse him then take a step back and finish off with a secondary using melee when possible also saves you reload time do not use against suicidal classes with explosive projectiles depending on the place chase [the enemy] towards awkward places and try to keep him with his back to awkward places when the enemy gets into an inconvenient position do not let him look around but conscientiously chase him around and pin him down always chase the enemy into bad footholds obstacles at the side and so on using the virtues of the place to establish predominant positions from which to fight the use of environment is not just pushing the enemy off cliffs force the opponent into rocks cactuses and other obstacles that will break the flow of his movement and give you the advantage to know the times to know the enemys disposition in battle is it flourishing or waning when in a duel you must forestall the enemy and attack when you have first recognized his school of strategy perceived his quality and his strong and weak points attack in an unsuspecting manner knowing his metre and modulation and the appropriate timing if you are thorougly conversant with strategy you will recognise the enemys intentions and thus have many opportunities to win  a crucial element of each duel give it some thought to hold down a shadow in single combat hold down the enemys strong intention with a suitable timing and defeat him by forestalling him with this timing particularly important when playing pyro use the airblast to counter the enemy advance and position yourself for a kill to crush in single combat if the enemy is less skillful than ourselves if his rhythm is disorganized or if he has fallen into evasive or retreating attitudes we must crush him straightaway with no concern for his presence and without allowing him space for breath it is essential to crush him all at once the primary thing is not to let him recover his position even a little dont let a weakened enemy retreat consider that you have a much better chance killing him when he is weakened and retreating than after he returns healed do not let deadringer spies escape to throw in confusion observing the enemys spirit we can make him think here there like that like this slow fast victory is certain when the enemy is caught up in a rhythm which confuses his spirit in single combat we can confuse the enemy by attacking with varied techniques when the chance arises feint a thrust or cut or make the enemy think you are going to close with him and when he is confused you can easily win once again force the enemy to play to your tune and abandon his usual approach airblasting or dodging projectiles changing distance and switching to melee when appropriate is a good example tldr those techniques share certain common themes to become a better player simply follow the rules of the way of strategy 1 do not think dishonestly you wont become better if you dont face your enemy directly 2 the way is in training practice your timing counters and approaches 3 become acquainted with every art know all your weapons and map geometry 4 know the ways of all professions know all the classes 5 distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters know when to retreat and which enemies to prioritize dont die blindly following one enemy 6 develop intuitive judgment and understanding for everything 7 perceive those things which cannot be seen intuit into others intents spycheck 8 pay attention even to trifles listen carefully to the sounds pay attention to your peripheral vision including kill feed 9 do nothing which is of no use make sure your actions are purposeful

team fortress 2 has been regularly updated since its inception in 2007 after over nine years in development due to all these updates the game has actually taken on several incarnations in other words i will be individually reviewing the following three separate games team fortress 2 20072010 hat fortress 2 20102012 dressup fortress 2 2012present but first general you can regularly defy the laws of physics in too many ways to be listed scouts can fly by flapping their legs a can of soda turns you into the supermatrix you can make bullets dodge you some pistols can make you jump higher or fully absorb the impact of falling at any velocity coating someone in milk and then beating them up will cure your cancer steeltoed boots make shooting rockets at your feet less unhealthy whipping people makes them run faster a big russian guy can survive as many direct hits from an antitank missile as a russian t72 tank can blowing into a seashell can patch the gunshot wounds of everyone around you flamethrowers can also shoot a powerful blast of air that can send people flying or rockets back to their maker you can beat people to death with a bottle of whiskey you can decapitate people with a golf club harmless explosives eating a sandvich will cure aids mend katana wounds and treat your erectile dysfunction hitting a machine with a wrench will fix it upgrade it and resupply it dispensers generate ammo for your weapon and pills for your back pain a remote control with one big red button can be used to destroy one of any four buildings of your choosing you can shoot up morphine with a crossbow you can use a beam of light to turn someones exterior skin and clothing into pure titanium armor pretending to play the violin with a bonesaw used for amputation will cure the common cold urine is more effective than a fire extinguisher frenchmen with ski masks are incapable of stabbing their victims in the neck when they encounter australians with shields on their backs theyll stab the shield first making the shield disintegrate a pocket watch can partially absorb the damage caused by a rocket create a deceased doppelganger of you all while you become invisible and walk away if you backstab someone with an icicle theyll instantly transform into a highlydurable ice sculpture team fortress 2 20072010 this was a teambased first person shooter involving two identical teams differing only in color and artistic design vying for control of various strategic locales around the world you could play as one of nine cripplingly overspecialized classes the various classes would have to pool their strengths together and cooperate in order to prevail over the opposing team however this was easier said than done as communication and teamwork were and still are generally foreign concepts teams would have to beat each other up and steal their briefcases beat each other up and steal their stage lighting platforms and beat each other up to push a high explosive bomb cart into a pit hats were just a cool side thing many people would stand around and do nothing on dedicated idle servers so that they could amass the metal necessary to craft themselves a new hat overall team fortress 2 was a fun and highly addictive game whether or not there was a team or no team involved over 9 out of 9 worth the weight hat fortress 2 20102012 the mannconomy update released on september 30 2010 marked the end of team fortress 2 and the birth of hat fortress 2 players no longer needed to idle to get hats they could also buy them trade for them and even sell them for other hats in addition keys were also introduced giving players the ability to throw away their parents or their own hardearned money on opening virtual crates in the hopes of getting virtual hats more often than not they ended up getting worthless virtual guns the mannconomy fever quickly swept over team fortress 2 reducing it to a side game hat fortress 2 was about accumulating as many hats as possible by any means necessary and then using the team fortress 2 minigame to show them off to others the freetoplay update in 2011 further enlarged the player base increasing the popularity of hat fortress 2 its modes and related fun minigames as hat fortress 2 was further refined and developed new elements were added including unusuals and nonhat cosmetic items eventually so many new cosmetics came in that hat fortress 2 gradually evolved into another game 11 hats out of 10 dressup fortress 2 2012present this is the current and ultimate form of team fortress 2 the game is centered on assembling a complete outfit for each of the classes that you play you can acquire the components for your dream outfit by unboxing crates of all shapes and sizes andor by implementing any one of the many trading strategies out there you can show off your outfits topped off with exorbitant unusual hats in a multitude of ways you can do the conga hifive other folks adorned with fancy and quirky outfits play intense games of rock paper scissors or play jack blacks guitar you can also play whatever vestiges remain of the old team fortress 2 you could also play mann vs machine and acquire stock weapons with robotic skulls hanging from them or perhaps even become the man with the golden gun if neither of those are satisfactory there are a wide range of other minigames to play some of which have been around since the days of old team fortress 2 they include but are not limited to versus saxton hale freak fortress 2 jailbreak balloon race tf2 kart magic spells in halloween event maps slender fortress surf maps jump maps and tf2ware in conclusion dressup fortress 2 does provide something for everyone so i guess its alright 1110 iterations of gaben and my favorite class is the spy thanks and have fun

review made by kurakao who had 2566 hours of team fortress 2 while writing this review on 5102014 ddmmyyyy includes 1 tf2 from my pov point of view 2 about team fortress 2 3 experiences & details 413 about gamemodes 5 competitive in a nutshell 6 recommendations from it 7 my own experiences and why 8 tldr too long didnt read aka this whole thing nutshelled in a sentence 9 my rating 1 what can i say this is the reason i downloaded steam because i wanted so hard to test this game out i saw this game everywhere and i was always wondering like hmm what kind of a game this might be like counter strike mixed with its own weirdness and i was halftrue 2 team fortress 2 is like mixing the quake games counterstrike and a bit of fashion and hats all the way this is the reason tf2 is so fun you get to do any kind of hatmisc combinations cosmetics these days and you can create your own individual looks how people recognize you from others i remember using funny combinations so people recognized me easily and were like oh hey kurakao i just noticed you came in because i saw that awesome set of yours 3 team fortress 2 is extremely fun teambased depends what style you play i play dm deathmatch alot which is basically just killing with no point somehow restricted with the 9 classes but doesnt restrict enough to not be individually weirdstyled and its extremely addictive  41 i have never played anything as addictive as team fortress 2 this is extremely fun to play and you can play any kind of gameplay you like you can go either saxton hale vsh_ maps to run away from the evil boss monsters that is controlled by a single player and he chases trying to kill you 42 then theres my favourite customs prophunt which is the same as in gmod you disguise as an object and the enemies are trying to catch you firing your weapon decreases your hp so you need to be careful not to spam 43 then there are normal based maps payload capture point king of the hill etc etc which is hardlybased on teamwork and who plays what it usually costs the team a victory if they are fullteam snipers or spies or whatsoever unless they are protier players but usually it ends up the team who has a better classsupport wins you can stop reading here and scroll down if you dont want to know anything about competitive 5 then there was competitive where i played some of my time i was only division 6 and i played as a roamer i had alot of friends who were either division 6 or they were division 5 or better and some of them were as good as lowdivision 21 competitive is extremely fun but it can be stressful sometimes if you take it too seriously 6 i recommend taking it easy and having fun while having the pressure at the same time this part requires great communication skills and you need to have atleast a bit of social skills to learn to handle this its a great advantage if you play with your team other than in just scrims or officials play with them normally and chat often with them to link up a true friendship and that is what makes you indestructible 7 i quitted competitive myself because it was too hard for me and i couldnt handle the tryhard you have to do in competitive it also might take a long time to find a true team you want to play in and never underrestimate being a substitute spot because that might be extremely crucial in some moments  8 tldr team fortress 2 is extremely addictive and gives tons of good memories best game ive ever played myself 9 1010

first i time came across with tf2 was after i bought an orange box from the store i was dying for hl2 didnt know it was coming with this cartoonlike game called tf2 and interestingly i almost was going to ask steam support to remove this game from my game library after watching a clip on youtube seriously i was like what the $$ but was too lazy for that so time passes looking to something new i see this tf2 thingy again in my library so whatever lets download and give it a shot now after a year i wish i had submitted a ticket to steam support and got this thing removed from my account clocked 1000 hours and i dont know where and how this will stop there are two things you cant apparently clear one is radioactive contamination the other one being addictive to tf2 oh and supposedly this game came free with orange box nice play valve first fix is always free isnt it

english review interesting free game for entertainment and fun you might tell yourselves it s the same as the other actions games shooting games where you can play through servers with different players by the choice of a hero etc but tf2 has something very interesting some improvements and special stuff selection of 9 heroes while every of them is somehow specialized and has different inventory to choose and every chosen unit has it s own statistics unbelievable 500 achievements will get you and surprise you meanwhile for comparing with other games it s a big shot chance of gaining equipments to inventory of your warrior or any bonuses which are going to be very useful in the game it s important to point out that there is a possibility of playing as single player or cooperation or any other methods but its useless and needless and about graphics  it cant be compared with current class but if youre searching for relaxing and getting crazy then tf2 is made for you fory ou it will not lose its attraction rating 810 slovak review zaujmav free hra pre pobavenie a zbavu mono si poviete e je to to ist ako in akn hry strieaky kde mte hra cez servery s inmi hrmi vberom hera a podobne no tf2 m nieo do seba ist vyleenia a zaujmavosti vber z 9 hrdinov priom kad z nich je inak pecializovan a m na vber in bojov invertr k tomu kad vybran jednotka ma vlastn tatisku neuveritench 500 achievementov vs dostane a prekvap priom pre porovnania s inmi hrami je to riadna plka monos zskavania vybaven do inventra vho bojovnka i rznych bonus ktor bud vemi npomocn v hre treba podotkn e je monos aj hrania single player i kooporacie alebo in mdy no to je len na okraj a asovo zbyton o sa tka grafiky ned sa porovnva s terajou triedou no ak hadte odreagovanie a vyantenie sa tak tf2 je na to ako stvoren len tak ahko vs neomrz hodnotenie 810

great game there are quite a few glitches after big updates but its still a good game this game ruins people these hats ruin people i recommend any new person coming into tf2 to not focus on hats or the economy most of you will and you will regret it just trust me there is way to much price manipulation going on and if you do get into hats do not get into unusuals they will make you question everything youve ever done just dont do it dont go to the hat side anyways just based on the game not hats ill give this game a 1010 will swag again

team fortress 2 is quite a game with a history originally a paytoplay game tf2 became free upon so the number of players skyrocketed team fortress 2 is a game where reliable excavation demolitions red usually defends from onslaughts of builders leauge united blu you the player are given the choice of 9 merchanaries the fast cocky and furious scout the patriotic brawler soldier the mysterious hellborn that is the pyro the scumpydrinking oneeyed black cyclops demoman the comical and brutually large heavy the whimsical engineer the funny german medic the cool calm and collected sniper and lastly the man who perfers brains over brawn the spy what makes this game so entertaining is that each of the 9 mercanaries that you can play as all have such a distinct personality looks and playstyle if youre a player who likes runandgun scout is for you if you like big guns heavy calls your name stealth spy is already right behind you waiting for you to play as him who can forget the loveable pyro who sets everything ablaze this game is also very rewarding to both new and experienced player alike as item drops are given not for getting a certain amount of kills but for just playing the game however if you want to truely experience the full greatness that is tf2 i reccomend paying anywhere from 50 cents to $90 in the mann co store to get prenium so you can truely have a great feel for the game however if money is tight or if youre not sure youll enjoy this amazing game you are not truely penalized for being a freetoplay unlike most other games of this kind overall team fortress 2 is a great game that doesnt require a supercomputer and id honestly reccomend this game to anybody who asks so

i can not recommend this game enough ive played it for a really long time and it has never even once become boring there may not be many updates to it and its glitchy as hell and the developers dont care about it as much anymore than they used to it still is an incredibly fun game that you can just jump in any time you want it might be a bit hard to get in due to all of the different weapons classes stats and what not tons of stuff to remember but once you got into it oh man the community isnt that bad either had worse experiences in dota 2 shivers

team fortress 2 is a fantastic multiplayer online first person shooter with 9 classes that all have unique personalities each class uses a primary secondary and melee weapon the heavy has the most health takes a while to fire but can do the most damage per second with no reloading but he moves slowly the soldier shoots rockets has the 2nd most health and and is the 2nd slowest but experienced players can rocket jump the demoman is a defender using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class the pyro is a defender lighting enemies on fire causing damage for an amount of time air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team engineers build teleporters sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo the spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself his sapper can also disable and destroy the engineers buildings the scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else snipers snipe from far away medics heal and make people invincible at times as for the modes there are traditional capture the flag king of the hill and less traditional payload where blue team will push a moving cart while red team defends it the more blue players next to the cart the faster it will go if a red player is next to the cart it stops moving it is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest there is also payload race where two teams push their carts and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points 3 or 5 points instead of just 1 like king of the hill teams for both modes are mostly 12 vs 12 each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time the newest mode is mann vs machine where six players take on wave after wave of robots there is a free version of mann vs machine called boot camp and a non free version called mann up that costs a tour of duty ticket $1 in the store the ticket gets used if you complete a mvm mission if you dont complete a mission or if you complete a mission youve already completed then you keep the ticket a mann vs machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps what do you get for completing a tour a random strange weapon and a notch in your belt the maps in team fortress 2 stand out for their paths there isnt just one path through each map but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes there is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind sure this game is free to play but there are a lot of things to buy for real money hats for $5 keys for $250 keys are like legalized gambling you buy a key to open a crate if you dont get what you want you can always use steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key there is a whole micro economy in the game with trading the game will drop you weapons as you play then you can craft two weapons together to make metal 18 weapons will make you a refined metal thats the basic free currency of the game when you have three refine you can craft them together for a random hat most people prefer to trade their refined for keys but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons keys will always cost $250 you can also buy and sell keys in the steam market for steam wallet money to buy steam games the items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills so it is not pay to win even though you can buy in game weapons but every weapon is a sidegrade not an upgrade with pros and cons to each weapon since this is a multiplayer game nothing will overpower you it is all rockpaperscissors heavy can kill anything but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy a pyro can easily take out a spy stuff like that team fortress 2 is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items maps and halloween events the halloween events feel pretty special but for the most part theyre just halloween versions of normal maps the community items while cool seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons there have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on it is an exceptional game diverse weapons maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play free you get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them it is such a good game even if youre like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer or single player against bots it is a must play for any fan of first person shooters the game is smooth the 9 characters and weapons are very balanced and very different there is a diverse array of modes

best f2p ive ever played and best im ever going to play probably first of all its very fun great gameplay funny characters awesome community made items perfect to play with friends its really skillbased and has also some good teamplay elements too one of the best thing about it is also that its a very balanced game the classes are the player distribution in teams never is even after 84567 scrambling the teams the class you select is always gonna have a lot of pros and cons be effective against some classes and be an easy target for others after some time youll probably end up having favorite classes and some that you like a bit less d [iimgurcom] fking spies  theres an inner story to the game and its characters but as often with valve is not really explicit actually even less than portal or l4d2 so take a look at the comics [wwwteamfortresscom] to know more about it  after 9 years in development its been worth the wait

i can honestly say this is one of the best games i have ever played i have been playing for 3 years now and i have yet to get bored it seems there are always new things not only does it have a great weapon system and diffrent uses fir diffrent weapons it has a beutifal customization system hats miscs its amazing and it has a personality for each class and i love it not to mention it has that classic game sort of feel it brings health packs into the game a use for each class i really recomend this game to people who are tired of call of duty and battle field not trying to say that those two are bad i played them but it reapeated nothing much new so if you are looking for a good game i higly recommend this

this reviewrating can be divided into two sections prepost f2pjune 23 2011 it is very important to distinguish between these two because they are really two different games pref2p tf2 1010  for the first few years of tf2s existence the game managed to have an absolute killer dynamic with a great playerbase that relied heavily on teamwork and a great community fostered by valves friendliness to the modding community valve really worked with the community to create new scenarios maps and weapons these first few years that helped vastly improve the game postf2p tf2 510  the easiest way to describe the state of the game today would be a male dressup barbie simulator i dont fault valve for trying to capitalize on a game that is at the time of this writing over 7 years old but the best times for this game are now well past theres just too many new hats and new weapons to choose from from which the majority are useless sure there are still plenty of servers to play in but the majority of the servers are devoid of players with skill microphones and teamwork theres still a few fun servers see the noheroes servers but donating is about the only way you will be able to see the inside of one of these servers when its full the only bright side is that valve is still adding new content with multiple updates a year
recommended
wasted a large portion of my life on it 1010
recommended
once you start you just cant stop never before have hats had more meaning in my life

this could be the best mmo you will ever face its just perfect every role is nearly perfect balanced maybe the pyro is a bit to strong get items you can sell a great community who will not hate you when you are bad they will just leave you alone

team fortress 2 aka tf2 is a free to play multiplayer first person shooter fps and a hat cosmetic simulator a very fun game especially very addictive and good for relaxation but it depends how good you are at the game or on your picked class classes & teams therere about 9 classes in the tf2  [offensive classes] scout soldier pyro [defensive classes] demoman heavy weapons guy engineer [support classes] medic sniper and spy each class has its own strength and weakness for example spy has a low health but he can kill can instantly by backstabbing you tf2 has 2 teams blu and red they hate each other and they attack each other nothing interesting maps levels & gamemodes maps can be different pretty obvious but unfortunately maps can affect the gameplay because like i said before each class has its own weakness for example sniper can kill you pretty easily in a very wide map and you can get annoyed each map has its own gamemode here is a list of all official gamemodes capture the flag ctf control points cp territorial control tc payload pl payload race plr king of the hill koth medieval mode special delivery sd mann vs machine mvm robot destruction rd arena arena mannpower and here is a list of unofficial gamemodes highlander tf2centercom 6v6 tf2centercom saxton hale mode or freak fortress vsh randomizer slender fortress sl prop hunt ph dodgeball zombie fortress surfing surf jail break fortwars and many more hatscosmetics you dont need them to play a game players usually care so much about cosmetics because they want to look good and feel good while they play a game most of them spend about $500 on the game only because of the hats players also care about the qualities of the items some qualities can be very expensive so i dont suggest to spend money on crap however hats are not the only ones players also waste money on weapons due different qualities or reskins if you really want to get hats then i suggest you to read this guide httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid248435114&searchtextfreehats if you want more hats then i suggest you to understand and learn some basics about the tf2 trading community and about trading itself here is a guide httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid158754458 major updates there are 2 different kinds of tf2 updates official updates and community created updates theyre official too whats the difference you ask well its pretty simple official updates  are created by the main creatorcompany called valve in their updates you can find new gamemodes new weapons which are usually made in the summer or in the winter new maps bug fixes and especially there is a 90% chance that valve is going to add new hats made by the community from the steams workshop community created updates  valve usually cares what community makes but they dont allow community mess with the balance of the game meaning valve doesnt allow us to create new weapons which can have different stats and especially add new maps however valve added community maps only in the beginning when tf2 was still new and fresh but now everything is different because in nowadays tf2 became as a very popular game so like i said before valve actually cares what community creates so valve likes to add new hats and new weapons just models created by some talented people from the community but majority of the community hates to see that every new update has a new hat and to be honest its normal if you didnt know there was a big over hyped update called end of the line and it was actually the most useless update in the tf2 it had tons of cosmetics a new taunt a new weapon which is a actually a reskin with no stats before an update arrived the community really hoped to see a map called snowplow with the new gamemode but when the update arrived the map was canceled by valve valve said that the map is too confusing for new players  later that sentence became as a meme  because other maps made by valve are more confusing than a snowplow anyways lets move on unbalanced gameplay & weapons tf2 has 2 kinds of players f2p free to play players aka noobs and p2p premium to play players aka experienced players imagine blu team full of noobs and red team full of experienced players is this a balanced match heck no reds would win every bloody match however in valve servers you may find a voting system which allows any player to vote something here is a list current voting types kick player restart the match change levelnext level scramble teams disable team autobalance eternaween allow halloweenrestricted items for two hours player must have an item to enable this voting choice so imagine again those 2 teams again imagine that you joined the blu team and you see that the teams are not balanced at all and whenever you come out of your base  you always die so you decide to vote to scramble teams so what do you think whats going to happen the voting will fail because your enemies are having fun and because your teammates noobs doesnt know how to vote at all or just completely ignores the voting now lets talk about weapons shall we nah lets not because valve finally fixed all those unbalanced weapons i could mention them like a long time ago but now its not worth it i will still save this title just in case the story well there is a story in the tf2 but unfortunately you cant find it ingame you can only find it in the official tf2 comics you can find comics in the official tf2 website right here [wwwteamfortresscom] the community the community was great until tf2 became for free right now if you go to any official valve server then you may hear some screaming or crying children with microphones i hope your ears doesnt explode to be honest tf2 community is still great it depends where you live usually i really love to play with americans i never loved to play with europeans because they love judge each other and sometimes theyre so speechless how cruel what is a premium account premium account means an upgraded account in the beginning you can only have 1 backpack slot if you buy something from the mann co store ingame store then your account will be upgraded and you will have 6 slots in your backpack its very important to have a premium account because 1 backpack slot if not enough for you i suggest you to buy a mann co supply crate key  once you bought something from the mann co store  dont use it again use it only to buy keys once you understand all basics about trading  you will know what to do with your bought keys just trade your key for the metal and then buy tons of hats and weapons as much as you want overall my rating is 7 out of 10 remember once you start to love this game then there is a small chance that you will leave it everything depends what you like or love or how quickly do you understand things also i am very sorry if i was very rude or mad in this review its because sometimes tf2 can make your feelings hurt especially your sanity if you dont want to risk your life then simply dont play this god damm game have fun ^^

edit to all the people who are complaining about the new update you wanted a new update you got it so what a couple of skins some crates and some fresh gameplay mechanics big deal leave your negative reviews to yourself no one cares  team fortress 2 here i go looking for a game thats free to play a first person shooter and down right fun as hell well youve come to the right game all 9 classes add for a diverse choice of playing styles but thats only part of it weapons lots of extra weapons the large universe of weapons can assist you in your play style or just change it completely im looking at you gunslinger  the large selection of weapons allow for a diverse and quite unique experience for the first person shooter genre and theres still not something that can match up to this game but the main reason most people play team fortress 2 is for its 1 of a kind trading system while is is sometimes unrelliable trade servers and all team fortresss 2 trading system is a game changer you can trade hats miscs and weapons and trust me youre better off having hats because in this game your generally considered a better player for having loads of hats and unusuals ah unusuals almost forgot about those things unusuals are basically hats with special effects like flames or a snow cloud over your head or on your head they are obtained through purchasing mann co supply crate keys and many more types of keys from the mann co store or the steam market or other sources and using them to unbox a crate that corresponds with that specific key generally reffered to unboxing or uncrating players have a very rare chance to unbox these unusuals but when you do consider yourself done with trading unless you unbox a less valuable unusual  thats team fortress 2 in a long nutshell im superonlinegamer and i approve of this game

tf2 is a casual free to play first person shooter on its own that doesnt really translate to much but with a wide variety of game modes incredibly high skillcap and diverse classes with a variety of weapons to cater to a large amount of playstyles tf2 does stand out as being a cut above the rest balancing unfortunately isnt as strong as it could be and there are a few legitimately overpowered weapons and not all classes are equal in usefulness however with the lack of cash shop based game stats and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game on top of the skillcaps of the classes keeping in mind the casual nature of the game any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and teamcoordination their business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the ingame storeor to be gifted a premium upgrade packageat which point any cosmetic weapon or upgrade can be found through playing the game crafted or purchased through ingame resources its a very fair game with one of the best free to play models in the market the primary difficulty youll find with the game is starting it with a lackluster tutorial uncordinated public games and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in soloplay playing with friends and doing some research into the game is highly recommended as tf2 wont do it for you tf2 on its own is highly modfriendly and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes with a bit of searching you can find hangouts minigames training servers custom maps unofficial weapons and the like on top of the official game and fairly friendly community its not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues or requirements to invest money it has its problems but ultimately they are minor what tf2 offers is a rich fps experience with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes so i have no issues recommending this game to any fps fan looking for a teamfocused objective based shooter
recommended
tf2 has been out for over 6 years and it still hasnt gotten old you know why because valve will never keep it the same thanks to frequent game changing updates if you like shooting people youll like it if you like blowing people up youll like it if you like hats you will love it just get this game theres no reason not to
recommended
after all these years tf2 is still one of the most balanced and dynamic shooter games out there the art style is a refreshing break from the usual quasirealisticgrimtactical asthtic of most other popular shooter games the action is fast paced there are always new stratagies to try and this game is great with friends whats not to love

i love this game so much that 7 years after its launch i spent over 3 months of sweat and firstworld hard labor to put together a love letter in video form why team fortress 2 is still my favorite fps in 2015 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvp5woxxmtwh8 theres no classbased fps that combines hilarious and genuine character with unending gibfests and an unstoppably addicting skillceiling for every playstyle the way team fortress 2 does im not sure when ill stop playing tf2 for good but it wont be anytime soon my original review from may 22 2011 i stopped playing starcraft ii an hour into its launchday premiere so i could play a then threeandahalf year old game ive never quit loving i had to get my team fortress 2 fix if that doesnt tell you anything about this game i dont know what will launch after launch i play new gamesthat cost 5 times what tf2 cost meand i enjoy em like anyone else but at the end of the day i get bored of the lot and find myself back in the action of this chaotic masterpiece team fortress 2 has been a constant source of entertainment and skillsharpening throughout the years andin all honestyi just wouldnt call myself a pc gamer without owning this hilarious bloody gem

i dont even know where to start with this this is only an fps by definition as it stands out from all the rest after thousands of hours of playing this game i cant praise it enough the game play is fun the characters are likeable most maps are welldesigned and enjoyable to play on the game can be modded serverside either minor tweaks or major gamechanging overhauls or played vanilla which is amazing in its own right and theres many classweapon combinations to keep things interesting the game is entirely free but you may want to buy one item from the store to get premium so you can trade items which you get randomly anyway but its only a dollar or something for the least expensive item a small matter of convenience and cosmetic really there are only two significant problems most servers have random critical hits enabled its by default that basically means youre screwed or dead simply because by random chance youre gonna take 3x damage from a hit the other major problem is that some weapons are unbalanced or unfun to play against but its not a huge problem in this game if you got a free night check the game out you may just be hooked for a long time easily the best game ive ever played and the one ive played most by far and its free

i like this game honestly for all my complaints about it i really and truly love this game but its a sinking ship now dont get me wrong theres a lot good with it tons of ways to play loads of weapons hundreds of maps and its easy enough to learn on the other hand though it has its fair share of issues the community is pretty much the number 1 problem ever since valve made it f2p hordes of idiots no longer hindered by the issue of paying for it joined the bandwagon meaning that even people who shouldnt be able to contribute to the experience now can through this any potential good people see the way that the masses play and adopt the strategies {wm1ing nade spamming healing only heavies etc} for their own leading to an endless spiral of stupidity additionally every single time spuf throws a temper tantrum over something being op {omg vlve git rd of sandman} valve caves in and nerfs the offending material so expect to have to relearn to use your favorite weapons every other month or so as a final aside apart from a few servers here and there rest assured that almost every server you visit will be a mish mash of imbeciles who should still be training on bot servers {and should probably never leave them} people who are leagues better than you and only there to grind stranges traders who are only there to idlespam trade requests and the occasional troll very rarely will you find a server where everyone is polite actively playing halfway decent and more or less on your skill level the same issues also plauge coop mode {mann vs machine or mvm} youd expect to see the usual pub filth in boot camp {and you do} but not in tour of duty mode which is pay to play nope youll still see the normal assortment of trade spammers caber demoknights gunslinger engis people that call for kicks after you miss a single piece of cashdie too often and really just a general lack of common sense after the community id say valve themselves are the next biggest problem everytime you turn around theres a new hat a new misc item a new kit to make your weapon fire glowy pumpkins and set your head on fire after a few kills and so on and so forth new weapons though been almost 2 years if im remembering correctly {edit finally valve although even this update only gave us 4 new weapons with the others being reskins and the rest of the content being guess what misc items and taunts} tons of reskins though including the stupidly rare golden ones and that stupid frying pan that goes for over $4k {in a f2p game no less} although to be fair weapon stats are changed so much that we technically get new weapons every now and then this game has gone from capture the point and kill all enemies in your way to holy wow guise stout shako 3 ref trade me up its no longer an fps its a dress up game with murder as an optional sidequest valve sadly seems to longer care about making the game fun as much as they do fattening their wallets edit the halloween events of the last 2 years are all but proof positive of this where the new gameplay elements more or less amounted to pick up this item and mindlessly spam instant death beams and dozens {yes dozens} of misc items being released the majority of which cant even been worn once the event ends or outside of a full moon truly the golden age of this game is over with any competent players bound to permanently ragequit sooner or later

youll think this game doesnt look appealing because of its graphics and gameplay well id tell you this youve got to give it a chance by playing it for like 5 hours try out all the game modes and try out all the custom modes made by the community after 4 years of playing this game is absolutely amazing not only because of its high amount of comic and hilarious scenes but also for its original graphics gamemodes characters and much more the 9 different characters in this game makes team fortress 2 so unique for instance its tons of fun playing as the spy character this very unique character can go completely invisible against other online players this one of the reasons i liked this game so much when i was 14 the ability to go invisible is one of team fortress 2s many appealing reasons to play it by going invisible you can have tons of fun by playing around with it and using clever tactics with it are you bored after a few hours no problem you just switch to another character within a split second lets take the soldier character its equipped with a huge rocket launcher on his shoulder which can obviously fire rockets something also very unique and great scripting is that you can rocketjump with the rockets you fire you shoot them at your feet and youll get launched away this is just also very great and really amuzing youll spend hours and hours mastering those rocketjumps and is also a great reason to keep on playing team fortress 2 these were just 2 of team fortress 2s unique characters these are all characters other first person shooter games dont have this is one of the biggest reasons to try out this incredible game also something every first person shooter doesnt have is that all the weapons are completely free reason why is that you find them all eventually you just play with your stock weapon at first until a screen pops up and says you have found a new weapon and poof youve got one of tf2s 1000 weapons in your inventory all shiny and ready to get played with all weapons have their unique ability which can be great fun and tactical besides shooting rockets grenades blasting out fire and shooting a billion bullets a minute there is also a whole different part of team fortress 2 and thats trading your items team fortress 2 comes with a very unique trading system you can trade your weapon you just found for something else via another online player beside weapons there are also a thousand hats for all your tf2 characters so you can enjoy tf2 even more by dressing your characters either very fancy scary classy funny or whatever you want for anyone who wants a unique game this is it free to play for everyone so get it now id say

ever since i bought this game i have never put thought into doing a completly honest review if you want to take a few minutes from your time you can listen to my storythe first time i played this was around late december 2007 on my brothers old windows vista computer it didnt have much on it weapons hats unusauls etcid played it a few times over at friends houses and watched it change new gamemodes servers weapons etcand how that all changed the gameplay balance i didnt get my own steam till about 3 years ago and i was only going to use it for garrys mod then i decided oh what the hell i guess ill download tf2 since its free id been playing it on the xbox 360 for about a year then by the way it sucks on that and i remember my first game feeling sweetness as i got an insane killstreak on 2fortlike 50 something kills in less than 7 minutes i hadnt been using steam much at the time but around late august 2012 id really started to get into things i found out about trading and the tf2 economy and getting cool hats for your characters and the new mvm update which i mainly play right now then when my friend told me about unusuals in tf2 everything ing changed in late december 2012 i was doing everything i could to get one of these so claimed unusuals they had these like cool particle effect thingys coming out of them finally from the help of a steam buddy of mine i was able to get one the very first unusual i owned was a steaming handymans handle now i know youre thinking haha a 10 key hat so what but at the time i didnt care if it was worth jack squat it just felt so good to have that thingy with steam emmitting out of it then soon after that i got earbuds and a bills hat and some strange festives and then around my sprnig break in 2013 i got scammed out of my unusual my only unusualand the guy who did it i wanted to ing rip his head off i hated him so much i will give his name out balestorm1 although hes been offline for over a year now hes a really interesting guy did a scamming spree of like 6 unusual hats back to my story now after that i traded my earbuds for a second unusual hat a stormy pith helm for solly it looked pretty cool as well i then started trading up to make profit and by early summer 2013 i already had about $1000 worth of items a whole summer went by dedicated towards making profit and spending more of my money on unusualsstranges etcbut after reaching what seemed like my full mental capacity for trading i started to feel sad and lonely and withdrawn from the everthing else im not kidding i decided i should probably cash out of tf2 to get money and such for it all i did end up getting around 500 us dollars via paypal but i still had a whole bunch of  after doing thati traded towards an awesome burning dappers for soldier of which i favorited then i traded and traded till in finally decided to spycrab what was primarily left of my backpack not alot but something 4 buds worth of  i lost in multiple spycrabs on the mctpink tacos trading server during all that i was also taking a long break from tf2 as well going into several gmod communities i even made my own server with a buddy of mine that is a different story though all the trading has put aside a focus for the core gameplay i feel like this is how it is for many others who play this game as well several updates ago i was getting really  at the game and with this new love and war or bread and conga lol not update it really  me off for multiple reasons and for like the 6th time i said im done with tf2 im never playing this  of a game again but here i am amidst all this chaosstanding strong i prevail through all of this i know no matter what this game with its mystery will be my all time favorite video game

1010 this game is really addictive the gameplay the community the fun its all there there are lots on ingame items such as cosmetics taunts etc these kinda ruined the game what i think but other than that this game would never bore you recommended

this is a well made stylized team based first person shooter teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers there are 9 classes to choose from each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team this provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels the game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes at the time of this review there are two official modes of play player versus player and mann versus machine player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players within this mode there are different types of maps each type of map has its own objective or objectives for each team to achieve mann versus machine is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots players collect money from destroyed bots the money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots the pay to play submode mann up gives rewards upon completing a tour in addition to the official modes of play there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as versus saxton hale where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named saxton hale dodge ball where two teams of players playing as pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive zombie mod where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players to name just a few of the many player made mods available in addition to game play players will randomly receive free items from the game some of the free items given out are weapons hats and crates hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class crates can be opened with a key keys can be purchased from the mann co store or from the steam community market or traded for from another player most crates will list which items can be found within them the game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for the game is easy to pick up and play either alone or with friends yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly the dynamics between the different classes weapons play styles skill levels modes and maps provides content for many hours of play i have been playing since january 2015 and i still return to the game on a regular basis

that meet the spy was leaked onto youtube on may 17 2009 two days before its intended release that the smg was originally intended for the scout that a telefrag will instantly fill the buff banners gauge that a scout getting gibbed has a 1 in 100 chance of spawning a dove flying out of his body that a 101 golden wrench and a 11112 gentle mannes service medal were given to the winner of a charity auction for childs play that the ambassador originally dealt minicrits on headshot rather than full critical hits that the flamethrower could not originally perform airblasts before the pyro update

a wonderfully crafted cartoony arena shooter if you dont already own this game you are not a pc gamer there are 9 classes to choose from 1 the scout  a bostonborn rude inyourface and speedy character that has a double jump ability 2 the soldier  a crazed patriot from americas heartland hes versatile and a great starter class to get familiar with tf2 3 the pyro  a mumbling pyromaniac of indeterminate origin who has a burning passion for all things fire related 4 the demoman  a scrumpyswilling explosives expert from the scottish highlands 5 the heavy  hailing from the ussr he is the largest and possibly most dangerous class in tf2 6 the engineer  specializes in constructing and maintaining buildings that provide support 7 the medic  provides healing for the members of his team and has a special ability known as an ubercharge 8 the sniper  from the aussie outback this character provides longrange support with his trusted sniper rifle 9 the spy  this character can be rendered invisible and can disguise as members of the other team there are also a plethora of maps and weapons that can also be used to your advantage to gain control and defeat the other team tf2 is definitely one of the best freetoplay games to ever be released

i doubt anybody really needs to be told why to try team fortress 2 especially with its reputation and lack of a price tag but i suppose i should throw my 2 cents in anyway team fortress 2 is a fun game that gives you fun options in how you want to play you get 9 classes to toy with each having an interesting personality and a unique playstyle then as you play youll come across weapons that let you experiment within each classs playstyle the more you play the more stuff you amass and the more options youll have at your disposal if you havent already take a dip into the world of team fortress 2 youre almost guaranteed to find something you like

great game although the balancing team seems like its made up of monkeys there are many complaints from the community about balancing classes and weapons that go ignored some of the updates especially recent ones are lackluster sometimes it feels like its just valve versus tf2 community also if anything happens dont forget to blame gaben edit some people also like to blame jericho

ive been playing this game since 2011 i was free to play until my father gave me $5 to spend and i got 2 keys and my free to play days were over ever since then i have fell in love with the game the people the maps the items mostly my friends is the reason i still keep playing this game i would reccomend this game to anyone who has an open imagination demoman is my favorite class i love blowing  up 3

hat simulator 2 hat harder what can i say about it that hasnt been said already its fun its free its got cool stuff that is seriously underplayed and the classes and asthetic are nearly timeless but youve heard that a thousand times what of the meat and bones the mechanics that everything is built on gotta say hella good the interplay of a lot of slightly different weapons and the drastically different classes combines well with the objective focus but more importantly it makes you ask yourself silly questions like what if i ran a melee medic or a melee heavy what could make this more fun to play it is a great game with great appeal but most importantly the mechanics are fun plus who could argue with the price now if they would just do more with the magic spells and medieval mode and the bosses then i would have no complaints

hat fortress 2 oh sorry team fortress 2 is a multiplayer fps focusing on cooperating with your allies to complete objectives or stop the other team from completing theirs at your arsenal you have 9 unique classes with hundreds of weapons of your choosing you find random drops in form of weapons as you play allowing you to try out new weapons and eventually finding your favourite combos unlike other popular fps games tf2 focus on advancing with your team and fill in for your allied classes weaknesses while a heavy class have great damage output his slowness makes him a sitting duck a medic class can keep him alive and together advance into enemy territory to do damage in another example an engineer class can setup a small base for allies to heal refill ammo and have a few seconds of not being fired upon against a demolition class like soldier or demoman he can just watch as his buildings are wrecked however with the support of a pyro their explosives can be turned against them some weapons are even specifically made to support another class in battle the real gem of tf2 is however its crazy customization you can equip all kinds of hats clothes and other miscs making your classes stand out and not only that tf2 even got a huge economy with thousands of other players involved into trade a weapon or a hat with a friend profit on selling your rare misc or simply hoard it all its all up to you pros crazy fun gameplay badass costimization hilarious voice acting huge economy and one of the longest surviving fpses on the market oh and free cons to avoid having to play for tons of hours to try out all weapons the ingame store sells extremly overpriced items trading however enables you to get everything cheaper but new players will have trouble with this to make your items tradable you are required to buy a premium upgrade which you can by buying the cheapest item in the store so not too expensive

this is by far the most awesome game ive ever played ive never seen such variety in any other game before so many different mods texture packs its flexibility its support its just lovely and i always get back to it the freedom you have in this game is incredible you can noclip through every map record demos which you can then play back from different angles movierecording at any fps rate relatively powerful scripting language dedicated private free serverhosting easy access to players on the server to contact them all textures editable gravity editable its just purely amazing and its also relatively bug free by now compare this to other aaa titles nowadays theres nothing like this thats why i find myself always getting back to it and its not just about fragging & killing either there is also the medic which heals people you can play surf maps or jump maps to pull off amazing stunts each of the 9 classes is fun in its own way the moviescene is also huge and this game is almost 6 years old now and is still very actively played for reasons 1010

instead of i would play this game 10000 hours straight and i would still suck 1010 i will now post the class jobs or something like that heavy can be killed by demo or soldier easily has high output of bullets with medic can be a bullet sponge for 10 seconds if under medium fire medic healer also has a syringe gun thats like snipers smg a bit except i believe it does less damage also has a crossbow that when fired at teammates it will heal them sniper not the fish cod sniper you probably want the darwins danger shield i think its that one and that will replace your melee but have it so spies cant backstab you scout runs 2x as fast as everyone else has a double jump triple jump if you use the nukacola bat cant remember it and backscatter makes it so that when yknow you hit the back of your enemies it crits soldier his rocket launcher can be used to rocket jump to get to places that the other classes wouldnt really be able to get to pyro can airblast using rightclick to blow away explosives or can use soldiers rockets to rocketjump himself engineer best class can setup a sentry which fires when any enemy is in range might want to protect it against spies though you want to hide it around corners and his dispenser can give him and his teammates ammo health and metal metal only for him and his teleporter to teleport to where the exit has been put so say your entrance got put in a shack near where you spawned and you put the exit all the way across the map in a tiny patch of grass behind a building you would be able to get behind the enemies spawn better spy he has a few different watches which allow him to go invisible such as the cloak and dagger you can stand in one spot to regen watch time and be pretty much infinitely invisible the dead ringer anytime you get shot or damaged you turn invisble and leave behind a decoy dead body and the normal watches and the spy has his sapper and knife the knife instakills with a backstab and the sapper destroys the engineers buildings over time demo or demoman has a grenade launcher from which can be used to launch around corners at the enemy team or the enemy engineers buildings and a sticky grenade launcher which can be blown away by the pyro i recommend setting sticky grenades up at the start of the match on the exit frames and of course melee owo this is the hardest ive worked in my life jk

stupidly fun

you get hats you sell hats for more hats it is a vicious cycle once you get more hats you sell those for more hats hats are everywhere all hail gaben the lord of savings all hail valve the lords of hats edit i might play it once in a while but it isnt good anymore valve is running out of ideas soon tf2 will die out and valve will lose their highest engrossing product perhaps if it goes back to the old school way itll get a lot more popular saddens me that it has become this 2nd edit okay so i kinda lied ill only go back is i am playing with a friend or freak fortress

a great first person shooter with comic look and interesting weapons and a creative and big community in the first hundred hours you learn to play the game on regular servers find new weapons you will test and recognize that not always more damge  better enough of these matches how about a bit coop mann vs machine you can upgrade the weapons you learned to love and kill waves of robots with some friends or other tf2 players you can make bonds with i still have a lot of the players i met as friends on my friendlist done more than enough of these two but wait there is more have fun with community made mods like zombie fortress versus saxton hale parcour fortress death runthere is so more to find you got that good that the public servers are starting to bore you get into competetive and meet highly skilled players along your way build a team and learn how strong the team aspect of team fortress really can be want some special items there is a whole big community based on trading in tf2 look around and youll find players trading the stuff you want to have please inform yourself about what items are worth before starting to trade many items you find may not be as valuable as some items you want and dont trade away unusuals for any weapons every unusual is worth more than 1000 weapons no matter which weapons i warned you all in all great game many possibilities and a lot the community has to offer

let me just tell you this game is euphoric from the free to play novices donning their wonderful gibuses and mercenary badges with dates less than a month prior to the phlog pyros to the 8 snipers on a payload offense all the way down to 5 plebtier spies pursuing a single heavy for 10 minutes all of this just draws you in via amazement all of the 9 classes in the game and dozens and dozens of weapons are simply there to pull in you in for the real purpose of the game hat simulation after playing the game for a few months you are bound to purchase more than just the 5 dollars you wasted to get a premium account now you are beginning to put yourself in debt as there was a sunbeams fedora on the market that you had to have in order to attain maximum euphoria alongside your fellow brony friends although the review has indeed been negative to this point you will meet some amazing people and experience some wonderful moments along the wanderlust that is tf2 and by the end of the road you will have over 3k hours clocked and have over 2 thousand of your parents dollars logged in cancerous unusuals i am just a lone wanderer in the massive journey that is team fortress 2

first off i want to start by saying that i have had quite a lot of experience with this game and all the different mechanics in it which make it very interesting tf2 really isnt just your ordinary shootandrun game it has much more to it than just aiming a gun and pressing m1 the classes are what really make the game stand out of the crowd classes are divided in to three different types offensive classes defensive classes and support classes im going to go through all of the different classes and their purposes in the game offensive classes the scout hes fast and effective at doing objectives double jumps and speed make him move quite unexpectedly he might be fast and do good damage but he is quite weak equipped with a scattergun a pistol and a baseball bat the soldier hes slow but deals quite a big splash damage with his rockets he has quite a lot of health so he can take quite big hits as well equipped with a rocket launcher a shotgun and a shovel the pyro its quite self explanatory with the name pyro does a lot of damage with its close range flame thrower and can also airblast enemy projectiles rockets grenades sticky bombs equipped with a flame thrower a shotgun and a fire axe ironically defensive classes the demoman he is a drunk black scottish man with one eye demoman is the class who uses explosives much like the soldier he can also take a big hit but not as well as the soldier equipped with a grenade launcher a stickybomb launcher the bombs stick to walls and are detonatable and a bottle the heavy a big man with a big gun and a big russian accent hes the most tanky class in the game and has a freaking minigun be wary though he is very slow and usually depends on having a medic equipped with a freakin minigun a shotgun and his bare freakin fists you really wouldnt want to mess with him the engineer hes one of the more unique classes in the game he can build an automatic sentry gun that shoots at enemies a dispenser which gives him and teammates health and ammo and a teleporter to get your comrades faster to the frontlines when an engineer is good it is a game changer definitely equipped with a shotgun a pistol a wrench and a construction and destruction pda support classes the medic hes the one who is responsible of keeping the whole team alive and you should definitely protect him hes a german doctor who might be a bit on the crazy side equipped with syringe gun ouch a medi gun a gun that is used to put a healing beam on your teammates and a bonesaw the sniper he can quite easily pin down key enemy targets like heavies from a long distance but is also quite weak and vulnerable to spies this australian man is effective in long range but starts to get less effective when in close range combat since the sniper doesnt have much health equipped with a sniper rifle an smg and a kukri the spy a lady killer figuratively and a man killer literally the spy is a stealth class who can get behind enemies turn invisible disguise as other players disable and destroy engineer buildings and effectively kill unaware enemies with one stab in the back definitely one of the more interesting classes equipped with a revolver a butterfly knife a disguise kit an invisibility watch and a sapper i would also like to point out that this game has had an unusually long lifespan its been over 7 years since the release of the game and people still play this actively although the economy has went down the shitter i was thinking of typing about the different types of unlockable weapons in the game but this is already a really long review in itself so ill let you guys look into them yourselves if you want to play an fpsshooter thats out of the norm tf2 would definitely be something i would recommend its free and fun phewh its been quite a job writing all this lastly i would like to state that this is my favourite game of all time and i hope you guys found this review interesting and or helpful go out and play this awesome game for free peace

so team fortress 2 is a game that is free to play and offers a fun user experience to people of a large age range tf2 gives players the choice to play with friends and have a good laugh or even take it to the next level with competitive gaming one thing which i love about team fortress 2 is that almost everyone is happy to play with you and that some items in the game are created by our online community this gives people the chance to display their own creations and hopefully bring them to life in game tf2 is more of a relaxed game and does not require you to be good at first person shooters this is because there is a class suited to every style of play if you prefer to stealth and be hidden then the spy is for you however if you having a bad day and you cant concentrate why not throw out some flames with the pyros flamethrower which requires no practice to use there is also a large amount of different gamemodes on tf2 such as pushing a large bomb into the enemys base or even sending a rocket into space if your a relaxed person looking for a bit of fun with a game that is not full of try harding people then tf2 is definatly for you i highly recomend it  happy gaming

what to heck why you no play this game a very casual and sometimes competitive first person shooter based around hats and dancing i recommend this game to those who love casual first person shooters however for those who want reasons not to play this game i would have to say that this game sometimes suffers the occasional stalemate forcing a slow and very drawn out round there also suffers the problem doesnt bother me of the cartoonlike graphics very fun overall rating 8910

team fortress 2 is really fun multyplayer game there are 9 classes and all of them have balance like heavy has a lot of health but he is really slow and really big target on the battlefield sniper is verry good at long range but he is verry weak in close range pyro is verry good at close range but weak at long range ect in tf2 there are weapons that you can get by random drop buy them from mann co store craft them or trade them all weapons have balance no weapons are opif there is a op weapon its going to get a nerf they have good sides and bad sides like frontier justice you gain revenge crits but you have no random critical hits and smaller clip size tomislav minigun has faster spin up time but has slower fireing speed in tf2 there is so mutch teamwork one team is probably going to lose if they have only one class on a team or if they dont have a medic or if they have 6 snipers and no engineers to defend overall this game is great and its free so if you are reading this on computer that you own why dont you download the game btw sorry for my english

you cant go wrong with this title not only is it fun but it is ridiculously varied valve has worked on this game with additions and fixes since its launch so it has undergone a lot of changes and it barely resembles what it was when it first launched if you get into it now sadly youre probably going to have a hard time understanding whats going on under all that cluster of weapons hats and whatnot but even though it became such a chaotic mess team fortress 2 remains my favorite teambased fps of all time you have lots of options with every class thanks to the sheer number of weapons available to them each one is balanced and focused on a specific role so youre bound to find one that fits your gameplay preferences like a glove dont like being an useless sniper who stands way back away from the action fine get up close and go with a bow your team needs a strong offense in order to fend off enemy attacks and youre playing as a medic switch from the normal medigun which confers limited invincibility to a kritzkrieg for guaranteed crits no problem are you so pro with your aim that you feel disgusted using the stock rocket launcher as a soldier or grenade launcher as a demoman no problemo use the direct hit or lochnload to show off your mad skillz and deal more damage as a result of your prowess do you love being a soldier but feel a glorious desire to help your team with temporary buffs okay give up your shotgun and go with a buff banner concheror or battalions backup so you can help everyone push with increased damage increased speed or increased defense depending on your equipment of choice there are a lot of options available to you its simply amazing what this game offers plus since it became f2p there is no reason not to try it get it now

you want a review well even if you didnt im giving you one anyways tf2 is not like most fps games let alone one that is free to play tf2 is the sequel to a game known as team fortress classic a mod using the unreal tournament engine blah blah blah historical stuff i prolly got wrong anyways tf2 is quite simply an amazing game with 9 different classes each with their own unique roles in a successful match 1 scout he runs fast capping intel capping control points and pushing the bomb cart with the power of 2 people warning since he runs so fast and has a double jump allowing for high evasiveness hes also pretty squishy having a measly 125 base health 2 soldier soldier is a powerhouse holding 200 base health and a rocket launcher that deals splash damage to multiple enemies his rocket jumping ability though this takes a lot of practice to fully master can get him to the point even faster than a scout 3 pyro the most controversial class having 175 base health mediumpaced walking speed and a shortranged based primary the flamethrower pyro can be seen as the weakest class while most newbies would complain to him being an overpowered fire demon here to eat your babies they really just dont know how easy it is to counter her one second though pyro can airblast projectiles and extinguish burning teammates by using m2 or mouse 2 4 demoman arguably the most powerful class in the game demoman is here to bring diversity to the game yknow because hes scottish anyways demoman while having the same 175 health as pyro has one distinct advantage the stickybomb launcher this bad boy does 60 damage per sticky meaning that spamming it on a public game makes you a bad player that should go back to playing minecraft and the hundredth jumpscare game pewdiepie just played 5 heavy also considered one of the weakest in the game especially without a medic latched onto him 247 heavy is the mascot for tf2 this bald bear wrestling russian giant shows none of his ruthlessness in the game but rather the comics which even then he realy kind of doesnt heavy has 300 health wow you must think until you learn his disadvantages he is the slowest and has the largest hitbox in the game making him easy to pick off from afar 6 medic oh boy medic is the second fastest class in the game just after scout he also has 150 base healthyour codwashed mind might think hey wheres his souper smg ding well thats because tf2s medic is actually here for healing sure he has a syringe gun which is basically a flamethrower without afterburn but no sane medic would rush into a fight like that as hed die near instantly each class has their own way of dealing 100 damage in one shot though this is mostly up to crits actual skill instead medic uses his medigun a long black healing device that can patch up your teammates wounds in seconds plus when you have full ubercharge you can either have increased healing full invincibility 100% chance of everything your teammate does being a critical hit or a tiny uber that increases your resistance to a certain type of attack and gives you health for the damage the person youre healing recieves 7 engineer engineer builds sentries dispencers and teleporters sentries will guard an area sitting in place waiting for some unsuspecting scout to run in and get blasted away by tons of bullets and rockets when your sentry reaches max level dispencers health and provide ammo for you and your teammates teleporters are capable of sending your teammates from one side of the map to the other however all these buildings require a lot of care as they are susceptable to many attacks and will do no damage to stock ubers the kind that grants full invincibility and since youll probably be taking care of your buildings and aimbot engineer only has 125 health 8 sniper sniper if played right can outdamage demoman even though sniper only has 125 health he has the longest range out of every class what with a sniper rifle and all sniper is the one of the only classes that can kill a fully overhealed heavy in less than 3 seconds the sniper rifle isnt like most sniper rifles in other games having good aim is essential to playing sniper as his main source of damage is getting headshots otherwise hell normally do only 50 damage 9 spy spy is a real sneaky rat he can diguise as any class sap buildings turning them off and eventually destroying them unless the engineer hits and breaks the sapper his main deal is that he can backstab enemies backstabbing someone is always an instant kill with only for a few exceptions tf2 is a great game and i suggest you look into it

im playing tf2 since 2010 and still enjoy it first of all one most important thing about it its 10x more fun when you play with friends heres my top 10 reasons why i love that game 1 you dont need to be great at multiplayer fps games cs quake 3 ut etc to be good at tf2 of course skill reaction and good aim helps but as long as you know your role and if youre playing it smart youre gonna be just fine and theres always something you can figure out or learn to turn things to your advantage 2 it has one of the best and most hilarious characters with hundreds of lines and a lot of space for random accidents that make me lol really hard even after playing it for three years the humor in this game is great and it never gets old 3 a well crafted balance between teams and classes and really great maps unlike most games with good balance this one doesnt make you feel underpowered and pressured to be a real pro or die as a noob in shame im looking at you starcraft when you start to do things right you start to feel how powerful your class is that feel that by doing simple things youre supposed to do is bringing the glorious victory of your team closer every passing second is priceless 4 complexity in simplicity each class has a simple purpose and just few simple tools to accomplish it the complex gameplay of tf2 is made of very simple concepts like rocket launchers hurt people if you get an ubercharge you can use it and make yourself and the guy youre healing invulnerable and push through heavy resistance airblast  alternate fire of your flame thrower is pushing things away players rockets and even arrows also it extinguishes allies and saves them from burning to death spies may look like one of your teammates but act suspiciously smack their face with your wrench and one more simple thing most new players are having a hard time to figur out for some reason engies can actually help other engies to build and defend 5 there are no weak or powerful weapons most weapons are the same as your default weapons except they are slightly better in something and a bit worse in other thing you dont need to know the entire arsenal of the game you just need to find the weapons that are most appealing to your playstile also there are a few weapons change the way you play like engies gunslinger you cant build big fat and mean sentries you build a small minisentry however equipping that thing gives you hp boost and makes you a mobile obnoxious prick who runs around and builds and instantly deploys those annoying mini sentries whenever he feels like 6 most items are cosmetic that means you dont need to have any hats high level or money spent in games store to be effective some weapons that will amplify your strong traits would be a good addition though and those are very easy to get also despite those cosmetic items thanks to the good character design all classes are very distinguishable you always know what to expect from a fat guy with a minigun and you always know you should kill the dude in white coat because he heals others still you can get some cosmetic items and look badass or funny 7 the game is constantly updated every now and then you get new maps modes bug fixes balance fixes weapons and cosmetics sadly valve gets more lazy and greedy with each new major update and makes more hats rather than real content 8 they got it right with graphics i remember playing other modern fps games and that was terrible all those eye candy effects strong contrasts cinematic camera movement realistic shaderslightingeffects poor character design and spectacular explosions were very distracting and were making it really hard to tell whats going on before it would be too late 9 its all about teamplay and mission goal rather than killcount and skill a team of average players who help each other will always be stronger than a team of disorganized showoffs with mad skillz who play their favorite class even when the team needs a medic and engie and dont care about anything but their killcount 10 valve puts a lot of effort each year to make the haloween event in tf2 very very awesome however there are things i dont like in tf2 1 community lots of obnoxious kids trolls pretentious jerks and total s 2 trading i hate it i reallyreally hate it 3 painfully stupid people this game introduced me levels of stupidity i couldnt even imagine 4 bugs there are some really annoying gameplay and performance issues with the game and valve pretends really hard that everything is cool 5 cheaters sometimes there will be some  who will ruin everyones game by flying through walls and spawncamping with 100% accuracy and 100% crits however there are some guys who use not so obvious hacks and claim they knew where you were and hit you from an impossible angle and distance for ten times in a row just because they are so good at this game and youre a stupid butthurt noob 6 server customization finding a server that has good ping vote menu enabled good map list and doesnt have custom music idiotic settings like instant respawn ads or other  are very hard to come by hope this was helpful

short review go and ing download it long review team fortress 2 is definantly the best free to play game out there there are so many different game types in tf2 from ctfmann vs machine and even the hidden you can get any weapon by craftingtrading or finding without using real money although you are limited to a short backpack space as you start off you can easily purchase a 10c item to upgrade to premium and get heaps more spaces even though being released 7 years ago there is always an update around the corner one of the best things about tf2 is that if you get an item which is festivevintage strangegenuine collectors and more you can sell it on the steam market and get real steam credit i know i have got a a lot of moeny from selling my items some people even get 500 of steam credit by selling a rareawesome item i can`t possibly list all the things you can do in tf2 but overall team fortress 2 is the best game ever it even beats all my paid games 
recommended
one of the best free games out there
recommended
team fortress 2 it may be old game but the idea never gets old team fortress 2 is about guns hats and miscs and when you use them all together you may even do money yes you may earn money in team fortress 2 to your steam wallet of course it is also very good as game the mann vs machine vanillas and all other game modes make team fortress 2 one of the most flexible game to play what youre waiting for it is free amazing and for everyone
recommended
i dont have to say anything about this game you probably know about it already and if you dont you live under a rock this is the most amazing fps ive ever played in my life i seriously love this game if you didnt try it out yet get it now oh and if its your first time playing this game dont ever get cosmetics theyll curse you trust me
recommended
easily worth the purchase price

tf2 is an excellent class based fps that has taken over the last few years of my life

great game based off a great engine youll see lots of new things every week from the community and valve the best free to play deal you can find unlike the silly pay to win games whether you like sneaking behind your enemies or burning them down with fire team fortress 2 is a great game
recommended
this game may not have weapon skins but does it really need to i mean come on everyone it has hats what more could we ask for oh wait collectors being bought at half the price they should be being bought at wonderful this game is perfect for you oh right there is some gameplay but who the hell plays tf2 for it well dammit everybody should but its pointless now i swear everyone is going to become a salesman by the age of 13 in 10 years when this game is obviously going to be still relevant
recommended
i only played a little bit but it was fun
recommended
nice game
recommended
shooting people in the torso to make 10 year olds irrationally angry is a once in a lifetime experience
recommended
this game is one of the best free to play games i have ever played and would possibly say that it is the best overall game i have played i do not recommend this game to any call of duty player who thinks they are amazing at games just by playing cod this game will make you angry if you go in hopefull that all of your hours of cod will pay off they wont this game is for the adventurous people who enjoy a community based game what i enjoy about this game is the fact that you can find weapons from enough gameplay time the fact you can craft weapons the achievements the taunts how you can install huds and change in game visuals the range of characters and of course the taunt kills the taunt kills give you a sense of achievement when done on an opposing player because they are very hard to do apart from against lazy snipers overall this game is highly recommended by me and others that i know i would encourage you to download this game  [yt] zyaxitron ed
recommended
this is a very awesome game i will see forward to this game in the future 1010 imo
recommended
let me rename this game a bit  hat collecting simulator 
recommended
team fortress 2 the game where buying vitural hats are more expensive than actually buying them in real life 1010 needs more gibus
recommended
a really funny game to spend time everyone should at least try it 
recommended
okay here are the basic classes a new yorker kid who kills people using baseballs and soda a patriotic dude who jumps by shooting rockets at his feet a pyromaniac who sees the world as rainbows and candy a drunken africanscottish man who blows people up a fat russian who eats sandwiches that heal bullet wounds a texan who builds sentry guns just by opening a damn toolbox a psycho german doctor who heals people bypointing a gun at them an australian who throws jars of urine at people a man in a suit who can magically transform into any of the above and kill people by just stabbing them in the back area in summary i love tf2
recommended
its ok
recommended
very funny game the game never ends and its free
recommended
the good team fortress 2 is not your ordinary game focusing on its cartoony graphics offbeat humor and wide variety of game modes and player classes but it will definitely put some people off if youre a person who likes teambased multiplayer firstpersonshooter video games i think this game is for you the sound in the game is exciting overall together with the visuals its a perfect game you are always updated with new incredible releases last but not very least a very fun and unique shooter with cool mechanics and great teamplay is totally free to play the great the game can be addictive and challenging if you let it the game is very fun with different characters and balanced one of the best games of all time for sure people who call this game or boring dont know much about shooters to be honest each class is a really funny cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality youre not running around with an ak47 or m16 but with syringe guns and sticky bombs its quite hilarious not to mention its great itemdrop system an amazing fanbase and the community they are the perks which keep the players from all over the world to play this game the ugly there is no serious gameplay whatsoever if the developers wanted players to have a real serious gameplay they would have made an ingame system where players get penalized for quitting the game before the match ends face the facts you can disconnect the current game any time you like even in mvm matches perhaps for dynamic joining and disconnecting of players of the current match but it can be frustrating when you spend the whole damn match without stable players gameplay most team fortress 2 game modes have 2 opposing teams the reliable excavation & demolition red and the builders league united blu that compete against each other in various maps to complete certain objectives some game modes include capture the flag each team attempts to steal the opposing teams intelligence briefcase from their headquarters and secure it back at their own base king of the hill a central point must be captured and defended for a set amount of time to win the round payload one team attempts to escort a rail cart filled with explosives to the enemies base team deathmatch a team is able to win a round by killing off the members of the opposing team characters the players on each team must choose a class to play each with their own set of abilities and special weapons medic heals fellow teammates with a medigun that can bercharged to make other players temporarily invincible scout runs very fast and is able to double jump the scout default weapons are a shotgun and baseball bat heavy weapons guy also known as just heavy this is the largest and slowest moving of the classes he wields a minigun and boxing gloves and can recover health by eating sandwiches pyro wears a gas mask and fireproof suit while wielding a flamethrower and fire axe and is best at killing enemies up close engineer can build teleporters sentry guns and dispensers that aid other teammates in battle sniper can kill enemies from far away with his sniper rifle enemies can be killed with one shot if they are hit in the head demoman wields a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher that can be used to kill enemies around corners or lay traps for enemies to run into soldier a rocket launcher equipped brute that is capable of reaching great height by jumping while firing a rocket at the ground spy can disguise themselves as members of the other team and can kill enemies with one hit if they manage to sneak behind them and stab them in the back can sap engineers buildings to quickly destroy them

before this game i used to have a life i think i remember the sun the gentle breeze of summer air the sound of children playing outside outside yeah i remember going out with friends they arent shooting at each other and why no one is wearing a hat poor guys maybe i should give some gifts around but wait what is this strange triangular sandvich here on my hand oh i remember its called pazza pazzi pazzia piazza pizza yes pizza and look at that beautiful sunset thats some serious modding going on here i need to save this moment forever wait where is f5 oh no where is the keypad and the mouse ctrlaltsupr no no what kind of hellish game is this i dont like this character i wanna change where is esc shifttab alttab anything please let me out ill buy more keys ill do whatever you want what is it that you want my wallet my soul the blood of my first born child is all yours but please dont let me trapped here without a tutorial

though my actual ingame hours is closer to 600 hours team fortress 2 tf2 is one of the best firstperson shooters of all time feeling the need to just fool around tf2 is hilariously comical feeling the need to play competitively tf2 has a very high skill cap feel the need for variety tf2 has mounds of variety verdict team fortress 2 is a game where just when you think you have had enough of it it lures you back in and leaves you thinking man i totally love this game
recommended
trembling uhh yes i think this game is amazing aaand could only be improved by adding more weap uuhh i mean hats yes hats the hats are amazing we need more sob you hear a gun cocking read it all please valve we need mmmmore hats if you dont  aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhh i dont want to be killed by a hat

this is a very nice game every time i play it with pleasure 
recommended
i recommend this game to anyone who has never heard of steam before ive been playing tf2 since 2009 and i wish i had instead been playing since the 2007 beta this is a fun game to play and the ability to use sourcemod to create custom plugins to add new features to the game is one of the greatest selling points in my opinion look at all the wonderful gamemodes weve received such as vs saxton hale slender fortress and many others as well being a lover of betaunusedcut content in games and tf2 being jampacked with betaunused contentwell its just plain awesome
recommended
fun that is all
recommended
played it a bit it was fine

team fortress 2 is a unique game in many respects first and foremost being just how much and for how long its been updated while its only recently gone free valve has been supporting the title for years with rather significant content additions and gamebreaking bugs tend to get squashed within hours or days rather then the months that some other companies take with even their flagship titles its also interesting in the fact that you dont actually have to be a living god at firstperson shooters to do well or support your team the engineer and medic help their allies out with their buildings and healing abilities and the hundreds of items available can change any of the classes capabilities significantly and of course the game is infamous for its cosmetic items such as the hats which dont typically provide any real bonus but do allow you to customize your character further you have to play this game and if youre on steam you already own it
recommended
this is supposed to be a review for counterstrike global offensive dedicated server apparently thats not a game i should have known not only can i not play the dedicated server like it is a game i cant review it like one either let me save you some time do not try to play counterstrike global offensive dedicated server it is not a game if you want a comparable nongame open the command prompt that will save you so much downloading its like you have to download all the counterstrike global offensive content but only get to access it through command prompt why sure sure other people can play the game on your computer because youre running a server but all i get is words in a black box who needs that certainly not me getting shot repeatedly in team fortress 2 is much better i would encourage you to play team fortress 2 over something like command prompt simulator for counterstrike global offensive

this is a f2p game in which ive spent and i will spend lot of hours playing isnt a standard fps game because of the amount of funny class available to pick worth the time downloading for sure

take two at a review of this game ill make it quick since its early 2015 now and tf2 has been out for nearly eight years that said its balanced they keep adding things while still keeping it balanced with a few notable exceptions google short circuit heh it has lots of game modes and they keep adding more as wellwith mannpower and its grappling hooks currently in beta there are tons of communitiesmany are mature many are not theres surely at least one for you and youll make friends spend thousands of hours playing the best part is its not an mmoits a real competitive and cooperative fps that you can pick up and put down at any time getting bored of the standard game modes try mod servers versus saxton halefreak fortress 2 are the undisputed kings of the modding scene but theres deathrun prop hunt dodgeball fortwars jailbreak not my thing but meh slender hidden tf2 ware tf2 karts and so much more the tf2 dev team has done plenty to rope people in but its the modders that fill in the gaps with the absurd gameplay variety stemming from nine distinct classes and a player vs player foundation its impossible to get bored of this game also you might see a hat or two and some ducks eating bread
recommended
great game but its mostly hats
recommended
its ok
recommended
team fortress 2 seems like such an understatement when i say i recommend this its probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hours logged on it even though people may not like the hats and new items personally i think thats what keeps this game alive every time the game feels like its getting boring or repetitive they add something new that makes the game feel fresh and fun this is the only game i think id ever give a perfect 1010 because the games always expanding the community on the other hand is quite a lot like the sonic fanbase and ill just leave it at that in conclusion if you havent played this game before do it i cannot stress that enough download it and play it its free but i highly recommend buying something in it at some point in time
recommended
its ok
recommended
a shooter that ages and adapts at its own pace for people experienced in militaryesque shooters like cod or battlefield this game will require you to completely throw out the ideas of those games in favor of more unique gameplay elements aswell as teamwork being much more essential than in your standard shooter tf2 is layered in multiple games within its core shooter design for collectors you can get potentially hundreds or thousands of a specific item and even potentially wield a collectors variant of it for fashionistas you can design and paint your character as you see fit for shooters you can ignore it all and focus on playing even amist the heat of battle your enemy could become your best friend seconds later say youre looking down a hall you see a soldier you blink theres a pyro now too you blink the soldier is now dancing the conga the pyro is now too you run up to them and dance aswell blink both teams are now crowded in a room raving before you know it youre headbutting and hifiving that sniper who kept headshotting you minutes ago in a nutshell why havent you downloaded this yet

team fortress 2 is one of the most fun games i have ever owned its facepaced comedic fps that has a very addicting way of making one want to play more the nine classes scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and spy have their own traits and balances that make the game fun such as backstabbing spy running faster than the other classes scout and being able to rocket jump soldier with tons of different weapons and a random number of classes of the other team each round is never the same so it never gets boring unless one is playing deathrun team fortress 2 is also been known as a hat simulator which it basically is considering the amount of cosmetics that each class can wear one the battlefield their are many different kinds of combinations of hats and miscellanious cosmetics that you never know which kind of combination you can obtain the game has its own humor that the characters create and sometime the game itself will cause something that will make one laugh if one is free to play then one has the choice of being free to play forever or buying something from the tf2 store and becoming premium the game does not force the player to buy something from the store although the downfall to being free to play is that one can not trade with other people and some servers make [f2p] appear at the front of your name but these are just minor things that a player can bypass if all the player wants to do is play the game without the hats and such i fully recomend this game to anyone who wants a fastpaced fps that likes to laugh at the often switch between comedy and intense battle i recommend it even more if you like cosmetics that make your classes look awesome in your own way and the different varieties and stats of weapons that can change one classes health or vulnerability or even strength in damage to me team fortress 2 is my favorite game i have bought on steam today

always on the first favorite game on my library first time trying pyro class and got stuck on it awesome game for try our teamwork to win on battle and have been returned and got bored on pyro class head over my pointer to try scout class with killstreak gun and and its my favorite class till now you cant just go soloing on the arenas you need a great teamwork to get in the good place like in the game title highly recommended this game at all first person shooter sequel would try and should try this game the first thing that you must know from this game is this game was fully for free to play doesnt valuable player can win at once you can just start with item drop to be the great one at battle but im not let me tell some deep thing about this game the grapich and texture on the game already at the top points and depend on how far you can handle it there are two team you can join that is red and blu or bluemostly called it blu many class that you can wanna be like sniper a burner a medic an heavy man a spy class or as a scout bring deadly itself small shotgun and more class that make you into the core many awesome map made by community and official creator a crowded server by player and official server make this game more enjoyable for in random gamer community an stats detail about your gameplay to beat in some records as much as achievement to unlock beat the average players and meet stranger and be a good team all is about shoot and some teamwork require to win i need to say again few fun mode that you can play the game always updated so dont be minded is this game was old and bored like in other day i check up on steamcharts almost got 70k player everyday an active player every hours dont think youre lonely you can start your own story and friendship by just playing this game and be a good person all will accepting you well grab your favorite class and combined item and start chillin with your friend for more fun

tf2 is a good game it is fun in many aspects like characters voices hats maps etc nowadays i just play this game to jump around everything and have some fun in community gamemodes like deathrun surf parkour and fun servers over the years the gameplay of the game has changed valve keeps doing small changes everytime combining those changes the gameplay experience is not the same in my opinion i think the game was more fun and attractive when i played the game for the 1st time small changes like not being able to take your buildings in you hand to the spawn the distinction between the rocket launcher and the rocket jumper small changes to weapons made me abandon most of the competitive gamemodes from valve the only valve gamemode that sometimes i play is mvm and it is getting more bugged whenever a big update is released and its matching system sucks valve added so many hats that i dont even care about them anymore im fine with my old hats i still recommend this game but not as much as i did before
recommended

team fortress 2 is a very decent racing game first of the vehicles in this game are somewhat strange instead of licensed vehicles we get stuff like heavy soldier and scout the vehicles are all different in their own rights for example the heavy is the slowest the scout is the fastest and the medic is normal speed classes in this game seem to be slightly broken however the medic class vehicle is near useless on its own and only serves a purpose when teamed up with a second vehicle this will either serve to slow him down immensely such as when healing a heavy or let the teammate he is healing get away from him because the teammate such as the solider is faster than the medic the level design is beautiful but take two in an attempt to create an immerse and beautiful world forgot that these types of tracks arent really suitable for racing taking place in such areas as underwater in long corridors and intelligence rooms but some of the levels seem to be made for racing such as 2fort but there is no finish line the fun thing is that each vehicle has a weapon to take out the other players of course you can only take players that arent wearing your vehicle colors for example the heavy has a weapon that literally takes out everything in sight except that it slows him down to a halt the pyro has a weapon that sets fire to anyone and anything and so on and so fourth it seems similar to mario kart with the various courses and powerups however it fails to capture the fun of mario kart and instead going in an ultrarealistic direction that often looks quite boring and bland the major flaw in tf2 is that there really is no direction as to where you should be going there are no checkpoints and no wrong way markers valve did include a map that changes between tracks but it is very confusing and really isnt beneficial these maps are nearly identical anyways so changing the maps seemingly randomly only serves to aggravate the players more while the tracks and graphics are fun and creative this racing game is lacking in many ways i wouldnt recommend this game to game owners if they had access to a console as this pconly racer doesnt seem to try hard enough to stand out from the crowd
recommended
better than crack 1010
recommended
my friends always ask what exactly is team fortress 2 i always tell them its like a better more fun call of duty with customization out the wazoo you can pick between classes and all of them are essential to the team you can find weapons hats crates and so much more the community is amazing as well they are the most fun loving funny all around awesome people you could ever meet on the internet go and get this game you wont regret it

i love the game its one of the best free steam games i have ever played and i would recommend this game to any hard core game cause 1 the game is awesome and great  2 you can buy stuff for your favorite class 3 you can enjoy the game online or offline 4 the updates are very big but its worth it at the end cause it gives you new stuff 5 you get stuff that it worth money  free  6 you can pick any 9 classes like heavyscoutsnipersoldierdemomanspymedic and engineers and pyro 7 and there are lots of hats to pick from   only for hardcore gamers 
recommended
team fortress 2 is one of the best free to play games out there with thousands maybe millions of players on right now playing it is really fun and 7 different classes to keep you ocuppied there is scout class fast and can double jump has a very powerful shotgun that can kill an enemy with almost 2 shots there is a soldier class has a rpg very power for taking out large groups of people or destroying sentry guns from long distances there is a pyro class has a flamethrower good for burning large groups of people together and good for taking out surpport classes spies snipers and medics are easy to kill unless they have backup there is a heavy good for leading the way and taking out lots and lots of enemies at once even harder to kill with a medic assisting them and healing them unstoppable when the ubercharger is ready and activates and thats when the heavy is at its best has a big gun and loves it like his own son there is a demoman has a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher lays sticky grenades near doors and waits for a enemy to come through and blows them up which pisses some people off sometimes their grenade launcher is good for corners and hitting the enemies beside the corner and taking them out unlocks a sword and can charge at enemies and can kill them with one shot unless its a heavy there is a engineer which its main weapon is the shotgun and of course its mechanical tools to help kill the enemies the engineer can make teleporters entrance and exit point a dispencer heals him and friends and a sentry gun which kills and protects a certain area placed in has a limited sight and cannot shoot from far distances all the things can be upgraded to level 3 which is the last and best levels there is a spy has a pistol and knife to backstab enemies quickly and quietly the spy is a quiet and sneaky basterd that pisses off the enemies so they rage quit the game so the friends get a better advantege in life and make their job easier the spy can go invisable and hide from enemies to help make them live longer and hide from enemies who caught them backstabbing their friends and want payback the spy can sap the engineers teleporters both dispencer and the sentry the medic has a needle gun and a ubercharger that heals friends the medic is very important in helping the offensive time if medic and heavy combine and the ubercharger is ready they are invincible and not a force to be reckened with the medic and shoot needles at enemies and when the needles hit the enemies the medic gets 2 health back for every hit the medic gets 2 hp per second as a medic and which no class can do that special ability is to ubercharge and be unstoppable for a short amount of time and finally the sniper the snipers main gun is the sniper rifle its his best weapon and takes out enemies from a far and safe distance one at a time he a submachine gun and is his secondary weapon for medium range combat his machette is for close combat situations if a spy tries to take him out or tries to run away or a enemy comes and it becomes a close combat round the sniper gains focus whenever he keeps his scope in for along time and deals more damage his machette is a powerful weapon and can kill a spy and a scout in 2 hits other classes 3 to 5 hits at least thats all the classes ive covered the maps are amazing and highly detailed and new maps coming in from the community every month new guns being made skins and character customization to personalise your own class to make u unique and one of a kind new abilities for classes and more to come stuff to buy at the tf2 store manco is what its called i think its highly over priced but if u dont have a thing and u want it bad go to the store and buy it dont recommend that when u could just keep playing and wait to unlock it the hard way i better most of the time ok thats covers tf2 hope u like my review and please rate it i give team fortress 2 910 from arcade

when joining a game you have a choice between red and blue usually you dont even have that choice after a while of playing the game forces you to join the loosing team only to get steamrolled by 8 enemies due to the fact that the rest of your team were all gibus wearing machina sniperssometimes you have the opportunity to play against the endless swarm of gibus snipers and kill them again and again and again until they ragequit and get replaced by better people which is so rewarding that i actually recommend this game

i have never seen a game more like call of duty in my life they might as well call this game call of duty noobs n dudes now grant it there are loads of hot dudes in this game that is not enough to make me want to play this game over and over i feel like it is a childish version of call of duty it definitely is nowhere close to as good this game has awful graphics unlike call of duty alright characters and way too many weapons a video game should not have so much customization i want restrictions i think i am just going to stick with call of duty if you like call of duty but cant afford it i recommend getting this game it is pretty much the same exact thing

team fortress 2 the game where everyone loves hats but hates newcomers actual review hello everyone im here to tell ya about tf2 its one of valves biggest games out there maybe not up there in competitiveness like dota or csgo but its more of a game you grab a couple of beers with your friends and just have fun the weapons are not like this stupid reach this level to unlock this op weapon thats meta as all heck no in tf2 you find weapons just through playing the game now some would argue that this is a bad system but to counter this the weapons you start with the stock weapons are the best weapons in the game no downsides on upsides sits completly balanced now in each shooter game you have this generic story about a marine taking on a army or this superpowered soldier but in tf2 there is no single player camapign which might turn you off but what it makes up for is frantic action and hilrious characters seriously tf2 pushes the boundaries of fpscharacters every character in this game is a stereotype like the scout for example hes form boston ergo hes annoying loves baseball and is generally really cocky but valve made it work so that hes completly funny same with all characters even the mann of espionnage himself the spy theres also holiday themed events like the scream fortress update every halloween smissmass every christmas etc tf2 goes out of its way to have microdlc like hats taunts even the weapons from earlier you can buy but they aint cheap only bad thing i can say about this game is the community they are really hard on new players my advice hop onto the tutorial and do all 4 of them it will give you a general sense of how to play tf2 also sports a coop game mode called mann vs machine its like tower defense except you and 5 other players are defending your base from a bomb that robotic versions of the classes are carrying you can do it for free with your buds or buy a ticket and do tours everyones after the fabelled australium weapons which are golden weapons that go for alot of money so if your willing to have rng hate or love you try it out in conclusion tf2 has so much things modern day fpss dont have if you havent tried tf2 yet what are you doing its free forever go download it maggot
recommended
its good for your soul
recommended
if your life or wallet wasnt ruined by this game you havent played enough
recommended
great game so fun trading is awesome too ddd
recommended
for as long as ive been playing team fortress 2 i have never found myself being bored the constant updates and additions keep the game fresh and fun the game is starting to become more of a social experience what with the conga lines and friendly players on opposing teams my only concern however is that team fortress 2 may be rather intimidating to the newer players maybe a bit overwhelming with all of these new cosmetics a vast arsenal of weapons and the ability to turn any bloody battlefield into a parade has changed the face of shooters im afraid that newer players may start playing and will be immediately turned off by either the vast personalities and items or just the overall sillyness regardless tf2 remains a great game over 7 years after its initial launch props to you valve
recommended
well im the conga queen what else should i say new game title conga fortress 2 hat simulator is too great to be ftp in my opinion but enjoy the hell out of it friends
recommended
iz goot

[insert yet another outstanding review for tf2] wait no dont not anymore not since the halloween update gave us no new bosses infinite appearances of merasmus and an event version of the worst map in the game not since the most hyped update ever turned out to be surprise surprise just more hats 1010 scientists would confirm eotl is worse than robotic boogalo not since smissmas gave us 7 festives instead of 9 and crappy festives at that but before then 2010 would spread my wallet wide for gabe
recommended
not even realistic 1010 would waste my money on free2play again
recommended
team fortress 2 is a game set with many gamemodes and various set objectives it is a game based on many god like weapons and hats and miscs d best frwee game evar x3
recommended
this is by far the only fps in my eyes like the only one in the world true there is cod there is battlefield etc and so forth but this game has a charm to it that incredibally fastpaced all action stuff that makes it great and its a free game so really you dont need to worry about wasting like $15 or $200000 honestly if you just got steam you need to try out this game first like need im not kidding go play it
recommended
if you have a steam account but no team fortress 2  httpwwwtf2soundscom2423p%3d3

warning this game is to addictive for the following average gamer if you want to play this game prepare your self for a quest for unusuals and australium weapons which you will never lay your comic holding hands on

recommended
what can i say team fortress 2 so many know it so many love it this is one of those games that changed my outlook in many ways as a followup to a game to a mod its a wonderful experience that truly revolutionized gaming from challenging play to quirky characters a great artstyle and a unique universe and level design tf2 has become a classic in my mind that will forever remain one of my favorite games if it wasnt for tf2 hats may never have been as popular as they are today
recommended
team fortress 2 is the biggest cluster  with strategy i have ever played but i love the trading system in this game you choose teams and a class with a basic set of tools to kill your enemies along with teammates every character has his own backstory and truths valve really really thoguht this through

recommended
basically a good firsttimegame if you want to play shooting games graphics are unique when you compare it to other team vs team games a big shop with a lot of clothing and free weapons makes the game more interesting in a way that the users can get creative and style their own characters nine classes makes the game more challenging and less boring as you can just switch class when you feel like it the videos about the characters and their histories are absolutely terrific and the medic is something you dont see in every game as you heal with a medicgun and shoots with this incredible syringe shooting gun where in other games its often a character with a medicback and often with normal often normal guns or in use of some type of magic also is the game always active with players and new products in store in all is the game catchy and available for everyone 55

recommended
this a very entertaining game that allows you to battle with friends or just anyone by choosing one of nine classes that each has their own pros and cons you will either be on team blue or team red obviously the teams are against eachother and you want to battle the opposing colour there are a variety of game modes to choose from where you must beat the other team you can trade items and there is even a whole currency for this game that is used in trading or when identifying the price of your specified item overall i think this game is great i highly recommend it for people who love action filled games and who love to learn new skills i recommend helping your team out if you would like to win and dont leave them behind team fortress 2 is a great game but is better accomplished as a team rather than a singular person if youve never tried the game i recommend you give it a shot its loaded with entertainment and you might just like it

this is a well made stylized team based first person shooter teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers there are 9 classes to choose from each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team this provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels there are two official modes of play player versus player and mann versus machine player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players within this mode there are different types of maps each type of map has its own objectives for both teams to achieve mann versus machine is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots players collect money from destroyed bots the money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots the pay to play submode mann up gives rewards upon completing a tour in addition to the official modes of play there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as versus saxton hale where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named saxton hale dodge ball where two teams of players playing as pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive zombie mod where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players to name just a few of the many player made mods available in addition to game play players will randomly receive free items from the game some of the free items given out are weapons hats and crates hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class crates can be opened with a key keys can be purchased from the mann co store or from the steam community market or traded for from another player most crates will list which items can be found within them the game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for the game is easy to pick up and play either alone or with friends yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly the dynamics between the different classes weapons play styles skill levels modes and maps provides content for many hours of play i have been playing since november 2007 and i still return to the game on a regular basis

ah classic ol team fortress 2 there really just is nothing like it it has teambased combat unlockable weapons and most important of all hats but forget about that for just a second what makes this game so good the humour of this game is just amazing every class has something nasty to say about each other and you would know what im talking about if you played the game or watched the meet the  trailerteaser series it just makes me smile when i hear a line ive never heard before secondly the teambased combat as with most modern day fpss with the exclusion of the battlefield series somewhat you dont see a lot of team oriented gameplay take for example call of duty its really just a run and gun experience and thats not what teamwork really is about in tf2 though it really requires a good deck of cards for you to win you need to work together to capture the control point get the intelligence push the cart and etc it can get rather intense with either your team or the other team trying to do a push that is one aspect that i love about tf2 next the unlockdrop system with games such as call of duty you need to level up in order to gain new weapons and attachments for your current weapons but with tf2 no need they drop randomly every weapon has its advantages and disadvantages making them virtually balanced either way but do note that these are only sidegrades not overall upgrades from your stock weapons your stock weapons are just as effective as your new weapons but droppable weapons do have stat bonuses and stat drops that your stock weapons do not have every unlockable weapon is suituational to some degree so it is important to plot out which weapon you will use the thing youve been waiting for hats while not all that important hats do add some flair to the game they give you customization options to your class which can often result in a rather spectacular looking player to not only look at but play as but how do you get hats its somewhat complicated really standard unique quality hats drop rather rarely but you can get them from unlocking crates or trading you can get genuine hats by ordering a game that has a special compaign that gives you the hat for free if you buy that game then theres the real meat of this whole hat thing the holy unusual hat yes theyre rare and expensive to obtain but they give you a feeling of satisfaction and achievement once you do get one for the first time especially if you unbox one that is rather hard to do on the first try but hats dont add anything special to the game really same with stranges and killstreak weapons they only track your kills obvious difference is that stranges track your lifetime kills while killstreak weapons count how many kills you got in one life but yes i do recommend this game it is a nice game to play for a few hours and hopefully find something new to do that you never did before

if youre looking for a challenging fps thatll give you hours of competitive gameplay aswell as an unique community and amazingly fun weapons allowing you to get creative look no further team fortress 2 is one of the most fun amazing oneofakind games that ive played not alone does the 9 different classes grow on you the game itself is amazing featuring unique fun gamemodes as payload or atkdef if youre not conviced just yet the game allows you to customize your classes with hats and miscs community created aswelll as valves own all in all team fortress is by the community for the community now i understand if you find looking at people and clicking hard or cook that grenade just right but in team fortress 2 you dont nessecarily have to theres much more to the game than just being the first to draw fire heck there aint even that many guns to top it all off its free you might think ah then its a paytowin and youd be absolutely wrong with the unique drop system youll be sure to aquire new firearms by the end of the day if not a hat or two

team fortress 2 it is for litterally everybody the community is one of the best ive ever seen and is contsantly putting more into the game the mods and things are great but why do people like tf2 then the game itself is not only free but has hats i know what youre thinking hats in a shooter thats obsurd but it works i dont think im the only one who thinks this game is not only helping steam but valve as a whole they make money off of hats and the market and we have awesome looking hatsweapons that are fairly balanced and have fun it is truly the winwin situation at hand keep making great games valve

wow much hats much skill much unusuals buy much more keys much metal much trading economy much never forget much recommend
recommended
its ok i guess

lets start with the fact that i have never write any review so dont be too harash with mine please team fortress 2 what can be said about this game some people might just look at it and say regular fps you play with maybe even 100 people a day and shoot to win or is it what i like mostly about tf2 is the fact that everything there is build on the teamwork after all this is called team fortress 2 not deathmatch fortress 2 playing as a lone wolf will lead you to no where and even eventually make you rage quit from playing this game for good its not about your high score or how many kills you get at the end of the round altough it still motivate you to fight more and shows that you are the experienced player to others its all about doing the objective together with your team to win the game and every new game there is completely different than previous one so working together as a team is really important with every challenge that comes with every new game mode team members and map the game is going on of course so we already know this game is all about team work and doing current game objective got it good and keep it that way lets go with the next thing  weapons even though theres not many of them as the cosmetic items that would be something theres still a lot of them to pick and choose from and most of the weapons usually change to way of playing your current class so it makes the game even more interesting and challenging we have weapons that heal or overheal you on killing your opponent slow down enemies who are shot gives you speed boost hurt enemy after attacking him the list is long every weapon have its pros and cons so everyone can choose try out every weapon and stick with it as this style of fighting with it fits him most thus makes your gameplay completely different everytime you join on a random server with new random people more guns  more fun check them out and find your style thats our conclusion here one tip though  every time you will get a new weapon dont think you have advanced to a next level or something and this new weapon is way better than the previous one carry on classes youre playing there are 9 playable classes in game avalible from the beggining so theres no any this class avalible after reaching that level no you can play as who do you want from the beggining so you can try out every game style and see which one fits you most as with every class youre playing completely diffrently than with previous one so the classes are scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and my favourite spy every class have its pros and cons just like the weapons you can get so the choice of your favourite one are a little easier for example  scout is the fastest one of all the classes can make double jumps and even capture points 2 times faster than anyone else but he is really easy to kill in battle unless youre good at dodging incomming spam of bullets and rockets much better for a frontal attack are classes like soldier armed with his rocket launcher and the possibility to do a rocket jump to help him reach bigger distances in a short time due to the fact hes really slow but thats just a short example of everything that each class is avalible of and honestly too lazy to write down all of them thats all meh worth to mention that every class have its own personality which makes them a bit more cooler and interesting to play with another example fine scout is pretty much kind of a cocky guy who likes to annoy others and think that every girl wants him and every guy wish to be like him soldier is a stereotypical example of an american patriot who most likely lost all his brain cells durning ww2 heavy is a very calm and serious guy until his minigun starts to spin and the battle starts then hes like a wild angry bear that hates people and so it goes as well with the other 6 classes so 9 different mercs for a usually 1224 teams sounds cool because it is that is until most of them are only spies or snipers exactly most of the players think that this game is like cod  thus they go full sniper force believing they have nailed everything no no no this game is nothing like cod a team full of snipers will never win i was once in a team where out of 10 players we had 8 snipers one spy and a soldier which was me so i think you can say how that round went inb4 mlg jokes so what i mean is  teamwork is important we know that but when theres not enough classes that will provide enough firepower for the team the teamwork wont help you much or does not exist there at all okay time to move on to hats this is something completely random that makes this game unique in this game you can wear on every class a nice and fancy hat or other cosmetic that will make you look diffrent from the others heres my question  can you wear a hat in every other fps than team fortress 2 no or dance conga of course not or being a total annoying brat and taunting after every kill no matter how much skill you put into your kill of course not another reason why tf2 is so unique and why we love it so much okay slowly getting tired of thinking what to poot here so conclusion time team fortress 2 is an awesome game unique in her own beautiful way and great to play i recommend playing it together with your friends but they have no money this games free just download learn how to play and get good the only thing that makes me really angry about this game are most of the time unbalanced teams the autobalance curse in the worst possible moment of the round or the fact the prices are getting higer in its shop

team fortress 2 is a popular f2p fps over the country this game is actually one of the best game valve ever made im not saying that this game is the best one among all the games that valve made the only thing players love about this game are hats yes hats the economy of team fortress 2 will be hats ans cosmectics why not weapons you said well it is very difficult to have a new weapon because of the weapons stats and when a weapon goes wrong the game will not be balanced making this unfair so i know some of the players in team fortress 2 just focus on weapons and not focusing on hats and they just quit team fortress 2 i know a lot of players did this because who doesnt want new weapons now valve are now looking into the steam workshop of team fortress 2 to find new weapons for the game and even hats every damn time yes youre actually playing the future hat simulator when i first played team fortress 2 around 2008 i forgot where i started playing it but nevermind just stick to around 2008 this game is well optimized but it sucks up a lot of your cpu usage though this game is well optimized i said again i mean most maps are smooth making you having a good fps well valve is actually a big company due to popular fun optimized game and etc the graphics in this game looks cartoonish and when the graphic settings are all low the game will still run the graphic to pretty i know that graphics doesnt make a game better only story does oh and i forgot to mention that this game has a story just check their wiki and read the comics the story wont show up ingame and lets get back to the graphic i last said the graphic looks cartoonish i mean who doesnt like cartoonish graphics trust me its beautiful just like the borderlands series its cartoonish there are 9 classes in this game scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper spy the scout focus on speed and agility and scout captures control point x2 faster the soldier focus on dps by using his rocket launcher very useful on a pocket medic the pyro will uses his or her flamethrower to start a fire to the enemy for afterburn damage demoman will focus on defense and offense with his stickybomb launcher due to the dps or he can focus on melee or demoknight for short the heavy is the tank hes also good at being a pocket and also wield a minigun but the damage isnt high the engineer focuses on defending and uses his sentry gun to defend points he can also equip the gunslinger to build minisentry and also becoming offensive engineer the engineer can use his shotgun or pistol to deal with enemies instead of his sentry doing it the medic focuses on support the medic is a must on all team due to healing and ubercharge the sniper also a support class the sniper stays back front of the battlefield to support his teammates and lastly the spy he is very mysterious you wont know he is behind you or not you better watch out his backstabbing skills and also watch out for your fake teammates the spy can disguise as your teammate and act like them so watch out after a lot of hours playing this game i should like to rate 1010 amazing

best hat simulator game i have played so far here is why  you get 9 choices of hat modelers from different ethnicities the russian and german models are probably the worst models because they dont wear a default hat  you get a lot of different locational maps to model you hat in best with western hat modeling  you can team up with others in what i assume are competitive hat modeling competitions like capture the hat control hat king of the hat mann vs hatted robots hatload and hatted delivery  super cheap hats in the games hat store $1299 for a bubble pipe hat what a steal i think they should increase these prices or they might run out items i already bought this item 26 times in case they ever do run out of hats some things i did not like about the simulator  you get these weird metal hats drops called weapons which you cant even wear on your head they only go in your hands what idiotic developer decided that putting hats on their hands is a good idea there only real use in the game is to be crafted into scrap hat metal which you can then trade in for real hats

team fortress 2 is one of the best games i have ever played it is addicting fun and 100% free the class based gameplay encourages smart teamwork and class balence and the random drop tf2 as rewards you with free items to play with there is no paywalling in this game you can be free to play and it will not affect your gameplay whatsoever becoming premium however brings the tf2 experience to a new level becoming premium is optional but it gives you many priviledges such as an exended random drop and the ability to get hats through craft or drop there is no downsids to this game other than the troller kids spamming mics and mini sentries otherwise excellent game

probably one of the greatest time and money sinks that valve has ever come up with  other than steam itself  team fortress still holds up years after its original release regardless of what anyone is telling you yes the hats start to get annoying and sometimes just a bit too flashy but it still retains a brand of humor that is wholly unique in what it does for those unfamiliar tf2 is a class based shooter based on the team fortress mod for quake and team fortress classic which was a mod for the original source engine a cbs is commonly a firstperson shooter such as enemy territory battlefield and battlefront although some cbs titles like battle of heros is a thirdperson shooter tf2 is the former unlike the example titles however both teams are exactly the same and neither side has any kind of special unit or weapon thats only available for that side unlike battlefront giving each of the four factions a unique unit with unique weapons there are nine classes in total scout pyro soldier demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and spy this is also quite a few more classes than some other game have had again as an example battlefront had only six classes per team and some battlefield titles such as hardline only have four classes although it is a lot of classes each one carries a bit of weight and can be very important to a team although in general play teams will have multiple members of each class and some cases one class will not even exist during a game the scout is a fast moving class that can get in close with a shotgun and blast enemies at close range and then quickly pull out to evade a counterattack the soldier while slow moving is armed with a very powerful rocket launcher the pyro moves fairly quickly and needs to get close to make use of his flamethrower these are considered to be the offensive classes and are meant to push for an objective the demoman can create explosive traps with sticky bombs and has excellent melee capabilities the heavy wields a minigun and has a very high amount of health which makes up for his slow walk the engineer can build ammunition dispensers and automated turrets which will shoot any nearby enemies these are the defensive classes and are used to hold a position although heavies when paired with a medic can also turn into a menacing offensive force the medic as the name suggests heals teammates in the thick of battle snipers again as the name suggests use a sniper rifle to pick off enemies from a safe distance spies can cloak themselves and get behind enemy lines to take out deadly players with a swift onehitkill backstab with a knife these are the support classes and are meant to help the rest of the team succeed as mentioned this game has objective based gameplay such as capturing points stealing intelligence capture the flag king of the hill and several kinds of demolition based missions so probably not as advanced as an enemy territory game but probably a bit more mission related flesh than a battlefront game so if you like team based class shooters give tf2 a try the base game is free and the cosmetics are optional there are a lot of extra weapons available to all players and new content is added semi regularly though mostly in the form of cosmetics sometimes new weapons are added too also the community is still quite large and community servers host a barrage of custom maps and content that can enhance the experience

alright first review ive ever done so ignore incorrect spelling if you can right so off the bat i adored the art style and the gameplay but the gameplay was way overwhelming for me at first the good thing is that i wanted to join in be more of a team player so i started playing more to gain more experience in how to basically as some might say get good at this game its really enjoyable and with updates every now and then it stays fresh fun and the community are always welcome id say that this game is the one that everyone should have a go at and if its your kinda cake then pick up a slice place it next to your sandvich and get your lunchbox to the battle field and place a dispenser here its go time

this game is ok i guess

while highly addictive and extremely enjoyable this game does have its issues but lets focus on the positives for now unique gameplay insane weapons amazing class variety witty and sarcastic domination lines interactions between classes hilarity ensues this game offers a variety of gamemodes such as payload control points and more you can play as a range of classes from a fast paced accurate scouter to a super slow powerful heavy weapons specialist from a pyromaniac suffering from schizophrenia to a stealthy wine connoisieur with a sharp knife and sharper wit the downsides oh the downsides this game is a total wallet robber over 3 for an ingame weapon of which there are many or you can spend hours and hours playing the game for a chance to get a weapon which by the way that weapon probably wont be what you want the mann co store is a total ripoff next mann up mode is also a ripoff 59p to play one match which you have to complete multiple matches to win anything decent and again that thing wont be what you want it to be in total while this game is a money stealer it is great fun my suggestion play pvp casually getting into this game competitively will bankrupt you

team fortress 2 is at heart a gloriously simple game thats been created with style panache and an undeniable love of gaming its the kind of game that you want to show to people who dont play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away there is life before team fortress 2 and there is life after after is better
recommended
it is the good game

once upon a time in a far away swamp there lived an ornery game named team fortress 2 whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying freetoplayers there are blind mice in his food a big bad wolf in his bed three little homeless pigs and more all banished from their kingdom by the evil squeakers determined to save their homenot to mention his ownteam fortress 2 cuts a deal with squeakers and sets out to rescue the beautiful hats to be the squeakers bride accompanying him on his mission is wisecracking freetoplay who will do anything for unusuals except shut up rescuing the hats from a new trader may prove the least of their problems when the deep dark secret it has been keeping is revealed

when i reached 1000 hours and finally asked myself what am i doing with my life it was too late tf2 sucked my money time studies everything now i do nothing more than spend all day sitting in front of my computer playing tf2 dont play this game for your own good
recommended
its the most played free to play game besides dota on steam and its made by valve what could go wrong
recommended
ever since i originally bought tf2 i fell in love with it straight away i am still in love with the game its an absolutley amazing game i would seriously reccomend it to anyone who is into fps games i love mann up mge pubbing and lots more its free its worth buying something to become premium this is a serious reccomend for me
recommended
i was only nine years old when it happened i loved valve so much i had all the merchandise and movies everynight i would pray to gaben gaben is love i say gaben is life my dad overheard me and calls me a n00b i call him a console peasent he slaps me and sends me to bed its cold now and my face hurts i feel a warmth come towards me it gaben i was so happy he kneels down beside me and hands me a game called team fortress 2 i begin to play it i see that everyone is wearing hats i buy some and gaben lets out a mighty roar my dad walks in and sees gaben your wallets empty now he flies out of my window gaben is love gaben is life 1110 supah mlg

i actually quit playing videogames around the time i started high school but then a few years later i was introduced to steam and only wanted to try playing tf2 because all my close friends had it all my friends in real life have stopped playing but to make a long story short im addicted to be completely honest about my recommendation though id change the metascore to 100100 if i had the ability to
recommended
this game is asome i give it 5 stars better than tf1 yea thats rit theres a tf1 by the way its rlly a mod for the first half life ikr
recommended
a fantastic game that has no competition in the first person shooter genre there is nothing like team fortress 2 its frantic class based multiplayer combat is unmatched i can only imagine that there will never be anything exactly like team fortress 2 ever again even team fortress 3 would not quite be the same i have spent many hours playing team fortress 2 time and time again i return to play it no matter what the game play never gets old for me every match is against different players with different play styles and different strategies if for any reason you still have not played it now is your time to try it especially since it is free to play forever while there is an item system the default weapons are definitely the best in most combat situations hats are purely cosmetic and have no change on the game they only change how you look i give team fortress 2 10 out of 10 hopefully the community stays strong for a long time to come it has been strong since 2007 and still going

now what can i say about team fortress 2 well first of all they have made it now free to play which is excellent this game is mostly responsible for ruining my life and also the millions of my dog ate my homework excuses was because of this game yet i still play it but why well thats the fact cause it is a addicting first  person shooter with a cartoonish style valve has made this game for a reason to kill things and thats what everbody loves rating 1010

awesome class based game

recommended
i got tf2 last year some time and have been playing ever since you may not think 100 hours is much but it is seen as tho i play so much minecraft anyway i would reccomend tf2 to anyone because it is a really fun free to play game i found the tutorials on how to play very easy to understand the tutorials consist of being a certain character and going through what weapons they have and what they do once gone through the tutorial i went on to mulitiplayer the multiplayer of tf2 is faultless with countless amount of servers to choose from all having different aims like capture the point or team death match etc you may be thinking to get better weapons you will have to buy them in the store like in other games well thats not the case as you find items while playing which you can use or trade with others making it ideal for all gamers no matter there budget graphics side tf2 has decent graphics with a low to zero lag experience if you like third person shooters tf2 is for you 1010

if you want to waste money then this game is for you p
recommended
this is a very good and awesome gameyou guys should play this game
recommended
ive decided to quickly just edit my joke review to provide a better idea of how the game is tf2 is a brilliant game theres no denying that ive been playing this game nonstop for almost two years now however while it is a fantastic game the overall quality of updates and morale in the community has been dropping quite a bit since i joined many players are now looking towards two possible solutions to the lack of proper updates 1 move over to blizzards upcoming game overwatch 2 pray that valve is just holding off on content until the release of source 2 tf2 currently runs on the source engine in case you didnt know the game is free so i suggest you at least give it a go however do keep in mind that there were better times than this which i sadly never got to experience its also important to note that the game might be near death in the near future if valve doesnt pick up the pace a bit edit competitive matchmaking was confirmed doubt the game is going to die anytime soon jump aboard the hype train
recommended
holy  is this game good my experience with tf2 has been a rollercoaster awesome and not that awesome almost quitting to getting my first 1k kills on a strange weapon d tf2 is so diversed with so incredibly many ways to play you will be hooked straight in with its addictive multiplayer action all day long forgetting of time this game has a alot of potential and you should try this out right now this instant this game does have some downsides random unfair crits unfair playstyles the market has been turning  and lack of new stuff at the moment the good sides are u dont need microtransactions to look goodu can craft hats with ref as a fp2 there are lots of fun ways to play the gametons of weapons this is as i said earlier not a pay to play game in any waynew weapons drop randomly so you dont have to buy them those were just some of the good things about tf2 i highly recommend this game download now and have fun
recommended
been playing this game fot about a year now and it is a great game not much to say about it other than that tbh valve keep it going itll do you good
recommended
hey random watch out theres a super subjective review ahead after over 3000 hours of playtime in this game i can surely say that it is one of the best games i have played yet the 9 classes numerous maps many gamemodes and huge number of weapons in the game just make this a superdiverse game and very enjoyable to play once you figured out how to play it looking at tf2 from an outsiders perspective its free2play first downside it doesnt look too serious theres are a ton of cosmetics and you can buy stuff from a store seems pretty much like a pay2win game right well it isnt cosmetical items all only have visual effects on your character and dont matter weapons however do all have diffrent sometimes even completely classchanging stats which may or may not be usefull depending on the situation you are in stockweapons being the most realiable ones in pretty much every situation you get weapons through itemdrops there are around 7 itemdrops per week the counter resetting on thursdays so there you go you can get all the items except some special ones that have diffrent visuals but otherwise are just reskins of their normal counterparts through just playing the game it might take you some time of course but i think that being overwhelmed by all the unlocks and not knowing what they do as a starter could more easily lead to frustration than getting them after each other and checking out what they do then deciding if they are usefull or not psst you can also find hats gameplaywise its a pretty fun experience occasionally annoying randomcrits and some unbalanced weapons aside and you can actually have a blast playing it with your friends tf2 has a class for every type of player theres a stealthguy theres a sniperdude theres some big slow guy with a freaking minigun theres some really fast dude and so on also its like i mentioned before free2play so whenever you are bored why not jump into the game with some friends have fun for an hour or 2 and quit the game without having spent any money actually if you get further interested in the game it also has a competitive side to it the skill ceiling is incredibly high i myself for example have only managed to be semigood at one of the nine classes and am not able to play in a competitive division higher than steel one of the worst even with my 3000 hours of playing the game yes there are people like me that take that game serious and you know what its amazing to play in a team of nice people and try your heart out just to lose because of teams that actually know what they are doing wrecking you you cant blame it on unfair unlocks or randomcrits either both arent existent in comp summary good many maps classes gamemodes weapons for alot of variety actually not pay2win pay2lookgood instead huge trading community if you are good you can trade your way up and own virtual items with real world value enjoyable competitive formats go to playcomptf to get more info playstyles for everyone visually appealing artstyle alot of mechanics features amazing fun hilarious moments and people falling off cliffs bad some unbalanced weapons though counterable with an ounce of coordination occasionally annoying randomcrits random critical hits hard to get into all the diffrent mechanics at start actually pretty badly optimized all the updates made the game run slow on casual machines as a free2play you only have 50 backpack slots any kind of investment in the store however which start at a few cents increases your backpack size to 300 slots defenitely enough ps theres quite some stuff i havent actually talked about like the actually challenging coop missions in mvm and community created gamemodes and maps go ahead and boot up the game in order to have a nice time d

this game is the best thing since sliced bread in fact its better than sliced bread because it has sliced bread see sandvich the only problem is that sliced bread doesnt have a 7 gb file size which is annoying especially if you have a 10gb broadband allowance bt will chase you with a shotgun but the months in hospital are worth it until you realise your hub is crap still 1010 though because engies arent affected by lag or the laws of physics yeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw

this game oh gods this game oh you only have nine classes and you dont even get unlocks that are better than beginner weapons what reason is there to play words can not lend this game justice that 75gb that was spent downloading this game it was definitely put to good use you see other people playing and its all this game is sh but when you actually play it you dont even notice the minutes tick by its like a hypnosismachine but with more gun the only gripe i can really give to this game is that it uses a lot of internet data then again what good online game doesnt aaargh i couldnt encourage you to download this game any more than i am now if you can only barely spare the 75gb download trust me download tf2 you will love it except for those dumbasses who spam the microphone with some dumbass song w

recommended
spy makes me realize to just put a mask in your face and act the right guy for the right person you are deceiving and that applies in real life its a helpful skill you can apply to your friends and family because you can make a fake copy of yourself that you will show to your family and friends for what they want you to be the game is great and makes you know whats right and wrong but seriously you dont know whats right and wrong in this game just blast them because theyre the enemy and shoot your teammates doubting that they are enemies too 1010 would doubt everyone in the team an enemy

team fortress 2 is a great game with a great community what i love about this game is the large variety of styles classes and ways tp play each class not to mention the large amount gamemodes i would recommend this game to anyone who is a gamer 3 love this game

after playing 1000 hours i might do a rewrite of the rewrite of my review stage 1 graphics everyone knows the cartoony graphics of team fortress 2 imo the change from a realistic shooter that team fortress 2 was supposed to be was a good idea the graphics are amazing hd and no lag when at high hopefully tf3 if they actually do make one has the same graphics from the current game that everyone loves rating 1010  beautiful art design stage 2 gameplay and mechanics in the usual fps its simple wasd to move and mouse 1 to shoot and kill everyone to win well in tf2 its much different custom weapons that allow whole new styles to play gamemodes that never get old especially payload and control points and the creative maps no map is the same except for its gameplay mechanics one problem i have with this is they dont have a filter that allows premium players who have higher skill than free to players this causes unbalance in some teams when a team where its mostly free to players and and other team where its highly skilled players always destroy the other team as well as the auto balance it makes people who are about to win then bam the player is now on the losing team but overall the mechanics of the game may have little downsides but never stop people from enjoying the gameplay and different weapons rating 8510 close to amazing final stage community updates and content first ill start with the community the tf2 community is amazing a lot of faithful players who love this game to the very end but it has some flaws free to players these people are so stupid these players cant even listen to direction ive tried coaching and it sucks so much they dont listen to you at all and clueless to what is happening second premium those people are mean in trading they force you to pay more than what its worth they should add rules to trading chatting and other things that can effect new players i hope those who are mean become good and help those who are new and change the way they play second updates the updates are lacking very lacking valve step it up after some updates tf2 is losing their community i mean the eotl was overhyped there was supposed to be new weapons and a new map then valve says the map was too confusing for new players how about rd_asteroid even players who played for a long time dont get cp_steel basically step it up valve finally content there is a lot of content in this game mostly hats they should focus more on weapons than hats that covers most of that but now gamemodes no new game modes for a long time except for mann power but recent players of the gamemode think its bad valve is focusing on hats and bugs rating 1 910\ rating 2 410 overall7110 need a bit of work rating 3 710 overall rating 8610  amazing game
recommended
tf2 is one of the most fun fpss around  great gameplay and fair shooting  no one class or weapon is overpowered  art design is great  map design is great  modes are all fun  coop is fun but costs money  never really gets old or stale  its free  far too many cosmetics that clog up the game and turn it into a dck measuring contest  official ingame store prices for cosmetics are astrinomically high and basically pointless  90% of the servers are trade servers not enough game servers 810 download it you idiot its tf2 its free

very nice and competitive game
recommended
a free to play firstperson shooter with lots of content and an unique art style nine classes each of which plays and feels differently lots of game modes to play hundreds of items to craft or trade ranging from purely cosmetic stuff to different weapons for each class its very easy to jump in and just enjoy yourself ill be honest when i say that the game isnt like it used to be back when i actually played it a lot  but it is a great title nonetheless and being free youve got nothing to lose
recommended
team fortress 2 is handsdown the funnest game for trading and just playing for fun yeah counterstrike is fun but that is more of a competitive game team fortress originially went through many titles and ideas until they came within an idea that idea was having two teams red and blu having nine classes scout soildier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and a spy all these classes were very thought out and disputed like how they are this is one of the best games ever made for millions of people but i would like more cosmedics bug fixes way more sfms etc to conclude this i will be going by saying team fortress 2 is a very fun cartoony style game and i will recommend for any interested people to play thank you for the time reading this
recommended
played it some pretty good hats are important though
recommended
very good game some skill in hand of this  its free to play and premium its fun and not too gory with alot of comedic action but after awhile you could get bumped into many problems for examples  gaben memes no updates people calling u hax if u kill them russians not all of them calling you bylad or when u miss people call you noob but i overall reccomend you do play this game its economy is dying alittle but the gameplay is very good would reccomend to anyone i knowexcept somone named bill cosby

lots of depth every class has its weaknesses and enemy classes as well as strengths when you look a little deeper into the concepts of this game youll see how everything is linked and you need to choose the right class and weapons for every situation too many hats though this takes 12 gigabytes of data on my hard drive and i can assure you its aaallllllllll hat textures and it updates every day _

i havent played much of the game yet but team fortress 2 is an incredibly fun experience that shouldnt be passed up the game follows 9 mercenaries on two teams battling each other to the death in order to complete a certain objective depending on what game mode they are on what really makes the game unique is that each class doesnt seem too highly overpowered like in call of duty or halo each one has their weaknesses and relies on other classes to help them stay alive for example the medic class is designed to heal teammates and occasionally grant them invulnerability to bullets at the expense of a poor arsenal he needs to be protected by the class hes healing because he cant defend for himself very well the engineer class relies on his sentry turret which can be deployed to wreck havoc on enemies trying to invade his base along with this he can deploy a dispenser which grants ammohealth to his team and two teleporters good for helping them get out into battle quickly although he cant be with most of the others fighting on the front line he still helps them immensely with these inventions along with uniquely designed classes the art style of the game is gorgeous in its own way as its not too realistic with a fun cartoon art style the voice actors for each class are hilariously overthetop which adds to the enjoyability of playing as each of them and even if you dont like what they seem to offer theyre still worth a go id defenitely recommend this game to anyone the classes are fun the gameplay is fun and the visuals are even fun id say this is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters you can come across  and its free too
recommended
who doesnt want a hat with fkn flames on it
recommended
addictive and tons of fun great game and hardly lags at all even on crappy computers this game is a must have for any steam player who enjoys fps would be better though if three new classes were made either in a new catagory or a new one to each catagory

i i cant begin to describe how i feel what i feel is that tf2 is dying its hard to admit i still love it but the telltale signs are everywhere youtubers leaving and hell shibby is basically a freaking battlefield 4 youtuber now like seriously what did we do to force him to play the generic military shooter that has been rehashed tf2 was great it still is its one of the most unique and innovative games and well its dying nothing lasts forever tf2 has been around for 19 ish years and theres only a certain point to something you start with a sketch you expand on it draw lines all over the paper fill in the gaps but eventually your run out of space i hate to see a wonderful game die but more and more actual servers empty and more and more people go to trade idle and vsh servers the game slowly kills itself is tf2 still the 3rd most played game hell yeah but so many of those people are congaing or bartering over unusuals and not playing the game is it the communities fault no a poor reflection of valves contribution and what just soldified the joke that valve used to make games now they make money is the end of the line update a poor excuse that could have introduced something that hasnt been seen in so long a finished map not ing operation hole bound beta or tile texture rd but a real somewhat new gamemode but valve took it out because it was too confusing they dont add weapons only cosmetics and a ing cheap attempt to suck up money through bonus ducks i would hate to see tf2 die because so many people are invested if tf2 dies so does the market the 10000 dollar spender who bought the burning ke smissmass was okay new weapons yay but once again valve seems to be trying to please us with half finished ideas with mannpower theyve brought too much beta and we the people would much rather see a finished and drawn out map rather than a  overpowered attempt at pleasing the people i dont hate tf2 i hate whatever the cause may be for this wonderful deviation from the rehashed ing military shooters like hardline and advanced warfare just please valve as great as community effort might be it seems like your not trying please make it like the good ol days where youd introduce a polished custom map that is valve standards every update we have enough hats and festives we need weapons and maps and gamemodes and anything but this  just please ive gone through 2 game deaths in my gamer career they were fun on the last days moderators giving out planned items it was amazing but then they ended and although you think youll be fine you sometimes wake up and go to your computer and open up steam only to remember that your favorite game is gone please dont leave the ones who love this in the dust just focus on this game and give it some love

after 2000 hours on this game i believe i can made a correct review about it well team fortress 2 is a free to play fps unlike in some fps being a great killer is not always the key to sucess indeed teamwork often beats singlework even if this singlework team is made of real good players 9 differents classes with their pros and their cons some classes can be hard for beginners for example spy however some are easy for them a good point is that each class even if it seems to be easy to play at first can be really effective after some training there are a lot of weaponsmost of which are balanced some are not though i would say therere many ways to waste your money with this game but if youre clever enough its possible to have fun without spending too much money mainly to get the prenium pack nothing more the lastest update and mann up need money to be played well you can buy mann up tickets on market nevertheless you can play a similar gamemode which is free except rewards since its a rather old game there are a lot of custom gamemodes and maps which can enhance your gaming experience the amount of maps and gamemodes is very high which prevents you from getting bored in this game even after spending 2000 hours im still having fun community however can be an annoyance some preniums players act very badly with beginners and show off how they spend their money you know they think paying tons of money on a game will make you strong and skillfull prff on an other hand there are some servers where you need to pay in order to win and valve servers where teamwork is almost impossible since beginners think theyre in a singlework game a pro tip  dont wear gibus hat if you dont want to get mocked in the end i would like say that this game worth a try you may not like it but i rather think youll enjoy it if youre a fps and teamwork player the game is kind of old but is not dead yet and the cartoon graphics ire ok also be carefull of trading madness some players and of excessive money spending

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

team fortress 2 a great game believe it or not and the best partits free now just because its free dont think itll be some crappy game thats insanely pay to win because its not it uses a great f2p model that was around 8 months before the game even went f2p the model the game uses is that everything you buy is purely cosmetic and the weapons you can buy from the mann co store everyone else including you can find and craft ingame the game has many things to offer hell the game is 7 years old and has 7 years of great content in the game between the hundreds of hats and weapons in the game you can literally customize your loadout to be completely different than other players the game has 9 playable classes scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and spy i know the class names sound generic as hell but anyways the classes are broken down into three tiers offensive defensive and support scout soldier and pyro being offensive demo heavy and engineer being defensive and medic sniper and spy being support of course that doesnt mean that you cant play any of the classes differently if you want to be an offensive sniper then you can do that just use the huntsman if you want to be a defensive demo then sit back and place sticky traps scout fast agile can double jump and get in and do serious damage and get away easily soldier slower deals great damage with his rocket launcher and shotgun can rocket jump to higher ground pyro pretty high health can ambush with his flamethrowers and cause havoc demoman can place sticky traps charge at you with huge fcking swords and simply pss you off heavy highest health count 300 slowest class huge minigun to tear through people engineer same health as a scout can build sentry guns to defend areas of the map heal teammates and give ammo with dispensers and teleport teammates closer to battle with his teleporters medic very useful can heal teammates and overheal them and upon full uber can make said person being healed including hisself invincible for a short period of time sniper can take out classes from long distances same health as scout pretty easy class spy same health as scout can disguise as teammates and enemy players also can sap engineers buildings to destroy them and can cloak to get away silently i just described the classes in their vanilla form there are literally thousands of ways to customize your classes to change their playstyles and its amazing game modes team fortress 2 has tons of gamemodes to play and their are community made gamemodes and maps modes capture the flag ctf capture point cp king of the hill koth payload pl payload race plr territorial basically cp but slightly different special delivery sd mann vs machine mvm and robot destruction map currently in beta but you can play it ctf and cp pretty much describe themselves for you however the other modes are different and i will explain them king of the hill hold a capture point for 3 minutes to win payload red has to stop blu from pushing the cart to the objective and winning payload race both teams have carts to push to an objective and have to stop the other team from capping at the same time territorial basically cp expect the map is divided into different sections the map unlocks by whichever team caps first special delivery basically like capture the flag but youre delivering a package of australium to a rocket mann vs machine horde mode also mann up mode can give you awesome rare loot robot destruction both teams work to get a certain amount of points by killng enemy teams robots or by stealing the others teams points from their vault and returning it to their own vault maps im not going into great detail with the maps simply because theres way too many to just list off but all the maps have a way different feel and are all pretty damn amazing besides steel and hydro team fortress 2 in all honesty is a very good game ive spent a lot of time on this game over 2000 hours in the past 4 going on 5 years ive owned it really you cant go wrong with this game just download it and give it a shot its pretty fcking amazing rate 910

this game defines the freetoplay genre it should be by all means the standard goto example for any game developer out there that aims to make a freetoplay game and profit from it  in any casethe actual review  the aesthetics in this game are greatly done and the colour pallet is so carefully picked that it creates a unique if not beautiful visual experience the music really immerses you in the kind of atmosphere the game tries to offer the gameplay itself is great and it covers any kind of play style you could possibly ask for with the nine classes  the scout for fast passed shooting  the soldier for tough all purpose defenceoffence play style  the pyro for close range ambushing kind of play style  the demoman for the indirect play style the heavy for alloutoffence reckless playersthe engineer for strategists  the medic for the laid back defensive players though it can be an efficient offensive class too the sniper for picking off key targets from great distances and finally the spy which gives a unique stealthy gameplay to this first person shooter  the huge pool of weapons that exist and are still coming for each of the nine classes makes it all the more interesting and fun with all the possible combinations of loadouts you simply can not get bored of this game there are numerous classic game modes like king of the hill  capture the flag  control point and arena to name a few but the game has a lot of unique and fun game modes like mann vs machine essentially a swarm game mode and special delivery there is a lot of content done by the comunity like cosmetic items and very well done maps that encourage exploration and have multiple ways of tackling a challenge  putting all these aside the game is very welcoming to new players and very rewarding plus with the implemented weapon drop system you can essentially experience everything the game has to offer without paying a single cent by all means it isnt perfect but it strives to be and that makes it great  over all awesome game i passionately recommend it

team fortress 2 two opposing camps and try to conquer territory or those of others to steal documents this is not a big map while the action is concentrated on a fairly small area and never on its own base line of the war you do not have to far so little could be described as a system deathmatchov turmoil with very rigid constraints that determine the characteristics of the characters each of the nine occupations is completely different and presents a specific approach to playing they pick all  born attacker reaches for ultra fast scout  soldier balanced with a rocket launcher or a flamethrower armed pyro  defenders choose your favorite heavyguy with oversized gun a rogue demoman with a grenade launcher and on the walls fireableholding mines the third option is astute engineer who can build a teleport station complementary health and ammo dispenser or fatal loophole after the third upgrade capable of firing missiles the last group of occupations will appeal especially calmer nature that play for the team and not rushing to the front line they have a choice of medic with its inexhaustible source of health and the occasional immortal effect of course not miss sniper  whose professional look me after every execution can inflame red and finally virtually invisible spy  who are attacking from a backup in disguise maps the basic package includes six maps which is quite a few on the other hand all radically different and shortly after the release occurred fan creations the classic is the already mentioned 2fort which will again become the most played of all  you know it from the trailers theres no guaranteed recipe for victory and hardly anyone will be surprised by the unusual strategy dustbowl is a map of conquest points one team defends the other attacks when you have some place you can not lose him and immediately move forward to conquer the next space thus working through progressively up to six stations the map is definitely interesting and the best part is the determination with which resists defending team at the last point has never happened to me that i would not much help the team conquered any negatives it is very difficult to me to team fortress 2 find any bug aside sobs veterans who lack the ability grenades or enemy medic poison injection to them and to all who come simple concept is intended as modifications to fortress forever halflife 2 otherwise tf2 but perfectly balanced mix between complex for discerning players and also the accessibility to a wide audience enjoy game czskeng etc

team fortress 2 is the sequel to team fortress classic it was included in the orange box along with halflife 2 halflife 2 episode 1 halflife 2 episode 2 and portal it was released in 2007 running on the source engine its a classbased fps that relies on teamwork for offense there is scout soldier and pyro defense has demoman heavy and engineer support has medic sniper and spy pros the quite cartoony graphics make it unique it brings a new feel to the source engine and it does well there are no overpowered classes everything is balanced each class is made to counter each other unlike tfc there is music in the game tons of gamemodes and maps including custom ones the gameplay has improved since tfc airblast ubercharge etc constant updates unlike tfc there are extra weapons each weapon is made for certain situations hats cons music only plays during the title screen or class select screen the community can be pretty bad the amount of naked pony sprays explain a lot too many tradeachievement servers updates never seem to be tested and each bug fix brings at least 2 more bugs 7510

team fortress 2 a game that removes all of my stress team fortress 2 is a game that is as great as the portress you play on various maps no matter what i always find it hilarious you play as one of 9 mercenaries from different countries on each map there is no gap designed tactically so that every class can be able to kick some  equally if you want you can go scout to double jump about with high speed to fight hard with good dodging and making them bleed you can distract a sentry with a chug of bonk from another entry and with one konk from a mate that sentries fate is decided or grab the intel and run like hell has broken out in the area for fun if scout is annoying and you want someone with a louder shout you could go soldier the man who is as scary as a boulder armed with a rocket launcher the results are grandly stauncher you have multiple banners an trumpets each with different manners of effect to protect your allies or boost them to the enemies roost or if youre bored get out a shovel and pulverize the enemy like theyve been hiding in a hovel but if you want to be a drunken scott you certainly can and its as fun as being shocked by 1000 electrical watts you fight with a grenade launcher and a bottle or a blade if you want to add onto the throttle pull out the eyelander and chargentarge to pander to your sick barge fight your best to destroy whatever pest is attempting to melee fight because clearly they werent that bright to fight a drunken man who can stomp you like a tin can or if you want to dawn a gas mask for my favourite class the pyro spewing fire to change enemy attire into ash while you laugh and dash in to smash their heads with an axe a psychopath who doesnt hesitate to unleash his wrath upon the map charred and scarred bodies in burning coal mines which is probably costly in fines but with flare in hand do you dare to land a critical strike and extinguish your cohorts while theyre burning like a shrike or to easily kill a tankier enemy just become a  with the sniper a foot blowing heads open from the root of where you stand which i find very grand the satisfaction from their reaction and watching the brain matter patter to the ground you have a smg and a shield to help protect you in the field but if thats not enough you got a machete for when things get tough or if youre normal you can be very formal with jarate in a jar you chuck from far soaking the enemies in urine better yet do not fret pick up a minigun and have a lot of fun mowing down the opposition with destructive suppression enjoying a sandvich whenever you find yourself cornered in a ditch though itd be wise to use it to help heal allies cooperation is a major key to the enemies destruction but if angry break out a tangy steak and go break an enemys face with your fist each hit spilling so much blood like a huge mist or to become near immortal and quite vital to your teams survival you could become the medic an interesting pick you stay close to the group not wanting to stray with a medigun in hand you run with your crew to ruin the enemy like a bad bowl of stew with an ubercharge you make a huge barge critical strikes or ubercharges for real which are very analytical when they deal true damage if cornered dont get bothered get your ubersaw out and cut the enemy like a cat paw use a crossbow when you need to allow for long range heal a medical vow which is very high brow to do no harm but i laugh while making a human limb farm if camping is what you prefer pardner than look for farther be smarter and barter with sentries a lot of kills which fills my heart watching so many die to my sentries like pennies on the sidewalk you can help your cohorts with some teleports teleporters ready to help steady the fight on the front which ill be quite blunt is wasted often because someone became somewhat too soften building them five steps away from spawn a major thrive to a  swan to aid the fight an supply the braid of the team a dispenser can help condenser the teams health but again it is wasted like a pasted chain kept mostly beside the sentry to guard an entry instead of make a fight quite tight but if its a bore grab a mini sentry and even the score get in on the combat being as threatening as a gnat but if you want to be subtle like a cuttle pick up a watch and attempt to botch the enemys defenses forcing them to hesitate their offenses disguise yourself and chastise the enemy for trusting you before busting their spine with a fine knife to the back go through an odd entry and sap the engies sentry when he charges aim your ambassador like a bally matador and headshot them right on the spot before cloaking away to enjoy more smoking while choking the tactics of the enemy gameplay is far from all but lets stray to a plot which is quite an unexpected clot its very comedic like my relation to a hasidic in the form of comics on their website which are very great to some peoples plight and i enjoy whatever they write the fact the plot is good is an extra to be stacked on the many pact reasons to love it the characters are just perfect like a group of barristers and with trading that is never fading you can get other material like games an such which i love a bunch without it i dont doubt id have no bout with any other games to play that aside i play it competitive as well i find it hard to get repetitive to drop the rhyme for a moment i have to be honest without this game id of been bored so often and ive met some of the greatest people and my best friends through this game no matter what i will love this game i may have arrived late to the party only joining a few years ago but i will always be happy to be a part of the team fortress 2 community otherwise can recommend

as of writing this it has been one year to the day that i started playing tf2 i thought it appropriate to finally write a review on this wonderful game as a mile stone of sorts in one years time ive accumulated a little more than 3000 hours more time than i have sunk into any other game so far the replayability of this game is something you rarely see in an average first person shooter and its charm is something that has kept its fanbase happy since the games release in 2007 some of the things that set this game apart from its rivals is its unique brand of humor and its beautiful art style in interviews with the games creators it was explained that in development they drew heavily from the art style of beloved american illustrator norman rockwell in this well thought out game there are 9 classes to choose from each with their own unique weapon arsenal strengths and weaknesses and personality scout soldier pyro demo heavy engineer medic sniper and spy scout being a very frail fast class with burst damage output at close range he can also capture control 2 times as fast as the other classes soldier having balanced health and mobility comfortably played in all situations pyro being of lesser health and balanced speed allowing him to flank enemies and ambush them demo man with overwhelming damage output lesser speed and a fair amount of health heavy being the bullet sponge of the game massive health slow movement speed and decent damage output engineer with the ability to construct buildings that will help allies and hinder enemies with area denial medic being able to heal team mates back up to full health sending them back into a fight sniper having the devastating ability to pick off enemies from a distance but having the disadvantage of low health and normal speed and lastly the spy able to become invisible disguise as enemies and one hit kill anyone with the major disadvantage of low health and close range combat when it comes to gameplay this game is about as balanced as it gets you start out the game already owning all the best weapons and you slowly earn or randomly receive items with different stats better in one area worse in another the fact that everyone is given the most balanced weapons from the start make this a game heavily based around skill the hilarity of slapping someone with a fish a ham or a frying pan make the game enjoyable for more casual players where as the mix of good art style balanced weapons and numerous tournament modes make it enjoyable for more serious players on the topic of serious game play there are competitive gaming leagues from all over the world hosting tf2 tournaments and events all with special objectives rule sets and banned item lists making the outcome of each game different there are several divisions of skill so even the best have something to work toward the economy of the game is something that has a controversy surrounding it although this games target audience is mature young adults several children find there way in with so many children actively participating in a global scale open economy it can lead to unbalances unfortunate and sometimes hilarious circumstances hats are what make the tf2 economy go around everyone wants to find a hat that showcases exactly what they want their character to represent finding just the right hat with just the right color and possibly a special particle effect can be rather expensive making most people pour more money into pixelated headwear than is reasonable in the end this is the most interesting quirky an beautiful game i have ever had the pleasure of playing i recommend it to any gamer and will continue to enjoy its charm for years to come

team fortress 2 is a prime staple of a firstperson shooter that balances casual and competitive gameplay very well since game sessions are fairly short you can always drop into a game and play even if you only have a short amount of free time if you like fps games different team roles random item drops  crafting and fun actionpacked gameplay then you will really enjoy this game as a free to play game tf2 is one of the best of its kind available and you can play without having to spend any money  it gets very tempting though especially the more invested you get into the game the aesthetics are fantastic the character models are very welldone and there is also a lot of detail in the environment there are a multitude of different weapons and cosmetics ex hats outfits etc allowing for huge character customization however most of these things must either be purchased with real money or traded if you dont want to rely on the random item drops the sound effects are good and there really isnt any music so i just play my own in the background the character taunts and dialogue are great and comical the controls are very straightforward and the learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with fps games there is a coaching option where players can volunteer to train new players and new players can be matched with any available coaches this is a great option considering that there is no real tutorial and playing against bots does not compare at all when playing against real opponents understanding the different character roles  equipment configuration different loadouts can change your playstyle considerably can take some time but i personally find this part to be very fun for example you can equip the demoman with a melee weapon each character has a primary secondary and melee weapon and give him a shield and special boots for his other weapon slots  this will effectively turn him into a whirlwind of melee death so long as you are able to close the distance between yourself and your opponents swords will give him a charge ability this differs from his default loadout where the demoman can use his grenade launcher and also set up triggerable mines the gameplay is extremely fun and there are a number of different game modes available  territory control capture the flag briefcase and push the cart get your cart to the other end of the level to name a few the different character types and equipment make for high replayability and can also make each match different in its own unique way i strongly advise you to try out every character type at least a few times as each class can be very fun and complementing your team makeup is always helpful the cosmetic items and weapons are fun to craft and you may be very tempted to purchase a few things basic items are very cheap on the market if you dont want to spend money there are frequent item drops that happen while you play as well as achievement items that will be unlocked when you fulfill certain requirements overall this is an excellent game that you should try if you are interested in multiplayer andor fps games especially since it is f2p if you arent into those type of games you should still try this out since it is much easier for people to get into than say battlefield or call of duty again the perfect blend of casual and competitive elements makes this game very appealing for all types of gamers highly recommend cheers djsf @djsfs rogue reviews

this game is now 7 years old by rights this game should be relegated to the dark dank corners of the internet played by only a few diehard geeks with fond memories of the days gone by instead its now the internets premier hat collecting game spawned a trading system only slightly less complex that a wall street derivatives trading unit and added far more weapons maps and silly items than anyone can shake a stick at yes the game has its faults but ive never found any except arena mode and its cheered me up on more occasions when ive been down merely by enabling me to set fire to people without the risk of another long jail sentence
recommended
continuing from the classic half life mod team fortress classic this game is constantly being updated and improved you can trade items with players across the world collect and craft your way to the top play as red or blue and comeplete objectives or pimp your class out with stylish hats and accessories team fortress 2 is always a game that you can turn to in order to waste some time and have fun while in comeplete chaos and silliness there are nine personality filled classes to choose from to fit your liking each one has a different set of skills and over time you can get enhanced weapons by playing buying them from the shop or even trading with a stranger definetely a game id recommend to players that love free deathmatching games with a ton of things to do on the side
recommended
better than call of duty the games all about hats this is a game where it can be either serious or goofoffish all you need to do is select the mode and choose what map requires some skill to get the hang of goofing off though

this game is tottaly same as drugs you get addicted to it and ruins your life but whoever addicted to drugs he must love drugs same as team fortress 2 the best game evar btw  wastes all your money c sigh 5 stars

very good game its awesome you can customize your character and get new weapons and buy stuff from the store its free to play and its the best fps game ever
recommended
fun to play with friends just play the game you easily unlock achievements without trying hard and get decent item drops it is definitely more fun when you learn more about the classes and go online against other players i do consider it to be a unique game where hours do not give you much of an advantage against newer players but knowledge and skill is what makes the difference

team fortress 2 is the best fps multiplayer game i have ever played 1010 heres my review team fortress 2 is one of valves games that you should have first once you made your steam account there are 9 classes you can play as so what are we waiting for lets meet them all scout he is not as weak as you think he has a scattergun pistol and a bat he is a offensive class and he can beat you up by bonking you on the head plus hes pretty fast too soldier he is a pretty balance class but he is equiped with a rocket launcher shotgun and a shovel yep its a shovel hes also offensive too and also can rocket jump too as in jump very high with the help of his rocket launcher pyro whats with the fire guys oh its the pyro that makes the fire with his flamethrower shotgun same old shotgun and a fireaxe hes the last offensive class and he can burn you alive watch out spies demoman sure hes drunk but hes a defensive class and he has grenades well not really unlike tf1tfc but he uses grenade launcher stickybomb launcher and a bottle cuz he drunk burb he is a powerful class if you use melee  heavy the heavy is a heavy weapons guy that holds the minigun shotgun again and hes own fist he is a defensive class and he is heavy i mean hes slow so keep that in mind if you dont want to get sniped in other words hes the face of tf2 engineer our buddy likes to build stuff and these buildings are useful he builds sentries dispensers heals and teleporters he fights with shotgun pistol and a wrench which use for building as well look out of sappers [he is the last defensive class] medic medic we need healing and thats where medics comes in hes a support class that heals his teammates and he wields with a syringe gun medigun heals teammates and a bonesaw meeeeediiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccc sniper gday mates lets headshot our victims with this supportive class he shoots with the sniper rifle smg and a kukri well not for shooting with watch your head and avoid getting shot by snipers spy our last & support class the spy he is very sneaky but also weak hes uses a revolver a sapper to sap the engineers buildings but it takes time and finally a knife which he backstabs people with thats spy a spywait what thats all of the classes and now lets talk about gamemodes theres ctf control points payload payload race koth and arena okay i dont have to explain what this game is all about because this game is so awesome youll have fun and download this game play team fortress 2 a fps multiplayer game that will keep you busy for hours and also get new weapons and last thing theres hats for your classes to wear and also some misc such as clothes now anyway download this game and have some fun [require a purchase at mann co shop in order to become premium tf2 player] i might make a guide of this

your wallet will be hungry because you will be wasting money on pixels and more pixels and more pixels you play the game to get more pixels and with more pixels you look better and cooler and people assume you are good at the game when you really can be crap so with fancy hats and glowing weapons you are good at the game that is how teamfortess2 works

if free to play scares you away from this titile dont let it it is a great game there is no need to pay anything as all items are given though drops the more you play the more stuff you get premium player or not speaking of premium player you become one by spending any amount of money in the game even under $1 and you will always be a premium player no subscriptions this basically lets you have more items and sometimes get hats and rare but only cosmetic items through the drops players are not hindered by being free to play or by not playing a lot the default guns given are balanced and unlocked guns provide benefits in some areas but have negatives in others ex a larger clip but no random critical hits all in all the only thing that will make you like or hate the game is the gameplay not the pricetag if you like fps games you will love it if not still give it a try you could have fun and not need to worry about being locked behind a paywal

skip this first part if you just want to read my review ah i see you see my review well not really because it hasnt started yet and i cant see you anyways now that ive wasted a good thirty seconds thats an aproximation if it hasnt been thirty seconds replace the word thirty with the time it is currently taking you to read if you dont know i encourage you to go back and read it again with a timer now on to my review tf2 two letters one number these three characters have a meaning to all of us gamers to some tf2 is merely the sequal to team fortress or team fortress classic to others this game brings meaning to steam unsurprisingly tf2 still remains one of the most popular steam games a while back the game officially became f2p free to play ever since the official release as i said before it has touched the hearts of hundrends if not thousands of steam users the game cleverly mixes first person shooting with the cartoon graphics you see in disney movies except valve makes it work though this brilliant combination attracts tons of people every day it is very much a reason not to play for the harcore graphic obsessed steam users to combat the people who say things like the graphics of this game are horrible i will not play it and a cartoon first person shooter no let me play call of duty and halo i must say that you learn to love the commical blowing off of the head and watching your vital organs fall here and there as a handful of characters that could only be created from the mind of a serial killer run around shooting this and blowing up that overall the game is very fun and entertaining

i honestly recommend team fortress 2 i bought it with the orange box on the release day which would have been 10 euro but i would pay 60 for it aswell since the game is free to play now you need to try it out i am disappointed in the fact that it is free to play now though the difficulty level has drasticaly changed to low standards due to all the new players other than that it is a nice game when youre bored

this is by far the best free to play game ever made tf2 is more than just a hat simulator its a hat simulator with guns no seriously tf2 is awesome it features 9 classes which are all needed to make a perfect team except for pyro no one needs pyros it does have it bad sites because the game is sometimes full of cod kids who only choose pyro and also the medic which is highly needed is very unpopular most people wont get that its team fortress 2 and not kill everyone on the field fortress 2 also the trading is a very big part of tf2 so tf2 is very different from shooters like cod battlefield or halo i recommend it highly
recommended
the competitive is awesome the trading not so much and too many people judging freetoplay s just because they have no hats
recommended
2007 simple game with 9 classes and basic maps and weapons nothing else 2014 war themed hat simulator

the best free to play game around better than a lot of premium titles with a great community and an awesome team of developers
recommended
this game is like a women it eats away at your wallet until you realize what its doing but then again this game is sexy just like women
recommended
after long hours of gameplay in team fortress 2 and after playing every single mode in the game except a few mods i guess its time to do the review 3 the game is very unique in everything its not everyday you see a game which you have to choose between 9 different classes with unique abilities for steal out some kills its not everyday you find a game with crazy guys hired to kill each other just because silly brothers its not everyday you see the both silly brothers being killed by their lost brother and then starting a war for get the company its not everyday you find out a game where you have to kill a lot of hordes of robots made by the crazy lost brother seriously tf2 has even story behind the mercenaries protecting briefcases pushing giant bombs and capturing points also fighting notsosmart robots its not only about the hats actualy its the gameplay its not the same thing in comparison with others fpss entering even more inside the game you can discover more random stuff like the ingame fads thats what attract more players in my opinion and for being a f2p game everyone can enjoy the randomness of teufort and dont think the f2players will only noob some gibus guys will dance over your corpse ingame im being serious curious now d get the game doesnt have space in the computer at least get some culture of the game dont know where to start watch all the meet the team pay a visit to the tf2 official wiki and check out the most famous tf2 fads two famous ones are demopan and painis cupcake d meet ya around teufort
recommended
tf2  hats shall i say more
recommended
very fun and free
recommended
for a free game this exceeds any and all standards allowing you to play for free while giving you the option to go into the world of premium membership with cartoony gameplay and a comic series what can go wrong plus you have a thriving community creating updates for the game it cant get better than this my favorite part is getting the task done as a team most people dont do that but its fun once they do
recommended
i dont think much has to be said about tf2 if you havent played it you should its f2p after all so you have nothing to lose besides no one can resist the most hyped hat simulator ever existed 
recommended
sometimes i play this game

after playing this game for a while now i would recommend this to anyone it has a competitive side casual minigames the vanilla is extremely fun and tons of hilarious moments when you light someone on fire and they try to give you a high five it just adds to the overall fun and experience of the game with constant updates and new items valve is ensuring players stay interested as mentioned above there are some funny group or solo taunts that can be traded for in the games expansive trading economy also hats hats are worth a lot and valuable in trade they are fun to collect and allow you to make your character look as ridiculous as possible however new players be warned dont expect a shootemup style game as it takes numberous amounts of good meatshots to kill somebody or a few rockets weapons are vastly different than other games nowadays and take skill to learn to use effectively so be prepared to have fun wear hats and hone your abilities with flamthrowers rockets miniguns and even a fish

this is the game that made me come to steam made me know about all of the hats and tryhardscod fanboys that hate this game and hl3 so i would rate this game 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999910 cause why the hell not conga conga conga

i wasted over 1000 hours on this game and it stole my life from me and i have to say i love this game to death i see new players every day and think back when i was free 2 play it doesnt really matter about hats but skills
recommended
team fortress 2 absolutely no words can express what i feel about this game main reason is i have mixed feelings about this game its a great first person shooter game with many servers allowing you to customize your character the downside to this game is the creators will to continuosly aim the game towards a moneymaking process so much of this game is moneyoriented its quite sad and ruins the cartoonish aspect the game provides but besides that this is one great game that would not disappoint through the hours i have logged i have spent countless hours playing competitively casually and even just sitting there and helping coach other players its a fun game and i really do love the time playing it the cartoonish feeling and effect has a major voice in my opinion reason being is just that after coming home from a long day of work the cartoonish characters with all their personalities is a real pleasure to see would recommend you get it its free
recommended
you dont actually have to spend money on this free fps 2010
recommended
team fortress 2 tf2 is one of the most popular games ever especally in the fps firstperson shooter catagory theres 9 classes to play as all with diffrent playstyles peranalitys weapons or something funny to say in genral tf2 is a must have if your on a computer you own theres absolutely no reason to not own this game

tf2 is a fast paced game with a crtoony look and will make you lagh so much on how stupide the custom made gamemodes are but if you want to get serious you can buy hats and wepons to look good and get a head of the game finally if dont want to pay at all just keep playing and youll find tons of items whe you die

> i was only 10 years old > i loved tf2 so much i had almost all the weapons i wanted > i would leave my computer on for hours just to get a few drops > then i got my first hat the gibus > suddenly everything changed > i no longer cared about playing for fun i only cared about the hats > i borrowed my mommys credit card and bought more hats > i had so many hats i loved them all > but then someone traded me i accepted > they offered an unusual for all my hats > it was so sexy looking i put up all my hats and traded > but no unusual he scammed me > i lost it all > i was so sad i cried for hours > later that night i prayed to gaben for my hats back > i went to bed after praying > i felt warm > i looked behind me it was gaben > he said this is gabe newell and handed me a burning tc > then i woke up i was wearing my burning tc and i was naked > i saw gabe leave through the window he looked back at me and winked > hats are love hats are life

if you like action and sometimes mindless hilarity then this game is for you there are many different aspects of the game and each loadout is a new way to play it is extremely fun and most of the people you will meet on this game are very entertaining the trading feature in the game is very useful as well but there inlies one of the only flaws of this game often times after an update the trading network goes down as well as the item server so that you cant use your items for a while these probelms are fixed quickly but its still a tad bit annoying all in all its still a great game and as youll see i have over 400 hours on record so i have a good idea of the game
recommended
honestly this is one of the best games i have ever played im suprised they dont make it cost money because if it did i would totally buy it
recommended
possibly one of the best dress em up games on the market great variety in costumes my demoman in particular wearing those shutter shades and a cool beanie and my pyro looking superthreatening in a skull and bones getup its a shame you spend most of the game shooting each other
recommended
so much fun for a price of nothing

a really dumb fps focused around hats sandviches and congalines i highly recommend it in all seriousness though i had never played a fps before tf2 they all seemed boring dull and overcompetitive tf2 is not like that all the classes are hilarious and full of character it has a thriving and friendly community and there are weapons suited to every play style no class is better than another everyone should give it a go if you havent already

today i shall bring up an important question can a game go too far in short yes team fortress 2 sent hat simulators way too far by adding guns to it but unlike other things that go too far team fortress 2 actually improved the hat simulator genre with guns yes i certainly reccomend the best hat simulator in the whole world

very good game best hat simulator ever you can paint set style go on dates and see your hats mood im so glad that they added frostbite 3 to it and that this game is on for casual players well the last part is not entirely true even though the game was never meant to be played competitively it is being played competitively ever since late 2006 valve just dont want to take this game seriously like they did with counterstrike many and when i say many i mean it i bloody hell mean it many quake veterans moved from quake to this game but i think they got upset that their old comp tournaments werent there anymore and that the comp community wasnt official valve please listen to all the players asking for it i know that youve heard it many times before even when sal and extine went to your office just to ask this make tf2 official this game has a huge community this game has huge potential come on look at all those game gimmicks but you cant deny that highlander is a lot less strategic than 6v6 and that itll be a pain to assemble and manage 9 players for each team instead of 6

recommended
this is by far the best free to play game ever made tf2 is more than just a hat simulator its a hat simulator with guns no seriously tf2 is awesome it features 9 classes which are all needed to make a perfect team except for pyro no one needs pyros it does have it bad sites because the game is sometimes full of cod kids who only choose pyro and also the medic which is highly needed is very unpopular most people wont get that its team fortress 2 and not kill everyone on the field fortress 2 also the trading is a very big part of tf2 so tf2 is very different from shooters like cod battlefield or halo i recommend it highly
recommended
yes this a absoulote amazing game im from the airforce

a rather simple yet entertaining first person shooter normal objectives blow things up kill other players repeat just what i like d

team fortress 2 review team fortress 2 is a great game that everyone can enjoy i love it as there are loads of maps to play with different gamemodes even if you are a more creative person you can buy taunts and cosmetics which you can paint and style to your liking positives it is a very fun game easy to customise just a great game where you can trade and fight all sorts negatives it can get very addictive a lot of little children which are not fun to play with if you play constanly it may get boring
recommended
its soo fun
recommended
a wonderfull game everyone should own this
recommended
two words get this its free its fun its fcking awesome all it costs is diskspace and once youve mastered all the classes and shooting and weapons and stuff then i have two more words for you get pimped yes pimped there are way more hats than weapons so once you evolve from noobyf2pness either turn your crappy old duplicates and unwanted weapons into scrap the currency of tf2 and craft or buy hats or you could use real money at the mann co store but thats lame this game is the definition of neverending awesome
recommended
well this game is  absolute  not eenough teams we need more teams like purple orange green and yellow also the classes and maps are dumbnate wish they could make these changes and i wish they wouldnt make it cartoonie its dumb like reid

as one of my most played games of all time team fortress 2 is an incredidibly original and fun fps it not traditional in a way but i can honestly say no other game has come as close as being as fun as tf2 i mean you know when a game is good when it has its own economy anyway play tf2 its free its fun and it doesnt pull too much out of your pockets like other free to play games

what i think of the game its alright i guess i mean there are some flaws like hackers and such but its not bad really its basically for anyone to all the destructive people out there play as the soldier or the demoman or the pyro for all those people who love to help out to be the team player play some medic or engineer a little story i wrote for team fortress 2 once upon a time a little boy named jimmy had finally got himself playing some call of duty modern warfare 2 and he said to himself gee i wish people arent so mean and hateful of other people and so gaben flew into little jimmys window on a unicorn with laser eyes with armor made of chuck norris beard hair and so gaben took little jimmy on an little adventure into the world of team fortress 2 he showed him ctf_2fort a magical place to live if you are a maniac who has a barn full of guns and he showed him the magicalness of team fortress 2 little jimmy coulnt believe what is going on so he fell asleep and the next morning he gathered all his lunch money and bought himself so many hats he became a hat lord something truely amazingnot so he went on and bought even more which made gaben very happy the end basic steps launch team fortress 2 get on a server buy hats buy even more hats rename team fortress 2 hat simulator give it the game of the year award fifty times eat sleep play anyways to be mature about this team fortress 2 is a wonderful game which players can interact with each other either by relentlessly murdering them or just giving each other high fives it has many game modes like capture the flagbriefcase or control points it really gives players control over many things there has been other things like custom community content or mann vs machine it also has many abilities to make players smarter each class requires you to play differently everytime i would recemend team fortress 2 to many people but i dont have that kind of communication although youll first end up as a free to play youll soon invest some cash into the game word of advice if you get the ghostly gibus throw it away people will criticize you for it all of all things enjoy the game dont just mess around time will fly way past your head if you do but you might find yourself addicted to it after a while that has been my review hope it helped you

team fortress 2 is an awsome fps and tp game it has some weapons from the future some of them are historical someof them are existing today and there are cool gamemodes too like control points cp_ payload pl_ king of the hill koth_ and sd_ let me explain one of them control points is a team fortress gamemode and the most popular cp maps are cp_gorge and cp_dustbowl the gamemode is simple the re team is defending and the blu team is attacking the blu teams goal is to stand on the control points for a time the red teams job is to prevent the blu team for controlling a point usually control point maps have 23 control points but there are cp maps which have 45 points too the other gamemodes are good too so go and check them out for yourself in the great world of team fortress 2 by [own] kirito

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

well how do i talk about a game which dosent really have a purpose how do i convey the hours of enjoyment ive gained if i havent been doing anything useful this game now this game is not a first person shooter it is a hat simulating conga lining unusual trading strange gathering killstreak hoarding taunt collecting piece of beautiful magic that we are lucky to have graced the earth deeper into the game you encounter hours of fun which are never the same no matter what you play this my friends is the only game in my whole steam library that i play not to mention that its free if you want to be a gibbus noob one thing i must say download this game its not serious its a joke but its the best joke ever told
recommended
amazing fps if you ask me various classes each of which specialize in different weaponry tons of weapons hats and more fun game modes too like ctf hardpoint payload and more id reccomend this game to anyone new on steam it helps getting used to trading cards ingame purchases refferals friends and more 55 1010
recommended
havent written a recommendation yet  i mustve been too busy playing the game seriously though with 800 hours of gameplay i can safely say this is my favourite fps game in fact its the only one i really find interesting  its got that surreal quirk to it the awardwinning pixarlike art style and of course the fact that it records all of your stats my ocd is pleased with that id definitely recommend giving this a go even if you dont like it which i highly doubt you can just uninstall it and you wont have lost any money as its completely free so give it a shot its worth it 
recommended
team fortess 2 is surprisingly a great game i had doughts at first that it would be a rediculase game because of the hat wearingstrange guns and hats with unusual effects but i thought wrong and now i am addicted to team fortress 2 i recommend }

team fortress 2 is at heart a gloriously simple game thats been created with style panache and an undeniable love of gaming its the kind of game that you want to show to people who dont play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away there is life before team fortress 2 and there is life after after is betterthe action is fastpaced and furious the games presentation is hilarious and exciting and the gameplay is very easily approachableteam fortress 2 is a beautifully designed game with a visual style reminiscent of old warner brothers cartoons and battles that combine strategy with frenetic action
recommended
team fortress 2 absolutely no words can express what i feel about this game main reason is i have mixed feelings about this game its a great first person shooter game with many servers allowing you to customize your character the downside to this game is the creators will to continuosly aim the game towards a moneymaking process so much of this game is moneyoriented its quite sad and ruins the cartoonish aspect the game provides but besides that this is one great game that would not disappoint through the hours i have logged i have spent countless hours playing competitively casually and even just sitting there and helping coach other players its a fun game and i really do love the time playing it the cartoonish feeling and effect has a major voice in my opinion reason being is just that after coming home from a long day of work the cartoonish characters with all their personalities is a real pleasure to see would recommend you get it its free
recommended
you dont actually have to spend money on this free fps 2010

this game has been a constant source of entertainment for me for a long time it is a lot of fun for the competitive gamer the casual player or any junior economist not only is the shooter gameplay fun as all hell the trading and the economy will keep you coming back to find that one guy who will buy your smoking stately steel toe ughh this game has been around for a long time and in my opinion it is starting to die a little the developers have choices now should they keep satisfying dumb hype or should they change the game entirely needs new gamemodes new maps better support for competitive all in all though if you have not played this game yet you need to its a game that while kinda hard to understand at first will definitely keep you coming back for more team fortress 2 is an experience that all gamers need to try at least once or twice or forever 910 would be 1010 but devs are slacking

one class defeats the other there is never an overpowered class when you know how to use them all i preferably love soldier pyro medic demo scout and spy all to which require skill the game is quite fun because you can do all sorts of things and not only pvp such as slenderfortress rocket jumpingwhich is one of my favorites mann vs machine and so much more this game by valve has been quite successful ever since its release and would continue playing it if youre new to the game i recommend you playing ctp or ctf maps you wont regret it 
recommended
yes i recommend this game tf2 is pretty good and its free if youre on steam and you dont have it get it now

senp more than 1500 hours in this gameand to be honest i dont even regret a second this game just has something that will never make you boredgraphics are pretty goodsounds excelentand even if you do get bored playing one class you got 8more

team fortress 2 where to begin you were the game we as a community needed you didnt care about the generic shooters and made something so interesting addictive and fun life was awesome at your early years but then the bronies struck the bronies were unrelentless in their assault roaming in packs server to server to give every unsuspecting player autism as they spread their love and tolerance to our precious fragile community they began to take root in your server lists with maps like trade_bronycraft which to this day have given me a huge traumatic experience with your dumb high value in game item but have little to contribute in gameplay but thats a ludicrous topic team fortress 2 skill is based on your hats value and if you owned items with little value you were shunned by these low lifed basement dwellers the community had to accept the fate that their precious team fortress had succumbed to they tried to tend to the damage the neckbeards had caused but then the salt was poured on the fresh wound the weeaboos came as if some coordinated strike from the scumlickers of the internet the weeaboos steamrolled throughout the already diminishing community morales were low such a dark time it almost happened instantly the game was flooded with autistic splash damage mains with their pockets spamming binds like the lenny renaming their items to names that were almost as original as their characters currently the assault of these degenerates continues will the game that fell from such grace ever regenerate into the jewel that valve had uncovered only time will tell i rate this up due to the fun ive had from this game
recommended
this game ruined my life
recommended
like any online multiplayer it takes a certain amount of time to get really good at it this one looks fun has a lot of settings in game and in the menu and i like a lot of settings i would recommend this game to anyone its a lot of fun
recommended
my hours say it all in honor of this new update 1010 ducks
recommended
you could play upon hours upon hours of this game without stopping thats how great it is also with the almost endless amount of stuff you could get on this like hats or weapons or crates that you can unlocks or find just endless amounts of play time that you can do
recommended
people asked me alot why i play this game they mostly say geez such bad graphic or whats that for a kind of shooter not even realistic like call of duty but i tell you why i play this this game is called team fortress 2 so it basically has a teamplaying role something what many shooters dont have to get more into detail this game is a bit surrealistic but that makes more fun tf2 is a game for fun you can work together or against and still play relaxed the roleplaying with the 9 classes makes a perfect synergy with the term team so you wont get bored by doing always the same thing and you can help each other out by just doing something different another thing which is good in this game is that you can first try the game so its a freetoplay game and gives beginners a good chance to try it out and if they like it they buy something and get premium so they can have full access to the game and for you f2phaters be honest 70% of all tf2 mercs were f2p when they started so still calling f2ps n00bs is a bit respectless there are so many more reasons why this game is actually good but if you want to know more about the game just try it out its free for everyone and has a lot of gamemodes to play for you and your friends and so on so try this no1hatsimulatorgame from valve out and then you can shout at it 
recommended
quite simply this is the best multiplayer fps of all time if youre on steam and you dont have team fortress 2 in your game collection you cannot call yourself a gamer  its that essential perfectly balanced infinitely playable and as addictive as a chocolatecovered crack cocaine sandvich this is as much fun today as it was when on release and whats more its free some may bemoan the cartoon aesthetic but if you want depressing realism go play the tediously repetitive csgo for me this is by far the most multiplayer fun you can have with a mouse in your hand get this on your system and get playing you wont regret it
recommended
a fun game when you get into a good server which is not hard multiple classes makes it easy to find something you enjoy playing and the amount of items alloted to you are immense and everexpanding
recommended
tf2 is a bloody game for kids but you will like taunts if you sneek your parents

recommended
probably the most fun ive ever had with a multiplayer shooter such a sweet art style too though i think its gotten a bit out of hand over the last few years with the bajillions of weapons and other content theyve packed in there but probably still a bunch of fun just not as pure as it once was been a little while since ive played it
recommended
i hate this game so much

i wod hawe choose tf2 insted of my home d super mega epic fun super fantastik ultra cool 100000000010

when i was young i was a big hat collector everytime i went somewhere like walmart or kmart i always bought some hats as i got older and older i bought even more hats soon though college came around and i didnt have time to buy anymore hats then my friend told me about team fortress 2 a hat simulator game this game let all my child hood memories come back 1010 best hat simulator
recommended
this game is in my opinion the most addictive shooter you have 9 completly different classes to play  scout medic pyro soldier engineer heavy demoman spy sniper every class has its own playstyles which can also be changed by a large amount of different weapons for every slot  primary secondary melee you dont die so easy in this game so you can play really hard long duels against players but never think you are indestructible something could kill you instantly if you want to learn the game you need to play it you need to learn the classes pros and cons after ca 100 hrs of playing this game you will be able to learn the game give it a try youll not repend it
recommended
extremely fun class based fps but what are you waiting for its free go get it already
recommended
i only played it a little but its okay
recommended
great game animations really great lots of fun good weapon choises extremely enjoyable lots of game moads overall 910 suberb game 
recommended
this game has been a blast from its actionpacked gameplay to its unique ingame economy this is the 1 game i play all the time it is a great title and fun for everyone including the kids i mean you combine a free fun game with pyrovision goggles you get a great time for the kiddies on the other hand for more mature people there is its own economy i have had so much fun exploring the economy in this game and i think its just great including the various different sites yet with its economy there are also sharkers scammers and phishers people who try to steal whats rightfully ours my first initial reaction to this game was it was just a stupid cartoon shooter now i think its the best game i have ever played and i shouldnt have judged this great game by its cover its fun for everyone it is unique in its own ways and it is probably the funnest game ive ever played on my pc i recommend this game for everyone and all who enjoys a great game
recommended

i love that throughout the game you get items and cosmetics or hats and also that unlike some games i play you get more classes to choose from i also like the crits and powerups you get during the game however i dont like that admins arent around most times if there is someone causing trouble or hacking but team fortress 2 is a really great game overall

hey guys this is an awesome game
recommended
havent written a recommendation yet  i mustve been too busy playing the game seriously though with 800 hours of gameplay i can safely say this is my favourite fps game in fact its the only one i really find interesting  its got that surreal quirk to it the awardwinning pixarlike art style and of course the fact that it records all of your stats my ocd is pleased with that id definitely recommend giving this a go even if you dont like it which i highly doubt you can just uninstall it and you wont have lost any money as its completely free so give it a shot its worth it

team fortress 2 is a good game and here is why i think that of course this is only my opinion but i hope i can be of service first of all lets talk about the bad things sometimes you will run into a hacker or two its not uncommon you just have to report the player and go on with your day reconnecting to a new server or telling the admins of community servers another bad thing is that this game is full of bugs and exploits another common thing in all games thats all i can really think about for the bad things so on to the good things this game is a great time waster when youre bored or just have nothing better to do you can spend hours online trust me i know im proud of my hours logged dont care what nobody says the community is usually very nice and fun to play with sure you will find those players that are quite rude but this is an online fps game that is also free to play you will find talkers another thing thats great about this game is that team fortress 3 is not needed the community and valve are always working together to further this game and make it better for everyone with updates fixing glitches and adding items constantly coming out and last but not least hats lots of them 1010 best hat simulator 2k07

team fortress 2 my review team fortress 2 is a free to play game with a lot of content to it even if you dont think you will like it you should give it a try it is unlike most modern fpss today and one of the only to have classes you will not have to pay 1 cent to find enjoyment in this game hats are nice to have but can be gotten without buying anything most weapons are to gimmiky and you should not worry about except a few eg gun slinger degresser dead ringer gun boats escape plan even today i play defualt scout sniper and heavy you will get achivments at a steady rate and will not be urged to find new wepons after 9 years of devolopment i hope it was worth the weight like our fatty lord and saviour gaben

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor
recommended
tf2 is a very good free to play fps and i recommend it to anyone who is looking to get in to gaming or also want to try something comical as this can be quite a jokey game too
recommended
i think im nearing 1000 hours and ive gotta say i havent played a game thats more fun than team fortress 2 especially for the price not only does this game have tons of different game modes such as capture point king of the hill capture the flagintel pay load arena basically death match and a wavedefence mode called mannvsmachine mvm the classes each have multiple play styles making them very versitile for any situation you may face get some friends together and this game can be a real blast once you find a good server with friendly players youll want to add that one to your favorites and become a regular usually regulars get benefits which could include visual effects auto balance immunity endofround immunity  some servers even have plugins that give your character an ingame effect good or bad like instant kills or you may shrink down to ankle high maybe a giant head low gravity anybody and anywhere in between i forgot to mention all the constant updates weapons hats big community hats promotional items and so much more in short if you dont have this game go ahead and hit yourself for not having it and start the download then go make a tasty sandwich of your choice dont forget to toast the bread grab a glass of tea and commence waiting for your next favorite game to finish
recommended
pretty decent point and click adventure needs more ducks
recommended
an economical simulator which will make you want to pay to look cooler than everyone else and will make you want to spend more time to be better and make people rage blaming on teammates and your computer are also included as well in the package and you get to meet some rare species such as the vocal commands spamming dude the guy calling everybody a noob and of course the 9 year old kid who needs to talk constantly you will find very balanced skilledclasses like the mini sentry engineer and the sticky spamming demoman overall a pretty mediocre game would definitely recommend
recommended

now that i have reached 2000 hours on tf2 i suppose i should make a review now unfortunately i suck at reviewing stuff and describing things but yeah this game does have its pros and cons heres a fewby the way i suck at finding pros and cons too so i just put the first things that pop into my mind pros mostly balanced there are a few weapons that  in my opinion need to be nerfedbuffed easy to learn the basics exciting except if its ctf and both teams have a lot sentries guarding there intel thats just boring gameplay many different weapons to choose from so you can make a loadout that works for you the characters have interesting personalities and have some funny things to say mvm is also pretty fun there are different mods such as vshversus saxton hale and freak fortress which are really fun and chaotic ones like tf2 x10 for those who never heard of this its a mod in which the stats of a weapon are multiplied by 10 theres a lot more pros than this i couldnt think of what else to write cons glitches seem to pop up every now and then especially after an update some players of the community are jerks to f2ps the economy is a bit  at the moment players will sometimes kick you for no apparent reason the price of keys remember when keys were worth 266 ref yeah i do too oh and you will only know what im talking about if youve done a good amount of trading im pretty sure that theres some more cons for tf2 i just cant think of any right now overall pretty decent game

originally i downloaded this game simply for content in garrys mod thinking i would never take interest in it and play it i made a mistake i started playing it in early september and im very glad i did everything about it is so loveable the less realistic stylized art style the map design the gamemodes the variety of the classes the satisfaction when you kill a really good player weapons hats and outfits and the constant stream of community made items in my opinion it is far better than other fps games on the market and its free without a doubt i recommend this game to anyone who wants exactly what team fortress 2 has to offer or someone who simply wants a game to be addicted to

review if you like a cartoony animated fps then this is your dream game it has good gameplay and the classes have their own strengths and weaknesses which makes gameplay very unique also the classes are made to work together to win a match my most favorite part of team fortress 2 the halloween event is my favorite part of tf2 its all crazy and very funny when you play on the halloween event maps but the downside is that you can only play the halloween event around the time of halloween i also like the unique classes what i dont like about team fortress 2 i think the prices on many items in the shop are outrageous they should also have more weapons instead of many more cosmetics also there needs to be a more secured vac valve anticheat system because i have been in games where the hacker doesnt take any damage i have played with at least 34 hackers in my entire time playing this game rating 80  10 really good
recommended
i connot think of a reason not t get this game as it is completly free and you can only pay $ to speed up unlocks even on old or lower end computers this game runs very smoothly so dont worry why dont you already have this game

this game is free and by god you will enjoy it america the blu soldier 1972 this game is pretty much the most fun you can have online its well balanced but still has a lot of variety between characters weapons etc and is pretty damn funny too i mean you can get a haunted haunter hat what else do you need to complete your life and of course its free and premium is enabled as soon as you buy any item even one of the weapons costing about 30p and is with you for life and enables trading and by extension the amazing economy the community has built up over the years to be fair though to ultimately succeed in this game you must own hats miscs maybe get some weapons help too but seriously get hats you wouldnt enter the worlds 1 warthemed hat simulator and not buy a hat would you so as we all know hats and even better unusual hats improve skill this game is technically pay2win but if you think you can handle the hattening and you have any space left on your computer get this theres no reason not to its free until hats and fun so yeah buy it now

this game is based around 9 classes fighting against another team of other classes in other words a team based game when ever you start playing you choose between a red or blue team and get to choose the class you want to play as the classes are scout soldier pyro demo man heavy engineer medic sniper and spy i reccomend if you are just starting to play this game do not start with playing spy he is the hardest class to master there are also a variety of game modes king of the hill capture the flag and payload are just a few of them here is a list of the pros and cons pros  free to play  variety of classes  variety of game modes  hats  lots of weapons for each class  constantly updated  a lot of humor cons  some bugs and glitches here and there hope this recommendation helped i encourage you to play this game thank you screamin eagles say soldier

recommended
without this game i would have never learned the conga for that reason this game is good
recommended
tf2 has had a strong community for many years and for good reason beneath all the weapon unlocks and silly cosmetics the game has one of the most balanced set of mechanics of any first person shooter that i have had the chance to play all the classes are situational allowing intelligent players to deal with a wide variety of situations the health mobility and damage of each class is fine tuned to make sure there is no clear cut best class and in less organized games one can do well with any class given enough experience each class presents such different game play that the replay value is very high and there are many populated servers to play on it also has a very active competitve scene for when you feel your skills have evolved to the next level overall tf2 is still around because it is a great game and i would certainly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a fast paced first person shooter with some comic relief
recommended
this is a great fps game it has a cartoony feel to it which is not very common among most first person shooter games however if you have played games like cod or other games with guns be aware that this is nothing like those it has specific classes with set weapons all classes have weaknesses and strengths not recommended for people who like to play offline either as the training games are not the best
recommended

alright its been a long time since i decided to have a legitamite review of tf2 up but i feel like its time to bring one back as a person whos sunk over 4000 hours into this game youre gonna bet this is gonna be a positive review my old review was pretty damn cruddy in the first place so i made it into a joke afterwards because it was the corniest pile of screws ive ever very poorly composed my first point to make the variety 9 classes was enough for a ton of people to buy this game even without hats new weapons or too many mapsgamemodes if thats not enough each gamemode has been updated to have atleast 3 maps except for tc tc only has one map and thats tc_hydro the objective of tc is to advance a couple stages capture the enemys point and protect yours in other words attack and defend cp maps minus the rest of the map as mentioned earlier a large amount of new content has spread around the game with the sniper vs spy update there came hats only a few but still hats i wasnt there myself but i can bet it wouldve been my new favorite toy the weapons which have been made at least once a year are always a nice twist to the game adding a new form of strategy offense defense andor mobility all weapons are a spice to that one bowl of noodles that make it seem like an entirely different game my second point to be mentioned how it was made tf2 has an odd way of how it was first born and how it eventually came to be what we love today starting as a simple quake mod made by 3 people its hard to believe that it became the tf2 that we or i love and know today it grew pretty damn quickly had its own maps in quake and was a huge hit in quake and team fortress quake was probably the biggest leap in what lead to tf2s hype well not tf2s hype valve eventually decided to accept them into them at their large success and allowed the production of a game on the halflife engine that was team fortress classic it was a higher balanced smoothed better quality game of team fortress theres not much else to say about it its last update was 2004 the community had not completely given up on staying with tfcs system a new game called fortress forever theres not much to say about it it was a slightly better version of tfc it never really did make it too far considering tf2 came out only one month later since then it has recieved multiple updates changes andor tweaks on tf2 my third point that is well the most interesting part of tf2 in my opinion the lore yep the lore its not well known to most tf2 players and most hardly ever take note of it alongside the updates every once in awhile tf2 always hides a little something that the community likes to take up on itself the love and war update for example it had an ongoing line of hints that there would be an update revolving bread and currently people believe there is a engi vs spy update coming up based on game file updates theres also comics that tf2 releases once in awhile the mention of jarate had a comic itself im not going to go into much detail about the lore because most of the fun of it is figuring the small things out yourself the fourth part i myself find a major detail that tf2 really adds trading yeah trading its gone downhill recently and many are quitting because of this im not going to go much detail about this cause its not really necessary in tf2 that you need hats but being able to trade weapons and cosmetics is a large part of tf2 being able to stem out in many directions tf2s economy has grasped an interesting way to donate to the game creators especially valve just know that when you buy something off of the mann co store the person who made that is payed and youre increasing the development speed of hl3 the fifth part of this review is simply put community now i cant stay positive with this entirely tf2s community is well odd to define tf2 is so far out there that it grabs attention of a lot of people its jammed with weebs and bronies not saying either of those are bad things to everyone i myself find both of those annoying at times as most most of them stay sitting in their own servers theres communitymade maps communitymade hats communitymade guns not saying that valves always too happy to accept those that or its just trying to form a suicide pact there are a lot of people in tf2 and its hard to pinpoint what would define tf2s community other than an evergrowing vast black hole and it sure as hell isnt going down just because the trading is going down the sixth and final part of this review extra stuff if you dont like fighting in tf2 and arent too happy with trading then thats alright theres tons of community created stuff that valve doesnt accept into the game that can still be ported into the game as a custom map custom weapon custom gamemode or something of the sort this cant really be put into a positive or negative form as im happy with how some of this turns out and some of it is well cannon fodder because the extra bits and pieces of tf2 are such a large piece of what makes tf2 so addicting ill be putting this into well just what its meant to be extra bits and pieces the weapons these can be found pretty much anywhere whether its on a times ten server tf2 tightrope hale or weaponizer most of these ideas are original or simple modifications of a weapon most of these add a spice to it that fulfill a gamemode or class to maximize what it was made for and accept it as an additional piece of the game when i say weapons most of what has been claimed is well a gamemode weapon yes most of its a gamemode weapon and you have to play the gamemode to actually experience it while it is rather strict the tf2 community is always coming up with new stats new models and new ways to play the game with weapons via the workshop the hats and cosmetics this is probably going to be my shortest paragraph to exist on this review its via the workshop valve gives you examples on what to make it with you make it it gets accepted you get some greens not paid mods but well content that becomes official the gamemodes whether its forming tf2 into a horror game with a dark enviroment somewhat scary unkillable bosses that crisp you alive or dragging yourself against a slope at lightspeed with flashy lights and upbeat music the gamemodes can easily turn what you thought was tf2 into something out of its capacity now when i say gamemodes i dont mean noncompetitive gamemodes those are gonna be in here for damn sure alongside weapons being added to fully experience a gamemode theres also competitive gamemodes ultiduo mge 6s 4s and highlander these gamemodes are also accomodated with websites with competitive tf2 involved including ugc etf2l asiafortress and much more theres badges lan tournaments and bets placed on players that can easily turn tf2 into a fun nonprofit game into a competitive sweaty tryhard moshpit where you want to win with everything you got not saying that it really is that competitive most tf2 competitive players are making jokes and get along pretty damn well in the community but it does go large when the players make it so i guess thats my review on tf2 8 years after its release still a large growing community with updates that supplies and endless amount of content that well does what its made for scare you infuriate you or make you feel like you could dig your fingers into a tree because you play it so ed much tf2s one hell of a game that i couldnt imagine ever dying out

this is the first steam game i got and i was immpresed on the quality of this free to play game in app purcahses may be required for certain content hats > i love the mann vs machine i have to comment about people saying that this game sucks because you get addicted to hats its not true who cares about hats if you want to waist money on fake pixelated items buy them all you want this game still is one of the best games ever plus its free

this is a great game its balanced and valve listens to its community it has an active trade community and has been going on for 7 years now wow

to put it shortly team fortress 2 is a competitive multiplayer fps with a loose spytech aesthetic and is one of valves more popular monetary juggernauts it was originally released in 2007 and was included in the orange box players choose from one of 2 teams and one of 9 classes and must fight to complete objectives for their chosen team that vary by game mode they can choose from a variety of weapons to aid in their missions and wear cool hats while doing so if they so choose valve are still generously and freely updating the game even more than half a decade after it was released with new bugfixes maps game modes and weapons they should however take a break  more on this below objectives range from capturing andor defending control points to capturing enemy intelligence while defending yours to pushing large bombs along rails to destroy the enemy base to banding together and fighting waves of killer robots and more there is a lot of variety here to say nothing of the custom maps and unofficial modes some of these are more prevalent than others however  not every mode fits the game equally well players are able to randomly find craft purchase from the microtransaction store or trade for different weapons that they can equip tf2 is not strictly paytowin because you are not required to spend money to gain weapons although it may be the fastest way to get them its also worth knowing that the default weapons are generally good and most of the other weapons are sidegrades most of them not all  a handful are still direct upgrades for some reason new players start off with only 50 inventory slots for any weapons they find if a player wants more space  and they probably will considering how many weapons there are these days  theyll have to go premium with a onetime microtransaction purchase there is also a much larger amount of optional cosmetic items to put on your characters acquired in largely the same way as the weapons these are completely optional but given that most tf2 players want to look pretty there is a sizable ingame trading economy that largely focuses on these cosmetic items of note are the keys used to open mann co crates which largely resemble a form of slot machine  except modern crates usually give you something nice killstreak counters that grant graphical effects weapons with persistent kill counters different taunts and of course more hats this is also completely optional and frankly an auxillary game function that i wish people wouldnt pay so much attention to keys also serve as one of the currencies in the tf2conomy and thats how valve makes money from this game dont be put off by the hats  team fortress 2 has some good gameplay the 9 classes are grouped into three categories which are more like loose guidelines and should be regarded as such the attack classes are the fast and doublejumping scout the jackofalltrades rocketslinging soldier and the flamethrowing ambushing pyro the defense classes are the versatile bombchucking demoman the heavy weapons guy with the huge miniguns and the engineer with his helpful buildings the support classes are the reallyquiteimportant medic the sniper and the backstabbing disguising cloaking sabotaging trickster spy most of the classes deliver differing gameplay experiences due to their abilities and mechanics this means that you can play just one or two classes that you really like or switch between any of the classes that your team or situation may need this is because the classes largely serve to fill separate niches and an effective team will contain a variety of classes  with some being more generally useful than others given the nature of the game youre bound to occasionally come across majority spy andor sniper teams which can be funny or annoying depending on your perspective tf2s general gameplay is slower than its halflife mod forebear team fortress classic and the original tf mod for quake especially when you compare player movement speeds this is however balanced by the more tactical nature of gameplay overall tactics revolve around frontlines and offensivedefensive pushes with the medics bercharges playing a vital role longtime veterans have also developed explosivejumping strategies for the soldier and demoman that can rival the player mobility of tfc as they fly towards the front lines this is of course assuming that you find a server with skilled enough players lowerlevel public servers including most of the official servers dont usually have the camraderie unfortunately there dont seem to be as many around as there was back when new weapons were regularly coming out around 20112013 but that could just be me tf2 doesnt take itself too seriously so you should be prepared to come across relatively easygoing players and matches as well if you find yourself dissatisfied or complaining about a game like this competitive tf2 is only growing stronger and pickup games or lobbies are good places to play more seriously  or even enter the scene proper with all this in mind you could compare tf2 to a sort of mmo fps it had persistent items and gameplay experiences that are built the same but can play out differently due to differing player tactics try playing the same 5 control point map for a while and youll see what i mean one other thing to note is that valve treats this game as a testbed an area for testing ideas that might not work so well the first time around this is just a useful thing to keep in mind i also mentioned that valve has continually added content to the game for most of its existence  from 2008 onward  which is especially admirable since theyve taken to adding communitycreated content unfortunately most of what theyve been adding for a while now has been large amounts of communitycreated cosmetic items since theres several hundreds of them in the game now along with oodles of particle effects weapons and other thingsthe size of the game has ballooned and optimization has taken a nosedive i really hope they take time off from their stated content first policy to do some housecleaning until then youll want a decently powerful machine to play this on  but avoid nvidia cards they dont like this games distinctive phong shading effect valves balancing act is not perfect either they continually make changes & additions that are not always wise and that some of the playerbase love to argue about overall though the game is usually balanced enough to have fun with while i recommend team fortress 2 as a great game overall i must also recommend you avoid the old steam users forums board for the game its an insular morose community of whiners who spam dumb memes and tired arguments and the remaining moderators seem to have all but gone into hiding if nothing else about tf2 interests you please at least take my advice on spuf

team fortress 2 three words to describe it are addicting superior and cosmetics the only problem is that once you buyfind a cosmetic you cant stop so unless you want this showing up on your screen rip wallet then i recommend limiting yourself to cosmetics but unfortunatly my rip wallet happend a very very long time ago but i would definetly recommed this game to the ages of 8 it is one of my favourite free to play action games on steam and if you do go on tf2 make sure to go on at halloween times because they are always fun so may the cosmetics be ever in your favour  the elite platypus

this game is unfathomably good i dont even like firstperson shooters and not only do i still like tf2 its actively my favourite game of all time there are 9 classes each with different playstyles and each with a bunch of different weapons you can use to finetune the class to how you want to play its impressive how balanced the game is  each weapon has benefits and drawbacks compared to the stock weapons you have when you first start the game there are a few whose benefits outweigh the drawbacks and viceversa and a couple that are literally direct upgrades but you never feel like youre at a huge disadvantage by not having certain weapons the fact that the games around 7 years old and theyre still updating it is incredible the mann vs machine update added a new game mode thats a sort of tower defence game it could have been its own $20$30 game but nope valve gave it to everyone for free there are some advantages premium players have over free players but none of them directly affect gameplay  premium players can keep more items and trade trading makes it so easy to get weapons and premium can cost less than a dollar so i really dont see any reason to not upgrade yourself to premium i guess at some point i have to talk about hats they seem silly right why bother making so much of the content have no effect on gameplay but thats exactly why they do it a new weapon isnt just about modelling and scripting you have to make sure its balanced and cant be exploited in any way but hats and other cosmetic items cant possibly be unbalanced so of course they can add a hundred hats easier than they can add one new weapon maybe they could focus more on weapons but there are already so many as it is you dont want to make it impossible for new players to catch up so obviously tf2 is amazing 1010 would play again and probably will this afternoon there are however a few drawbacks tf2s normal devotion to balance makes it all the more glaring when something isnt balanced the soldier has so much versatility in his weapons that its pretty easy to call him the best class in a game thats supposed to be about teamwork its pretty easy to see valve playing favourites with the soldier if some class has a weapon that players are favouring over the other options most of the time valve will nerf the overused weapon ex the spys dead ringer but for the soldier theyll just buff the underused weapons ex the concheror and battalions backup giving the soldier extra upgrades in mann vs machine also reeked of favouritism when its the spy and pyro who needed the help one other drawback is that the stores prices on weapons has absolutely nothing to do with how rare  common they are this isnt really valves fault but it makes a lot of things in the store complete ripoffs suppose you want a phlogistinator it costs $10 in the store or you could buy four keys $250 each each key is worth in the trading economy about 100 phlogistinators im not exaggerating phlogistinator 005  011 refined key about 866 refined basically once you know a little bit about the economy you feel like you have to really get into it so you dont get ripped off or maybe that was just me

this is the sexiest awesomest hatfilled freetoplay there is good on you valve
recommended
fun is quite frankly a complete understatement when describing this game fast crazy mind blowing maddening trouser tightening enlightenment is more like it recommended to just about everyone out there even if you dont like shooters then play it anyway for if you are someone who is not a big fan of shooting things then blow em up backstab em burn em bludgeon em headshot em hit em with baseballs and christmas ornaments freaking fly down from the sky and smash em over the head with a shovel do whatever just as long as there is carnage in this game then there is fun to be had also hats get those hats dammit and show em to your enemies
recommended
its amazing i am just getting started and so addicted
recommended
dont even get me started on this game i was introduced to it back in 2012 and since then i have never looked back unbelievably addictive team fortress 2 is one of the most well optimised consistent performing and superbly balanced games i have ever played and has no pay to win aspects at all a person who has had fps experience on computer can pick up the sniper on the first day of playing the game and come top scoring in a pub this game is so simple and complex at the same time which is why it is so much fun if you dont play this game more and have passed it over as another of valves ploys for money seriously think again because unlike what most comments say this game is more than just hats tf2 has teamwork that is unlike any fps i have played and puts cod and even battlefield to shame as it is almost impossible to lone wolf in this game even the pro snipers can get crowded by sphees or gibus scouts and get killed nobody is perfect give this game a go though just dont go full  and at least learn what things do by watching videos before playing dont be that spy that stabs the sentry  also please go medic if your team does not have one 1010 d

haha i love it when a pyro comes running at you swinging a great big sign at you had many laughs with this game note to self dont stand out in the open like a dy idiot or els ya 100% are gonna get sniped mate

team fortress 2 review game grade a explanation for rating team fortress 2 or tf2 is a wonderfully comical first person shooter the game does not focus on graphics or realism by any means unless beating down your foes with a lollypop is normal for you tf2 is quite enjoyable from a comical standpoint which is outstandingly hilarious something else you can enjoy in the game is the balanced game play will be addressed later in the review the replay value of tf2 is rather high due to the countless modded servers and new equipment you can unlock the game is very fun and you can rest knowing that the download time was well worth it seeing its a free game the only thing spent is time team fortress has a very unique and comical first person shooter aspect to it the fighting in the game is all based off of comedy weapons can range from a smelly fish to an actual hand cannon like weapons the equipment is quite entertaining for all of you that like first person shooters you shouldnt be afraid of this loss in realism there are still satisfying damage accuracy and unlocking systems that are involved this will keep you coming back to the game for newer and better weapons andor equipment in all combat is fun and takes skill to master the battlefield i think everyone can agree many games with potential are ruined by a paytowin system this is not true for tf2 every weapon and piece of equipment can be unlocked randomly throughout the game you can however pay to get something quicker also you are given crates which can be unlocked with a purchased key but again all the stuff can be earned some things are harder to get than others so dont expect to get all the great equipment right off the bat to sum it all up combat is fair and balanced as in most games people create modded servers these modded servers are for the most part fair and do not kill the game these servers tend to have the most people because they are very enjoyable while we are on the topic of players i would like to address the player base unfortunately there are some immature people on the mic you can avoid this problem by muting them and falling back into the focus of the game play other than that the community is still active and rather fun to play with all in all team fortress 2 is worth a try it is a great game you can play with friends and work forever on getting all the achievements if you are active in the steam market items can be traded and sold with ease i can promise you that you wont regret downloading this game
recommended
a very very fun game so fun that team fortress will sap your wallet
recommended
first its a fun game but then you get a hat then you want more hats and more and more and more and more and then you play the actual game and holy sht its a masterpiece best classbased shooter i have ever seen has a nice engine artstyle original fun weapons and cool game mechanics it also has mvm and of course and the upcoming bread monster turns out valve didnt add a bread monster shame on you valve shame on you

recommended
the ideal online shooter average player can enter the fray and even hurt somebody while pros will be grinding away milliseconds from the time to carry the suitcase on 2forts and all thanks to the fact that among the nine classes there is exactly zero useless ones the only serious drawback is the disgracefully low number of maps
recommended
2 teams 9 classes and a ton of maps and weapons to choose from ensure that this game has everything for any kind of player i have also met quite a few good friends on tf2 to me tf2 is one of the best games out there solely because of the amazing community the hours i have played speaks for itself its free go get this game
recommended
one of the best multiplayer games made to this day

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here
recommended
oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

help ive become addicted to this game no joke why you ask let me sum up my experience so far   first and foremost the game is quite original with its colorful and quirky characters which ive come to absolutely adore each character has their own stereotypical but hilarious personality and its really fun to watch them interact and talk being able to play as each is a blast community wise ive met a handful of awesome and cooperative people who are great to play with you never know who youll run into in online games but its totally worth it when people are friendly and talk to one another once in a while youll come across players that are complete jerks but i assure you that youll find a server with a bunch of dorks you can party and have fun with xd apparently i have been on tf2 for only 1578 hours total but it feels like at least a year i plan on continuing with this energetic and playful game for a long time to come aaaaaand i think thats all oh and before i forget just a word of advice to you newcomers make sure to get hats other than the ghostly gibbus

this games odd yet classic cartoon style shoot em up is unique yet lovable by players of all ages even if most players under 12 are loud squeakers most of them are great traders who really know what they are doing if you can get past the average scrub or bad egg you can find that the game is quite worth playing and yes it has the two roles of trader player or even both if daring you can have as much fun price picking as you can completing objectives in modes such as man versus machine control points or king of the kill can give you the weaponry or cosmetics to have the greatest time playing ever_grey zarcovski

i have played this game for few hours and its weird because everyone calls me a noob i dont know why maybe they are jelaous because i just got this awesome gibus thing hat for free and i think its the coolest hat in the game someone wanted to buy it once but i dont know how to trade so it didnt work out well to be honest i wouldnt have sold it because its awesome so i was wondering that does only good players get that hat or how to get it because there arent many people who have it i think i have seen few players wearing it and i was like omg you have this cool hat too and i tried to ask him how to get it but i guess he was too busy destroying everyone because he didnt even answer me well pro players dont have much time to chat back to others even though i had that same hat the strangest thing i was wondering was that how did i get that professional players hat so quickly i played this game for like 3 hours and i already had it maybe its because i have amazing call of duty skills well i stopped playing call of duty for good yesterday because i found this cool game where i dont need to do any teamwork so i can just kill everyone alone like in call of duty i had to do a lot of teamwork to keep everyone alive but here i can just go to a server and rek everyone who gets on my way so i started this game yesterday and i love it because i was already good in fps games like this so it didnt take more than like 1 hour for me to get used on this i would rate 10 bananas out of 8 strawberries for this game
recommended
game is cool but if ur thinking ur good at cod then you would be good at tf2well no this game is differenttheres a higherarchy noobsaverageprothis game takes some patients but i reccomend the game for people that have the time for games if ur like under 18 or 12 dont play becwell u knoq if you watch or been in a server with a squeker or a raging squeker
recommended
many firstperson shooters feel the same youre the only one that matters any weapon will kill in one to two hits the game takes itself way to seriously the main goal is kill kill kill overall it seems to me that most fps genre games are lacking a bit in the diversity department team fortress 2 addresses that by giving you a crazy colorful whackedout and unpredictable world to screw around in with nine classes to choose from each with his own arsenal of specialized and sometimes hilarious guns bombs and blunt instruments to do battle with youre presented with countless different play styles customizing the mercenaries with nonsensical wardrobe changes is a big part of the game as well just visualize a giant brutish man wearing a tutu team fortress 2 also encourages a team dynamic of sorts while you can go off on your own and sucseed coordination with other players is vital as each class has his own ways to help out his fellow mercenary i know this is quite the exstensive review on a free game but please heed my word and give this a shot im certain youll enjoy it

this game is probably the best thing to downloadit has great 60s cartoon style animationmainly made for the steam trading function and millions of fun custom servers this is a revoloutionary game and its suprising it took 3 final looksthe game has great functions and the more you play the more hatsweapons and taunts you will get and almost everybody on steam has this game in their libraryget it now so that you can get more stuff faster
recommended
technically this game has everything from a steady stream of new content & events as well as community made content and all the loving care the valve tf2 team can give like a mother goose would care for its younglings but the overabundance of children really took its toll on this game throughout the years for me tf2 gradually stopped being a fun shooter in recent times and started to look more and more like a ballpit at the mac donalds and i always knew that at some point the fun was going to stop so i have decided that its time for me to part ways from this game and focus on other goals dont let this influence your first impressions about this game though after all this time and the many hours i put into this game i can look back at tf2 in a very positive way and had some of the most memorable gaming moments during my time as a tf2 regular its free to play so the good part is that its easy to give it a try free of charge to see if tf2 is the game you are looking for just be patient with the game though its easy to play but takes some time to master anyway i hope to have helped you with my review whether you have found your new nr1 game or have decided to keep looking a little furhter i am happy to have played a small part in it all the best sie

the intuitive deduction that is associated whilst playing this hilarious game is impeccable this is both fun and challenging which also allows one to customize their players via the location of common to rare items hats are always fun but my favourite has to be the tide turner a shield for the demo knight with a turn rate of 100% accompanied by an instant recharge if used successfully if youre looking for an fps game that is not too competitive but very fun totally download this game it is a must have plus its free

is gud has hats 1010 would play again

a masterpiece by valve corp team fortress 2 blows team fortress classic out of the water new classes weapons and hats appear to make the game more fun every class is individual and completly different from one another spies might be gabe newells favorite class but theyre hard to play as one people have invented other game modes such as sandbox slender fortress 2 freak fortress 2 and more this makes the game even more diversified and gives players a new experience if they cannot buy the games they originally come from valve has done an amazing job with this game and it is a huge improvement i expect valve to keep this game up and running for a long time with multiple matches like control points capture the flag briefcase and payload  payload race its a game that you will never get bored with one thing valve should do with team fortress 2 is to add more payload race maps this game is going to be free to play forever so feel free to get it whenever you want there are also good features like trading crafting and the mann co store even a training mode was added otherwise i give team fortress 2 a 1010 legendary

you must click that download button this is probably the best f2p game for ex you dont have to pay for weapons only if you pay some amount of money you earn only cosmetic items and you can trade but trading is very important if youre not f2p but of course the game is not about trading but about playing and killing people matethere are 9 different classes to play my favourite class is soldier he has rocket launcher shotgun and shovel as stock weapons but his best ability is rocket jump you have to crouchjump and shoot rocket under you and you wont believe yer eyes youre in the sky if you did it correctly thanks hope this help i recommend you to spend some money to buy hats and earn some respect i did it and its great you must try it
recommended
this game is absolutely excellent for anyone who likes fps games

team fortress 2 is an amazing game it is very skill based unlike other games such as cod tf2 has no weapon unlock system and the weapons are as balanced as possible unlike games like cod where a weapon is better than another no matter what the game play is very fast and fun you need to pay attention to everything around you in order to play at the best of your abilities even though there is a limited number of weapons there is quite alot though there is always new gameplay stratigies and tactics to discover and learn no one class is the best class to play each one has their own advantages and disadvantages that may make it better to take out one class but harder to counter another many people that begin playing tf2 often give up quickly thinking they are not good enough but everyone needs practice we all started bad at one time even if you are not getting alot of kills you can still be a great deal of help to the other team by being a distraction providing health and damage buffs or picking off a single class on the other team that would otherwise give your team a dissadvantage regarding the trade system i consider it a quite good economic simulator i have used the trade system to gain funds in my steam wallet and buy even more games without the need to spend alot of cash in real life team fortress 2 also has things such as a costom scripting system and the ability to make your own hats and game modles but that is mostly not for all people and tf2 is not generally played for that
recommended
this game is 1010 would paly agin super mega awsome game i recomend it gretly

u cant get enough of this game something new happens everyday when i play tf2 and its awsome to play mvm with friends what i really like about this game is the funny charecters lines and charecteristics with the workshop its really fun cause u never know what new stuff there will be in the game i totaly recommend this 100% this is the best online miltiplayer game for me
recommended
many people wonder why one plays tf2 when there are many other better online shooters i simply say to them you dont pay a dime to waste your time of course it is not a complete waste of time the thing that makes tf2 unique is that it is not just a shooter it is a stabber healer runner sneaker jumper builder burner boomer and of course a team strategy game it has spawned many internet memes and youtube videos and has many different weapons and customization items of course it would take hours to describe the whole game so i will just say this install the game try it out and have fun

the most awesome first person shooter ever i started off as a f2p like almost everyone else some time went by and now i have over 1000 hours of playtime and i became one of the many virtual hat traders this game is not all about shooting the bad guys and winning the game this game has a whole economy running behind it and when i first discovered trading i became obsessed with it i learned everything about the prices and i am still learning new things the game also has a fantastic community constantly providing content in the steam workshop while valve decides which content is being added to the game besides the trading and the awesome community it also has great gameplay what makes me play it more is the amount of fun i have while ingame like in every match i play there will be something that gives me a big smile on my face is there someone in the server annoying you with micspamming or just being a total  you can mute kick and ban that er thank you valve for that what also makes me play the game more is the great sense of humour the personalities of the 9 classes are so well thought out and they all have great voice lines to win the game you have to work together with your team you can try to win without them but that is basically impossible its the best teamworkbased hat simulator fps on the planet what else needs to be said 1010 go play it now

gameplay is horrible and poorly made cod blows this out of the water the only redeeming quality of this game are the hats nothing like scamming 12 year olds out of their virtual headwear and shiny weapons that they bought with their moms stolen credit card 1110 would recommend
recommended
probably the most fun and balanced multiplayer fps in the history of steam and maybe the history of fps definetely worth playing
recommended
want fast paced action want hours of entertainment from the stupidest of things want constant updates that will break the game look no further than team fortress 2 valves sequel to the even more broken team fortress classic delivers non stop surprises as you journey through a dessert and a factoryand a barn in order to complete objective such as pushing and standing youll start your voyage as a f2p gibus but once you earn your wings youll notice people with shiny guns and fancy hats from then on your life will be hell trading and trading metal and hats just to get the one unusual to make it all worth it and youll be trapped unable to escape the reality that youve playec this game for nearly 700 hours also if youre a sensitive impressionable youngster make sure to disable multiplayer sprays not as bad as gmod good game i r8 88

epic story line ending makes me cry everytime

tf2 is your average team based game there are multiple different classes from scout soldier spy etc all with different abilities and weapons the twist to this game is you can decorate your characters with hats and cosmetics i think this is a great idea as it can make you unique from all the different players i also like it from your different qualities of weapons unique strange feative unusual etc the down side to this game is the fact that me personally got quite addicted to it
recommended
i bought this when i first got steam but originally didnt enjoy it between having an old computer and a terrible internet connection the game was practically unplayable but about 2 years ago i upgraded both a couple of months ago i decided on a whim to give it another go this game is a lot of fun the balance between the players is fantastic with the shortrange but very powerful pyro to the far more tactical demoman you can find what suits your flavor of play
recommended
fast paced yep

team fortress 2 allso known as the game i used to play alot back in 2009 the game have had  ton of updates so you can expect alot from it if your new to it the game offers up to 9 unique classes scout soldier pyro demo heavy engineer medic sniper and spy ech has their own role and sort of an objective to achive when your playing in matches spy for example can take out engineers buildings and backstab people pyro is really good for clearing the path with his flamethrower and taking care of spies medic heals and has the ability to ubercharge wich makes the players untouchable the game offers alot of game modes such as payload were you push a bomb to the enemy teams point capture the point capture the flag arena and the games populure mode mvm mann vs machine the game focuses most of cooperating with your team at max if your not chances are your gonna lose plus the game has hatscuz why not xd valve loves hats and the game has alot to offer some may say its the ultimate hat collacting simulator game mixed with first person shooter yes and no you dont really need to collect hats since they dont really offer anything special however due to the fact that hats has become a huge thing theres no wonder people would think that i would personaly say that valve made a great gameonly they kinda ruined it to this day there are major bugs and glitches some that hasnt been fixed for weeks or months some weapons have been nerfed so much some are considered useless like the tomislav for heavy there are allso problems finding normal servers nowdays since apearently the comunity finds valves servers unintresting some do otrhers not the comunity itself is pretty decent most of them are quite friendly and some may even offer help if your premiumactually payed for the game there would be no suprise if the half of you have quited playing tf2 i myself have found tf2 less intresting becouse of all the negative reasones if your new however pick this game up its really fun and it will drain alot of hours from you

i learned how to be a weeb with the nerds on this game 911 would recommend
recommended
if youre a fan of shooters but are getting tired of call of duty notei have nothing against cod then this game is just for you while the cartoony style might throw you off that doesnt stop it from being a fun game you can choose from nine classes the scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and the spy while you play the game you can sometimes get item drops that consist of weapons of different varieties of classes crates that you can unbox with keys from the games equivalent of the market and hats and other apparel so you can customize your classes to look the way you want these items however are quite rare to obtain from drops and youll have to get them by either unboxing crates or buying them from others the currency equivalent of this game is metal to be more precise scrap metal reclaimed metal and refined metal how you can get this is by crafting two weapons of the same class to make one scrap metal then you combine three scrap metal to make a reclaimed metal then combine three reclaimed metal to make a refined metal this is the slowest form of gathering metal which is what the community calls scrap banking theres also the form of selling your weapons on trade servers or the more recommended form a website called tf2outpostcom this is the more recommended form of getting scrap in my opinion but thats not the focus to help you understand the gameplay a bit more im going to tell you about how each class works scout the scout is the fastest class in the game and has the primary weapon the scattergun the secondary weapon the pistol and a melee weapon of a bat all classes have a primary secondary and melee weapon of different varieties the scout is recommended for people that just wanna get in the front lines and just destroy everyone the downside to the scout is the low health this flaw is why you shouldnt just run into classes like the heavy and soldier so recklessly soldier the soldier is one of the slowest classes in the game but its quite understandable with the weapons he has his weapons consist of a rocket launcher a shotgun and a melee weapon of a shovel the soldier is recommended for people that are good at prediction and just wanna do a lot of damage but its because of these that also make it his flaw if someone is good enough as a scout they can just run around and just sap up damage and pyros are quite the same pyro the pyro is essentially the easy class of the game making up a flamethrower and a fire axe the pyros recommended for people just starting to get into the game but other than that aspect its not a very good class for people that have a lot of experience with the game demoman now this is quite a fun class for both newcomers and experienced players his weapons consist of a grenade launcher a sticky bomb launcher and a beer bottle the demoman is recommended for again anyone really but its not for everyone note i know it sounds like im contradicting myself here but what im saying is that i recommend it to everyone but the class itself might not be for you his flaw is that he isnt very fast and his weapons while as fun as they are all depend on your skills of prediction like the soldier thats basically what the demoman is just a soldier but with grenades and bombs heavy this is a class that hardly anyone uses unless youre defending the heavy is the slowest class in the game consisting weapons of a minigungatling gun a shotgun and his fists yes the minigun does immense damage but what happens when you run out of ammo youll have to rely on your shotgun which wont be very effective against almost every class in the game this is why the heavy isnt played very much but that doesnt mean that he isnt fun to use the whole way through engineer now this is a class that has a lot to be said the engineer is by far the most complex character gameplay wise his weapons consist of a shotgun a pistol a wrench and his buildings that are a sentry gun a dispenser and a teleporter entranceexit these buildings can be upgraded using metal not the kind for currency but this metal is specifically for the engineer when you do upgrade your sentry it can do massive damage and can soak up more damage then a level 1 sentry would you can only level your buildings up to a level three dispensers give you health and ammo while teleporters well teleport the more theyre upgraded the more health and ammo your dispenser gives and the faster your teleporters cool off but beware of spies because they can sap your buildings which result in the buildings being destroyed if you dont get rid of them but thats about all i have to say for this class on to the next one medic this is one of the most useful classes in official servers but when it consists of other servers such as trade servers and saxton hale you wont get much to work with the medics weapons consist of a syringe gun a medigun which can heal your teammates and a bonesaw when you heal your teammates long enough you earn what is called uber once your uber is full you and your teammate can be invincible for a short amount of time other than that there isnt much left to talk about sniper for all of you cod players out there youll either fit right at home or stay as far away from this class as virtually possible but anyways the sniper does well snipe his weapons consist of a sniper rifle an smg or to be more precise a small machine gun and a kukri which is basically a small sword the sniper has a comfortable speed and is fun to use if you know how to rack up the headshots the only way to actually make any sort of progress like that though is to find a safe spot and just go crazy just watch out for spies though they can backstab you while youre dominating everyone spy this is the final class in the game and is by far the hardest to perfect the spy lives well up to his name with weapons consisting up of a revolver a sapper a knife a disguise kit and a cloaking device the spy is quite versatile if you know what youre doing the knife you have can backstab someone which kills them in an instant no matter what class you are this mechanic is the stuff of nightmares for engineers and snipers unless you have a certain item for the sniper which is called the razorback which prevents spies from backstabbing you the cloaking device does just that cloak but its only for a short amount of time so dont even think of trying to exploit the sapper can be put onto enemy buildings to destroy them but they cant be destroyed instantly so youll have to make sure engineers dont destroy them watch out when you try to sap sentries if youre not disguised itll utterly decimate you before you can even get close to you the spy is the weakest class with the same amount of health as the scout other than these factors theres really nothing else to talk about well anyways thats all you need to know about the game of team fortress 2 i immensely recommend this to any shooter fans out there that just want a change of pace
recommended
i highly recommened tf2 i would say it has the best community for a game in the world if your into having fun with friends or taking games more seriously this is the game for you public server are avalable all over the world where you can play with friends and have a lot of fun but tf2 is a two sided game one side where you play the game casually and hang out with friends on public servers etc the other side is a major part of tf2 being the competitive where you take the game seriously the most common formats to play competetive tf2 in is 6v6 where you have 2 scouts 2 soldiers 1 medic and one demo the other format is highlander where a team has 9 players 1 of every class now i just pointed out the basics of this game i would recommend this game to people who like to play with a team using teamwork to win
recommended
really fun i enjoy playing this game theres a wide variety of characters to match your playstyle so you wont feel left out the controls are pretty standard and easy to learn but the best thing is it is free i strongly reccomend this game you have nothing to lose ^^

to begin i would like to say that tf2 is a f2p game and i would recommend it to anybody the following is a shrek is love shrek is life parody that is child friendly i was only 13 years old i loved tf2 so much i had put countless ammounts of money onto steam to get al the tf2 miscs every night i pray to the scout soldier engineer medic sniper spy heavy and demos that i would get a good trade in the morning my parents hear me and say i have an addiction i knew he was jeleous of my pro skills at tf2 so i said he should leave me alone my parents ban me and send me to sleep i know i will never gte my level three chin anymore now i feel a warmth approaching me in my bed its a fat engineer that says i see you found my teleporter enterance i tell the fat engineer that i am ready he gets out a chair and sits down drinking beer he offers me one now but i say no i feel my eyes tearing at his fat face but i know that one day i want to be like him so thats my parody of shrek is love shrek is life please go check out the video afterwards if you already havnt to understand this fully warning thhis vidoe on youtube will contain rude words and scenes so in the end i think of tf2 as a fantastic game

i dont play many shooters but when i do i prefer team fortress 2 this game breaks the mold with its clever cartoony humor unique identifiable characters creative weapons different game modes and diverse balanced classes with their own unique playstyles i enjoy teambased games and while im not particularly good at this game it hasnt gotten any less fun in all the time ive played it
recommended
do i really need to explain what this game is are there actually people who dont know what tf2 is holy  okay lets start the review team fortress 2 is a classbased fps that recently became freetoplay where two teams of varying classes are pitted against eachother in a variety of game modes including everything from capture the flag to push the cart its different from other fps games that take themselves seriously with brooding and mature themes this game dosent take itself seriously at all thats what makes it so much fun and so appealing to everybody it has colorful cartoonish characters think looney toons but with more blood and wacky weapons and maps the best thing about tf2 is its absolutely bonkers sense of humor and while this makes it so awesome some more serious players might be turned off by how wacky it can be me on the other hand i ing love it its the perfect game to play when you just dont give a  the game emphasizes on fun and isnt exactly the most balanced thing in the world but you probably wont notice since youll be laughing your  off the good  wacky & humorous world filled with lovable iconic characters  fun colorful blood soaked world  tons of user generated content  massive dedicated playerbase  dedicated servers duh  hats  its made by valve what more do you want the bad  upbeat colorful setting might not be for everyone like emos lol  balance never heard of it  its not halflife 3 or is it the ugly what the spy probably did to your mom last night bottom line if you have a sense of humor go ing download this game what the hell are you doing with your life if you dont go play bingo at the retirement home across the street you know the one httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhan3afjh210 ohh theyre going to have to glue you back together in hell  910

team fortress 2 is a game hard to write a review for its constantly updated new things are always added mostly hats but valve does a good job keeping it alive the community ingame is a bit like being in the deep end of the pool not expecting whats to come when you go deeper into the pool some people are generally nice to talk to and very kind some are a  and racists but hey its the internet what can you do but generally people are nice classes are balanceda bit to a point where most of the time classes can kill each other easily if you play that class really well the classes have their pros and cons but its really all up to how you play that specific class mvm is a bit of a push and shove trying to get a good team that does not compose of prepubescent children who have such a squeaky voice they could do a voice over for mickey mouse if need be but mvm is a nice addon for tf2 killing robots instead of mercs as i said before tf2 is hard game to make a review about but its really funbuggy sometimes but the bugs usually get patched quickly

i main medic so i dont really know how to play this game
recommended
the epitome of multiplayer fpss freetoplay with a huge emphasis on game balance however this game is incredibly difficult to just start playing theres a steep learning curve that lies within the classes themselves and some unfamiliar game mechanics the main thing that sets this game apart from well any other game in the genre is the classes every class has their own unique abilities with only one notable class that id consider good all around the soldier however he has some drawbacks hes slow to reload his movement speed is the second lowest there is no definitive best class or worst class each of them have their own important roles and often become less useful in large numbers the huge variety of weapons is incredible and in the same respect can be kinda confusing i truly cant recommend this game to anyone who isnt willing to actively learn about it first as it can be frustrating to not be able to understand the opposition and constantly get called a gibusvision f2p knowing is in fact half the battle

dota 2 is better then this garbage and that says a lot when all i see in dota 2 is a black and blurry screen at least farming simulator is more action packed then this i would rather spend my time playing modern warfare 3 aka 420qu1cksc0p3 bl4z3 it simulator but hey if you always dreamed of having a multitude of hats like i did when i was a wee little boy then this is the game for you
recommended
after hockey when i was ten i would come home and play on well servers for hours most people completely ignore the game based on the fact that half of the tf2 community are hat crazy people besides that this game means something special to me

team fortress 2 is a multiplayer shooter that defines its genre every class is a completely different challenge to master and just when you get tired of how they play you can use a different item set which require some work to unlock to completely change the game with a variety of gamemodes including the recentlyreleased mann vs machine hoarde mode that all add whole new layers of replayability to the game keep it fresh even 6 years from initial release team fortress 2 is possibly the best freetoplay game on the market and you have absolutely no reason to not give it a try

tf2 is one of the best multiplayer games around its design and art direction lend to its fun and friendly atmosphere the majority of players ive encountered are welcoming and helpful although still remain competitive one of tf2s biggest strengths but also one of its downsides is variety when it was first released tf2 was a fairly simple game of two teams pitted against each other players could pick from a variety of nine classes which each filled and suited a role either defensive supportive or offensive play the maps were few but well designed and allowed players to start to adapt and learn new tricks and skills valve supported this and to stop the game from going stale brought out secondary weapons and then cosmetic items such as hats sometimes the new weapons would cause chaos as they were big game changers and allowed defensive classes to be better at offensive play valve always implemented fixes and through numerous updates introduced more items maps and gamemodes this kept the game feeling fresh and reinvigorated the playerbase tf2 has always been an game that valve has experimented with it introduced cosmetic items crafting additional media such as video content and comics to the valve audience this meant that tf2 has always been changing which can sometimes lead to times when it can be annoying to play overtime the game has become more demanding in terms of computer resources and seems to also suffer slightly from being on the older source engine sudden framerate drops can be common when it has been updated but generally these are ironed out my overall thoughts on tf2 is that it is still a fantastic game the gameplay is top notch and you rarely feel frustrated when you die the player base overall is great with a good community although there are poor players and servers here and there mainly tf2 is fun and humorous this is enhanced by the great character designs taunts and oneliners that are uttered by the classes it encourages players to worry less about losing and to just enjoy the game the variety of gamemodes and maps is vast maybe a little too much as i feel the game has become a bit saturated with content it can be a overwhelming at times or feel like a chore to manage items that are randomly dropped some players thrive on that as there is a marketplace for trading but it is one activity i have no interest in my interest in tf2 peaked a few years back it waned during a period of constant updates that crashed the game for me or caused texture bugs that however is tf2 you can play it for months and then a few updates will be made that change the game or introduce new elements it is an accepted part of the game

the cat in the hat game is designed for parents and children to play together the rules are simple and the game is played in the same manner every time so children can quickly become comfortable with the game this game teaches and reinforces early reading skills children look for letters that form words and learn to recognize words as they see them paired with pictures the game also features counting matching and introductory strategy skills since the game is not over until the last player reaches finish every player stays involved in the game until the very end

best game ever the excitement the tense moments getting that high killstreak doing those rocket jumps bashing the enemy with a bat ubering your teammates to victory headshotting the gibuses chain stabbing the cart mauling down the defense with a minigun and burning everything down this game still succeeds to entertain me after being out for over 10 yearsits not all about hats but theyre pretty to look at investing $10 into keys can get you full and nice loadouts for all classes but what i love the most is that this game is a derp i love being able to do the square dance with an enemy or laugh at a rancho relaxing engineer this game is so much fun 1010

okay finally reviewing it team fortress 2 was my first love it was what it made me get steam and even if i preffer the classic for my reasons and even if i was  at it because people mocked that i was nonpremium user i learned to ignore that fact and enjoy the actual game youll love tf2 for the game not the hats not the weapons just the proper game mann vs machine payload and a lot of new unique game modes are waiting for you its free go ahead and get it if you havent already

yeah when i play heavy a lot of stuff goes over my head too since its such a complex class a lot of people think its just an easy class where you hold m1 over the enemy but they dont understand that m2 allows you to spin your barrel but not fire which can fake the enemy out in fact one of the most exciting meta games in tf2 is watching two heavies duke it out since a lot of times its really not about aim but about the sheer determination and willpower and how badly each player wants it

very fun would reccomend d

oh man this game ohohohohohohohoh man i get to make 10 year olds cry while wearing fashionable hats what more could you want

i think this game needs alot of practice and learning to be fully apreacated as the obsevisecompuslive spending simulator it is really i dont think cosmetics are as important to gameplay unless through the community the only redeaming quality is well the quality the gameplay is real smooth and well addicting and fun i dont think spending money or scamming or trading is all that important but when you play this you can hear and smell the effort and time put in to make this game a working fun and overall great gaming experiance the community can be harsh at moments but usually you can make real friends unless your a

oh boy team fortress 2 where to start gosh i have over 400 hours docked into this game this game is endless enjoyment and despite the fact there will be trolls and whiney cussing eight year olds the game itself makes up for all of this im not the best tf2 player but i enjoy playing the game for the game unfortunately most people for some reason tend to overlook the team in team fortress 2 and dont cooperate as a team all the time but when you get a good team or some good competition its easily enjoyable many people on team fortress 2 are friendly at least most of the time but of course not everyone that plays the game is mature nor a goodsport but more often than not there will be some friendly people on a server ive made a bunch of friends just from meeting friendly people on team fortress 2 if you like a good fps with silliness fun and of course hats then team fortress 2 is the game for you pros free extremely addictive fun well made hats several different gamemodes did i say hats different cosmetic items including hats x3 for the classes hilarious moments 1000s of different items trading profit cons 4 out of 5 servers will either have or eventually get a whiney micspamming cussing 510 year old some people get too into the game sometimes and take everything personally you will find yourself investing over 400 dollars into the game x3 you will slowly have your mortal soul taken from you by the game boot camp bears the dread of a horrible team mann up bears the dread of a boot camp team people who like to think everytime they kill someone is the time to rant or spam rekt [most] freetoplays are often gibuspyrovisionbearing micspamming little kids [most] freetoplays are awfully annoying at times otherwise team fortress 2 has many more pros that i cannot take the time to list right now but if you can deal with suddenly looking at your credit card balance then realizing you just blew your last 5 paychecks on tf2 or all the whiney 510 year olds then team fortress 2 is a great game and i truely recommend this game i give it a 2010 if you decide to download team fortress 2 i hope to see you sometime in the game trixie out

hat simulator  every year

really addicting and fun game
recommended
ive had countless hours of constant fun with this game i grew up playing this and ive made almost half of my steam friends through it i just absolutely love the concept and idea of this game im always getting into duels and battles to see whos better among my friends we play arena to see who lasts the longets last person standing and i usually get into the mediocre sort of range im nothing special at the game but i see myself as a pretty good scout an ok medic a good heavy and a great sniper i find all sorts of different ways to traverse all sorts of maps as scout and test my sharpshooting on 2fort as sniper ive played with lots of nice people and on servers with plugins that allow you to get upgrades and buffs kind of like an overpowered version of mann vs machine in which you and your team of 5 others fight for a certain amount of rounds against robots and they keep getting harder and harder just wait until the tank comes then you have a fullteam target great game overall and you should definitely get this game
recommended
i recommend this game because its fun and how it shows versatility and usefulness of every class
recommended
tf2 being another one of valves best which is about every one of them games is a fps based around 9 classes in colourful and fun maps the game is of course also known as hat simulator 2 as hats are what you do to display your skill even though said hats are purely cosmetical this game has sucked up almost 2000 hours of my life and was the one game to get me into steam as tf2 is completely free to play purchasing any item in the ingame store upgrades your account to premium allowing for a couple of perks as a free hat and more ingame item drops it should also be mentioned that even though it is f2p there is no need to pay if youd like to win you can get the weapons from in game drops achievements or a clever crafting system and i can almost guarantee that youll be enjoying this game from start to end give it a shot it is free after all 910 this game is at its best with the real f2p and the userfriendlyness but it does have a couple of bugs and annoying things which will get on your nerves if youre looking for a casual fps with competitive possibilities check out tf2

this is my favorite game this game have very loot of items and things what you can do

hat simulator 2 is an allaround great game and has been for a long time

team fortress two is one of those games where you can play it once a week or you can play it every day for hours of fun the cartoon artstyle along with the humour is very much appealing to the casual gamer and also a well polished and balanced competitive scene for the hardcore gamers i have 30000 kills on my sniper rifle and im still not bored siink

welcome to profit simulator 20xx the jist of this game is to buy stuff as cheap as possible sell that stuff as expansive as possible then rinse and repeat i dont always play this simulator as the gameplay gets quite repetitve and its hard to get items that are on fire cause fire n warm glowy stuff  trading cornmunity on a regular basis other than these flaws the gameplay is fine you have 9 classes scout he has 50% profit and 75% chance of ruining your day and sadly you can only play him in 4 colors black white pink and green he isnt a very good stealth class because his vibrant colors standout on the maps making me think they didnt think it through when choosing his color scheme soldier he has 40% profit 15% speed and 60% dressing apeal he too falls to the same flaws as the scout having only 2 color choices pink and green despite his 15% speed he can sacrifice a chunk of his health to do a super jump although they say you use the rocket launcher to do this you end up exploding into millions of pieces you actually hold down right click to charge it and let go while looking up to perform this move this class is overall good and can help you out if making profit is a bit time consuming and boring with his increased dressing apeal can add a few extra hours of fun just by dressing him up pyro he has 25% profit 999% speed while target is in contact by flames 85% outfit diversity and 65% more confusion her main weapon is the flamethrower which allows major bursts of speed if you set people on fire making him a very interesting but new players should avoid using her as his most game changing ability is her comrpession blast which can defend you by deflecting rockets grenades plasma grenades ariplanes soldiers wild cabermen and steam flash sales but you have to time his ability or else youll be hit which is why she isnt recomended for new players with the highest outfit diversity in the game he can create intersting and profitable combos which also requires a decent amount of experince to even pull off demoman has 35% profit 50% boom 25% outfit diversity 999% damage only active with stock secondary and 45% stealth only active during the night this unique looking individual is the explosive expert of the team with his loadout that consist of sharp blades shields and boots making him an agile tank of destruction pairing this up with the stock secondary makes you invincible because your aura becomes so strong from the damage increase everything gets ripped from reality and only requires you to press two buttons repeatedly making him easily the best class in combat unfourtunatly despite his godly stats in combat he falls short in profiting abilities with having outfits of things from the past making diversity a problem and can hinder his profit stat heavyweapons has 35% speed 90 more ammo 10% profit 60 more gun 45% outfit diversity 175 bulk this character is a mixed bag for combat and profit his combat ability is soaking damage and retaliating but he is slow forcing him into a more defence gameplay which can be quite slow and doesnt feel rewarding and the fact that demomans damage is off the charts the heavy can only last 3 seconds once he enters the demomans 30 metre aura making this class redundant as for profit he can be very effective if you can find someone who prefers this characters outfits which because of his offical mascot status can make this quite easy to find oh an also the heavy has a hidden ability called thick fat which makes him take 50% less damage from temperature based attacks the engineer has 35% profit 90% calm down 35% fun and 20% height dont look at that 20% height as a bad thing that can be the difference between life and death even though the characters share the same hit boxes for most projectiles and with his sentry gun ability you can create a machine gun that has aimbot and can even upgrade it to shoot rockets aswell making this class easily the most defensive class and with his 90% calm down stat makes him a good switch after a stressful day of ripping people off the engineers outfit divirsity is interesting and quite large but nothing like the pyros the elusive medic has 0005% speed 80% happiness 45% damage 60% crit ratio 90% common the medic is a god send in the metagame and has the most complex and useful magic attacks in the game with such abilities such as partner shield skill crits and restore these along can be used together to create devastating combos that can counter even the demomans destructive aura which is why they used this spell combinations on the already powerful demoman to tripple his auras damage and radius the truth to why the medic is so powerful is because of how rare and fragile they are but when someone experienced enough gets ahold of one they can unleash hell the medic is soley combat orientated the only ability in profit he is capable of is restoring hats to their original form sniper has 90% common 90% new players 100% usefullness in large numbers 70% productivity 35% vision and 75% interesting outfits this class can be beast in the hands of a pro but will still be destroyed by demomen making him pointless and all you can do for fun is scope in atleast with soldier and scout you can do something intersting with them and too many new players choose him like some kind of god or something as if its the  in some other game or something like and fail with him that and then we end up having just scouts snipers and spies its just as bad for profit they only have 2 colors pink and green which is a small choice for making profits plus people are lazy with how they look and take the generic stuff angus hood outback interlectual that berret with a little shield on it those sound thingys from apple that hurt your ears and that leather thing for his face and nothing else making him a very linear and boring class combat and profit wise spy has 80% commons 90% new players 80% usefullness in large numbers 55% productivity 60% style 75% visibility and 55% stealth the spy has the same faults as the sniper combat wise the demomans arua wrecks him and and too many inexperienced players choose him the worse part is that they dont even bother trying to use the revolver his only way of selfdefense other than the energy shield watch along with this he is a very paitent and slow class that requires finding the right momment to strike and the right momment to run profit wise he has a hole wardrobe of stylish fedoras and diverse suits making him a very interesting class for profiting if youre a fan of tycoon games this might be right up your alley 8910

reviews for the deaf and hard of hearing rereviewing  overall game tf2 is fantastic there are a horde of game modes to play that can keep you coming back to this old game for a while while i prefer mvm these days i do often play community servers for a good ctf or payload round accessibility gameplay like most fps games tf2 uses wasd space and control for mobilityrelated issues keys can be easily rebound to whatever suit your capabilities i rebound cruch to space and jump to a side mouse key for example as for sound with the exception of spies and spyrelated events such as sapping of your equipment there are visual cues to accompany the audio for some weapons that you can hear being fired you may not be able to see that youre being shot at such as some sniper rifles this is something to watch out for for gameplay accessibility i give it 1010 you can realistically play and succeed at all of the normal nonmod game modes available with or without sound subtitles & captions for deafhoh gamers tf2 offers subtitles and captions  something valve has a solid history of providing ive found the default captions lacking in mvm however fortunately there is a way to use external captions and i have turned to clovervidia for that httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid167785751 as a deaf gamer i use captions over subtitles whenever i have the choice as the distinction tends to be between important information in captions and flavor text in subtitles that said i have not used the subtitles option for tf2 for captions i give it 610 normally 910 with external captions such as from clovervidia chattingcommunicating tf2 supports ingame voice communication but the pacing of the game does not make it essential gameplay can tolerate typing so many other players in servers tend to have no problem accommodating having to type even so many game modes dont require much communication for casual play for mvm typing can be made difficult at times and this problem can be exacerbated by queuing random teams each time you play and having to explain things repeatedly which can be a gamble ive written a guide to try to standardize voicebind calls in mvm until valve changes voicebinds to be more inclusive if ever httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid358478951 overall accessibility tf2 incorporates visual signals for almost everything that happens in game its ability to rebind keys and add custom captions make it pretty accessible for most deficits in the gaming population overall 910

amazing game for casual play and tycoonlike economic building of your items i reccomend 9510
recommended
a great game if not for its general replay value then for the exciting personalities and circumstances afforded to each character as opposed to simply playing soldier x or survivor y youre controlling a specialized class complete with an identifiable appearance and unique characterized voice casting i purchased this game a few years ago unfortunately a very short time before it went freetoplay but i do not remotely regret having paid for such an entertaining game aside from some revised classic fps game modes the moddinghosting communities present about the game offer a large range of alternative modes survival versus saxton hale and warioware to name a few that bring an expansive evergrowing catalogue of play styles to your game the commercial aspect of the game is primarily aesthetic youve probably heard the hat jokes and is in no way necessary to augment your ground against other players there are numerous weapons with traits that will allow you to customize the way you play your classes but even the base weapons can achieve great things when weilded by an experienced player there are also backstories via comics cinematic videos and seasonal events for people who are into that sort of thing overall a fantastic game i can only advise you use the official servers primarily for practice and explore others as you progress since the quality of people you tend to find f2p etc can become daunting

recommended
ok here is a more suitable rating i give this game five stars going with star rating system as im not very familiar with any other ones lol variety theres pleanty of classes maps weapons modes heck theres even plenty hats to choose from one thing i can state is that this game has variety the games popularity shouldnt be a mystery to any of the players simplicity the characters are full of personality though some players not be quite sure of the plot as there really isnt one we all know our objective as when we select a match we are told what map and such well be joining when it is loading even if it is the random choice that you selected interface is pretty direct and takes minutes to get used to hud is also pretty polished you dont have to keep your eyes at the bottom of the screen anymore with tf2 unlike most games in which your health bar is at the bottom the reason as to why i feel the tf2 health bar is neat is because its easy to tell whether or not youre low on health as the square will turn red also that it is within your peripheral vision which means yes you dont have to look at the bottom of the screen as previously stated every class has 3 weapons engineerspy are exceptional as they only have 23 weapons with 5 slots primarysecondarymelee a simple set up we can all get used to pretty quick this might sound a bit silly but even the names are simple they range from 13 syllables and are fairly short so its easier to describe say you saw a few sticky bombs in base in ctf you could simply type demo in base rather than xxxxxxxxxx in yyyyy in which is a problem in some games because some people are slow typers but well knowing the average steam user youre probably going to be a fast typer so thats not going to be a problem for you other modding is available its a bit more complicated than going to workshop and clicking subscribe on any item you see as appealing for modifications you have to go to a third party site however installing them even on a third party site is pretty simple you just drag and drop them into a folder and i guess you could say thats another thumbs up seeing as lots of people like to personalize their stuff me personally i dont do this with tf2 but others might community youre alright ive chuckled at the banter over hats even though you all made fun of my gibus when i first started playing i would add more at the moment i sure think theres more to mention but i cant think of anything i spent most of this year playing this game ive played more on my alternate account than this one and i dont regret it either ive also spent a bit more than time on this game lmao
recommended
this game is so so fun
recommended
great game free to play and super addicting more fun with friends and the drop system is well put together were you dont get too much or too little
recommended
everyday is summer in tf2 that is all i can say 1010

do you like very serious games do you like games that have dramatic stories indepth gameplay and touching scenes well this game is not for you this game is not your standard fps game this game has so much humor in it you cant take it seriously how do i know that this game isnt some generic fps game and youre just talking bs watch meet the pyro and meet the spyjustjujust watch to conclude this review there are many different things you can do in it you can play on custom maps like mario_kart_v20 randomizer maps you can purchase hats and costumes to make your character look like a baddas fighting machine or a strange person in a wierd outfit that makes you cry i need an adult i highly suggest this game to anybody who is into whacky and silly stuff if you find this game to be interesting i ma going to give you a little advice remember to spycheck

when i was growing up in the white trash apartment complex in the 90s i often spent my days playing outside i would catch toads fish and bugs and often keep them as pets one day my mother burned my face with a cigar a few years ago my brother and i were fishing we caught a catfish and as we were cleaning and gutting it we noticed a pair of human infant feet in the catfishs stomach contents more importantly this taught me a valuable lesson about not running on floors covered in ice or human excrement

playing this game you should remember few thing 1hat 2hat with awesome effect on it 3golden weapons aussies 4dont wear the gibus d ^ ^

nice freetoplay online game from valve that based on a team work you can play for one of 9 classes scout soldier demoman pyro heavy engineer medic sniper spy every class has its special limitations capabilities and features universe of a game is crazy comic kind of funny bloody violent enthralling by the way this game also famous for its variety of hats

i was like you once you know just browsing the steam store getting all the valve games then i got this one i was f2p for a long time until one morning i decided to buy like one weapon to get me premium id seen scrap banking videos on youtube so i wanted to buy a huntsman and build it up to a strange killstreak then fate looked down on me and decided i didnt need a life i went on the man co store planning to buy the huntsman and spend the rest of the fund card on games then i saw the hats line by line those beauties shining and glittering in the darkness of my bedroom i bought one then my life chsnged forever trading banking buying uncrating and just being addicted to these hats now its to late for me i got a team captain and realised id exceeded my target but i wanted to spend more money on the store pour money into valve buy hats now i feel hats whispering my name i feel their prescience i see them on those i love i see them in my food i can feel gabe newell in my soul pressuring me to buy more hats i cant take it anymore as i type this i feel a key in my mouth fake hats on my head professional killstreaks burning my eyes help me i love tf2 deeply recommend this game to anyone be it a cod player or just an idiot
recommended
utterly amazing game
recommended
this game sucks because spies should have wings flying around the map taking 0 damage
recommended
free to play and not pay to winwhat more could you ask for classes are balanced very much so and it is addicting
recommended
i got this because of wint3r i hate wint3r the game isnt exactly addictive with the knowledge anyone can join tournements after 50 hours it motivates you to keep playing another thing is the items you want the best of the best and again more motivation to play finally i got scammed and the dropped my morale so low i havent played this in 3 months and yet i still recomend this i wonder what is the motivation is this time
recommended
yeah screw valve and their free game theyre not getting any of my free money
recommended
its free first of all it is amazing cause you can do many different things but they all consider in killing or trading it is a fun game to test out classes you might be at or you can try to be a collecter
recommended
its like playing hide and seek except with a bunch of nonsentient arsonists 42069
recommended
this is the best game i have experienced in steam i wish there were more like these games

team fortress 2 is always hard to start off i remember starting and dying constantly but still enjoying it eventually i got better and started learning other things like rocket jumping and trading with all the classes weapons maps and gamemodes i never get bored and they keep bringing more out theres also all the mods and community made gamemodes such as saxton hale or super smash bros i would definitely reccomend this to anyone who has a pc i play on a laptop and from time to time it can lag but nowhere near as bad as some games and its still playable unlike other fps games like call of duty the classes in this are just hilarious they have each of their own personalities and just say some funny stuff while your playing with the fact that you can still kind of customize your character with all the hats and cosmetics they keep adding and keep the actual character is great theres also the halloween  scream fortress which im enjoying at the moment and the christmas  smissmas this is by far my favourite game today and i dont intend to stop playing it anytime soon
recommended
anyone who is a fan of fps games and hats should play this
recommended
this game is great
recommended
really love this game 
recommended
its a fun game get it
recommended
it is a really good shooting game for pc
recommended
the best hat simulator on the market
recommended
tf2 is a team based hat simulator the main goal is to collect hats and move your way up the ranks of the top traders although hats are obviously the main part about this game the shooting game included is great well balanced but with lots of inexperienced people calling you a cheater for sticky jumping across the map jokes aside tf2 is a great game and i recommend you try it at least once
recommended
this game is amazing as it is simple 9 classes the scoutsoldierpyromedicspysniperheavyweapons guydemoman and the engineer battle it out representing their 2 teams redblu with a plethera of maps weapons gamemodes and hats yeah hats this game is a great pick up for the casual player and the serious gamer go medic for once
recommended
vary fun game it can get laggy but it is still fun
recommended
tf2 is by far the best free game on the steam market it has a variety of game modes plus its free cant go wrong with free games with some free games you find to actually do something you have to pay but you can rock on tf2 without having to pay a single penny spy and soldier are my favourite classes and my soldier is pimped with awesome gear that i traded for on trade servers i would reccomend this to anyone who likes action packed first person shooters
recommended
this game is possibly one of the greatest f2p games ever however once you reach that premium level the game only gets better starting the game out people do not realize the potential that they have they look at their inventories see the stock items placed in the slots and connect to the first payload game that they find and so the journey begins on tf2 but with only 50 cents in your steam wallet you can unlock all the secrets of tf2 purchasing their first wrangler opens them up to the world of hats trading and of course unusuals when a newly found premium player gets his first key he opens up the crate that had no use before this the suspense is killing him 3 2 1 you unboxed strange jarate not knowing the dissapointment in this the player screams with excitement about getting a strange selling this strange for 1 rec turns into buying another and getting a ref this ref turns into a key and the key into a bud now you are a veteran of tf2 trading however with new updates coming every so often breaad new oppurtunites are created and the game of team fortress get even better
recommended
once you find a server that fits well with your skill level appropriate ratio of seriousness to humor and is generally free of s ive found tf2 to be one of the most enjoyable ways you can spend your time luckily tf2s community is exceptional compared to other fpss out there so this generally isnt difficult i do want to stress however how much server jumping can improve your experience if your first few tries arent stellar lots of people play this game for lots of different reasons so shop around and find a likeminded community whether youre super serious or just wanna conga or somewhere in between who you play with affects your experience hugely

sigh why dont you have this game yet team fortress 2 in my opinion anyways is one of the best fps games in the world for free
recommended
tf2 at its core is an amazing game and one of the most fun and balanced shooters ive ever played even though choices by valve have tarnished its reputation and i mean they really screwed the pooch on more than one occasion it still stands out as one of the most fun and addicting shooters there is however to get the full enjoyment out of it you either need to find a community server which since quickplay started defaulting only to valve servers is becoming harder or play competitive valves public servers have little to no team cohesion or coordination owing to the freetoplay system bringing in lots of children dont worry if you get destroyed by more experienced players youll get better trial by fire worked for me if you need help ask you cant be an asset to your team if you have no clue what youre doing ask for tips from experienced players and always remember that there is a wiki [wikiteamfortresscom]  and for gods sake use a ing mic dont have a mic get one teamwork and communication is key the game isnt what it used to be you cant drop in to a random server and expect to find competent and friendly players anymore the visually appealing and unique artstyle has been destroyed by cashgrab cosmetics and the actual performance of the game has been destroyed by the added weight of the cosmetics still even as frustrating as it can be theres never anything more satisfying than coordinating a team through a difficult push to win a close victory also a final note if the server you join has an motd read it
recommended
this game is just awesome
recommended
its a very good game the graphic the characters the weapons and the gameplay is awesome i think it deserves some of you money i suggest not more than 10 euros

i love this game team fortress 2 i think is a really good multiplayer game i love the trading community the gameplay and even the updates for a game that came out in 2006 or 2007 i dont remember but this game has come a long way sence then also from how long it took for this game to come out its a masterpeace i think i dont think theres anything that could be a better game you should get this game i highly recommend it 3
recommended
awesome game full of running around blowing enemys to bits really fun i fully recommend you give it a try
recommended
where to start on this wonderful game team fortress 2 is as the name suggests a teambased game where players are heavily encouraged to work together to comeplete the objective of that gamemode in total there are nine classes you can play as scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and spy all these classes have been built specifically around teamwork and as a resault rely on each other in order to be effective this in turn creates a dynamic experience that no other first person shooter multiplayer can get close to with fun maps quirky characters and humorous jokes and weapons along the way team fortress 2 has it all you can taunt your enemies with chicken tell your engineer to build a dispenser or even go shopping for hats there are a few bugs and problems in tf2 some of which can be fustrating at times and others just make you laugh however team fortress 2 is a game that i highly recommend to anyone as their first pc game or to a game hoarder who knows everything about pc gaming this game offers hours of fun and the community support ensures that this game is not going to die anytime soon final score  1010

team fortress 2 is one of those games you mean to play for half an hour and end up staying for a couple hours it is loaded with fun game modes maps and weapons it is a team game so be ready to be a team player the tf2 community has a lot to offer plus there are hats and you know those are cool
recommended
my very first steam game this game holds a special place in my heart but after buying other games i cant get myself back into this game
recommended
one worthy thing to mention one thing this game is full of is hats if you dont have hats you are an outcast until you either find one or steal your parents credit card to buy some this game in my opinion has a lot of key features that make it great first off there is no campaign so its all multiplayer based the community is very friendly towards anyone a mostly silly game but if you want to play competitive they have servers for that this game is also a good way to make money you can sell keys on the market or do what i did and play mvm and pray that you get an australium valve seems to listen to what the community wants added in to the game and will add them for the most part each weapon is unique and balance they will have something good about them but then they will have something to counter that ex a weapon might have 25% damage but then will also have 25% movement speed overall this game is great and despite being free is one of the best games i have ever played in my life im sure there are others who will agree with me ps dont buy anything from the mannco store no matter how desperate you are

i love this game i really do thats why i have over 1000 hours on it every single thing about it is great but the one single thing that makes me hate it is the freaking people who play it there is a select amount of people who are good but about i say 80% of the people who play it are either screaming 5 year olds trollers who wont shut up hackers who ruin the entire game for everyone people who think they are better than everyone and last just your classical  im sorry if im sounding harsh but this is how i see it i just needed to say this and this is the only place i could think of thank you for reading and good day

team fortress 2 is without a doubt the best fps game i have ever played and probably the best one i will ever play and that comes from someone who generally dislikes shooters the cartoony characters the unique playstyles for all the classes the unlockable weapons and hats and the different types of matches will keep you playing this game for tens to hundreds of hours best part its completely free

this is a well thought out team based first person shooter the game encourages teamwork to win against players of higher skill or wellorganized teams lone wolfing can still be done on lower levels especially on public game servers there are 9 classes to choose from each one offering unique skill sets and abilities that allow them to fill in a unique role as part of the team as a whole because of this the player is rewarded with a challenging and funfilled experience especially when faced against opponents or teams with similar or greater skill even though this game was released way back in 2007 the game continues to have an active development team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as new unique weapons or game modes at the time of this review the team fortress community is preparing for the upcoming halloween update which has been an annual event in the game since 2009 while this game is extremely fun and rewarding to play i have noticed how complex the game has become in regards to new items and game mechanics i became introduced to this game in 2011 and gradually learned the ropes of the game over time however i have noticed how newer players have reported having a hard time grasping how all of the items work and in general feeling a sense of information overload in order for them to not be considered a noob at this game they must experiment and test with all of the items in the game to have a full understanding of what weapons should be used in certain situations all of this however is a small issue amidst the big picture this game is fantastic and being a freetoplay game allows players to have loads of fun without having to make a big down payment to enjoy it i continue to return to the game on a daily basis

12 35 out of 4 team fortress 2 a beginners guide to multiplayer games tf2 has it all classes maps hats and a humourous attitude that said its also terribly addictive like most multiplayer games and whilst i recommend tf2 i cant help note how serious this addiction can be when people rack up 10000 hours playing this game it really doesnt deserve that its not that good of a game to be honest that says it is a fun time with friends or a group of strangers for a few hours here and there but little more unless youre an obsessive achievement hunter
recommended
team fortress 2 is undoubtedly the best freetoplay game steam has to offer the graphics are great and while this game may look childish to some the only thing childish about it are the cartoonesque designs outside of that tf2 is a game suitable for people of any and all ages 13 and up what i find most appealing about this game is that even though players are allowed to spend as much money as theyd like to equip their characters with extremely powerful weaponry the atmosphere of the game is generally quite fair and balanced of course some people may seem overpowered at times but they are often veterans of this game just as long as you know how to play right you dont need anything other than the default items the game provides

my only favorite addicting free online game on steam
recommended
this game is no question my favourite game of all time in the universe and its easily the best team based shooter ever to be created will you enjoy it dont let me be the judge of that this game is 100% free go ahead download it and try it out for yourself hate this game because the graphics are unrealistic to me thats why its so lovable and contributes to why its survived for so long microtransactions from the mann co store arent necessary and items like hats australuims unusuals etc arent needed to be good at tf2 im not to dis trading however its something you can use to your advantage and profit hundreds if not thousands of dollars i certainly have and you can utilize the steam community market to get funds when you need em
recommended
perhaps my favorite game the large community and great moddability make this a great game in my opinion with both official and community servers often running custom maps and plugins you can spend your time blowing things up as a demoman or just run around a trade map showing off your cosmetics either way its an interesting game and theres nothing quite like it
recommended
i love this game  its like having a baby  you really love it at first  like a lot  then you forgot it for about 1 year and after that you still find it and you love him again

a violent game but cartoony at the same time tf2 is one of the best games i have ever played it is simple but can get complex as you play more and more this is easy on your computer so almost any computer can run it even mine easy to jump into but still able to dedicate time and money to has cheesy aspects but the core can get as serious as you want without being cod

so the infamous team fortress 2 the game has been around for a long time 8 years to be exact and was first brought out on xbox 360 as a bundle the orange box still to this day the game has a large community keeping the game alive this game is a huge benefactor in the trading community and is constantly having various updates to the game for new items and refreshes to keep the game going as most of you already know team fortress 2 is a multiplayer fps with an objective to defeat the opposing side been blu or red depending on what side you are on throughout various types of game modes the class system consists of 9 characters to pick from 1 scout a fast agile character primarilly played to get into the enemy base and capturesteal the intellegence 2 soldier a slow but strong character weilding a rocket launcher he is played to be offensive and support the team by killing everyone basically 3 pyro played to be offensive and spy check so the spy does not get into your back line and take out your team and sentries etc 4 demoman a slow character played to support your team by getting into the back line and drop bombs everywhere and destroy their defences and keep the enemies in their spawn 5 heavy the heavy is a very slow charcter but to make up for this he weilds a minigun and has a tonne of heath you guessed it he just sits there as a tank and kills and defends as he pleases 6 engineer the engineer is solely a defensive character who supports the team he is very versitile he builds sentries to defend sets up teleporters and has a dispenser which regrenerates heath and stocks up on ammo for nearby friendlies 7 medic as the name says the medic is a support and runs around healing your team pretty straight forward 8 sniper now the sniper sits back and defends with his rifle this character can take out anyone with a single shot making him a valuable asset to any team 9 spy the spy supports the team greatly by getting into the back line and to take out the engineers gear doing so allows the scout to get in the base and capture the points and grab the intellegence doing so will win the game all of these characters fit together and each of them play their own role towards winning the game so now we have that out of the way i would say this is a great game especially because its completely free and things you buy from the store or market have no actual affect in game and are purely visual changes to the game which makes it a completely even game so no pay 2 win i would definitely reccomend this to anyone who enjoys fps titles 1010 the games free so what do you have to lose

this game is a must download exellent charchters and emotions of each charachters i just wish i couldve bought this game when it was still being paid
recommended
this 3d animated shooter is the perfect game for all valve fans a complete 1010 but you have to make sure not to be tempted by the hats the hats are the way to show victory and coolness in tf2 but some hats require purchasing them with real life money and are not aquireable in any other way the classes are amazing and one of my favorites being spy you can unlock certain items by playing the game or earning achievements without paying money this aspect of the game brings the fun of showing off your items without paying the five dollars for an awesome hat honestly not the best game ive played but possibly the second or third the classes are fun in many different ways  the scout has super speed and can really mess up the other team  the soldier has a rocket jump which can be used to camp and fire  the pyro gets an airblast that can deflect most things rocket airblast  the demoman can spam grenades at you and sticky bomb the entire base if he wants  the heavy has loads of ammo and good strength but bad speed and bad aim unless up close  the engineer can place sentries dispensers and teleporters to protect areas  the medic has a very rapid gun as well as a medigun which heals other players best with the heavy  the sniper can be horrible up close but he can make headshots and instakill players with his sniper rifle  the spy can disguise as the other team and even take down the engineers buildings even if the game costed money it would still be worth it once again a full 1010
recommended
if you get one game this generation make sure its this one 1010
recommended
great game

loved this game very good potential i also like the comedy and humor in this fps
recommended

ah team fortress 2 lets get down to the basics tf2 is a classbased first person shooter made by a very successful company named valve valve is the creators behind famous titles such as left 4 dead counter strike and halflife tf2 started as a mod for quake and slowly evolved over a 7 year editing period tf2 was finally created and it was a hit to put this in retrospective here is an example team fortress 2 launched in 2007 and now its 2014 this game just simply wont die tf2 has 9 classes that are unique in their own way each class having its weaknesses and strong points making every class equal and not over powered these classes include scout  the nimble fastrunning caffinated  that can dominate the game if the player is a good scout player or can be taken out very easily soldier  one of the few classes that newbie players tend to pick first soldier uses a rocket launcher to take down his foes and gib them soldier has 200 hp and can be taken out with a few hits from the scouts scattergun but if played right the soldier can also dominate the team pyro this unknownthing uses a flamethrower to burn his enimies to a crisp and can be taken out but normally its taken out from a long distance pyro is great for close combat same with the scout and while heshes not a class for newbie players heshe can take out enimies within seconds demoman  a bombweilding drunk that uses projectiles bombsstickies to trap foes andor stratigically place them to gib enemies demoman is not recommended for newbie players at all but mostly because his tactics are very hard to get a good grasp of and he can take a long time to get used to and master heavy  the posterboy of tf2 the giant russian man with a minigun this big dude is can be one of the biggest threats in tf2 as far as classes go and can take down any of the 9 classes with ease by no means is the heavy overpowered but he can definately get quite a few kills in heavy is also another newbie favourite and hes recommended for newbie players because of his very easy tactics and gameplay style engineer  the texan wearing the hardhat engineer also referred as engie or engy ehngee uses sentry guns dispencers and teleporters to fight in the battle engineer is also equipped with a shotgun pistol and a wrench engineer definately takes time to learn master and use mostly because the player needs patience building sentry guns take awhile to level up from 1 to level 3 and the player also needs to know when and how to use hisher sentry gun engie definately isnt a newbiefriendly class and will take some time to learn medic  the german medic that heals his dear comerades in the fight for victory medic is selfexplanitory he heals teammates in battle but has different tactics of playing the tf2 community has come up with a name for one of thembattle medic and this is used when a player uses medic to fight using his needle gun or his crossbow that is unlockablecraftablebuyable at any given time rather than using his medigun to heal his teammates medic is an overall respected class and although he may seem a little complicated he is a little newbiefriendly mostly because his point in the game is very easy to understand and he is overall an easy class to use sniper  the australian sniper that isnt mlg o the sniper also referred after his name mundy is nothing like any other sniper youve ever played as if youre a cod player transferring over into tf2 youll be starting a new leaf because his gameplay is absolutely nothing like cod or any modern shooter first of all there is no such thing as quickscoping or 360 headshot noscope unless you consider a hip fire to be a noscope the snipers gun doesnt give out an amazing amount of damage right as you scoper in you need to wait a little while there is a charge meter until the sniper will do its fullest amount of damage snipers aim for the heads of their enemies and even if its not a fully charged shot the headshot will normally do 75100 damage to any given foe sniper is almost always picked by newbie players especially cod people transferring to tf2 mostly because his tactics and gameplay is amazingly easy and insanely simple to understand last class spy  le spy the french guy who stole your mother  your mother and is right behind you the spy is adored by almost everyone being notorious for his backstab if you backstab someone using your knife its an instant kill dealing over 1300 damage to any given foe the spy can be a very sneaky class to choose and he can mean the life or the death of your team if you know how to use the spy youre more than likely to save your entire team hes that powerful on the other hand if youre a newbie and you have no idea how to use the spy your team will most likely fail because of a couple of reasons spies are generally targeted by most classes such as heavy sniper and pyro which means that if youre caught by the enemy team or you are revealed to the enemy team you will be put on high alert and you will most likely find spy checkers spy checkers are normally pyros who try to set their team mates on fire if youre a pyro on the blue team and you use your flame thrower on a real team mate the fire will not affect them and they will be fine but if they use their flame thrower on a red spy that is diguised as their team mate they will burst in flames and you will be revealed checking their teammates spy is also a very hard class to master which is why hes not recommended to newbie players thats the general description of all the 9 classes you can choose from in tf2 overall tf2 is a great balanced fun and absolutely amazing multiplayer first person shooter that will never fail to impress you will always find someone playing the game no doubt about it and there are countless servers that are ran daily ranging from pub serversvalve servers to custom made map servers there are many ways to enjoy tf2 and you will certanly never feel bored because there is almost always something new to enjoy in tf2 tf2 has been an amazing game that has developed into something completely bigger than valve had probably imagined thanks for reading my 10 hour long essay and novel written by sonic the hedgehog  twd kenny 1010

as we all know team fortress 2 does not require any special review great game but i am unable to play due to my  internet

this game is the bomb and i think everyone and i mean everyone should play it its fun and there r so many things to explore
recommended
this game is extremely fun many different game modes including custom game modes by the tf2 community and maps tons of community made maps nine fun unique classes to chose from which all take an important role in the battle you may find some classes or aspects of classes hard to grasp but with practise you will be successful there tons of unique weapons to get but many of them are useless and pointless some of these bad weapons have been changed for the better but bad weapons are still present there are hundreds of cosmetic items in this game but you dont need to appreciate them to enjoy this game this game is free so try it out you wont waste any money if you dont enjoy it also random crits suck

do you like spending over 100 dollars on a virtual ring you cant even wear or 10000 dollars on a stupid hat with a newspaper in it that was lit on fire or 3500 dollars on a dead person inside of a coffin that you used to get out of a small 4x4 compact crate that comes with a skull from five nights at freddys following you around or 2000 dollars for a haircut that makes you look like a crazy sadistic punk rocker that recently came from chernobyl or 5500 dollars for the fire hazard named the sorting hat from harry potter with a demonic face that got lit on fire or 928 dollars for a gigantic burning fish that does nothing but leech off of your brain tissue while you mindlessly slaughter others or 200 dollars for a satanic christmas tree that you can wear or maybe even the grandest deal of them all a frying pan or a wrench painted in pure gold in exchange for your house your car and your virginity this is for you i still reccomend buying spinach with the money instead

i dont know why i never wrote a recommendation for tf2 before but better late than never right anyhow long story short play this simple as that i mean first off its f2p and paying players dont get an advantage on free players either plus its ridiculously fun to hell with pretendtoberealistic modern shooters tf2 is probably the most fun you can have online when it comes to gaming a easy to pickupandplay very hard to master free game what else could you wish for more hats

i have played team fortress 2 since the day it was released oct 10 2007 its changed a lot since then but i still consider it the best multiplayer fps ever made i have about 460 hours in this game at the time of this writing and i still laugh my  off every time i play by reading this im going to assume youre thinking about trying it for the first time so heres some things all newbies should know  some classes are much more difficult learn than others id start your first games playing as medic soldier heavy andor pyro until you get a decent grasp of things stay away from engineer and especially spy  dont worry about the custom weapons that many other players will have although some are good the base weapons are still often the best choice for every weapon of every class as long as you dont take the game too seriously its impossible to not have fun playing it
recommended
honestly i cannot find any avid gamer that is on steam and does not play team fortress 2 its almost sacriligious to even have steam installed without also having tf2 as its called by the players on at least one computer capable of running it well and boy is that not surprising this game literally eats up time like no other except maybe dota 2 for some or call of duty for others and to be honest the community is just as great i can easily find a server where nobody gives a crap about killing as many other players as possible or i can join one with an internationally recognised player for their prowess or two the amount of hats too its all mind boggling that there are still gamers out there that havent found tf2 enjoyable or have not even heard of it in general what else to talk aboutoh the support obviously due to its enourmous fanbase and its publisher being the great and powerful gaben steam creater and ceo it will almost always be there as even halflife 2 deathmatch is still supported and given serverspace on top of all the newer games anyways i highly recommend this game and the game in summary would have to be hat simulator 2014 3 happy hat hunting my friends i hope to see you ingame
recommended
team fortress 2 is without a doubt the best fps game i have ever played and probably the best one i will ever play and that comes from someone who generally dislikes shooters the cartoony characters the unique playstyles for all the classes the unlockable weapons and hats and the different types of matches will keep you playing this game for tens to hundreds of hours best part its completely free

i really like everything in tf2 hats weps random drops etc my three favorite classes are pyro demo and medic run in with pyro and try to fry as many as possiable hope that theres no medics so that your run wouldnt be ruined demo i had one awesome round with demo my team was really close to getting the last cap point and then i used the charge n targe and ran on the point and won for us and i noticed when i turned around everyone was coming in medic first class i ever played in tf2 i like how medic is a simple class just go heal maybe heal yourself a bit but not too much because you want your teammates to live for a bit longer and thats all you gotta do nothing more

probably one of the best online multiplayer shooters to exist team fortress 2 provides a lot of fun with different classes customizable loadouts and of course hats the player can choose from 9 different classes each with different advantages and tactics the nine classes are divided into three categories offense defense and support offensive classes would be the scout a faster class that uses a scattergun a secondary pistol and a bat for melee this class has less health but can easily avoid enemy fire and capture enemy control points twice as fast as any other class the soldier a slower offensive class that carries a rocket launcher a shotgun and a shovel soldiers can be used to take care of buildings like sentry guns and teleporters made by the engineer or if youre skilled enough you could rocket jump by simply pointing the rocket launcher down at the ground below you before jumping and shooting the rocket will explode on impact of the ground launching you high above the ground and give you the ability to quickly fly into enemy grounds the pyro pretty selfexplainatory the pyro uses a flamethrower to set enemies well on fire giving additional damage even if the enemy flees unless said enemy flees into water other weapons include another shotgun and a fire axe pyros can also shoot strong air out of the flamethrowers muzzle which gives it the ability to air blast rockets back at enemy soldiers or grenades back at an enemy demoman for the defense category we have the demoman a class known to maining on explosives and to drink the demoman wields a grenade launcher a stickybomb launcher and a glass bottle stickybombs are pretty self explainatory bombs that can stick to any surface these bombs can be used strategically to blow up the enemy when they least expect it for example planting the stickybombs on a control point stickybombs can also be used to launch the demoman high in the air similar to rocket jumping the heavy a slow but effectively defensive class who wields a minigun as a primary weapon shotgun for secondary and uses his own bare fists for melee heavys can easily defeat any enemy in close quarters but skilled players can easily turn the tables if paired with a medic the heavy could be difficult to take care of having a medic paired with a heavy can make for a very effective defense as long as the medic stays safe the engineer a class thats not as focused on charging into battle but more on staying back and building different machines to help the team succeed the machines vary from sentry guns health and ammo dispensers and teleporters the engineer also has the ability to upgrade any building using metal a secondary ammunition that engineers collect from parts of destroyed buildings and dropped weapons from defeated enemies and allies alike and for the support category there is the medic medics have the ability to heal injured allies using a medi gun of course medics are also armed with a syringe gun and a bonesaw for close combat as the medic heals an ally he builds up an ubercharge which when fully charged can shield the medic and any ally hes currently healing from any enemy fire for a limited time medics can be very effective when paired with the defensive heavy so as long as the medic stays away from enemy fire and keeps safe the medic also has the ability to heal over time but only by a small amount per second the sniper selfexplainatory the sniper can be used to hide back unseen and snipe incoming enemies with the sniper rifle this class is also equipped with an smg and a kukri knife for close encounters with the enemy when you stay zoomed in on the scope a small meter is filled on the side of the screen leading to a lightning bolt when this meter is filled the rifle can fire a charged shot that can take most classes out even if its not a headshot and the spy a unique class that can be used to disguise as an enemy class using a disguise kit the spy can sneak over to enemy territory and use his knife to backstab an enemy instantly killing them no matter how much health they have spies are also wielding a revolver and a sapper sappers can be used to disable and destroy buildings from the engineer class spies can then sneak behind an engineer focused on the sapper and backstab them but attacking while disguised risks being caught as a spys disguise instantly goes away when attacking spies can also cloak to appear invisible using their watch but such power is limited and goes away if used for too long forcing the spy to stay visible until its fully charged spies cannot attack while invisible nor can they capture control points cloaked or disguised team fortress 2 also features a completely customizable set of loadouts for your classes you may recieve different weapons for different strategies such as giving the demoman the ability to charge and bash into enemies with the chargin targe or the player can give the heavy to heal quickly with the popular sandvich players may also recieve accessories and of course hats players can also paint certain accessories any color they wish if they ever get the right bucket there are also decal tools name tags and description tags decal tools allow the player to put custom images on certain weapons and accessories as the name and description tags allow the player to change the name and description of the item to anything they wish players may purchase or trade mann co supply crate keys which they can use to unlock and open mann co supply crates which are randomly found ingame doing so will grant the player special items like more accessories or weapons most common from crates are the strange quality weapons these special weapons can track the total amount of kills the player makes with that specific weapon increasing the total kills by certain amounts can rank up the weapon giving it a special name for others to see ie truly feared minigun team fortress 2 gives an unforgettable multiplayer experience its cartoony graphics remarkable voice acting and its unique classes and characters makes team fortress 2 a musthave for gamers everywhere and best of all its free players can also communicate over mic spray custom images on the wall and chat in the servers chatbox but its strongly recommended to not do so these days given the community also as a warning to new players dont enter unbindall in the console commands

this fps is not like others fps  no smg no assault rifle with 9 differents classes team forteress 2 has a very various gameplay if you do not want to play as one class you can choose one of the 8 others classes of the game each class has his speciality and they are all balanced and to finish this game is free and you can get all weapons randomly when you are playing  so this game is not a pay to win that is why i recommend this game also because i have more than 1000 hours of gaming and i still love this game 
recommended
i love tf2 its a wonderful pastime and i would definitely reccomend it to all of my friends due to the amount of fun i have during my experiences with it
recommended
this game has taken the most time out of my life than any other game for some really good reasons tf2 has some really smooth and balanced gameplay along with hats cant forget the hats anyway i really would suggest this game to everyone and the fact that its free is awesome if i had one suggestion is that make it so supply crate keys can be found dont make it a frequent drop but make it a drop nonetheless besides that they really did it right with this game 1010

i love this game because of the fact that it has over the past 5 or so years developed a diverse and mechanical economy of its own i have spent countless hours trading crafting and buying several hundreds of items over the past year and the fact that this economy has been almost entirely developed by the steam community is remarkable i would be shocked if i found a steam user who did not already own this masterpiece of a game any other mmofps game that has been thrown my way has not even come close to the mastery of this here game 1000010 tldr

if you like hats dancing playing dress up or have a gambling addiction then this is the game for you
recommended
warning this game is most fun when you know your  at least halfway and have some experience it may be repelling at first this is a incredibly fun and addictive fps the graphics are stylized in a cartoonish fashion making this one of the most recognizable games the maps are very welldesigned which is something valve always gives us i guess some introduction to the gameplay would be nice so here you go the gameplay centers around 9 classes each with a unique playstyle and different skills required to play this class efficiently every with their own weaknesses and strengths only full cooperation between the usually 12 players will bring victory to the team you have to know your  or be called a noob this can be solved by reading guides completing tutorials and simply practicing on public servers you need to get into the mood to play a class which can easily be achieved by simply playing it for a while something important to note is that there is no campaign but offline practice does exist the community is incredibly active nothing more can be said you can download custom models sounds and even huds some people may say its pay to win this just isnt true the items in the store are used only to earn respect and dont effect gameplay at all while weapons are buyable its completely pointless to buy them there you can get it randomly literally anytime or by trading i guarantee that if you go on a full 32player trade server someone will own the weapon youre looking for and wont ask much for it at all i have never had so much fun playing a multiplayerbased communityfueled game ps dont play as sniper snipers are cowards pps codsucks

this game is fun and you should start out official server multiplayer it is fairly easy to learn and i suggest playing as the pyro first then moving on to the heavy also there are lots of fun smaller servers and a great trading community along with a competitive community also you can go on special nonofficial servers such as randomizer where every quality about your character is randomized to anything on any class including having 3 differentclass weapons

team fortress 2 is easily one of the most addictive games i have ever played the gameplay is very simple you are either on red or blu fighting one and other ina variety of objective based gamemodes this forces players to work together as a team this game is not for the lone wolf what makes tf2 unique is its insane amount of customaztion the game features 9 distinct classes each with their own personality playstyles designs and weapons from the speedy loudmouthed scout to the insane mad scientist medic each class is unique this adds depth to this game there is always something new to do and experience the community have kept this game alive with constant mods and inventive gamemodes while the tf2 team keep the game fresh with constant free content whether is new weapons or new hats each update keeps players interested on top of all of this tf2 features a very unique art style this makes it stand out amongst all the other military shooters its cartoonish 1960s style makes it simply beautiful valve certianly did a fantastic job in creating a unique world for this game tf2 is also damn hilarious with a barrage of memes quotes and dark humor to keep anyone happy while the humor isnt always for everyone it certainly gets me laughing to myself as i gib a pesky spy while tf2 has lost some of its core charm due to tradingplayers it still remains one of valves greatest hits tf2 is a must have for any pc gamer also it is free and you can wear fancy hats if you have yet to experience tf2 i would heavily reccomend to download it right now 9510

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

i played in this game from 2008 right from the first time when i read review on this game in a cozy igromaniac author said the game has a lot of advantages 9 distinct glasses and the main thing cozy expensive and cool customization later about a week later we played on some custom map with my friends and were thinking how this game was cool how it is well balanced and stuff but later we noticed one more thingthe game was always changing the gameplay was changing there was added new custom parts and you know what i left from this game because i didnt like all this changes in 2012 or 2011 my friend sucked me back in the game with the arguement of dude you have to check it out and the thing was men vs machine update i was more than amazed so much changed for all this 4 years while in most other games stuff stays the same i highly recommend this game to everybody from the ones who likes bloody shooters to the people who likes fat eastern eggs on stuff from media and especially changes because this game lives more than 8 years now and it keeps changing it keeps being popular it keeps being fresh

well amongst all the positive reactions upon team fortress 2 i want to put in some more critical notes although the sheer quality of this classic is undeniable first of all the game is technically superb ofcourse  it all runs flawlessly and valve keeps updating and supporting it admiringly graphics and sound are also topnotch and deserve nothing but praise and the sheer imagination of the entire undertaking is gigantic and really aweinspiring but the actual gameplay is really mostly for those who enjoy fastpacing shooting and jumping action not for those who enjoy having a bit more time for their actions ofcourse it is an option to sit along camping but that is not what this game is made for and you wont win many friends by doing that also fir those who are now in 2014 new to the game it appears to be difficult to find servers where newbies aka beginners are really welcomed and encouraged maybe i didnt try hard enough to find those but it seemed like a stiff job to get me going dont misunderstand this game promises tons and 100s of funhours for those who just like this fastpaced approach but for the others it is something of a steep mountain to climb gameplay 1220 according to taste graphics 1620 sound 1610 stability & patching 2020 longlasting appeal 1820 overall 82100

this game is silly fun nothing is more satisfying than backstabbing your mate great over skype the teamplay is above average  it actually has a physics engine which i like the unlock system is a bit odd and i dont rally understand the crafting there arent really enough tutorials i do however have a reocurring problem on gmod and any other valve game servers get connection failed after four retries and when i refresh the servers disappear anyways i have to rate this game positively becuase it is one of the most fun games ive played and i feel the developers put lots of effort into it 810
recommended
not saying that this game isnt a money trap for anyone with a penny to spend but this game is a money trap for anyone with a penny to spend instead of looking bland while you get killed drop a good 400 dollars and you might have a few hats to wear while you get killed i recommend
recommended
one of the best games out there d
recommended
definitely a good game to waste your life on youll instantly become addicted as soon as you get your first weapon or hat apart from the great gameplay there is always something new or intresting to try out certainly a great game to download if the rest of your life isnt fun enough for you

this is certainly the billionth recommendation for tf2 ever made most likely if you need one word to sum up the game hats need another fun this certainly is a top favorite game of mine for a good reason and that its just too much fun really i can say its one of the best if not the best freetoplay game out there and thats not doing the game much justice the game has multiple objectivebased modes inplemented into a truckload of maps that have been either made by valve or the community and contains a pretty deep metagame thanks to the amount of weapons placed in the game and the varying ways that people play each class each match may play differently from the last considering that everyones going to play differently which requires you and your team to adapt to survive oh i mentioned it has hats didnt i yeah think of this as valves way of earning money along with some of the community members who contribute to the game i really like this system as you can customize each class however you want to and its a way to give back to the community i could go on about how this is one of the greatest games ever made but youre probably sick of me rambling on about this game by this point and of course youre already playing this game on some sort of time basis if youre on my friends list so i guess im just talking to myself ill shut up and let you get back to playing now xd
recommended
i think there are enough reviews to show that this game is highly recommended but heres another anyway tf2 manages to do a few things quite flawlessly 1 classes tf2 has 9 very distinct classes each with a very different style of gameplay attached to them making the game very replayable 2 clarity tf2 is a very approachable game as the classes are very well defined and their roles from the eyes of a newbie are fairly clear the art style in the game also makes it very approachable catering for pretty much all audiences 3 variety to add on to the classes being varied there is also a massive set of weapons which range from minor cosmetic differences to completely different utilities making weapon combinations become something personal that you can tailor to your style of play tf2 also boasts a decent range of gamemodes from ctf to capture points to king of the hill and even a vastly different coop mode mvm mann vs machine 4 community tf2 has a very active trading scene competitive lobby and league scene and steam workshop many items created by fans of the game have ended up being implemented producing revenue for the artist and valve itself which leads onto my final point 5 freetoplay done right their monetisation methods are nonintrusive and not in your face there is incentive to gamble with crates for strangeunusual items through buying keys but in the end the hightier loot are all cosmetic in nature rather than unlocking some weapon with vastly op stats like so many other f2p games everything that can be bought can also be traded for and with the activity of the community it is not too difficult a feat to do the game also provides you with free items based on play time which can of course be traded and nontradable basic weapons for completing achievement milestones with the different classes all in all its a great classbased shooterhat simulator with a great setup behind it go play
recommended
this is a fun game and is great for joining random servers where u can play just with your friends also has a wide variety of different game modes awesome
recommended
dont ask just play it awesome
recommended
how to feel good playing this game heal people on fire about to die with 1 health left bonk a heavy about to decimate your team snipe that spy about to chain stab your team build teleporter exit to first spawn point near the end of a match backstab a sniper until he switches to razorback headshot him until he switches to pyro win a match after team shttalker moves to other winning team kick a bad medic for trying getting 50 kills in a row also feels pretty good if you can do it dont acknowledge the people who defecate in their living room instead of their bathroom people who bring all their life problems to the game known as ragers dont realize the fundamental aspect of entertainment whatever good or bad thing happens while playing is ultimately for your entertainment you will forget this playing tf2 though just saying and become a rager yourself
recommended
this game is dank ^
recommended
team fortress 2 is exectly what the name is its a game where you have to oppose against another team and the best team eventualy wins this is nothing like call of duty as every class in here as an advantage and a disadvantage for example the scout runs really really fast but has low hp and because you only have shotguns and pistols you need to get close to you emeney in order to take him out quickly i really advice you to download this game since its free and it has a lot of options try teaming up with some friends and do some mann vs machine or try to launch a rocked into space it is all possible with the right amount of teamwork and fun d
recommended
it is bottom line the best game out there on steam it is so much fun and the weapons and items you can get in game are awesome looking

this game took my life away thanks gaben 11000000010

i got assassinated by myself 1010
recommended
this game is an average shootemup however the cartoony style ragdolls and gibs give it a funny atmosphere 1010
recommended
i like this game for not being just a basic fps first person shooter like cod call of duty its more of a puzzle shooter why i think it is more of a puzzle shooter is because each class has its weakness and the other class help their weaknesses
recommended
team fortress 2 or tf2 has truly earned its way into my top 5 games list with its imaginitive characters setting gameplay and features make this game an absolute musthave for any fan of fps games or steam members the game has many game modes that never get old or boring along with the games array of classes the game is always fresh and fun problems i encountered in other fps games like call of duty are they never involve strategy or team building in tf2 however teamwork must be used in order to win making it extremly fun and imersing to play with friends every class has a weaknes and strength along with imitations and constrictions that allow you to become accustomed to your own class and playing stradegy this overall allows for a extremely fun gaming experience
recommended
good f2p game basic physics and graphics engine adds a nice touch with voice acting and weapon styles
recommended
best free to play game
recommended
i reccomend this game its free plus its fun lots and lots of fun seriously its really fun believe me when i say this are you bad at videogames you can be good at this one possibly the only multiplayer game with built in aimbots just choose the engineer class and build a sentry do you like op one hit kills tf2 is the game for you go sniper or spy and headshot or backstab all the baddies theyll hate you for it but really do you care no if you do you probably shouldnt be playing a game with guns in it if you dont care and you like aimbots dont cheat in other games play tf2 instead because here its allowed

recommended
team fortress 2 is a fun online game with friends its so fun judging from ctf to cp to even parkour play it now its free
recommended
extremely fun game recommend it to all 2 thumbs up
recommended
i recommend this game to anyone the probem people have with tf2 is that they expect it to be easy it takes days to get used to and weeks to get the hang of it it takes a long time to get used to this game especially the style its probably one of the best games you can play on steam and for free the item system is also a good aspect it gives you a chance to make your own unique tf2 character and skill sets the downside to this is that it causes players to forget how to play the game and focus on hats however with all the bad things aside this game truely is probably the most fun you can have online id give it a 97  10
recommended
i am so tired of seeing free to play games where you cant be as good as anyone else without spending your money tf2 offers the perfect solution to this everything can be obtained ingame by random drops or trading with players however you can get items much faster by paying money but it is in no way required on top of that i love the way that all the classes are overpowered in some unique way counter ballencing the other overpowered classes it is a very unique model for a game

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

welli bought the game years ago when it was sold on a disc i was like in elementary school and i enjoyed the game but then i kinda stopped and lost the activation code for it so i couldnt play it but lately i saw it was f2p and was quite excited to see that valve has kept a f2p game up like this is impressive and is one of the reasons why valve is my favorite game company this game is great and will be for the years to come thanks for the great game
recommended
this is the best game evar over 2000 hours and still strong so ye also its free
recommended
this is the best jrpg ive ever played the customizability of your teammates is just ridiculous and with over 400 personas to summon the game just oozes with content my only problem is there are only 8 social links to do and there arent enough male characters dont get me wrong i love a jrpg with powerful female companions but theres only one male in this game and its the main character there are also over 50 dungeons in the game and while the game can be hard the challenge is certainly one of the most enjoyable aspects of tf2 i give tf2 a 1010 because it is the best jrpg ever since call of duty on the ps1
recommended
being upfront about this game is about as hard as a baloney sandwich nine classes 3 base or stock weapons each unincluding the spy and engineer classes with multiple abilities and different playstyles for each that was the base game being upfront about this game now is about as hard as wrestling a polar bear with a machine gun strapped to its back in zero gravity same nine classes same stock weapons but due to updates content additions and big rollouts of weapons and hats this game has changed unbelieveably now with new weapons for every class with all new statistics and abilities strangeteir weapons vintageteir weapons genuineteir weapons collectorteir weapons strangifies chemistry sets killstreak kits and fabricators unusual hats australium weapons keys refined metal you get it theres a lot to take in team fortress 2 even has its own economey that functions similarly to real life ones but after you learn about it the game is truly a gem hundreds of gamemodes both company and community made thousands of servers thousands of maps theres still a lot to take in playing well developing a strategy finding new friends and groups still not done trading and finding new items to have hats to wear modifiers for your favorite weapons and much more if youd like a quirky challenging game with thousands of things to do youre in luck as team fortress 2 has it if youd like a serious hardcore game with clans to join and other clans and groups to beat youre still in luck because team fortress 2 has that as well now stop reading go get the game ps its free 1010

recommended
1010 would pay for hats again
recommended
the red vs blue factor seems like a playful thing in this game alot of the time red and blue are depicted as teaming up quite a bit thats what makes this game diffrent and i love it
recommended
this was the reason i joined steam thank you valve <3
recommended
ah team fortress 2 who couldnt love this title after all the content added and popularity it has across the globe its fast paced and is so much fun to play with friends at almost any time over all a great expeariance
recommended
an excellent and fastpaced shooter from the past a must have for everyone
recommended
the game is a fun fps with multiple classes to vary up your play style and changes the way it is from other fpss then it just being a point and shoot with the regular fps guns smg sniper assualt rifle etc but tf2 adds a more expansive take with weapons flamethrower minigun sentries etc id say this game is worth it since its been pretty active for 8 years to this date although the game has multiple hats misc etc for you to wear on your characters and different types of weapons genuine vintage strange etc with along the trading the comes along with this game and can get you into a fuss over wanting an item for a long time and then going into the habbit of buying everything from either the mann co store or the steam market this game will consume your money more then pickpocketers in europe although the game is a new a fun fps with still 8 years of active people and with the downfall of trading i still give this game a 910
recommended
this game can ruin lives and ruin friendships at the same time collect hats and guns 1010
recommended
best f2p game 
recommended
its a nice game that can get very addictive
recommended
incredibly diverse game you can either play or trade the game itself is incredibly easy to get into no overpowered classes everything is well balanced easy to adjust to the trading part is less easy to get into however once you are in like the gameplay its incredibly fun and diverse i have played this game for so long and while i occasionally get bored i am yet to find a game on par with tf2 gameplay uniqueness and tradingwise
recommended
great game lots of fun
recommended
download this game right now its the best f2p game i ever played total funnice communityeditable characters hatsweaponsmiscs many servers for everyone and maaaany mapsgamemodes i suggest you also play mvmawesome zombiewavelike gamemode but with robots and its nearly buglessall in allits a totally awesome game 1010
recommended
team fortress 2 or tf2 is a phenomenal game not only has the community been strong for several years now but the game is free to play which means you never have to dish out money to be the best player in fact one can argue that the best weapons are the default weapons because they are simply neutral the only reason you would ever want to spend money is if you run out of space from the constant free item drops which only comes down to $1 everything else is cosmetic and will only aim to make you look like the ultimate badass tf2 does a great job of not forcing you to pay to be good or be ahead of someone so if you truly want a free to play game join the community
recommended
its a very fun game because you gwt to do fun things like take pictures have diffrent weird guns and you have 9 classes like scout solider pyro medic and spy im not gonna spoil the rest have fun if you get the game
recommended
ruined my life 5 stars

recommended
best f2p fps teamwork based nice graphics great gameplay you will love eeeht <3
recommended

recommended
this game is very fun because of its difference with the other fps games or should i say tfps its difference is in the personality of the characters and they each do different things not like 4 people do the same thing just different models the main reason i play this game is because i am a server hoster and i love modding the game  q1 is that redstone a1 yes q2 what is my server called a2 sodiumhydroxides server with infinite mvm cash and ammo q3 redstoneminecraft oh so you play minecraft a3 yes and i also host a minecraft server q4 are you a coder a4 yes of course i am you dumbo q5 did you buy tf2 premium a5 no and i hate people yelliing buy stout shako for 2000 refined

recommended
you play or i beat you
recommended
great game and freetoplay amazing
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
one of the best if not the best freetoplay games out there its not only fun as hell but its also the most balanced game ive ever played completely free of any paytowin aspects in my honest opinion this is the finest shooter ever made
recommended
this is the best hat simulator in existence this sounds silly and it is until youve played it it wont be long before you find yourself involved in the meta trading game crafting weapons and on the quest for ever cooler hats to replace your ghastly gibus and prove you are no longer a noob you will finally give in on microtransactions and be glad you did as far as gameplay goes well its probably the best class based shooter out there the game works and is always kept polished and regularly updated and supported by the community and valve with the 9 different classes there are many more ways to play just based on what your item loadout is but nothing is really overpowered just situational in its advantage the competative scene is real and there is an incredibly high skill cap within that time and experience in the game to the tune of thousands of hours actually mean something in terms of your ability to be good at it and probably the thing thats better than any of this its freaking fun
recommended
hats hats baby
recommended
a great and also a funny game the diversity of items and maps is unbelievable i recomend
recommended
me 2 months ago this game is over rated and this hat craze is silly i wont get addicted or buy any hats what zombies you must be to do such a thing me now i think i can sell my kidney for some money to buy hats wait i already did maybe i can go without my other kidney theyre over rated anyways 1010 would waste whole paycheck on
recommended
this game is awesome when i found this game i couldnt stop playing it d thumbs up
recommended
i love tf2 and its a great game whether you play with friends or by yourself its fun to play the kinds of things that you can do in it are immense and there is no end to the fun you can have while playing and the best part you dont have to pay to get the game
recommended
team fortress 2 has been one of my finest gaming experiences ever ive played many multiplayer games over the years and i must say tf2 has proven to be one of the most innovative and constantly changing for the better title ive ever dealt with though ill keep this short i will comment that every class feels unique and every character organic with a playstyle and personality that each can call their own this is perhaps my main drawing point to the series as their are few thinks more fun then dominating your enemies while your demoman slurs drunkenly about the battlefield with a sword and decapitates a heavy with a minigun in all my time playing this game the experience has never diminished and i hold high hopes for the future of this game
recommended
this game is soo fun and i cant stop playing it
recommended
this game is not good its its great
recommended
great game s of fun in it ive played tf2 for over 14k hours already traded a lot in it ive over 3k trades already and i can tell u that this game is great now i dont play it at all but it simply got boring to me because ive played it exclusively for long time and any game gets boring when u play it and noting else i score tf2 for 1010 and recommend it to everybody
recommended
team fortress 2 offers a great weapons system rewarding gameplay and many other things that just make it the amazing game that it is
recommended
hand built a $950 computer to play this game with friends steam suckered me with its sweet sweet sales and now i have 50 games but this is why i came and where i stay
recommended
this game is amazing
recommended
this game is definitely part of my top 5 best games vis in this game you have 9 classes with different features personalities stories and of course weapons hats plays a big role in the game but it is completely illogical because no other fps does not have any hats 3 hats are awesome as well
recommended
a must have freetoplay game that is well balanced in all classes and a bunch of the weapons if you havent played it already youre missing out on a lot of fun
recommended
friends dont let friends not play tf2 if you have not played yet i hope you are downloading tf2 as you read this

highly competitive shooter for tryhards make no mistake on that valve markets it as something else but it doesnt change what it is its not easy to pick up if youre new to quakelike shooters youd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you or you might get frustrated by some things public pvp and pve known as mvm in tf2 servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned if you dont want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though well balanced competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test despite valve overlooking the competitive format multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level if you want to do team based esports look no further than tf2 this game has more competitive spirit in it than lol and dota combined as for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age thanks to its stylised look some items from content updates are very much out of the games theme though which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is the game is poorly optimised in some instances too especially mvm but that can be solved by fps boosting configs all in all iz good

this game is the best freetoplay game i have played on pc ever great graphics clever maps and decent players although there are a few squeaker brats that do tend to get annoying it is freetoplay and although there are in game transactions you can run through 90 hours of gametime and not have to pay a single cent to have a lot of fun the only real problems are the occasional few squeaker brats and the power of the computer your using

when a fps meets team play fun and strategy  team fortress 2 is a game that looks simple at first glance just pick a class shoot kill everybody have fun but in the end you realize that its not that simple every class has strengths and weaknesses  the more balanced is a team the more chance the team has to win and once you really understand all the classes and know them all the game is just bomb so in this game being a pro at cs or quake 3 arena doesnt mean youll oneshot everybody here  youve got to think carefully about what you do and help the best possible your team thats precisely what i love in this game  each class is useful and no class is overpowered i do not count the number of games that have been won because i was a medic or an engineer which are support classes and because there were enough big guys in my team to do the rest and at last but not least you have in this game a lot of fun contents cf the pyro glasses  or when blood becomes balloons and fire becomes rainbow which is the icing on the cake the only backdrop  there is a lot of noobs in public games that dont know how to play and most of the time its the team who has the highest number of nonnoobish player who wins but that shouldnt be a problem for you if youre looking just for fun

as far as i know its the only classbased multiplayer shooter where a crazed rogue soldier can detonate a fast talking kid from boston using only a futuristic rocket launcher meant for mangling cows oh and did i mention he was flying through the air at mach speeds while sporting a bright lime green santa beard a dr seuss hat with money forever falling from the brim and an eagle taped to his shoulder not to mention the scout was doing the conga with a massive man from russia who was obsessed with sandwiches yeah the soldiers probably screaming something along the lines of maggots too gabe we waited nine years we got update after update waiting for the incredible potential of this masterpiece to be unleashed upon the pc gaming community now because the situation mentioned above is entirely possible within any game i have ever played and enjoyed for that matter i can die a happy person my soul will be rested with nothing left desired from this world i can indeed say this game was without a doubt worth the weight play this game right now or gabes wrath will forever be inflicted upon you and all of your family tree not really but seriousally play the game it is extremely good the best in the fps genere in my opinion give it a whirl its free 1010 best gabe ever

simply put tf2 is a comical fps that redefines what we look for in a shooter game this game never gets old in addition to the addicting gameplay theres a whole economy of trading that comes with it all in all tf2 is a musthave for any and all game collections
recommended
graphics  the graphics for team fortress 2 might not seem up to par with other valve games but its the art style that matters the cartoonish graphics fit so well with this game i wouldnt have it any other way 55 music  this game has amazing music its a shame we typically only hear it on the menu and during events 35 story  while team fortress 2 does have a story its never told in game the story can be found on the wikipedia page if youre interested in reading it it explains why the two teams are fighting at least 25 replayability  many gamemodes maps and weapons always being added dont like what they have modded game mods range from far and wide prophunt saxton hale the list goes on its never a bad time when you launch this game again 55 gameplay  the gameplay is nice and balanced something other fpss cant always say not pay to win either which should be noted considering its also freetoplay 55 overall score  45 good
recommended
i really recommend this game its so great

if you have not played team fortress 2 then you should sit in a corner and think about your life team fortress 2 might just be my favorite first person shooter games you can choose from 9 classes each one that has tons and tons of weapons and hats if you think that it is boring just killing the other team over and over all the time then you are wrong be warned that if you get this game you will be sucked into it and you will not stop playing it you will spend your days locked in a dark room with a bowl of doritos by your side you will become fat and lazy with no wife no kids and most importantly no life trust me it has happened to me already remember that this game appears to be free except for one thing your life

an fps that introduces a different style of play nine classes each have a different task in the team and each require different skill sets to play not only does one strive to master the classes but also the various weapons unique to each class despite coming with a cost to have weapons whether money or time in trading it is definitely worth it if you have time i dont recommend this to people who are in a busy point of their lives as it may be addicting to experiment with loadouts and whatnot though if youve got time take a shot its worth your while even if you dont stick around also as a final note this game is far from a pay2win scenario ive gained enough hours to have experimented with the many weapons and i will say this there are no weapons in the game that can be bought in order to destroy in a server even if a weapon has great stats ie the back scatter in the most recent update in the long run the default is usually superior unless someone has gained enough skill with such weapon as long as you have skill you can make a weapon destroy good luck and remember this is team fortress 2
recommended
really great game i recommend it really fun if you play with friends or different game modes

oh tf2 i started steam wanted to play garys mod but i did not have the money at the time as i was looking on steam i saw this and said hey isnt that the multiplayer game i played on the orange box on xbox i was little at the time about 912 years old so me being a new steam user also with a slight major case of not paying attention at the time i didnt look at the price and accidentally bought the game i cried for hours at the time because i had my fathers credit card attached to this account i was 13 at the time so be quiet when my dad looked at the price he had his trademark sarcastic smile and he said well good job coerrm trace noone needs to know mah name you just made me spend $100 on a game let me tell you i saw my life flash before my eyes again 13 and i had very little common sense this was before i grew out of being a kid then my dad laughed and said oh i was just joking dummy its a free game and that is how i got this game oh whats that you want a reveiw not me rambling sigh fine this game is free uh hurr durr dummy now free games are usually subpar but this game is different due to it starting as a paid game so it had a metric s ton of development so the game is very polished and is still polished now time to divide this review into catagories gameplay controls graphics community and its total score gameplay 910 this game has a great style of play you want to know why its different it is not call of duty with regenerating health or battlefield with giant maps the maps are actually not that big but are of decent size tf2 has health bars according to the cod fan that is my friend that is bulls but dont listen to him health bars are great it makes the game fair most of the time you see with a health bar it makes you see how long you have to live and you care about that without a health bar you feel like you could run around and spam the smg or ar and along with the health bar you usually have long as hell respawn times so you really do not want to die now lets talk about the classes and importance there are 9 different classes each with a use the scout is there to  off the other team and do chip damage so others can kill them easy the soldier is there to deal explosive damage to take down the guys with high health the pyro is there to act as a counter to the soldier demo and spys with fire to get the spys and airblast for rockets and stickybombs then we get to the demo who can use sticky bombs for traps and deal explosive damage the heavy is the allclass deterrent as he can soak up damage as long as you have a medic or sandvich the engineer is there to add a line of defense but the spy can ruin his day easily the medic does what a medic should do keep the team healed and shove a medigun up the heavys  the sniper is there as the heavy killer as headshots at full charge do massive damage the spy the hardest class to master is to get behind the enemys lines and generally ruin the day now along with nine classes there are many weapons that are unlockable or craftable each with an upside and a downside compared to the defaults if you need to get to the action faster get the gloves of running urgently for the heavy or the powerjack for the pyro need to survive as a soldier use the blackbox the gameplay itself is very polished fastpaced and generally fun as hell and more than anything it is balanced shall we move on controls 710 the controls are good but not the best at times yes you can configure it but i love playing with default controls on every game wasd is always good and m1m2 and m3 are also good but when the nonessential controls come to play we have some problems zxc are used for character speech thats fine and dandy but there are 9 different types of voicelines so the order goes as followed zx or c then 12345678 or 9 but thats not the worst ctrl is for crouch not only does that hurt the pinky finger but crouch is used a lot for explosive jumping and helping with jumping up larger objects but the reason why the score is not lower is due to the customization for it i personally only changed crouch to l shift and thats really all other than decline is at o and not k and with that lets move on graphics 1010 now graphics do not make a game good it only enchances the game but that aside the graphics are amazing many people would say the cartoonish graphics make it a kids game faaaaaaaaar from it this game actually gets quite high with the gore factor not as bad as some games but still quite the amount of gore but the cartoon atmosphere gives the game a nice fun feel sort of that stupid fun you get when you watch the loony tunes or play little big planet my little sisters force me to play it with them heck sometimes it reminds me of pokemon emerald with its bright graphics yes i grew up with emerald and when i look at any lightish green in the game i get a large rush of nostalgia because it reminds me of my favorite pokemon yes i know i got the dress wrong in my pixel art im working on it so in short the graphics are great and gives me nastolgia but will not contribute much to the score moving on to my least favorite part community 610 oh the tf2 community you can be great at some times but not all the time now i am not a hater of anything so long as you do not shove it in my face right now tf2 is full of cod lovers bronys pegasisters demopans star_ lovers demospams unusual flaunters and more now i am not saying these people are bad far from it but a large amount of these people shove it in our faces like we need these to survive not all but a lot of them do this but what redeems this catagory are the workshopers map makers good admins and hateblockers the steam workshop has great stuff that would be great if it would be added some of the maps that people make are great like black mesa and trainsawlaser even though that is a joke map the admins on a lot of servers are nice friendly and generally are helpful hate blockers help with haters usually by adding logic into arguments and generally are great people so in general there are a good amount of fans who shove their interests in our faces but the rest of the community helps with redemption total score 810 this game is amazing for a f2p game it is more than worth getting and is mostly essential to a steam user now this is silph co is a lie signing out to eat an omlet make sure to rate post a comment and if i got anything wrong feel free to correct me as this is my first reveiw so thanks for reading and tune into my amnesia the dark descent reveiw next mont

this has been a great game since i bought it for $20 valve never has let me down
recommended
i used to play this game alot back in the days but i got sick of it got sick of the people who always want the best hats and  even when they have the best hats they really suck at the game i remember a time when me and my friends were playing this game everyday we didnt even have hats then and there were people with unusuals we literally wrecked them anyway i gave up on this game but now im back just for the gameplay not the trading and all that i just want to enjoy the game even doe valve made it ridiculous with the new taunts and all that but still i just want to play it
recommended
that game is so freaking awesome you can  off people literally backstab burn shoot and almost anything else and this is only modern game where rocketjumping is fun and useful definitely must have two things that game lacks chainsaw and molotov there still katana and minigun though

recommended
in my opinion the best free to play game on steam available from what ive seen if you love fpss you will love tf2 if you love a mix of strategy and classedbased combat youll love tf2 if you like comedy and goofiness influenced in gameplay youll love tf2 and if you like hats well you get the point but truthfully this is an amazing game i honestly dont know why its free because it deserves to be a paytoplay game and another thing my laptop is probably around 5 or 6 years old and ill be honest not the best but when i first launched it it acted like it was nothinghigh quality too so you really dont have to worry about it lagging so much at least from your computer still depends on your connection to play multiplayer of course and if it is laggy on your computer it was free anyways all you have to do is delete it but that shouldnt be necessary id actually play this game instead of any call of duty game anyday really you have to at least give it a try my personal rating 1010 hope you guys enjoy the game as much as i am
recommended
team work is the main task in this wonderful fps valve has done it again making endless updates to this wonderful game called team fortress 2 go check it out its even free to play now on steam
recommended
the rockets represent the hardships and malice that the soldier has been weighted with throughout his life of war he doesnt believe what his eyes are telling him all they show is limitation the heavy burden of only succeeding with violence he looks with understanding to find out what he already knows that his violence is essential for the team for survival and then he sees the way to fly

after 9 years of development valve made another very good game that made me lose nearly 2000 hours of my life team fortress 2 came out in year 2007 and is still getting updates which clearly shows how popular and awesome this game is game is really free to play which means that you dont have to pay any cent to wreck player who spent thousands of $ on it but you can buy premium to get 300 backpack slots instead of 50 free hat ability to trade your items and ability to get rare items from weekly items drop but you will have to add at least 5 to your steam wallet and just buy cheapest thing in mann co store if you have already money in steam wallet you dont even have to spend 010 to buy one i can easily recommend this game to everyone who wants to have fun without spending much money or doesnt want to spend at all and loves games with some team work many mods custom too or just loves hats

team fortress 2 is a brilliant game which sucsesfully orients its self around extream vilonce first person shooter but pulls it off with a comical feel hopeing to make people take it less seriosly the game also has an ultrapenerial aspect to it with scrap banking involved and also some items with more than 5000 you can get lots of money for doing these things i would recomend this to someone who has never had much experiance with fpss and especily someone who has not played call of duly alot becuase of the very diffrent battle styles this game would be perfect for someone who is above the age of eight

glad that you ask team fortress 2 has been quite an eye catcher since its release in 2007 gaining game of the year awards having its own large fan base with fads and memes this is one of those games that seems to live on forever its artistic style never goes out of style due to its cartoonish rendering customization is also a pinnacle of this game hats and items are bought nearly every day netting valve lots of cash each passing day the game itself is fun more fun than you could imagine in fact there are servers that are even dedicated to fun however if youre a tryhard go ahead and try those competitive servers  if youre a bit of both then just simply join a public server gameplaywise this game is very flexible almost each class is tweakable to your own style of playing yes there are a few op weapons the scout can turn into a speeding powerhouse the demoman can turn into a melee behemoth even the freaking medic can turn into an offensive class when used properly the community is also a mix of kind players some could be tryhard but will usually say the good olg gg or gg no re on arena however kids do appear in the game at times some of them might even micspam but dont worry  you can just mute them you can even kick them if the rest of the server clients agree with you overall this is a great game community gameplay the game itself 9910 01 due to the fact if youre f2p youre considered a second class player unless you can prove your skill at this game you even get less backpack space spend money on the game to get the full experience
recommended
this game is fun to play with a great community to help you out if you need help and you meet great people inside the game
recommended
the best game ever you have to try it
recommended
sooo worth the download especially now that its free hours and hours of fun and tons of unlockables what are you waiting for go get it now

ive played this game for so many hours but im still not even that great at the game i cant rocket jump for anything i still cant properly time airblasts im pretty bad with the scout ive barely played sniper at all but you know what there are a few things i can do i can pop a perfectly timed uber i can be useful as a heavy and heal my teammates with my sanvich i can stickyjump and aim the lochnload pretty well i can setup buldings in strategic spots to be as useful to my team as possible i can get backstabs half the time i try and im pretty damn good at prop hunt you see tf2 is a game you can play for the rest of your life if you find some servers with a good crowd of regulars that use their mics ive had so many fun times just effing around on some servers that alone makes the game worth trying unfortunately the tf2 community is extremely divided nowadays this community used to be one of the best around a part of it still is but the more updates there are the more the community splits apart if you plan on playing this game it being free theres no reason not to please use your mic another unfortunate thing about todays tf2 theres less people using their mics than ever and thats how you really work as a team and have fun with one another dont be afraid about being new to the game a lot of people in the community may look down on you but myself and plenty of others wont feel free to ask for help start with heavy as your first class and work from there the shenanigans that occur in this game are limitless i feel valve has strayed quite a bit from the games artstyle with all the cosmetics theyve added originally a pair of windowed shades were how far theyd stretch tf2s artstyle and now that restraint is nonexistant but the games core mechanics are still great this game has an incredibly high skill ceiling its near impossible for someone to master all the classes in the game so just find 2 or 3 that you like and play them to your hearts content i maybe only have 1 hour logged with sniper because im terrible at sniping in video games and dont like being a sniper in general but im sure if i practiced with him as much as a played as demoman or heavy or engineer or soldier or medic then id actually be decent at sniping in this game like most games practice makes perfect well not really perfect more like practice makes you credit to team initally no you wont be credit to team but the more you play the more useful you will become so keep at it and find a few classes whos playstyle suits you tldr ive played this game for a while and i still suck as sniper scout and pyro but i do make a pretty great demoman heavy engineer and medic and an average soldier and spy the classes im good at im good at because i played with them a lot and i liked their playstyle if you play this game youre almost guaranteed to find one class whos playstyle you enjoy so i encourage you to delve into tf2 and find your class after 9 years in development this game was worth the weight thanks for reading this review and have fun

this game is so fun if you get very angry take your anger out on players and bots its fun and its greate when you play with your friends plus you can also trade with your friends with some items it so cool and fun xd

holy  this game is amazing sorry had to get that out but if a friend tells you to get this game do it immediatly it is so amazing the cartoony gameplay is new and fresh the controls are amazing and you can make a good profit from this game play your cards right and you just might get a lot of free games or good items seriously from only spending a total of 41 cents on this game only to get premium i didnt regret it and i met some guy online we played and he gave me a free copy of bioschock for no reason plus it is extremely addicting and i cant stop playing in a period of 6 months or less i have spent almost 400 hours on this game it is amazing tip never say that hats are useless in chat people will call you a noob and you kind of are just to say hats show your rankings as a player for me i am decently respected and i have a couple of really good miscs the hatless the hated on a lot and buy an item to get premium trust me it is worth it in the long run

i never was a fan of the first prson shooter games i just thought that they were all the same call of duty style gameplay and nothing more course i forgot that games that ive played in the past like spyro 3 had some first person gameplay this game eventually chnged my mind on that team fortress 2 is a sequel to somewhat lesser known team fortress some of the basic missions in the game include capture the flag where you have to capture the enemies intelegence attackdefend where one team attacks and the other defends payload where one team has to deliver a bomb to the enemy and various other missions then theres the coop mode mann vs machine where its one team defending an area from an army of robots the gameplay is a lot of fun as there are tons of different choices in class and weapons it helps experimenting with them to see which class you are better at and which weapon works best for you unlike in the first game where everyone had the same line each class member scout soilder pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and spy have their own personalities and dailouge just listening to them talk or watching the meet the team series gives you a good idea on what these characters are one thing that im not fond of are the mann co creates that ocassionly appear in your inventory as drop items in order to open them you need to buy a key at the mann co store for about $230 you think by now they wouldve been a nit more friendly and just redused it down to a buck instead of people having to deal with crates pilling up in their inventory and can never sell there are also stranges vintage unusual and other named titles to make the weapons or asscessories sound more vailuble but i dont really care for it that much im just glad that i bought the mining light hat for engi before they stopped selling them so yeah tf2 is a fun first person shooter game with its missions and if you get tired of that thre are tons of fan made servers on other styles of gameplay saxton hale mode zombie survivl servers for trading or hanging out at like all of those fim servers the list never ends and since its free its a good deal the only thing you have to pay for is for buying stuff at the mann co store unless you get lucky with trading

okay i should maybe make this review more fair team fortress 2 what is there to say this game is pretty fun hours of entertainment await in this free game by our favorite developers valve hats guns giblets servers and pyros make this game extremely fun but there are some things you should know before using your space for the game it crashes a lot this game is only slightly more stable than your average bethesda game where it appears to be being held together with scotch tape so if you think you can just pickit up and play it uninterupted for hours wise up the hitboxes and lag compensation is also a problem beware if youre spy or sniper as youll likely miss an obvious headshotbackstab likewise fighting spies or sniper as youll almost definately get backstabbed while looking at the spy face to face or headshot when the sniper wasnt looking at you at some point in your experience youll also notice some balancing issues when 3 engineers start camping your spawn with 3 level 3 sentries with 4 heavies being healed by 4 medics with ubers on standbye aside from all that the game is fun modable dumb and has lots of comedy if you have patience this is one of the best shooters youll ever play if you have angerpatience issues beware

a comical firstperson shooter team fortress 2 comes right into the top few games in anyones library shoot stuff blow up stuff sometimes even burn stuff  and progressively get better at it all if youre the sort of person who likes to shoot other people online then i see no viable reason that this could not be a perfect game for you if youre a clever tactician several ingame gimmicks and combos exist to aid you into better combat thats what i enjoy the most myself and even if youre a concientious objector theres a peaceful protest sign with your name on it  literally uh maybe the rest is better left unsaid all in all a good and timelessly entertaining game  bring a friend or two along

as a fan of team fortress my opinion is very much in this games favour its freetoplay ideology proves to display little amounts of bugs which do tend to annoy the player when they occur otherwise the game is superb with great class options witty voiceacting huge fanbase and a variety of fun gamemodes weapons and costumes this game is truly one of the most enjoyable fpss of all time must get pros one of the best free to play games out there cons large amount of bugs have to pay money to look amazingmarket is cheaper 810

what is team fortress 2 it is a game full of variety and choices team fortress 2 or tf2 for short has been out for quite some time and building up a story for tf2 now the question what is tf2 will ne answered tf2 is a multiplayer only game about 9 mercenaries who fight against each other to complete certain tasks the 9 mercenaries are the scout the soldier the pyro the demoman the heavy the engineer the medic the sniper and the spy each one of these classes have theyre own personality and tricks to hide starting off with the scout he is a runner born in boston and learned quickly how to fight living where he did he takes an interest in baseball and constantly suggests that he should be in a team the scout ingame is a very fast runner that has a shotgun called the scattergun a pistol and a metal bat used in combination he has a double jump manuever although hes very fast he has very low health the lowest in the game the soldier a man who claims to have been in the army is a man who takes things way too seriously is kinda wierd in the head and is homeless we dont know too much but his old house he lived with a magician named merasumus anyways the soldier gets a rocket launcher a shotgun and a shovel as his weapon he has average health and uses his rocket launcher to his advantage by shooting a rocket at his feet making him shoot into the air this is called rocket jumping the pyro we have no idea who this is and where heshe came from this is a manwoman in a flame retardant suit that wears a gas mask and cant speak with it on so the pyros talking comes out in mumbles when the meet the pyro video came out we figures out the pyro is delusional believing the world is full of rainbows and instead of a flamethrower hes carrying an orchestra but in real life hes using a flamethrower so many people either think the pyro is a gay male or just a really wierd woman the pyro comes equipped with a flamethrower a shotgun and a fireaxe but we dont have much more information than that the demoman a scottish man who specializes in demolition takes to the battlefield drunk and really angry as a child it is said he lost his eye to a book called the bombinomicon but many believe since he talks about it so much that the loch ness monster was the cause not much is said about the demoman other than that except he has average health like the soldier and the soldier and him seem to have a good friendship he carries a grenade launcher a stickybomb laucher as he can stickybomb lauch like rocket jumping and a beer bottle the heavy a big russian man who carries around a giant minigun fighting off people on the battlefield it is said he lives in siberia we dont have too much information on him because the meet the heavy video didnt explain much like the others the heavy carries around a minigun a shotgun and as a melee his fists the engineera texas man who is a builder that can get a nice sentry gun built up in a few minutes he builds things for the team like dispensers which give ammo and a little health sentries which are helpful for defending and teleporters to get to the battlefield like the heavy we dont have too much info on him he carries around a shotgun a pistol and a wrench he can also upgrade all of the said buildings by hitting them with his wrench the medic the medic is a german medic who cares not for the patient but for the treatment he lived in rottenburg and kept a bird named archamedies the medic carries around a syringe gun a healing gun or medigun and a bonesaw the sniper an austrailan sniper who lives in a camper van on the road he specializes in headshots and shooting sniper rifles he carries a sniper rifle an smg and a kukri or a big claw looking knife the spy a frenchman shrouded in mystery his main attack is backstabbing people with his knife the spy carries around a revolver a sapper that destroys engineers buildings a knife a invisable watch and a disguise kit the part that makes the spy so dangerous is the disguise kit he could be anyone on the other team he disguises himself to look like a class of his choosing so the spy could be anyone the pyro is a good counter to the spies though as the spies when they use theyre invisable watch they will be shown by the fire around them the economy tf2 is a game that is filled with hats and cosmetics and people are willing to pay for them this means there is a currency as well it is metal in the game there is a crafting option you can take a couple of weapons you have and craft them together to make metal take that metal you made them make 2 more then craft those 3 together and you have a bigger value of metal this is a frustrating thing to do but if you want that item that bad then go for it choices when i said the game was full of variety and choices i mean this you have the ability to use hundreds of weapons at your disposal but to do that you must play after a while of playing it will say you have found an item this is how you earn weapons and eventually cosmetics each class varies in weapon that being said your loadout could be completely different in every way to someone elses man vs machine in tf2 there is a gamemode called man versus machine or mvm for short its about robots that attack certain areas with a bomb you have to defend the area to make sure these robots dont reach that area and put the bomb in or you lose the robots are robotic versions of all mercenaries and some are giant versions there is also a tank but im not going to get into that trading this will be the final part of the review trading is a bit of a problem in this game as there are but few scammers here you can trade metal for items like taunts cosmetics and weapons or you could trade a weapon for a weapon or a taunt for a taunt in trading there are items called unusuals do not bother trying to get one unless you have mann co keys from the store im sorry but this is the end of the guide but in short tf2 is a fun game full of variety for people to enjoy like myself anyways i hope you enjoyed the guide and i will see you later 3

ive played the  out of this game but for some people 500 hours is nothing tf2 is a awesome fps that is very different from most for the reason of it being pretty comical and a cartoony style which makes it so great why i love this game so much is the community of all the weapons you can collect and the hats you get to show whos inventory as the most vaule the maps people create are amazing when i comes to achievement idle or trading maps or just plain goofing off in a mingame based tf2 ware this game never gets old hell the real best part is its free so no reason not to get it

its a great multiplayer game thats very addicting i reccomend this game to people who enjoy first person shooters

in my opinion the best free to play game on steam available from what ive seen if you love fpss you will love tf2 if you love a mix of strategy and classedbased combat youll love tf2 if you like comedy and goofiness influenced in gameplay youll love tf2 and if you like hats well you get the point but truthfully this is an amazing game i honestly dont know why its free because it deserves to be a paytoplay game and another thing my laptop is probably around 5 or 6 years old and ill be honest not the best but when i first launched it it acted like it was nothinghigh quality too so you really dont have to worry about it lagging so much at least from your computer still depends on your connection to play multiplayer of course and if it is laggy on your computer it was free anyways all you have to do is delete it but that shouldnt be necessary id actually play this game instead of any call of duty game anyday really you have to at least give it a try my personal rating 1010 hope you guys enjoy the game as much as i am
recommended
if you want some fun play this 
recommended
1 year ive been playing this and i still think im new to this game
recommended
team fortrees 2 is awesome
recommended
i got assassinated by myself 1010
recommended
this game is an average shootemup however the cartoony style ragdolls and gibs give it a funny atmosphere 1010
recommended
i like this game for not being just a basic fps first person shooter like cod call of duty its more of a puzzle shooter why i think it is more of a puzzle shooter is because each class has its weakness and the other class help their weaknesses
recommended
team fortress 2 or tf2 has truly earned its way into my top 5 games list with its imaginitive characters setting gameplay and features make this game an absolute musthave for any fan of fps games or steam members the game has many game modes that never get old or boring along with the games array of classes the game is always fresh and fun problems i encountered in other fps games like call of duty are they never involve strategy or team building in tf2 however teamwork must be used in order to win making it extremly fun and imersing to play with friends every class has a weaknes and strength along with imitations and constrictions that allow you to become accustomed to your own class and playing stradegy this overall allows for a extremely fun gaming experience
recommended
good f2p game basic physics and graphics engine adds a nice touch with voice acting and weapon styles
recommended
best free to play game
recommended
i reccomend this game its free plus its fun lots and lots of fun seriously its really fun believe me when i say this are you bad at videogames you can be good at this one possibly the only multiplayer game with built in aimbots just choose the engineer class and build a sentry do you like op one hit kills tf2 is the game for you go sniper or spy and headshot or backstab all the baddies theyll hate you for it but really do you care no if you do you probably shouldnt be playing a game with guns in it if you dont care and you like aimbots dont cheat in other games play tf2 instead because here its allowed
recommended
its skyrim with hats 1310

recommended
constant free content random items drops and tons of maps both community and developer made this game is a must have and for 20 bucks it clearly beats many of the more overlyhyped games like call of duty or halo if you have steam or if u play games or if u watch other people play games or if u just like stuff with the word game in it this is not a must buy this is a need a neccessity and a game not just for the average steam user but for all gamers in general
recommended
this is a realy awesome game      
recommended
team fortress 2 is a game about the most cut throat thing in human history fashion every aspect of this award winning game is made as an allegory to the ever changing world of fashion and the pitfalls that can befall any who wish to partake of this amazing experience you must find hats and accessories through a random drop system that represents the elusive mistress of inspiration then you must find the perfect colors names and descriptions for your hats and accesories to set yourself apart from the other less fortunate players of the game this would be a boring system much like the many you can find in the bland jrpgs that litter the market what sets tf2 apart is their inclusion of a fantastic and complicated minigame about shooting each other that blends wonderfully into the allegorical narrarative of cut throat fast paced deadly fashion

im just gonna make a short list to make things clear pros  its not paytowin unlockable weapons are sidegrades but almost no upgrades  9 very unique classes with extreme up and downsides if you wanna win you need teamwork  since there are almost only sidegrades they offer different playstyles to discover  fast gameplay  overall nice balance nothing is too overpowered  a fun coopmode mann vs machine  6 players against waves of robot enemies  unique 60s comiclike style watch the trailers to get an idea of the games style  great humor characters voice lines ingame news item descriptions   a nice way to individualize your characters with cosmetic items they dont affect the gameplay  still a lot of updates which include bugfixes new cosmetic items maps and weapons  steam workshop implementation community items are actually often put into the game  nice competitive scene  much game modification possible custom skins custom sounds custom hud you know the drill its source engine  premiumaccounts dont bring any gameplay advantages  longtime fun since theres much to discover cons  some unlocks are rather annoying  some classes need much practice until you become effective for your team  content upgrades often only bring new cosmetics less maps and rarely weapons  still lots of minor bugs which need to be fixed  workshop is only for items but not maps some facts you should also know when you want to try specific weapons  you gain items randomly when playing its a random amount which resets every thursday you usually find weapons you can also find cosmetic items but only when youre premium  if you want to try a specific weapon try the the ingame shop and look out for a testbutton usually you are able to test the weapon for some days  if you want to have the weapon as your own item play the game until you gain some random drops and use the trading system to trade for items with other people people usually trade 2 random weapons with 1 specific weapon  dont buy weapons from the shop its horribly overpriced thats about it if you like a fast teamworkbased online shooter you will also like team fortress 2 give it a shot and download it

if this game dosnt define good gaming then i dont know what does

team fortress 2 is a teambased firstperson shooter multiplayer computer game developed by valve it is the successful sequel to tream fortress classic it first came out in a compilation called the orange box which is no longer avaliable as of 2011 team fortress 2 is a free to play game where you can upgrade to premium via purchasing something from the team fortress 2 ingame store gameplay this fun game is based on two oppisite teams builders league united often refered to as blu team and red team reliable excavation and demolition players can choose to play as one of the nine character classes in these teams each with their own unique strenghts weaknesses and weapons each class consist of a primary weapon a secondary weapon and a melee weapon although certain classes contain pdas and other unique items team fortress 2 was released with six offical maps but many more maps have been added a neat little addition to this game is the administrator a woman announces different game events over pa or loudspeaker so that everyone in the game can hear it stats are a extreamly nice addition to this game where time played as a certain class most kills as that class and most objectives achived in that life etc game modes in capture the flag maps the objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy teams base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same the player carrying the intelligence can be killed to drop the briefcase or the player can willingly drop it in either case this starts a brief timer a team can only score by delivering the enemys intelligence to their base a match lasts until one team scores a set number of points or time runs out a variant of capture the flag called special delivery has teams vying over a single briefcase to attempt to deliver to a common target once the intelligence is picked up by one team only members of that team can carry it until either it successfully delivered or the drop timer expires and it is returned to its original spawn point control point modes are more varied in their objectives but share the common aim of capturing a particular point on the map by having one or more team members stay on the point without the presence of the opposing team for a short period of time in standard control point maps each team already controls an equal number of points with one additional point left unclaimed teams can only attempt to capture points that are nearest to those points they already control each team attempts to progressively capture all the control points to win the round in attackdefendstyle maps the red team already controls all the points on the map and must hold these points from being captured by the opposing team blu team for a length of time attackdefendstyle maps can come in either singleround or multipleround maps rounds past the first will only be played if blu wins a round territorial control is a more complex version of control point in which each map is divided into a number of closed sections held between the two teams each round has one team attempting to seize control of the opposing teams capture point for that section in a fixed amount of time once a team holds all but the enemys home base point they then attempt to capture the enemy base point while the enemy defends for a fixed amount of time king of the hill features a single control point in the center of the map with teams vying for control over it the control point is locked for a set amount of time after the round start once the point is unlocked either team can capture it capturing the control point starts the teams clock counting down the clock that is currently counting down will only stop if the other team captures the point the clock reaches 000 or another mapspecific event occurs such as a halloween boss spawning during the halloween event teams win the round when their clock reaches 000 with the control point currently under their control if the other team is capturing the point the round will not end until the points capture progress resets to 0 payload maps feature a length of track atop

target that the other team defends the cart moves when one or more players of the team are near it without enemies nearby during this the cart heals and provides ammo to those close by if no one is by the cart it may move backwards towards the last checkpoint or roll off uphill sections of the track in payload races both teams race to deliver a bombcart to a final target there are no checkpoints and unmanned carts will not move in reverse but still require team members nearby to fully complete uphill sections both types of payload maps can come in singleround or multipleround maps in standard payload further rounds will only be played if blu wins in payload race all rounds will be played regardless of which team wins but the winner of previous rounds starts with their cart farther up the

team fortress 2 after 7 years of its lifetime still hosts a great communitymostly the grand feature of this game is the classes they all have something unique about them comparing spy and sniper spy is more relaxed mischivousis this how you spell it and a guy likes to  with your head sniper is rude curses way more than spyspy does say  you occasionally and even likes to mock the dead charming but theres more their isnt just pick sniper cause 360 no scopesalthough a new weapon allows for this they all are handy in different situations spy is great for sapping and destroying strong enemies behind enemy lines sniper is great for picking off the medic and engineersweirdly sniper is a counter to engineer theres all unique playstyles in the game but some might not be your cup of tea scout is fast moving soldier is strong and has high mobility pyro burns  demoman blows up whatever the  he sees heavy is tank nuff said engineer is the high intelligence defence builder medic is that most is the most helpful class on the front lines sniper stays back and shoots peoples heads off spy is the chaser or the chased 9 different playstyles but none of them might fit you but we have someone to spice up the playstyles some weapons in tf2 can completely change your playstyle eg the air strike encourgages you to rocket jump for that extra firing speed that is fast as usain bolt another eg the base jumper encourages you to put on the air strike for soldier for extra damage and mobility overall a 1010 but does lack in major updates but that dosent matter as they change up the game most of the minor ones

recommended
a good game for all mature ages with hats
recommended
its big its loud its diverse it requires skill involves guns explosions fire rocketsand what more could an fps gamer want
recommended
one of my favorite games on steam
recommended
this is one of the finest hatthemed simulators around youd be hard pressed to find a better game with such a vast amount of fashionable headwear i came for the hats and i stayed for the hats something that cant be said about many other video games look no further don your derby show off your chapeau and kick  and take names while wearing your toque on team fortress 2
recommended
such a fun game couldnt resist investing money
recommended
there are 2 companies the reliable excavative demolition red and the builders league united blu who are competing against each other both of the company owners blutarch of blu and redmond for red hired mercenaries to put an end to one another this is where tf2 multiplayer takes place in the multiplayer there are 2 teams red and blu and you can choose between 9 characters these characters include the scout demo man pyro sniper medic spy heavy engineer and soldier each class has their own weapons and abilities such as the medic can heal people the spy can disguise as other players the scout can move twice as fast than others etc the gameplay is so much fun overall team fortress goes beyond great gameplay it has one of the most funbest first person shooter multiplayer out there there is just the multiplayer no campaign mode but the multiplayer is enough and team fortress 2 still outstands many of the video games out there also its free ok its sort of free you still can to buy items from the ingame store which is relatively cheap so if you like fps this is your game
recommended
team fortress 2 is such an addicting game when i first played it on my old pc it was freaking laggy i thought it would be a boring game my friend kept asking me to play it when i got a new pc but i had doubts because of how big the file size is i decided to play it anyway it was freaking fun i couldnt stop playing all the game modes are cool all the classes are good in their own way my kdr in tf2 is good unlike in other fps games where im horrible i recommend playing this game its a shame if you cant run it but it is worth trying 
recommended
im 100% addicted to this game its a really fun game with many ways to play it its unlike most games in terms of its game play yet probably better than any other game ive ever played you are able to customize your character loadout and theres 9 different charactersclasses you can choose from to start tons of game modes and maps plus its free ive meet many people and made many friends by playing this game and i know you will too id rate this game 1110 and id recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new amazing game to play and a new addiction
recommended
quite an interesting design may i say the game is a cartoonyrealistic shooter based on the american outbacks of the 1970s which introduces you into a very exciting fantastic world of endless battles led by free willing mercenaries that face no consequences for their wars and magically respawn after being shattered into pieces by rockets fighting on land and not in law for the territories of two dramatically cursed brothers that bicker until the end of their century long lives and after and you also have hats lots
recommended
it seems simplistic but this game can give you hundreds of hours of entertainment
recommended
this game is extremely fun to play the friendly community will welcome most people of good nature and the modded servers allow for many different experiences through this game
recommended
this is a very fun free to play online fps game i recommend playing it and hopefully we will get some more content added in the future
recommended
its one of the best games i have 
recommended
a great game for casual and competitive players that is based heavily on teamwork i give it 9 out of 10 due to some steam cloud errors on occasion but otherwise this is a great game
recommended
i think everyone has this so what else is a better reason to get it
recommended

recommended
i love this game because of the fact that it has over the past 5 or so years developed a diverse and mechanical economy of its own i have spent countless hours trading crafting and buying several hundreds of items over the past year and the fact that this economy has been almost entirely developed by the steam community is remarkable i would be shocked if i found a steam user who did not already own this masterpiece of a game any other mmofps game that has been thrown my way has not even come close to the mastery of this here game 1000010 tldr

recommended
i have been playing team fortress 2 for a year now and all i can say is its an amazingly unique fps game it can go from serious to silly in a matter of seconds and the playstyle of the 9 classes is special in every way the community is extremely friendly and sometimes even helpful and not only that the personalities of the nine mercenaries are just downright hilarious so if you are looking to have some silly fun times while blowing people and stuff up to pieces then team fortress 2 is the game for you
recommended
its ok i guess
recommended
to addictive to stop
recommended
team fortress 2 is without a doubt the greatest shooter game i have ever played while 11 year old tryhards slobber over rehashed call of duty garbage real gamers are playing this colorful creative funny well developed well written well put together and very well done first person shooter game the game is free so there is no excuse for you not to check it out you really shouldnt regret it unless you suffer from addiction to games then avoid this game at all costs

team fortress 2 i believe will be the future of fps games unlike other games where your just running around spraying automatic rifles this game involves teamwork and has 9 classes to help do this its all evenly balanced with every class able to counter another class and every class having a counter theres also a wide range of weapons to customize your loudout they also have many kinds of fun game modes both official and community made to top all of this off if youre a hardcore gamer like me you can play competitive which is a more highly skill based teams fighting each other theres two verions of competitive 6s where it is 2 scouts 2 soldiers 1 demo and 1 medic on each team and there is highlander which is 1 of every class no matter the gamemode you and your teammates will be on the mic relaying info to each other such as if a enemy is hurt or if someone is down

welli bought the game years ago when it was sold on a disc i was like in elementary school and i enjoyed the game but then i kinda stopped and lost the activation code for it so i couldnt play it but lately i saw it was f2p and was quite excited to see that valve has kept a f2p game up like this is impressive and is one of the reasons why valve is my favorite game company this game is great and will be for the years to come thanks for the great game

ever wish you could have that very expensive hat you saw at that one store well fear no more this is the worlds most loved and realistic hat simulator on earth it even has the people who insult you over your hat it even comes with the wars that come with your hats 1110 would go bankrupt over virtual hats again
recommended
its all about da hats man
recommended
this game is sugoi and kawaii get it
recommended
team fortress 2 is a team based game that focuses around 9 different classes working together to fight against another team for a free to play game it is quite good as you can customise your characters and get new weapons i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes to do something fun 
recommended
probably my most played game of all time its really good
recommended
y it not inclood webbz
recommended
no game has sucked more time out of my life than team fortress 2 this is one of the few fpss where you actually have to think and the only one where having a hat thats on fire makes you pro try this mothaa out if you havent already brother
recommended
great game
recommended
team fortress 2 good game to play laugh
recommended
its ok
recommended
this game is referred to as the best  or second best depends on whether you prefer this or dota 2 free to play title ever created i personally agree with this statement to a certain level but i can not help but feel that i must disagree with this statement this games presentation is amazing from the menus to the design and layout of the maps i can actually feel all the work put into the development of this game the menus use a basic layout that have both a simple and complex feel to them you are presented with a wealth of options to adjust your gameplay experience but you ever feel overwhelmed by the number of options available graphically this game is nothing sepcial by 2013s standards but back in 2007 this game was beautiful its cartoonish style and the charm of all its characters draw you in rather easily the maps themselves are rather amazing to look at though some are better than others the gameplay is what really draws many people in it consists of classes that possess both strengths and weaknesses  basically they are well balanced the gameplay changes with each class and you will always have a preferrence of classes however the gameplay could eventually feel repetitive and soon turn a person off of the game but to conteract this valve releases weekly updates for the game and have enable trading within this game the game will reward a player with loot for either earning a certain number of achievements completing certain tasks or for just playing the game the loot can either be considered useless useful stupid or great but that all depends on class and preference for the type of loot i personally love playing as the sniper and am thrilled whenever i unlock a new sniper rifle the game also features crafthing which motivates players into buying or earning certain items just to get another overall the game is great and i certainly think that it is highly enjoyable but i feel that most of that enjoyment comes from the offers valve tosses our way when we play tf2 which is not really good for the games reputation i hope that i proved to be of some assistance and please remember that this is my opinion and everyones opinion varies thanks for reading
recommended
the xbox 360 version is better only stock weapons allowed all engi 2fort and nobody plays on hydro
recommended
id say that it ruined my life but before team fortress 2 i didnt have a life 5 stars
recommended
it is pretty good sometimes
recommended
tf2 is a must have and you should feel ashamed and dirty if you dont already have it everyone and their mother is boasting their f2p game nowadays but it usually turns out to be a pay2win tf2 is not like that at all while some people may argue the whole mann co store makes the game pay2win theyre lying every weapon in the game can be aquired through random drops no painful leveling no grinding just play at your own leisure and the weapon will eventually fall into your lap if you are an impatient little  you can always just go to the mann co store and spend a candy bars worth of money on whatever weapon you want tf2 is an incredibly balanced game with no class being better than the other cough pyrocough all of that aside you have 9 completely different play styles if you dont count the plethora of different weapons and gamemodes where you might play a class entirely different valve the sweethearts they are also host holiday events and constantly add in new weapons and hats oh yeah there are hats along with competitive play you can spend money to play with friends cool right in all honesty the tf2 coop gamemode is lots of fun and is really hectic and chaotic but dear god is it difficult its probably just cause i suck tf2 is truly a spectacle in the fps world managing to rake in more money than ethiopia in a year by selling hats now these hats are not real they are a line of code they dont increase health or make you jump higher they make you look cool this is one of the aspects im not so crazy about this hathierarchy if you will causes a lot of discrimination between the community as to whos free to play and whos not along with that the community is not the best in the world especially not the man vs machine one tf2s coop game overall tf2 is a great game to have in your library it brings hours and hours of fun and excitement and is great to play with friends or by yourself as an fps in general it is more goofy than battlefield or call of duty what it lacks in seriousness it makes up for in charm and being better than call of duty my final rating for tf2 is 810 for being a fun and totally replayable fps for everyone it is great as an entry level fps or one for veterans also its freeeeeee so go on go get it what are you waiting for im going to stand here until you go and get it if you disagree with me feel free to tell me why and try and sway my opinion otherwise
recommended
i love you baby
recommended
you know what i recommend this not because its a good game which it is but because i know that somewhere somewhere there is a person a person that doesnt give any bulls about the outside world if that person is readint this right now pick this game up youll never see the outside world again or the rest of your house or anyone you held dear to your heart but who cares when you have all these hats
recommended
everytime i boot this game up i play one game if i do not receive a hat in the time it takes to play one game i quit one day the hat fairy will bestow her gifts upon me one day
recommended
awsom game its my liffe
recommended
this game is freeckin amazing lol$$
recommended
this next part i dont remember so hot all i know is i got up from the bed like i was going down to the can or something and then i tried to sock him with all my might right smack in the toothbrush so it would split his goddam throat open only i missed i didnt connect all i did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something it probably hurt him a little bit but not as much as i wanted it probably wouldve hurt him a lot but i did it with my right hand and i cant make a good fist with that hand on account of that injury i told you about
recommended
2 steps for being awesome 1 buy team fortress 2 2 play it
recommended

recommended
good game i just recomend to try easy servers for newbies
recommended
hats hatsfordays
recommended
this game is the greatest thing you will ever play in your life really good 010
recommended
had fun shooting guys in the testicles and did i mention the hats hats are a thing totally didnt take up half of my computer memory with hat models and unusual effects and i only spent about $400 usd on this game and wasted about 1000 hours on this game 6910 would recommend to anyone under the age of pasta
recommended
good but need hats to play well
recommended
is very cool play
recommended

recommended
13 year old put his mom on the mic and told me to  off for scamming him and stealing her money 1110
recommended
team fortress 2 is an fps game with a singleplayer and multiplayer servers i think that this game is awesome but they need to upgrade the weaponitem drop system it needs to give new players a few more items than people who have been playing the game more often the textures are somewhat realistic with a sort of cartoony feel to them the player models are good but could use a little more detail even if its a cartoony game basic plot mann co a company run by the tough saxton hale who had 3 sons red blu and grey red and blu exiled grey and fought with eachother like maniacs grey came back with replicas of red and blus armies robots classes scout soldier pyro demo heavy engineer medic sniper and spy
recommended
1000 hours all i need to say
recommended
if you havnt played this game you are not a true gamer so get it its free
recommended
best game in steam
recommended
like hotel california you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave
recommended
such a fun game takes time to get used to but lots of fun
recommended
one of the best games i have played
recommended
so addicting
recommended
best game ever could improve the lag pervention though
recommended
quite possibly the greatest hat simulator for pc as of right now but the shooting elements feel tacked on and not as well polished as the hat simulating aspects of the game valve has also shown zero progress in fixing the gamebreaking bug where your steam funds slowly drain and hats keep appearing in your inventory upon installing the game the shooting is subpar it is ladden with bugs and the community is terrible but the hats look cool 1110 would waste life on again

recommended
this game broke me 1010
recommended
cool
recommended
tf2s ideal for quick intense matches or fun rolling battles being free to play means that theres barely any barrier to play and the game allows you to play to your style now find yourself a strong friendly accepting community of fun people to play with and you dont need any other games
recommended
my friend taught how to play tf2 because she was always talking about it and i dicided to play just to see but now i play every day and i recommend
recommended
if you like shooting hats or trading this is the game to play
recommended
this game is its its too great to be described with mere adjectives this game is absolutely with out a doubt one of the best games out there it was indeed worth the weight its art style is amazing because it is so unique and different from anything ive ever seen this goes for both the characters items and enviorment i find the games visual appearence breathtaking for the small amount of soundtracks this game consists of they are amazing this game is great because it seemingly never gets old with dozens of different gamemodes exciting new content updates and its annual scream fortress smissmas and other events yet the best thing about the game at least to me it is is the nine classes that the game consists of each class is full of personality and dialogue whether its insulting taunts or hillarious cathphrases all of the classes are very different from each other with weapons dialogue attitude style and the way you play as them first off you have your offensive category consisting of the scout soldier and pyro the scout is a fast smartmouthed all bark and no bite kind of kid with weapons that are most effective at close range requiring a hitandrun sort of tactic the soldier is a dedicated american with a strong passion to fight possessing a rocket launcher as his primary weapon the soldier is a powerful threat to his opponents but all that power leaves him with a slow speed requiring him to use a maneuver known as the rocket jump to travel faster in exchange for some health the pyro is a mumbling lunatic whose history is a mystery to just about everyone he or possibly she wields a flamethrower as hisher main weapon which makes himher lack a lot of range but gives a lot of potential power if used correctly heshe is best used for ambushing enemies and hisher compresion blast airblast can be used to reflect many projectiles back at opponents next is the deffensive category the demoman heavy and engineer the demoman is a oneeyed drunk scottish man who has no bulletbased weapons and fights instead with 2 explosive weapons he can take out enemies that he cant see with his grenade launcher or lay traps with his sticky launcher the heavy is a large strong russian beast that uses his beloved minigun his immense power and large size leaves him with a very slow speed but with very strong fire power he may be considered an easy target due to his size but as long as he has his minigun he should be treated as a threat just like all the other classes the engineer is a intelligent texan that relies mainly on his buildings to fight his sentry gun is generally a threat to any enemy within its range he can build a dispenser to heal him and his teammates as well as refill there ammo and he can also build teleporters so his team can access areas faster the last category is the supportive classes consisting of the medic sniper and spy the medic is a german doctor with amazing medical technology at his disposal he is not one known for attacking but instead he is known for healing using his medigun he can quickly heal his teammates once charged enough he can deploy what is known as an ubercharge making him and whoever he is healing temporarily invincible to any damage from enemy weapons the sniper is an austrailian outdoorsman who as his name suggests uses a sniper rifle as his main weapon he can do extreme ammounts of damage at long range making him a valueble teammate when used correctly at short range though he is more vulnerable and can easily be overwhelmed by enemies lastly we have the spy a french trickster who can disguise himself as his opponents and quietly sneak behind enemy lines he can perform a backstab resulting in an instant kill use his sapper to destroy enemy buildings such as sentries and use his cloaking device to become temporarily invisible to sneak around danger playing as a spy requires stealth and smarts to succeed the best thing about all these characters is the fact that other than the heavy being the games main icon none of the classes seem to be better than the rest they all have their own special weaknesses and none of them are generally favored over the others the game is a masterpiece and thats all i can say
recommended
i love this game to much to not set it down lol
recommended
good and nice game3
recommended
best game i ever played i will play it for the rest of my life
recommended
best free to play game i have ever played
recommended

recommended
this game is so awsomebaby
recommended
if you havent played this game there is something wrong with you
recommended
there are hats
recommended
if you ever felt like you lacked a hatbased economy in your live this is for you
recommended
best game ever created
recommended
faboulas
recommended
severe lack of fortresses do not be fooled
recommended
super addicting and fun game with unique classes really takes away from main stream cod shooters on todays market of fpss
recommended
1010 very good multiplayer and a must have for valve lovers
recommended
its one of those innovative games that promotes different gameplay if you are a cod or battlefield player then try this game but memorise all weapon stats first because this game has no assault rifles and snipers does not one hit kill not unless its a headshot although this game is pretty cool it kept me covered when im bored for 2 years and on going and its really fun its free so yeah that is self explanatory
recommended
its the best game ever
recommended
its fun and like yea and u pay money and u like its good cuz u win
recommended
ive lost my friends and family because they bothered me while playing tf2 my girlfriend left me for another man due to neglect and i sold my house to buy keys to open crates i sold my pc to buy food so i wouldnt starve i am homeless and currently typing this on a computer at the library 1010
recommended
this game is awsome 1010 i like how it alway updates and adds new weps and hats
recommended
my only favorite addicting free online game on steam
recommended
this game is no question my favourite game of all time in the universe and its easily the best team based shooter ever to be created will you enjoy it dont let me be the judge of that this game is 100% free go ahead download it and try it out for yourself hate this game because the graphics are unrealistic to me thats why its so lovable and contributes to why its survived for so long microtransactions from the mann co store arent necessary and items like hats australuims unusuals etc arent needed to be good at tf2 im not to dis trading however its something you can use to your advantage and profit hundreds if not thousands of dollars i certainly have and you can utilize the steam community market to get funds when you need em
recommended
perhaps my favorite game the large community and great moddability make this a great game in my opinion with both official and community servers often running custom maps and plugins you can spend your time blowing things up as a demoman or just run around a trade map showing off your cosmetics either way its an interesting game and theres nothing quite like it
recommended
i love this game  its like having a baby  you really love it at first  like a lot  then you forgot it for about 1 year and after that you still find it and you love him again  
recommended
fun nonserious game the right move for a cool dude
recommended
the virtual hats in my inventory gives me flashbacks to the days where my wallet was full and i had multiple wives the sacrifice was worth it
recommended
its ok
recommended
team fortress 2 is an amazing if not best teamworkoriented fps i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves either team work firstperson shooters or having a good laugh
recommended
this is a great game but it takes foreever to load
recommended
team fortress 2 is very awesome good graphics very enjoyably and addictive hope that the game will go well in the future but there are some things thats kinda out of hand first is the community pricing about items damn the price just keeps higher and higher its getting out of control besides that everythings is all good get this game ratedm
recommended
lots of acheivements and stuff that is fun simple d
recommended
its a hat simulator not a hate simulator
recommended
has hats & sandwichs nuff said
recommended
anyone who is a fan of fps games and hats should play this
recommended
this game is great
recommended
really love this game 
recommended
its a fun game get it
recommended
1010 would pay for hats again
recommended
the red vs blue factor seems like a playful thing in this game alot of the time red and blue are depicted as teaming up quite a bit thats what makes this game diffrent and i love it
recommended
this was the reason i joined steam thank you valve <3
recommended
ah team fortress 2 who couldnt love this title after all the content added and popularity it has across the globe its fast paced and is so much fun to play with friends at almost any time over all a great expeariance
recommended
an excellent and fastpaced shooter from the past a must have for everyone
recommended
the game is a fun fps with multiple classes to vary up your play style and changes the way it is from other fpss then it just being a point and shoot with the regular fps guns smg sniper assualt rifle etc but tf2 adds a more expansive take with weapons flamethrower minigun sentries etc id say this game is worth it since its been pretty active for 8 years to this date although the game has multiple hats misc etc for you to wear on your characters and different types of weapons genuine vintage strange etc with along the trading the comes along with this game and can get you into a fuss over wanting an item for a long time and then going into the habbit of buying everything from either the mann co store or the steam market this game will consume your money more then pickpocketers in europe although the game is a new a fun fps with still 8 years of active people and with the downfall of trading i still give this game a 910
recommended
great game not pay to win at all i have put too many hours into it and do not regret a moment
recommended
in my opinion this game can temporarily help you to relieve your stress and let you have a great time playing it i definitely recommend this game to those who are not yet playing it it is free afterall make the best use out of it xd
recommended
i always have so much fun playing with my mates
recommended
most fun i have ever had in playing a game
recommended
nice hat collection simulator
recommended
its great very immersive online gameplay with an amazing community especially trading would recommend on a whim
recommended
some say that the graphics are from comics i think their great so come on its one of the best multiplayer games ever and its free valve is the best
recommended
when there is no more room in hell gibus wearing f2ps will roam the earth
recommended
whatever you do dont buy anything in this game at all once youve bought something in the game for the first time youll forget how outrageous the prices are for each item and before you know it youll be all out of money because you spent it all on hats 1010
recommended
tf2one of the best games ive ever playedlike it
recommended
this game shows me a decent way of cooperation with team and vulgar words to be used 
recommended
this game does it again the thing i love about valve games isno matter how much you play itthere is countless servers with mods or different game modesbasically expanding the game way beyond its limitsjust like css and day of defeati find myself playing official modes now and thenand the next second im already playing some of the weird game modes i do not really like mvm for some reasoni think itsjust not my style plusthis game is ing cursed i love collecting stuff and hoarding itemssothis game did hit me really hard i find myself trying to collect more hatsyeshatsand when i think i have all the ones i wanta freaking update comes up and brings lots of new ones that i want to get soyeahthis game is pretty adictivei would recommend itdefinitelyspecially because it is free to playbut be warnedif you pick up speedthis game is just like drugs it s you upit leaves you poor and regretting all the stuff you bought in herebut with many little valuablesof course <3
recommended
this game is the very reason i dont own a car have any social skills or an education but at least i can say i have hats 1010
recommended
circle of tf2 think youre good > see people with hats better than yours \   \  spend $money$ on better hats < think youre bad
recommended
lag compensation unbalanced teams 4 snipers and 3 spies on blu at least you know the downsides now upsides  very addictive versatile classes great performance huge amount of servers to play on lots of differents modes and mods every class has its weakness team work is the main factor for winning matches 8510
recommended
this is the only game where the main focus has turned to hats and there is a hat disguised as a hat hats and bread 14 hats  10 would wear an absurd amount of hats again
recommended
its an awesome game
recommended
awesome game soo adictive just get itits free
recommended
this game is probably one of the best fps games i have ever played it includes 9 different classes with their own personality like the scout he likes baseball and can strangely double jump hes incredibly fast which makes him a good addon to the offensive classes team fortress 2 is free to play now so everyone including gibus wearers can enjoy the fun probably im not that ermg it haz goats 1010 guy overall my rating is 9810
recommended
so the infamous team fortress 2 the game has been around for a long time 8 years to be exact and was first brought out on xbox 360 as a bundle the orange box still to this day the game has a large community keeping the game alive this game is a huge benefactor in the trading community and is constantly having various updates to the game for new items and refreshes to keep the game going as most of you already know team fortress 2 is a multiplayer fps with an objective to defeat the opposing side been blu or red depending on what side you are on throughout various types of game modes the class system consists of 9 characters to pick from 1 scout a fast agile character primarilly played to get into the enemy base and capturesteal the intellegence 2 soldier a slow but strong character weilding a rocket launcher he is played to be offensive and support the team by killing everyone basically 3 pyro played to be offensive and spy check so the spy does not get into your back line and take out your team and sentries etc 4 demoman a slow character played to support your team by getting into the back line and drop bombs everywhere and destroy their defences and keep the enemies in their spawn 5 heavy the heavy is a very slow charcter but to make up for this he weilds a minigun and has a tonne of heath you guessed it he just sits there as a tank and kills and defends as he pleases 6 engineer the engineer is solely a defensive character who supports the team he is very versitile he builds sentries to defend sets up teleporters and has a dispenser which regrenerates heath and stocks up on ammo for nearby friendlies 7 medic as the name says the medic is a support and runs around healing your team pretty straight forward 8 sniper now the sniper sits back and defends with his rifle this character can take out anyone with a single shot making him a valuable asset to any team 9 spy the spy supports the team greatly by getting into the back line and to take out the engineers gear doing so allows the scout to get in the base and capture the points and grab the intellegence doing so will win the game all of these characters fit together and each of them play their own role towards winning the game so now we have that out of the way i would say this is a great game especially because its completely free and things you buy from the store or market have no actual affect in game and are purely visual changes to the game which makes it a completely even game so no pay 2 win i would definitely reccomend this to anyone who enjoys fps titles 1010 the games free so what do you have to lose 
recommended
team fortress 2 is awesome and here is my five reasons why 1 its free 2 there are nine diffrent caracters  3 you can get free guns and tools and headgear and more 4 you can borrow things that cost in a few days 5 there are many diffrent gamemodes to play ohh and u can buy stuff
recommended

a very fun game overall each class doesnt seem to overpowered with strengths and weaknesses the games free so if you have steam just download it in your free time and start playing the weapons are so varied and each has a possible potential to be useful also has a variaty of maps and different gamemodes im not saying these are the best classes just my opinion

tf2 in a nutshell
recommended
its ok i guess
recommended
come on its tf2 a clear favourit for alot of people i just love it the timeless grafics and great speach and story behind all the characters pros grafics lore community mechanics noob friendly cons the trading that ruins the gameplay taunts that make the game seem like some cosplay
recommended
what is this game maybe the best team based game in the hole worlddont miss this opportunity and download it now
recommended
best conga simulator 2014 1010 will play
recommended
if you want some fun play this 
recommended
1 year ive been playing this and i still think im new to this game
recommended
team fortrees 2 is awesome
recommended
hat simulator the game play is actualy fun though 1110
recommended
things that make it better than a regular old boring fps actual personality the guns arent the same thing hats great community not hard to learn bad things nothing you fool
recommended
honestly this is one of my favorite shooter games there is team fortress 2 is often calledout for its cartoon like style but while in gameplay people will find this feature unique there is a major demand for cosmetics in the game however
recommended
this is one of the best games i have ever played i recommend it to all people and think that valve and steam should keep up the good work 
recommended
love this game and love my friends on it some ppl that play are awesome i think if your looking for one to meet knew friends this is the game just dont pay any attention to the trolls they are no body but this game is amazing love it
recommended
maybe its the quirky character personalities or the over the top jokes but i cant get enough of tf2 tf2 has its own style and personality that sets it apart from other fps tf2 is not a hardcore shooter although there are exceptions to this instead it is breeming with dark humor and stereotypical charm tf2 may catch you off guard but with time youll come to love it in tf2 each class is carefully balanced to counter the others forcing you to work as a team if you want to win hence the team in team fortress there are nine classes each with their own traits that define them in the battlefield the offensive classes scout soldier pyro are the bulk of a team and can pack quite a punch while remaining moblie the defensive classes demoman heavy engineer protect the objective and whittle away at enemy health so that the supporting classes medic sniper spy can tip the scales and push back the other team ingame items are available however they do not detract from the core game or overpower certain characters you dont need to buy them but eventually youll want to most of the items serve as sidegrades giving up an aspect of the original weapon for enhanced capabilities in others this makes for exciting and dynamic gameplay as you never know what the enemy team might be using overall i would rate team fortress 2 a 910 its art and gameplay may not appeal to everyone but you should still try it tf2 has lots to offer in the way of laughs at a very convient price its free
recommended
team fortress 2 is a first person shooter made by valve you control one out of 9 different classes with many different modes which adds to the replayability unique to this game is the ability to find different drops which can vary from various weapons to the hats it is known for
recommended
lets talk a bit about tf2 i main medic and spy one is a crazy german doctor and one is a handsome rogue i go spy i diguise as a friendly pyro i scare everyone even though im a spy i run into the front lines as a medic everyone pays no mind because im a petty medic right i pin someone to a wall by their head using my cc i shove a colorful festive bonesaw inbetween their spinal cord they never suspected a thing and conga 1010 ign would rate 1010 again get this game now

recommended
one of the smartest fps games out there has a lot of potential to always be fresh with updates mvm is a brilliant gamemode as long as the support from valve is there this game can remain popular for a very long time
recommended
if you like stabbing people in the back collecting heads collecting hats conga lines blowing people up this outlandish fps game is for you collect craft and trade items to get the best loadout for each of the nine classes rocket or sticky jump your way out of danger place unstoppable sentrys freeze people solid much much more i rate this game ten out of 5 stars
recommended
great game but too many inapp purchases
recommended
quick summary the crown jewel of f2p games purchase verdict free but worth playing points of interest a better community than csgo but still can be toxic and full of immature trolls pay2hat this game as the name implies is based around teamwork to achieve specific goals this often requires players to have a basic concept of strategy but i hear competitive tf2 is where the hardcore strategic gameplay happens plenty of classes with various weapons to allow players to play with a specific gameplay style in mind
recommended
this is the best game ever d
recommended
awesome game best first person shooter ever really recommended to all those newbies out there
recommended
absolutely brilliant game its a must
recommended
this is a very fun sort of fast paced fps where you can live your dream of being and unethical doctor or a russian who fires a gun with $40000 dolars worth of bullets who liikes sandwhiches or even a generic baseball player from boston there is alot of fun to getting this game and since this game is free there is no reason to not get this game i reccomend it to any person who bothered to read this ramble all the way through

recommended
now i have to say tf2 one of the many games i cant possibly live without despite the fact before tf2 i spent my time playing on a mobile game that was based on tf2 blitz brigade feeling shocked that ive never actually heard of tf2 or even played it ive decided to look up some videos based on tf2 it was pretty amazing to see all the action im missing out of so ive finally decided to create a steam account and start playing tf2on a really crappy computer that runs it at literally 10 fps constant but that really didnt matter ive enjoyed tf2 very much that i didnt even realize the lag i was facing the first class i ever touched in tf2 was the one and only spy his personality and play style matched perfectly tricking opponents then 1 shotting them in the faceuh i mean back you know what i mean at the time i never knew how to trickstab so i got my a wrecked pretty damn hard so i stopped playing spy and moved on to the rocket jumping american man the soldier i spent quite alot time on soldier but i realized that i am ruling out one of my favorite classes the spy thats when i started to step up and patched that gap between me and the spy i spent hours practicing the trickstabs then the gun aim of spy learning as i advance in my tf2 life while at the same time trying to avoid getting my a whooped now here i am 200 hours on spy surpassing soldier as i progress forward i met many strangers that i would never knew would be my very best friends i would never thought this day would come but you just gotta keep trying because the only thing that will stop you from winning is you this is why i recommend this game to you disclaimers crits kicks major a unless its used against you getting trickstabbed yourself even though you already know how to trickstab autobalanced right when youre going to win hackers squeakers that dies a virgin using the mic
recommended

recommended
team fortress 2 tf2 is a diverse fun experience the different classes give you a choice when youre looking for something different its free to play but not pay to win in fact the microtransactions stay out of your way unless you want to pay the game drops items for you to customize the different classes with the developers dont take this seriously but thats a good thing it provides for an interesting experience that is different almost every time
recommended
team fortress 2 made by valve and published by valve praise lord gaben team fortress 2 is an onlinemultiplayer firstpersonshooter like youve never seen before oh well the game that got me into steam videogames and stopped me from studying for my exam i have played this game for almost 2200 hours and huge number you might think and also you might think was it worth it yes it was team fortress 2 offers you way more then just a great core gameplay and hats its probably the game on steam that gives its players the most freedom in creating stuff hats and weapons submitted to the workshop are added in new updates and you recive them for free this game already got 5 gamemode and the community created even more  deathrun freak fortress 2 prop hunt or jailbreak are just the famous ones but im serious when i say theres so many gamemodes to explore in this game you wont have the time to do so its gameplay is one of the best ones i could have ever imagined f%& you i got killed by that f2p pyro again besides the public valve servers there are the compeptive servers website like tf2centrecom should get you into the competitive side of team fortress 2 in no time balance theres 2 things tf2 masters like no other game does and one is the balance there is no weapon in the game that is overunderpowerd in any way every weapon has its place in the game you cant just go out with a weapon expecting it being better then your default gun read the stats teamplay 9 classes to choose from and in competitive you need to choose one teamplay is what makes team fortress special working together as a team is essential to win so if you see your team already has 3 snipers but no medic why not go medic this review took a look at a lot of tf2 in a tiny way i could say so much more after this game than this but i dont know what to say anymore after 8 years this game is still going strong with getting free updates constantly after i played it for 2200 hours and 3 years my mind is blown i hope you will have a great experience in tf2 just like me have fun and enjoy
recommended
this is the one of the bestintensefunnyaddictiive fps multiplayer game ive ever played
recommended
first of all i want to start out by saying that i am not the most experienced player but tf2 isnt a game where experience really matters i have around 1500 hours but i am a decent trader and have come pretty far into trading what i mainly want to review is the stuff i know about competitive and trading perhaps the most wellknown aspects of the game yet the most fluctuated in terms of rating or liking trading trading unless you are extremely experienced revolves around two things luck and patience although you do need some other skills price checking negotiation etc you hardly ever get good deals unless you are trading with some 10 yearold whose mother spent wellearned money on a virtual game sometimes i do get good deals good in tf2 trading terms means profit on some decently experienced players but it is rare for me competitive from the tf2 servers ive played on competitive can be good bad or of course just normal why because in one game you might be absolutely  the asses off the other team but then you have been switched to the other team due to autobalance another example one team might have a player wearing a burning tc yet the others are fresh out of installation roaming cluelessly around with their gibuses on well thats my review this was just all my opinion and i respect every one elses bye
recommended
ive enjoyed this game for years and thoroughly recommend it for those new to the fps genre its fun to play and very easy to get used to edit  tldr  used to love it now i play it occasionally for a bit of nostalgia im an old fart stuck in the past who dislikes change i reviewed this game back in 2012 and while i stand by the opinion that its a decent fps for people to get into and it has a relatively fair learning curve my love for this game has taken a nose dive over the past few years when i started playing this game it was back when you just had the stock weapons and the alternative unlocks ala backburner while i may be looking back with rose tinted goggles on i remember personally having much more fun when everyone was on more of an even keel with each other dont get me wrong i think the community involvement that steam pushed has really opened the game up and the game modes people have made such as zombie fortress prophunt etc are a wonderful example of what the gaming community is capable of the range of custom maps available is also eyewateringly vast another positive for the game i also still recommend this game because it is still very easy to jump into for anyone the fact that it is now free also helps that nothing is lost by giving it a go however i personally do not get as much enjoyment from this game as i used to and therefore play it a hell of a lot less ive racked up over a 1000 hours so ive definitely got my moneys worth and believe me back in its hay day it was well worth the cash monies spent on it i also find it hard to gripe about all the hats and killstreak  because ive seen how much my friends enjoy that aspect of the game the mann vs machine mode also improved my opinion on the game and it is usually what i play nowadays when i decide to load the thing up for old times sake as it stands now though its lost its magic for me
recommended
teamfortress 2 is about the most fun game ive played yet it comes in second after gmod
recommended
tf2 is probably one of the best games ever invented it combines your usual fps with cartoonish highly customisable characters each of the 9 classes are evenly balanced in such a way that no class is better or worse than another they all have pros and cons that cancel each other out along with weapons which have additional statistics to further add to that class abilities all in all its a fastpaced highly strategic fps that is continuously thouroughly enjoyable 10  10 d

best game ive ever played but valv is turning it into a congahat simulation with guns with these updates i love it
recommended
be careful the wild conga virus still lurks these parts of mann co 
recommended
perhaps the first fps game ive felt comfy playing in a really long time goofy and nonsensical is probably what sells this game the best and hats and taunts

thank you team fortress 2 for hundreds of hours of awesome thank you for the free random item drops thank you for the holiday events thank you for being free god bless

ive wasted many glorious hours playing this and i can say ive had one heck of a time in team fortress 2 youre essentially playing 9 different games at once with the radical gameplay differences each class has and on top of that the many gamemodes provides even more diverseity to how you play each class since their role changes depending on the gamemode it is an unorthodox and first person shooter that continues to break the mold of what a game in the genre can be and i would recommend it to anyone that essentially wants something that is completely different while still maintaining enough familiarity for those accustomed to the fps genre effective teamwork diversity balanced and fastpaced gameplay what more could you ask for in a funtoplay and freetoplay first person shooter like tf2 oh yeahhatsdont forget about hats
recommended
i mean its free what do you have to lose
recommended
team fortress 2 is a facinating fps that i would definitly recomend to practically anyone there are things you can do from trading to styling your favorite class with hats miscs etc this game is an amazing game but even better its free although this game can be tough i dont see why you shouldnt get it like i said i enjoy this game and recomend it to anyone that is intrested in getting it
recommended
great fps f2p mmo game

erm well do you have billions of dollars no run run fast the hats will catch you ita too late for m

hilarious fps that has valve written all over it if youve played games by valve before you know each of there games has an almost unexplanible comedic charm and tf2 is no different the graphics arent the best but thats part of what makes the game funny and what makes it greatanother awesome valve game
recommended
omg the best game ive played in 13 years btw im 13 years old

it is a very good game when you get some weapons that you are better at at first it may seem that everyone is better than you because they have better weapons strangesmiscs and the most popular unusual hats this can change when you play it for a while don`t end up like me playing over 128 hours in 2 months and you get good weapons and then you get to purchace items it`s a game of cometition but there can never be a best player overall i am addicted to this game i love it
recommended

many years ago some men were concerned about our safety and so they tried to teach us a dance and assured us we could leave our friends behind unfortunately the message was lost for one simple horrible reason they had no hats fast forward to the 21st century and those who longed for safety and danced remained hatless with the exception of prince who had a thing for certain berets then came tf2 which restored hats and dancing to the world unfortunately it might have forgotten the safety part the impetus for this culture shift that is team fortress 2 was found in the cryptic writings of a large cat with a hearing impairment in ages past buried among those ancient words was no serenade no fire brigade just pyromania so it was clear that people should not sing but rather attack each other with flamethrowers and play air guitar with weapons it made perfect sense meanwhile while listening to the radio mann co came to remember that they built this city and when it was finished the engineers grew restless and bored and began to struggle with the pyromaniacs as the arms race escalated people had to come to terms that in fact this minigunwielding man he was not their brother and that he was in fact heavy because of these events a group of private eyes were hired they were watching and saw every move they assured the world im a spy but im on your side when they cried out hit me with your best shot fire away in mockery they were suprised to find sharpshooters from australia eager to take them up on the offer the military was called in to attempt a peaceful resolution the soldiers called out come off your battlefield lay down your arms and surrender but the combatants saw their rocket launchers were loaded and aimed and attacked interestly some talent scouts for major league baseball were on hand and mistook the melee for a sporting event eagerly one of the scouts shouted put me in coach im ready to play only to be hit in the head with a frying pan so he called out to the nearest medic doctor mr md wont you tell me whats ailing me and he said yeah before a spy snuck up on him stabbing him in the back and the doctor swore eternal revenge by then it was clear something needed to be done so scientists in a remote location in scotland prepared a weapon against this madness they spliced the genes of syvester stallone and wesley snipes together to create a new superhero his name was the demolition man but this was only a prototype the demolition man demo and taco bell wasnt sure about the sponsorship but then there were the hats and people stopped fighting amongst themselves to trade these many hats that they wore just kidding they kept killing each other endlessly but then they questioned the conflict and it became mann vs machine for a time the world is a safer place we can go where we want to a place that they will never find we could even act like were from out of this world and leave the real one far behind because of the wonderful hats which have brought world peace although it looks an awful lot like war

recommended
1010 very good multiplayer and a must have for valve lovers
recommended
its one of those innovative games that promotes different gameplay if you are a cod or battlefield player then try this game but memorise all weapon stats first because this game has no assault rifles and snipers does not one hit kill not unless its a headshot although this game is pretty cool it kept me covered when im bored for 2 years and on going and its really fun its free so yeah that is self explanatory
recommended
its the best game ever

my friend taught how to play tf2 because she was always talking about it and i dicided to play just to see but now i play every day and i recommend
recommended
if you like shooting hats or trading this is the game to play
recommended
this game is its its too great to be described with mere adjectives this game is absolutely with out a doubt one of the best games out there it was indeed worth the weight its art style is amazing because it is so unique and different from anything ive ever seen this goes for both the characters items and enviorment i find the games visual appearence breathtaking for the small amount of soundtracks this game consists of they are amazing this game is great because it seemingly never gets old with dozens of different gamemodes exciting new content updates and its annual scream fortress smissmas and other events yet the best thing about the game at least to me it is is the nine classes that the game consists of each class is full of personality and dialogue whether its insulting taunts or hillarious cathphrases all of the classes are very different from each other with weapons dialogue attitude style and the way you play as them first off you have your offensive category consisting of the scout soldier and pyro the scout is a fast smartmouthed all bark and no bite kind of kid with weapons that are most effective at close range requiring a hitandrun sort of tactic the soldier is a dedicated american with a strong passion to fight possessing a rocket launcher as his primary weapon the soldier is a powerful threat to his opponents but all that power leaves him with a slow speed requiring him to use a maneuver known as the rocket jump to travel faster in exchange for some health the pyro is a mumbling lunatic whose history is a mystery to just about everyone he or possibly she wields a flamethrower as hisher main weapon which makes himher lack a lot of range but gives a lot of potential power if used correctly heshe is best used for ambushing enemies and hisher compresion blast airblast can be used to reflect many projectiles back at opponents next is the deffensive category the demoman heavy and engineer the demoman is a oneeyed drunk scottish man who has no bulletbased weapons and fights instead with 2 explosive weapons he can take out enemies that he cant see with his grenade launcher or lay traps with his sticky launcher the heavy is a large strong russian beast that uses his beloved minigun his immense power and large size leaves him with a very slow speed but with very strong fire power he may be considered an easy target due to his size but as long as he has his minigun he should be treated as a threat just like all the other classes the engineer is a intelligent texan that relies mainly on his buildings to fight his sentry gun is generally a threat to any enemy within its range he can build a dispenser to heal him and his teammates as well as refill there ammo and he can also build teleporters so his team can access areas faster the last category is the supportive classes consisting of the medic sniper and spy the medic is a german doctor with amazing medical technology at his disposal he is not one known for attacking but instead he is known for healing using his medigun he can quickly heal his teammates once charged enough he can deploy what is known as an ubercharge making him and whoever he is healing temporarily invincible to any damage from enemy weapons the sniper is an austrailian outdoorsman who as his name suggests uses a sniper rifle as his main weapon he can do extreme ammounts of damage at long range making him a valueble teammate when used correctly at short range though he is more vulnerable and can easily be overwhelmed by enemies lastly we have the spy a french trickster who can disguise himself as his opponents and quietly sneak behind enemy lines he can perform a backstab resulting in an instant kill use his sapper to destroy enemy buildings such as sentries and use his cloaking device to become temporarily invisible to sneak around danger playing as a spy requires stealth and smarts to succeed the best thing about all these characters is the fact that other than the heavy being the games main icon none of the classes seem to be better than the rest they all have their own special weaknesses and none of them are generally favored over the others the game is a masterpiece and thats all i can say
recommended
i love this game to much to not set it down lol
recommended
best game ever made that i had ever played
recommended
one of the best hat sims of this age the objective minigames are also pretty good
recommended
one of the most hillarious fps game
recommended
its alright it should be the first free game for everyone but it could be heavily improved if they had better game modes more realistic weapons such as machine gun and if nothing costed money ingame it would be a big no if this game wasnt free otherwise you would pay for the game then spend $100 ingame
recommended

highly competitive shooter for tryhards make no mistake on that valve markets it as something else but it doesnt change what it is its not easy to pick up if youre new to quakelike shooters youd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you or you might get frustrated by some things public pvp and pve known as mvm in tf2 servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned if you dont want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though well balanced competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test despite valve overlooking the competitive format multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level if you want to do team based esports look no further than tf2 this game has more competitive spirit in it than lol and dota combined as for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age thanks to its stylised look some items from content updates are very much out of the games theme though which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is the game is poorly optimised in some instances too especially mvm but that can be solved by fps boosting configs all in all iz good
recommended
den outa den is what i would say but i just did anyway tf2 is a good game aside with being a ghost trap only with my money it is fun if you want to download let me give you a tip dont wear the ghastly gibus if someone sees you with that they will make fun of you it happened to me and i dont want it happening to you anyway get it
recommended

its a fun game for people that dont want to spend money on gemes
recommended
if you dont have this game than why are you even on steam best multiplayer game ever that gets the term team right\ 1010

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here
recommended
oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

tf2 is a game that i on multiple accounts have accumulated about 3000 hours on i love it to death im even happier that it is still well populated and regulated if you are looking to buy tf2 here are a few things you might want to know pros skillbased yet accessible gameplay tf2 is a perfect mix of difficulty with each class giving a different level of skill with some very basic twitch skills you can do quite well at the same time with practice you can become a god of the field dominating enemies with a long range rocket hitting them in the air gameplay suited to you different classes and weapons offer you any placestyle suited to you balanced gameplay all of the weapons classes and mechanics of tf2 feel welltested for balance there are few items that are unbalanced and none that are gamebreaking teambased gameplay as the name implies a good team is needed to win you will get moreorless randomly paired with a team you dont necessarily have to be good you just have to contribute f2p in the best sense you do not need to buy anything to be good or have fun in tf2 while you cannot trade or find hats as a f2p those are very little things that do not affect most gameplay plenty of gamemodes and maps team fortress 2 keeps the gameplay fresh with plenty of new maps and old and many gamemodes constantly updated valve still updates tf2 and even when major updates are scarce they still care for the game the community is very much alive as well cons bad community there are many good people who play tf2 but there are an equal number of bad who play it too nothing can take the fun out of a game of tf2 more than some embittered teammate complaining about how bad you are doing there are all manner of villainy i love that word in the game scammers who dedicate their existence to getting virtual items with no effect on gameplay annoying players who keybind after every kill little children who think theyre in charge those are more cute than annoying and elitist players who will scorn you for every failure the last is perhaps the most irritating there is many a player who at the first sight of you being new or bad will not hesitate to call you a noob or otherwise call you out there are also many who judge your skill based on your number of hats i recall on one occasion a behatted p2p getting dominated by a f2p who was better than him and remarking that the f2p was lucky and was a noob it was deplorable i advise going into the game with a thick skin all in all i give tf2 a 8510 the game is the bestmade i have ever played and although the community can be a bother the game itself is remarkably solid also if you dont like itwell its free seriously go download it right now right now
recommended
ing  i hate this game i hate it so much i play it all day out of spite

team fortress 2 is an fps game with a singleplayer and multiplayer servers i think that this game is awesome but they need to upgrade the weaponitem drop system it needs to give new players a few more items than people who have been playing the game more often the textures are somewhat realistic with a sort of cartoony feel to them the player models are good but could use a little more detail even if its a cartoony game basic plot mann co a company run by the tough saxton hale who had 3 sons red blu and grey red and blu exiled grey and fought with eachother like maniacs grey came back with replicas of red and blus armies robots classes scout soldier pyro demo heavy engineer medic sniper and spy

probably one of the best online multiplayer shooters to exist team fortress 2 provides a lot of fun with different classes customizable loadouts and of course hats the player can choose from 9 different classes each with different advantages and tactics the nine classes are divided into three categories offense defense and support offensive classes would be the scout a faster class that uses a scattergun a secondary pistol and a bat for melee this class has less health but can easily avoid enemy fire and capture enemy control points twice as fast as any other class the soldier a slower offensive class that carries a rocket launcher a shotgun and a shovel soldiers can be used to take care of buildings like sentry guns and teleporters made by the engineer or if youre skilled enough you could rocket jump by simply pointing the rocket launcher down at the ground below you before jumping and shooting the rocket will explode on impact of the ground launching you high above the ground and give you the ability to quickly fly into enemy grounds the pyro pretty selfexplainatory the pyro uses a flamethrower to set enemies well on fire giving additional damage even if the enemy flees unless said enemy flees into water other weapons include another shotgun and a fire axe pyros can also shoot strong air out of the flamethrowers muzzle which gives it the ability to air blast rockets back at enemy soldiers or grenades back at an enemy demoman for the defense category we have the demoman a class known to maining on explosives and to drink the demoman wields a grenade launcher a stickybomb launcher and a glass bottle stickybombs are pretty self explainatory bombs that can stick to any surface these bombs can be used strategically to blow up the enemy when they least expect it for example planting the stickybombs on a control point stickybombs can also be used to launch the demoman high in the air similar to rocket jumping the heavy a slow but effectively defensive class who wields a minigun as a primary weapon shotgun for secondary and uses his own bare fists for melee heavys can easily defeat any enemy in close quarters but skilled players can easily turn the tables if paired with a medic the heavy could be difficult to take care of having a medic paired with a heavy can make for a very effective defense as long as the medic stays safe the engineer a class thats not as focused on charging into battle but more on staying back and building different machines to help the team succeed the machines vary from sentry guns health and ammo dispensers and teleporters the engineer also has the ability to upgrade any building using metal a secondary ammunition that engineers collect from parts of destroyed buildings and dropped weapons from defeated enemies and allies alike and for the support category there is the medic medics have the ability to heal injured allies using a medi gun of course medics are also armed with a syringe gun and a bonesaw for close combat as the medic heals an ally he builds up an ubercharge which when fully charged can shield the medic and any ally hes currently healing from any enemy fire for a limited time medics can be very effective when paired with the defensive heavy so as long as the medic stays away from enemy fire and keeps safe the medic also has the ability to heal over time but only by a small amount per second the sniper selfexplainatory the sniper can be used to hide back unseen and snipe incoming enemies with the sniper rifle this class is also equipped with an smg and a kukri knife for close encounters with the enemy when you stay zoomed in on the scope a small meter is filled on the side of the screen leading to a lightning bolt when this meter is filled the rifle can fire a charged shot that can take most classes out even if its not a headshot and the spy a unique class that can be used to disguise as an enemy class using a disguise kit the spy can sneak over to enemy territory and use his knife to backstab an enemy instantly killing them no matter how much health they have spies are also wielding a revolver and a sapper sappers can be used to disable and destroy buildings from the engineer class spies can then sneak behind an engineer focused on the sapper and backstab them but attacking while disguised risks being caught as a spys disguise instantly goes away when attacking spies can also cloak to appear invisible using their watch but such power is limited and goes away if used for too long forcing the spy to stay visible until its fully charged spies cannot attack while invisible nor can they capture control points cloaked or disguised team fortress 2 also features a completely customizable set of loadouts for your classes you may recieve different weapons for different strategies such as giving the demoman the ability to charge and bash into enemies with the chargin targe or the player can give the heavy to heal quickly with the popular sandvich players may also recieve accessories and of course hats players can also paint certain accessories any color they wish if they ever get the right bucket there are also decal tools name tags and description tags decal tools allow the player to put custom images on certain weapons and accessories as the name and description tags allow the player to change the name and description of the item to anything they wish players may purchase or trade mann co supply crate keys which they can use to unlock and open mann co supply crates which are randomly found ingame doing so will grant the player special items like more accessories or weapons most common from crates are the strange quality weapons these special weapons can track the total amount of kills the player makes with that specific weapon increasing the total kills by certain amounts can rank up the weapon giving it a special name for others to see ie truly feared minigun team fortress 2 gives an unforgettable multiplayer experience its cartoony graphics remarkable voice acting and its unique classes and characters makes team fortress 2 a musthave for gamers everywhere and best of all its free players can also communicate over mic spray custom images on the wall and chat in the servers chatbox but its strongly recommended to not do so these days given the community also as a warning to new players dont enter unbindall in the console commands 
recommended

only played a few hours but its great fun  never been irritated by the game at all as long as you can run it smoothly this game is a breeze the different classes are so much fun to play and easy to learn if youre willing to put your mind to them trading is still a thing but as always be careful with the waves of scammers buzzing around your high value items if you have any of the sort have fun with this game ps its f2p  robbie

a game where you can have some fun with your friends and play around on casual servers or you can get into competitive tf2 and practice all day at the game to become good to finally create a team of friends or new people to get to know and play with the game itself is full of content such as many fun playmodes hats and miscs weapons and taunts such as squaredance yes you can dance in this game there are 9 classes and everyone is special from one another and every single one of the classes takes time to learn and get good at teamfortress 2 is a game for the casual player but also for the competitive player
recommended
this game is really easy to get into but if your a regular cod player this isnt a game for you in adition the free to play element is broken when you have to buy a key to open a box that has a 1% chance of giving you a hat that has either our planets orbiting it or its on fire 1010 in adition my wallet feals violated

team fortress 2 is a exellent starter game for those new to steam
recommended
this game made me feel like a part of me died but then another part had just been born
recommended
well i can recommend it i for a while did not like it it is very well executed the classes are balanced surpisingly compared to the typical freeium fps this game i can not consider a sequel to team fortress classic due to a huge change but entirely different game all together looks nice very interesting concept throws a couple refrences from allidin spectifically  your enternal reward  this is like the big budget game of valve essentially but there is a huge flaw some of the level designs are mazes being serious this is like a paid game without paying but you will have to get used to the classes and such always aim at the head
recommended
1010 its so ing awsome it gets you more hype than cocaine

the well known and appreciated war themed hat simulator aka team fortress 2 fantastic game with truly awesome gameplay that does not focus on being realistic just fun unlike many other multiplayer shooters this one requires a lot of teamwork hence the title which can be either rarther frustrating or just plain fantastic the feeling of when you and your team smashes through the enemy defenses and when you help each other out defeating the enemy is something to experience you wont find this anytime soon in cod kids but of course there are also some bad sides to the fact that teamwork is such a key element often it is seen that a lot of new players decide to go the class that they like this is problematic since a full 10man team of snipers simply will have a lot more trouble taking down a sentry nest than a single demoman and medic morale is that you have to balance the classes so you have enough of everything there are a lot of unlockable weapons in the game but you dont get them by 360ing 30 people in a row its random drops and to some extent achievement milestones but not that much really most weapons are simply sidegrades so there arent many weapons that are just better pretty much everything is balanced as a final note there are cosmetics in this game yey these doesnt change anything particular important even though people love em just collect them as an extra minigame it is not what the entirety is about  the game is free so yeah go have yourself a good time
recommended
the best online game ive ever played
recommended
gg wp 1010 like skyrim with hats would play again

before playing team fortress 2 i wouldve said to hell with firstperson shooters with so many of them being carbon copies of each other with the same old gritty realstic style its easy to lose faith in there being originality in the genre team fortress 2 is a fine example of everything having an exception its always the perfect solution for when im having a crappy day or im bored except for when its not but it often is moreso than almost any other game its incredibly fun and designed to be the kind of game you pour hundreds of hours into which is very easy to do its free and its fun theres no damn excuse to not play it give it a try youll probably surprise yourself with how enjoyable it is even if the ordinary gameplay style isnt your thing theres many other types of servers and play styles to always offer something exciting even when im getting my  kicked on this game i tend to be having fun and laughing its easy to get into and easy to get addicted to as well if youre wondering there is a catch to it being free to play which is that theres also a premium version but to get that version you just need to purchase any ingame item which can be for as little as 60 pence or something like that plus it is possible to play for as long as you like with the free version if youre satisfied with that the main motivation to get premium is the space in your inventory is quite limited in the free version and after a few hundred hours  playing you might start to feel like youre running out of space assuming you like to keep anything interesting you get as far as catches go id say thats pretty fair certainly gives you a loooong time to decide whether this game is worth putting your money towards a potentially very small amount of money i might add getting premium allows you to get rarer drops such as hats and be able to trade items with other players freely allowing you to get your hands on all sorts of cool stuff youll probably only want to get it if youve got really into the game and want to experience it in full and have been playing long enough for the inventory space to become an issue so dont feel this is a game where you feel incredibly stunted by your freetoplay status in conclusion this game is supersuper fun few other games have the potential to have so many hundreds of hours poured into them and remain enjoyable give it a try youll probably be very glad you did although having said all that it does have autobalance the worst feature to be included in any game ever nothing like getting put on the team youve been working against all this time the moment you die after having called vote after vote to prevent such a fate but everybody adores a gamebreaking flaw too much for there to be enough yes votes if you end up the very opposite to glad that you gave this a game a try after all finding yourself on the verge of suicide over how something as evil as autobalance can exist in this world im very sorry truly who could have expected that in a teambased game anyone could think itd be a good idea to have a feature that targets you the exact second you die no matter how long you had been alive beforehand and forces you to turn against your own team a feature that in an instant turns a highly enjoyable round into an extremely irritating one a feature that despite having been criticised for years still hasnt been reworked all weve got is a vote feature that people are too stupid to vote yes for

if you enjoy blowing people up setting them on fire or beating them to a pulp then this the game for you

help how does this game work
recommended
in case you cant tell i love this game just look at how many hours i have on it it is hands down the best multiplayer fps out there also its free to play and free things are awesome you do need to buy at least one item from the ingame store to get a premieum but the cheapest item is currently $010 so its not that big a deal now onto the gameplay this game appeals to all people who like fps games wanna snipe go sniper wanna be a healer go medic wanna be an indestructable tank in the battlefield go heavy the list goes on and on its wonderfully balanced except for the gunslinger also the hats are pretty neat

i dont have a life anymore nice game

you would be crazy not to play team fortress 2
recommended
tf2 has got to be one of the most fun and hilarious free to play games out there it is so awesome and easly one of my fav games to play
recommended
fortress of teams twice is a game that makes me more concerned about virtual hats then real life events i think this makes it worthy enough to be in anybodys steam library
recommended
team fortress is one of the best game i have ever played it has good graphics items look amazing ang just over all just really fun
recommended
rip bonus ducks

so this isnt my first review but i guess i need to do it again since the first one was on 40 hours of playing so after a year i get to know 5 things about this game 1 its awesome the tons of nice people almost every friend i have is from tf2 i can make some mentions like the best player in my list is a nice guy with true heart and soemone that helped me when i was about to kill myself due to a break up with anyway other guys like a teacher from a rocket jump server that now is one of my best friends an asian guy that well is asian and a german guy with a profile pic of a girl xd you can get to know ive been playing in almost every kind of server from a normal valve control points server to a death run server hosted by nice admins also you can get to some weird servers that are full of bots or idle people but well thats something that happens sometimes 2 hats 3 the community is half good and half bad i mean you get to know nice players and some funny servers to just have fun and other servers to completely destroy the enemy team but since mannconomy update now there is another market for all the things you can have and get but you need items to do it like keys and  and they have prices and a lot of more things that i dont want to get into it i mean yeah i used the market tf2outpost and tradetf but i dont care about prices or those things if i want a thing i get the thing no matters what is the price for it so i just skip this part but if you wanna get into it you will need to use backpacktf 4 last thing this game saved my life with the friends i got from it i must say thank you for it if you have a history just ing add me and hang me with me for a while maybe i can even be your new friend  5 hats
recommended
after playing this game for nearly 3 years i still love going on it every single day this is by far the best game out their and since its free to play youre out of excuses to not try it
recommended
one of the best free to play game with good graphics and all in it is fantastic
recommended
when team fortress 2 was released in 2007 it was the result of nine years of development its now seven years later and development hasnt actually stopped a wealth of gamemodes weapons and gameplay adjustments later team fortress 2 is less intricately wellbalanced but is still as exciting and funny as it ever was going freetoplay was also a smart decision i feel as the expanded playerbase means youll never go without a match absolutely recommended
recommended
i have stopped playing this game half year ago but i still respect this game alot overall rating 910 good things amazing community maps are ballanced classes are ballanced music d so many different weapon choices gibus bad things trading yep economy updates hats hats hats and hats
recommended
1010 there are hats in this game
recommended
a great game but the only defection is that it tends to lag and sometimes a lot
recommended
team fortress 2 what can one say about this game that hasnt been said already its a rather unique game in many ways how many games have had an entire economy based on hats appear in them thanks to their community how many games can have an extremely skilled player fragged by another less skilled yet adecuately equiped player how many games have a metric ton of hats that vary from plain and boring to silly and pure awesome lets not forget that this is a classbased fps in which every single class has its weaknesses and strengths twards other classes as the game gets updated more weapons are added all of which swap around the classes youre good and bad against with only a few minor exceptions there are no weapons ingame that are a straight upgrade to the default weapons all are sidegrades the best weapon in the game is the one that fits your style best the one you feel most comfortable using there are many ways to play team fortress 2 you can play on official servers which are all good play an objective against other players or play a 6 player coop mode against vast waves of ai controlled characters or you could play on community servers where just about anything can happen there are servers dedicated to trading to snipers to all versus one battles achievement servers and a large amount of modded gameplay servers play how you like its free and its good

the only game where team stacking is seen as a valid strategy if not the most valid strategy in video games since 1911 despite the incessant team stacking that would almost convince you to support ea if not for those steam sales tf2 still somehow remains fun to enjoy to this very day

team fortress 2 is a fastpaced gamefrom characters as fast as scout to characters as slow as heavyalthough some people might arguei personally feel that scout is not the fastest as a soldierrocket jumping proves to be a good mean of reaching to the front linea great item to have as a soldier when rocket jumping is the gunboatsthe gunboats is a pair of amazing itemit provides lots of mobilitynext were going to look at the classes 1 scoutfastgood mean of damage with the scattergunflying guillotinesandman can take down a heavy fast 2soldierslow at movingfast at rocket jumpinghighest mean of damage with stock rocket launchergunboats for mobility and market gardenerescape plan 3pyronormal speedreflecting rockets is the way to play pyro properly i feel and using the flare and axtinguisher gives you lots of damage output 4demomanslower by normal speed by a bitpipes and stickybomb launcher is a really good mean of taking down sentry nestsyou can have lots of fun by being a troll demoman by having the bootstide turner or sticky jumperdepending of map and the ullapool caberthe fun factor is high 5heavyslowest classgood mean of damage and very effective at attacking sentries 6engineernormal speedwidowmaker teaches you how to aim your shotgun as missing takes out your ammopistol for secondary as its your seond long range weapongunslinger as its annoying and fun to use 7 medicfaster than normal by a bitblutsaugerkritzkrieg for the healing taunt and uber saw to build uber for team 8snipernormal speedchallenging but funsniper is an effective class to deal with heavies 9spynormal speedlast but not leastwe have the spyan effective class against sentry nestsheavies and medicsthe spy is a very sly classable to take out sentry nests with the sappertaking out heavy and medic combos is a huge up side overall tf2 is a fun game to play

ive played this game for quite some time and had much fun in this game it is quite original and a unique gem in the line of video games out there for instance i was walking around in dustbowl and encountered an enemy pyro then astonishingly he croutched down pulled out an axe and called me a spy in friendliness i did the same except with a shovel being a new tf2 player and never seeing this behavior before i scrounged the voice command list for spy upon completing my feat of seeking the correct word we walked toward eachother slowly legs crouched and stared at eachother spamming spy we did this for a few moments until one of my team mates soldier came waddling himself down towards me and the pyro he stared at us both in confusion the little ghost dangling off his gibus in the fresh dusty air and shot a rocket at the pyro sending his body flying many yards away upon seeing my first tf2 ragdoll i burst into tears crying with laughter as the pyros body fell through the air and made the squish splat noise such a sight is unheard of in any other game and is quite common in this game i am not a tf2 fanboy as i have grown up playing games like the halo series my whole life since before i was 5 and playing cod for a few years i can easily say halo is a very fun game but that is another story you will never find another experience like the ones you find in tf2 nearly all the time every day there is much laughter to have and enjoy in this game 1010 is gud stuff heavy

recommended
best pc game ever tf2 is probably the best multiplayer game of the century valve games are the best
recommended
this game is addictive this game made me a premium and nonlimited acc on steam by trading started from gifted crates to keys
recommended
i started playing this game in the spring of what 2007 thats the year after it came out right the grand old days i remember when spies couldnt take teleporters because the glow would persist even when you were cloaked or disguised and the only way to refill the invisibility watch was to stand in a corner and hope desperately that nobody was going to turn around i remember when pyros had no airblast and engies couldnt move their buildings or upgrade anything but sentries to level 3 ahh yes that was a simpler time a time before demoknights and minisentries a time before crates and item drops a time by gum before hats a time when spies had their mouths crammed full of cigarettes when wielding the ubersaw was a mark of excellence when spytech provided equipment instead of mann co and nobody had heard of australium those were the good old days the golden years of tf2 you know what the games improved a lot since then go play it i still do
recommended
i like this game im 5 years playing this game
recommended
this its the funiest game i ever played
recommended
f2 this is nearly the ultimate freetoplay game on steam second only to dota 2 in the number of users playing daily why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam
recommended

team fortress 2 arguably the most popular fps on the pc this game is insanely fun even after so many years of playing every class is still working as they should well except the demoman but lets face it valve made every single one of his unlocks make you play him differently the addition of the steam workshop compatibility makes all new possibilities come up so even 5 years after its initial release team fortress 2 is a must have fun game and since its free now theres no excuse
recommended
you will play this religiously and at time will make friends my guideline dont be generous  everyone around you and strive to the top and most importantly no matter how many people you have to backstab your unusual is worth it
recommended
this is the best free to play first person shooter i highly reccomend this game
recommended
i love it very much 
recommended
if you like a fps that you can explode burn chop off heads or just fill some random body with bullets in a comical universe team fortress ii is a must play if bored you just sit open this game and stay minutes or even hours and hours playing this
recommended
there are good moments and bad moments in this game killing someone and making them rage is a good moment getting killed by someone and raging is a bad moment also watch your wallet gaben is hungry
recommended
this game is so much fun and is really addicting try it out its probably the most fun you can have on steam
recommended
id give the keys to my house for some keys to a box
recommended
fun in doses but not for everyone it can suck your finances a bit dry if you get too into it so beware
recommended
your saying hats dont make you better words of a wise mann
recommended
its fun i like collecting guns and i like the commuuntiy its polite and not dirty
recommended
this game is really fun i dont have lots of stuff and the trade is broke but other than that i can quickly join into my friends game without trouble just a great game all together
recommended
my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 2 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun
recommended
without a doubt the best online game avalible right now for many different reasons 1 it is updated all the time and the updates are usually big ones 2 the amount of weapons hats etc that are avalible in the system 3 the size of the community 4 the game never gets repetitive 5 the gameplay is great for all skill levels 6 its free so why not those are just some of the reasons that this is the best multiplayer game out right now and i bet you that you would find a whole lot more yourself so download this free game that will bring hundreds of hours of fun

this is very good i have over 500 hours of gameplay on this on alot of different accounts if you dont like blowing people up with a rocket launcher or shooting exploding enemies with a grenade launcher then you can try to run around like crazy and shoot enemies heads off with a scatter gun if you are just like you wanna camp you can try headshotting enemies with the sniper or just be the engineer who can build machines like a sentry that aims automatticly or shoot them build dispensers so you you can heal your teammates or build teleporters to get your teammates up to the line quickly

this is the best ftp game i have ever played there is so much to do no need to buy anything with real money if you dont want to everything can be crafted all 9 classes are awesome i never feel that one of them is too op because you can always counter them once you mastered one class there is always more if you master scout you can then start to master some else class or just dont master anything and still have a good time wiht this game pvp mode works like it should nothing special just 7 differend game modes and some beta gamemodes lots of maps and everyone is fun to play there is also an pve mode called mvm its supper fun with firends and some of them are hard to top it off i like this game

teamfortress 2how am i supposed to say itoh i knowits the best fps everwelltf2 is a really nice and popular game which will blow your mindyou have 9 different choices of weird charactersfrom the fast scout to the giant heavy weapons guymy personal favorite gameand since its freeyou can have one of the best fps you can play for freetf2 is also a game that will let you make your own server in which you will be capable to do anything you wanti highly recommend tf2 to those whowant to play a game which will make them laugh and will have enjoyable combat at the same timealso if you are good a programming and you want a game which will allow your ideas to leave your mind and join the internethere it is
recommended
this is a pretty good game its free if it lags dont blame the game blame ur laptop doesnt have enough memory
recommended
a great team based f2p fps with a breathing economy based off of virtual hats
recommended
this is a great hat simulator with billions of hats to choose from u will never run out of possibilitys having nine dress up dolls and so many combinations this will make u feel like ur actually wearing these hats theres also a shooting mini game but its very small and has barley any effort in it
recommended
the best multiplayer out there since 2007 and now thats its freewell you cant miss it buddy 910 solid for me
recommended
this game is an amazing fps with taunts and really cool maps
recommended
though tf2 has fame beyond many shooters i still would give it a little praise here in this little review now you have to know that i am not a first person shooter type of gamer outside of tf2 my only other experiences are wolfenstein 3d and unreal tournament which i never even played multiplayer however tf2 has become my most played game ever eating over 3000 hrs of my life it may be a bit on the downhill for me now but it was a solid pick during my phd the games cartoonesque style and class based system make it so that even nonveterans can jump in and have enjoyment i even managed to climb up the ranks a bit in competitive what if you dont like to fight other people and just want to have some fun with friends jump into the game mode man vs machine to have a unique tower defense  like game in short it has many different skill level and playstyle type of game modes to entertain a wide variety of players besides it is free to play and if you do not pay you get nearly the full game what you get extra if you pay  even just a nickel is enough to get upgraded to premium status  are nice extras like trading this is not necessary to play however and rarely are the first weapons you receive or stock weapons downright outclassed by others  others weapons tend to have their own niches furthermore the community in general is friendly so why dont you give it a try
recommended
1010 would play
recommended
most addicting game i have ever played
recommended
grass grows birds fly sun shines and brother i will dominate you and i aint even wearing a hat tf2 is an awesome game why hats weapons and misc items that make a call of duty fps look stale the gameplay is different then call of duty and will take time to get used to but man i have never seen a black scottishs cyclops flying through the air like a bird or a sentry that can not be destroyed a man who is your worst nightmare who cant be detected by your team and a sniper who will one hit kill you if your not lucky i like it atleast i aint being kicked off a server for being new to a game i bought with my money who the hell cares if its cartoony or has a stupid concept its pure stupid genius its origns story is funny as can be and who cant resist blasting them robots away with and uber charge 910 because its training program is too short for new players who deserve to know how to play all classes not four and there are scamers out there so remember its steamcommunity not staemcommuity or anything like that so i wish you good luck and keep an eye out for spys engies scouts snipers medics heavys pyros soldiers demos and spys haaaaavvve fun
recommended
used to play this a lot back in the day recently played it again its good to see that all the new aesthetics havent ruined the orginal art style in any considerable way its actually very tasteful in a quorn kind of way churchill asked me to play this again and i was all like  no that ing game is ing insulting to the  senses ing community content id ing rather pay actual ing concept artists so that  would look good that was of course when i used to drink but ive cut back now poor bevan he will never be not welsh again
recommended
a free to play game that isnt pay to win team fortress 2 gives you 9 classes scout runs very fast double jumps mainly uses shotguns solider slower uses rocket launchers to fight and to get around pyro class with barely any range but deadly up close using flame throwers and such demoman uses explosive launchers and can be made into a demoknight heavy very slow but quite strong engineer weak alone but can build helpful things like sentries and teleporters medic challenging to use in combat at first but also heals teammates sniper this one is pretty obvious spy disguise as enemies go invisible stab people in the back and sneak away all are diverse and helpful to have a combination of on a team each class starts with default weapons and items but over time you may find things throughout your endevors or maybe if you have the time and items craft things you could also go off and buy items none of which make you stronger or even trade with other people the gameplay is fun and takes some skill that you will develop quickly with some time put into the game the community is very active in trade and marketing this is one of the least money grubbing f2ps because of the fact that weapons you buy are balanced and not op meaning a f2p and premium player both can be slaughtered by eachother just as easy the other items are things like cosmetics hats accessories and keys to open random crates you may find that provide you with random weapons and cosmetics all updates are free and you can get every bit out of this game without spending money not to mention valve puts alot of time into sending out updates for new items maps etc all these updates free so what more can i say great game good company active community not pay to win its free so go ahead and try it
recommended
like skyrim with hats
recommended
wow this game impressed as soon as i hit play it has timeless cartoonish graphics that fall right in the boundary line between too animated and too realistic it has a wide variety of characters and a lot of items to find so there will always be a reason to keep playing most of the characters are easy to play but hard to master so it wont be too difficult to switch characters and play as that one i reccomend this game to anyone 10 and up you can turn of the blood and as long as a kid understands that its not ok to do any of this in real life and to keep a positive attitude heshe should be find see you in pyroland
recommended
hdfbgiuaysgfiaysfhgusaiirgby ok thats good

very fun game i enjoy this game and it is pretty cool yeah
recommended
its definitely a fun game thats worth playing for longer than a day its freetoplay so theres no real downside to trying it out im surprised at how well it plays on my pc and my pc is pretty crappy it runs google slower than tf2 which is pretty sad actually just shoot anything that moves and you should be fine also dont eat the bread

recommended
this first person shooter is unique to all others it has a cartoony look and feel which is the core to how this game works the weapon designs are all unique and humorous and the maps are excellent to play in
recommended
just doing this for badge its good
recommended
this game is amazing it is the best fps that i have played in all my gaming years 5 stars  this game is for those fps players who just want some hilarious gameplay this game has many easter eggs and has may in game rewards you should all go out and play this funny and wierd game full of crap from another universe
recommended
a unique fps game that i actually enjoy playing the classes are very different the game is balanced getting updated often and has a great art style and humor
recommended
my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3
recommended
can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here
recommended
oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

pro  wellbalanced classes and maps  team dynamic can yield immensely satisfying moments  appealing visual aesthetic  extremely facilitated gameplay and hud system  newbie friendly  funny and humourous elements are added in the game  very stable and only presents a few minor glitches  high detailed world and models  reward system is present to evaluate the progress  looks and plays great  500 achievements  valve anticheat  free to play  items trade contra  heavy reliance on other players can make or break the experience  strategic depth can be daunting  price pushes boundaries of reasonability  respawn times of twenty seconds or more can feel like an eternity conclusion this game makes me laugh even when im losing an impressive

team fortress 2 is a very good and balanced game for me i dont know what other people think you can play it alone or with friends like building a group of players there are many different modes to play capture the flag paylord paylordrace capture points man vs machine and other costume modes there are also 9 classes you can choose 1 scout fast and you cant aim thembut he has 125 hp this are scouts 2 soldier tanky and got a rocket launcher but he is pretty slow 3 pyro flamethrowershotgunaxe pure death he makes a high damage 4 demoman bombs yes bombs many bombs wait to much bombs for people who love explosions d 5 heavy very tanky 300hp and he got a minigun more i wont say 6 engineer my favourite class he can build buildings like sentrys  dispensers  teleporters for tactical people 7 medic medic i am dieing a sec later a med appears and saves your live medics are wonderful 8 sniper see your teammates dieing dont know why they are dieing sniping is a good job my friend 9 spy whats this strange sound hears a scream why is he dead got backstabbed sneaky spys excactly what im thinking of this classes xd dont hate im not english im just austrian

team fortress 2 is a fastpaced gamefrom characters as fast as scout to characters as slow as heavyalthough some people might arguei personally feel that scout is not the fastest as a soldierrocket jumping proves to be a good mean of reaching to the front linea great item to have as a soldier when rocket jumping is the gunboatsthe gunboats is a pair of amazing itemit provides lots of mobilitynext were going to look at the classes 1 scoutfastgood mean of damage with the scattergunflying guillotinesandman can take down a heavy fast 2soldierslow at movingfast at rocket jumpinghighest mean of damage with stock rocket launchergunboats for mobility and market gardenerescape plan 3pyronormal speedreflecting rockets is the way to play pyro properly i feel and using the flare and axtinguisher gives you lots of damage output 4demomanslower by normal speed by a bitpipes and stickybomb launcher is a really good mean of taking down sentry nestsyou can have lots of fun by being a troll demoman by having the bootstide turner or sticky jumperdepending of map and the ullapool caberthe fun factor is high 5heavyslowest classgood mean of damage and very effective at attacking sentries 6engineernormal speedwidowmaker teaches you how to aim your shotgun as missing takes out your ammopistol for secondary as its your seond long range weapongunslinger as its annoying and fun to use 7 medicfaster than normal by a bitblutsaugerkritzkrieg for the healing taunt and uber saw to build uber for team 8snipernormal speedchallenging but funsniper is an effective class to deal with heavies 9spynormal speedlast but not leastwe have the spyan effective class against sentry nestsheavies and medicsthe spy is a very sly classable to take out sentry nests with the sappertaking out heavy and medic combos is a huge up side overall tf2 is a fun game to play

ive played this game for quite some time and had much fun in this game it is quite original and a unique gem in the line of video games out there for instance i was walking around in dustbowl and encountered an enemy pyro then astonishingly he croutched down pulled out an axe and called me a spy in friendliness i did the same except with a shovel being a new tf2 player and never seeing this behavior before i scrounged the voice command list for spy upon completing my feat of seeking the correct word we walked toward eachother slowly legs crouched and stared at eachother spamming spy we did this for a few moments until one of my team mates soldier came waddling himself down towards me and the pyro he stared at us both in confusion the little ghost dangling off his gibus in the fresh dusty air and shot a rocket at the pyro sending his body flying many yards away upon seeing my first tf2 ragdoll i burst into tears crying with laughter as the pyros body fell through the air and made the squish splat noise such a sight is unheard of in any other game and is quite common in this game i am not a tf2 fanboy as i have grown up playing games like the halo series my whole life since before i was 5 and playing cod for a few years i can easily say halo is a very fun game but that is another story you will never find another experience like the ones you find in tf2 nearly all the time every day there is much laughter to have and enjoy in this game 1010 is gud stuff heavy

recommended
this is very good i have over 500 hours of gameplay on this on alot of different accounts if you dont like blowing people up with a rocket launcher or shooting exploding enemies with a grenade launcher then you can try to run around like crazy and shoot enemies heads off with a scatter gun if you are just like you wanna camp you can try headshotting enemies with the sniper or just be the engineer who can build machines like a sentry that aims automatticly or shoot them build dispensers so you you can heal your teammates or build teleporters to get your teammates up to the line quickly
recommended
this is the best ftp game i have ever played there is so much to do no need to buy anything with real money if you dont want to everything can be crafted all 9 classes are awesome i never feel that one of them is too op because you can always counter them once you mastered one class there is always more if you master scout you can then start to master some else class or just dont master anything and still have a good time wiht this game pvp mode works like it should nothing special just 7 differend game modes and some beta gamemodes lots of maps and everyone is fun to play there is also an pve mode called mvm its supper fun with firends and some of them are hard to top it off i like this game 
recommended
this might be hard to believe but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite i know this first hand i took care of this being as the mentor as i am a hyper elite of the syntaxsector of the illuminati i have experimented with teleportation obama and lizards shapeshifting into secretservice agents when the syntaxsector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole most experiments broke loose this prototype however was smarter than most with little to no signs of lizardlike structures when shapeshifted he was the perfect man for our job i once used my transformation powers but was quickly spotted and the extramolecular shapeshifting superdinosaur came and saved me with the hyperbeam harvested from dialga in the pokemon dimension yes that show is real made by the ancient gods from sectorbanimationdimensionx3 we transported the creatures into the intelligent planet called earth in my opinion the weakest sector of the whole illuminati if you want more information about these creatures first hand contact me via google or teleportating to the hyperdimension in classa

recommended
really fun and addictive game you need teamwork skill and shooting skill i would reccomend this game to anyone
recommended
i hate this game
recommended
team fortress 2 is in my opinion the best fps game ive ever played heres why it has 9 classes to choose from heavy medic sniper ect lots of gamemodes capture the flag control points ect humorous voicelines for each of the classes lots of weapons that you can find at random and of course hats to customize your characters oh and did i mention its free i highly recommend this to anyone who likes fps games
recommended
awesome fps game with unique classes and gamemodes perfect for new comers of fps games and experienced players
recommended
its a great game and i appreciate the 9 years worth of work put into this but like every game there are flaws its mainly glitches and exploits like the sandvich exploit to get endless points without cheating but this game sets the standards for what a first person shooter should be and if you had a mind you would think the same thank you kaifyre
recommended
its ok
recommended
this game is absolutly awesome every class has its unique skills and every single one of them is great graphics are not bad and never get boring this game may look hard at the first time but when you reach 20 hours of playing then you cant stop playing and you want to play more and more but the best part is gameplaycontrols are very smooth after 2 hours of playing you can find the class that is made for you i played a lot multiplayer games but from my opinion this game is the best multiplayer game ever made 1010 thank you valve

recommended
this game is actually a hat simulator the true objective of the game is to trade for hats and miscs all those other gamemodes in this game are actually minigames meant to distract you from the prime objective of aquiring hats 1010 would hat
recommended
team fortress 2 is a gem in my steam library although i do not play it daily like other players the game is surely addicting and i always turn up when there are updates or special events the game is a freetoplay which is great although you can buy stuff in game it doesnt make the game a paytoplay game there are no op weapons as far as im aware and the gameplay is fantastic you can pick from a range of classes which are all free and come with different weapons which of course are free flamethrowers machine guns knives bombs you name it highly reccomended thanks for reading

recommended
we all know how reviews turn out to be in team fortress 2 well if i have to be honest from my experience it was a great game back in the days do not get me wrong it is still a great game though but after how things have changed throughout the years team fortress 2 is all about hats and economy any public servers are not always fun to play on your own when you have to carry your team all the time plus do not expect to see any medics on your team either as there will be more snipers spies and scouts may the luck be with you and then there is random crits ugh this is just what i dislike but if you only care about having fun playing the game then do not let this bother you but still i will recommend to play team fortress 2 with your friends as it will make your gaming experience much more enjoyable

tf2 is a game that would make my top 20 best games of all times list it only has minor flaws but mostly amazing in terms of gameplay and its growing community and tons of weapons and especially hats
recommended
very fun game nice system okay graphics but it feels like 75% of the community are deaf blind or muted
recommended
great
recommended

recommended
dude its tf2 how do you not have it already
recommended

recommended
it never occurred to me that i never did recommend this but then again did i really have to in the first place one of the best free to play games out there it never was pay to win it was pay to look rad
recommended
when you want to look nice wear a hat if you want to push in dustbowl use the side tunnel if you wanna blow up robots and save mann co play some mann vs machine with friends and if you wanna be in space play some asteroid

recommended
in my opinion tf2 is one of the greatest games of all time with many different styles to play and loads of game modes and hats so i would deffinatley reccomend tf2 to anyone and whats stopping you its free
recommended
i just realized that i have played this game for more than 1k hours and havent made a recommendation for it so here i am when i tried this game first time the voice of the announcer was so strange i said i wont be able to tolerate this voice so i stopped playing basically right after i started after like a year maybe i picketed it up again thanks to gameday iroda i thought why not try it again and boy after few hours of struggling with well any class i fell in love i wasted few hundred bucks on virtual items since then but you know i dont mind it this game gave me so many awesome hours and i still like it i dont know when it will wear off but one thing is for sure if you havent played it already just give it a shot you cant lose anything since its f2p
recommended
best f2p out there
recommended
so what i like about team fortress 2 its complety different from other first person shoters i have played another thing i like about it is how much you can custimize your classesanother thing i love is the gameplay is just so adictive honestly i dont hate anything about tf2

best muilti player game ever
recommended
as you can tell by my play time i quite enjoy this game i find it extremely fun this game is filled with the craziest things you can grab your minigun or your sheild and sword it has nine classes to chose from all with distinct roles and weapon sets what is really cool is that it is fun even to the free players you can get most weapons without having to pay if you decide to buy anything from the ingame store you are automatically upgraded to a premium account all you gain from this is more frequent item drops the ability to trade and other minor things all in all i think the game is extremely entertaining
recommended
this game has a great community and economy on top of it being free to play the gameplay is fantastic and the graphics are good too i highly recommend installing and playing team fortress 2
recommended
this game is great for if you are looking for a team based game from medics that can heal your team to spies that can cloak and disguise as a member of the oppisite team to the wacky and wide variety of weapons you have at your disposal this game never gets old on top of that there is a large community behind this an although broken economy and much more also hats if you are worried about if your computer cant handle this my 1 year old windows laptop can handle this game on the highest graphics with more then playable frames per second this game is also not very serious which depending on your taste is a great way of bringing humor to this game this game gets constant updates with new weapons features cosmetics and sometimes maps on top of this you can play this game free of charge however the downsides are that this game requires you to buy something off of the in game store in order to expand your storage you also cant trade until you buy something off the store this may be a problem for some people that are having a hard time with their money at the moment this game isnt the most balanced either this is mostly due to the wide variety of weapons that are avaliable overall this game is the best fps i have played in a while and the only game i have been playing for some time i highly reccomend this to anyone that is a fan of fps games
recommended
this game is absolutely amazing for those of you turned off by needed to buy something from the store to get premium you can get it for less then 50 cents the kits are well balanced the achievements are fun and the weapons are awesome hope to see you online
recommended
tf2 is a good game u can play with friends or play coop also play ofline gaming if your new stick with training or offline til you get good byes lighting fire

i love this game it is my all time favourite game and i have nothing more to say other than play it my rating 1010 get it its free
recommended
if you cant afford games like call of duty advanced warfare or counter strike global offesive then this game is for you why you ask well its a great game overall because its a cartoony shooter what more can ask its not like those games with fancy graphics like tomb raider cod advanced warfare bioshock2 portal2 etc so i suggest you add this game to your library and give it a try

great game many hours on it with endless fun i reccomed it if youre looking for comedy guns and fun another great thing is that they focused into every characters personality there traits characteristics and weapons as you play more you build skill earn acheivements and express your personality by putting on cosmeticsclothes another thing you should note is the community they are usually nice and respect and try to help you in summary i reccomend this silly game to new players and expeirenced for entertainment

tldr at the end it was 2011 i had been wandering around best buy when i saw a box case for team fortress 2 for 10 dollars i wondered why they would be selling the same minimalist game i played on the orange box on my xbox so i wandered over to the computer section of the store and looked up why someone would buy it on pc i found that the pc version had more than the 10 maps on the xbox version it had differnt weapons to pick from and hats too i thought oh what the hell and got the game i came home to set it up on my old cruddy toshiba laptop and as a result caused me to create a steam account but it couldnt hande it so i used my brothers laptop whenever he wasnt using it i fell in love instantly the multitudes of gamemodes the custom maps and many achievements to get and i was an achievement addict back then thanks to my xbox kept me entertained my brother got a virus on his computer and blames the custom maps i downloaded because of it to this day im not sure if it was the cause so he didnt let me use it anymore almost a year later it was early 2012 somehow i convinced my brother to play on his computer again when i found out that a few months earlier the game became free to play a ton of my friends began playing it which made it appealing again when i came back though everything was about trading not many went to achievement servers anymore there were spreadsheets and things that used to be worth very little buds were 2 keys and bills were 1 were now jacked up in price i got used to it though and adapted to become a good trader i even met a guy who i called my partner and we worked together to trade our way up and it worked we got a fireproof diary which i still dont know what it does out of pyromania despite me finding the deal he wanted to hold on to it and around that time i felt him becoming more hostile i was kind of afraid to ask him to much out of fear that he would run off with the whole thing and despite my pleads in saying that it would probably triple in value soon it only doubled but i was still kind of right he decided to sell it anyway and because of my conversations with him being too cautious he only gave me 25%  5 keys out of 20 and i couldnt really do much about it i was angry so i created a scheme in which i created a fake account and pretended i had some crazy amount to offer him in a spycrab look it up if you dont know what it is and knowing him he said he had an equal amount which he didnt i got lucky and i won it and just like i thought he changed his name and did a bunch of other things to hide himself i then used a new fake account which i pretended was a steam admin of something like that and told him when he was reported for the spycrab i investigated and found that the bud he used to have was duped look that up too he practically bribed me to keep quiet and i got back a good share of what was mine he still doesnt know i did this to this day i lost my tf2 privalages again until late 2013 this year when i got my own computer and this was the best time of all for me from all my previous trading i had a ton of items which raised in value while i was away i decided as i didnt need most of it to do giveaways in different servers one server in particular sodahappy i met a kind admin still good friends with who helped me do some giveaways using his admin powers this influenced me to join the community and become a moderator so i could do giveways for a while it was fun people didnt do the giveaways for only free stuff but for the fun minigames it had such as one where everyone was locked in a small room and had to try and run away while i used a zap function which killed them if i pressed a button while aiming at them but then problems started to occur my giveaways started to become out of hand as everyone was doing them people no longer cared for the game than the prize and i got in trouble with the higher up admins because of the amount of zaps  i had 2800 zaps in the 4 months i was a mod other mods had no more than 100 in their entire careers after explaing that issue and a few others i was restricted in giveaways and over time i got less enthusiastic with it i left sodahappy but i left with a ton of new and good friends on my side who i met through the server in the recent months i focused on getting my dream unusual which i wanted long since before free to play was a thing a texas ten gallon painted gold that was vivid plasma and level 3 or 33 favorite hat favorite paint favorite effect and if you look at my name you can see why the level after borrowing an entire bud from that admin mentioned above from sodahappy the first one i met i purchased the hat for 35 buds with some extra sweets while it was only worth 25 this was because the owner was super reluctant to give it up but i needed it for its level 33 after paying off the 1 bud debt i felt complete i had a ton of tf2 stuff including my dream hat and i felt it was time to move on so i gave a lot of my stuff away and stopped playing tf2 revisiting occasionally summarytldr tf2 is my most played game of all time and i kind of grew up with it and if i could go back and change anything i wouldnt maybe except for that  scamming me as much as it makes me sound like a nerd tf2 represents a chapter of my life and i wont soon forget it

when i got this game i swore i would never spend a single penny to buy anything and just be content with the loot drops but then i thought maybe ill get something worth a couple cents just so i could get a premium account and have more backpack space and later on damn i have a lot of crates and i need to purchase a key to open one maybe just one or two and now im an active trader and have bought a bunch of keys for metals and taunts and weapons and most importantly hats
recommended
great game  its my 2nd day playing it and its just awesome  i love it  i really recomend this game to any videogame players  boys or girls for the first time i saw it before like 1 year  i tough its totaly crap  just kind of cartoon style fps with bad controls  but actually  its better than cod modern warfare 2 plus it got voice chat so you can chat with your friends  and it too got normal chat i love trading items from this game with friends  love this game
recommended
its a fun game to play every now and then if youve got nothing else to do personally i couldnt play this all day everyday
recommended
easily one of my favourite games ever most of the weapons are well balanced and the combat is absolutely insanely fun whats more its free strictly speaking you should buy at least one thing from the mann co store to get the full fun out of it but thats like a $050 outlay which heck you can get with trading cards
recommended
this game is a fps first person shooter game which is played by gamers worls wide i really love this game by its graphic design trading ingame
recommended
the best game that i have ever played tf2 is a class based fps the classes are all easily countered and fun no 1 class is too op and the range of items that you can find is astounding some items help counter the class that counters you which i think is great this is definitely a game that you want to play
recommended
after playing this almost 2000 hours i have to say it is my favorite game there is so much to do find friends spam binds trade play on community servers with ads play on valve servers with f2ps go on trade servers and snipe customize your classes with weapons and hats trade up or buy hats with coolio shiny  show off your hat with coolio shiny  cry cause no one wants to buy your hat keep the hat for days go crazy over the hat i still have the hat ok enough about hats here are the classes heavysuper slowprobably going to be healedbuffeddamage dealer spyaverage speedprobably going to be spy checkedstealthybackstabber scoutfastprobably will die of sentryssmart meat shoter sniperaverage speedprobably will be out snipedaussieaim botter demomanslightly slower than averagemay get healeddrunkdamage dealer pyrohuddah huddahmmmphmmmphmmph mmph mpmh mph mph mph engineeraverage speed910 chance to be harrased by spysalso drunkcamping more than snipers medicaverage speedwill most likley pocket heavyoktoberfestspy bait soilderslow on foot fast in airmuricamuricamurica well thats about it mates im drunk demoman

this game is great i started playing after some very tragic issues in life as i slowly became even more of a gamer and an antisocial to be honest i only expected a few hours of fun and then id be moving on but that was not the case i joined a server one night and got sucked in the class diversity the community other than that of the mvm community taunts weapons and most importantly hats so while most people think the community is toxic they mustve been in the wrong damned place because everywhere i have been everyone has been very polite and nice with one exception the mvm tour of duty community people there are so damned strict with what they want as they push through one of the most challenging tasks of getting an australium weapon many of them have egos larger than the  on a black male but some arent as religiously following this gamemode and they will mess around if they realize being serious isnt beating the wave so other than that our community is running fine team fortress has fought changing times and has succeeded its the game that you hate to love but the game you cant put away 1010 would play another 1000 hours and probably will
recommended
best game ive ever played and to make it even better its f2p the game has a nearly unlimited skill cap and it is the most unique and hilarious game youll ever play dont let not being good get you down just keep practicing and eventually u will get good and come to love this magnificent masterpiece people say hats ruined the game thats dumb u dont have to wear hats and i wear a gibus with pyrovision goggles for the irony dont worry about all the weps and hats its still a fun game no1 is making u trade all the time or wear hats just play the game and have a blast with it

this first person shooter is unique to all others it has a cartoony look and feel which is the core to how this game works the weapon designs are all unique and humorous and the maps are excellent to play in
recommended
just doing this for badge its good
recommended
this game is amazing it is the best fps that i have played in all my gaming years 5 stars  this game is for those fps players who just want some hilarious gameplay this game has many easter eggs and has may in game rewards you should all go out and play this funny and wierd game full of crap from another universe
recommended
a unique fps game that i actually enjoy playing the classes are very different the game is balanced getting updated often and has a great art style and humor
recommended
what is there to say about tf2 that has not already been said not much really so i am going to try and keep this short this game has some of the best class based mechanics that can be found in any fps each class is different and provides a different style of play to have fun with and that is just the stock characters customization is one of this games strong points in what other game can i jump across a map with a pink beard and hat and then proceed to smash a shovel into a friends face causing them to endlessly rage there is a reason that people still play this after 7 years tf2 has taken many hours of my life and im fine with that as longs as it continues to stay awesome i will spend many more hours in the future arf walruse

ive been playing team fortress since the beginning of this summer 2013 to be honest i havent played a game that can matche up to team fortress and no matter how boring you are the fun never ends it keeps going going and going

introduction team fortress 2 has really surprised me while it has no story or coop modes this has to be one of my favorites game play simple multiplayer or bot matches thats it campaign nah there are some fun gamemode that include arena capture the flag control point king of the hill mann vs machine payload special delivery territorial control and even a dueling minigame what else can you ask for hats yes valve has added hundreds of hats for you which can cost hundreds of $$$ but why waste you hardearned cash on a digital hat you dont need to trading can get you 1 ordinary wepon to unusual hats but with a cost not a money cost but lots lots lots of time away from that you can customize your loadouts and play 9 different classes scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper spy each has there own advantages and disadvantages that make the gameplay different for each class sniper litterally snipes you from the corner of the map and medic heals you playing each can get you to your favorite ingame items that you get by random drops can complete change your style of play each wepon can either reload faster but shoot slower or completely opposite there are custom maps and plugins that can change the game from shoot stuff and kill things to slender and even role playing sprays can be a problem if someone is watching you people can relate and players can rage on mic most people are friendly and some never stop playing this game graphicsother cartoonlike characters and lots of gore lowerend pcs can also handle the game but on lower settings good graphics but you dont need better because its not realistic controls are normal wasd to move r to reload mouse1 to shoot challenge level easy bots can be a little difficult if it your first fps or new to tf2 as you play more expert goes from instakilling you to easy real multiplayer can have noobs or mlg players how fun it is really fun from walking into the super death trap of sentries or sticky jumping across them map this game has been worth ever hour i played playing death run is great fun but mario kart can be better there are many good laughs that i had while playing conclusion play it
recommended
team fortress 2 is an online multplayer shooter but over all i will say that team fortress is a great game and i recommend giving it a try its free to play so you should have no excuse not to have played it once
recommended
probaly the best free game you can get
recommended
very addicting and yet one of the best games i ever played
recommended
man this game is awesome play it if you are man or girl i dont know lol
recommended
respawn times are great breaks to jerk my sissy little  love this game
recommended
an excellent game one of my favorite online games of all time its entirely free except for hats and weapons but you can get all those weapons by just playing the game thats what i did and even now that i have all the weapons i can still have fun playing also theres updates every few months that fix balance issues and add a lot of items mainly hats plus you can make items in the steam workshop that can possibly be added to the game incredible right lastly trading in this game is an immense economy full of rises and drops once you get into this trading community you can make serious profit and eventually you can make money thats right you can buy other steam games by playing a free one is that not amazing if you arent downloading this game right this second i pity what youre missing out on over 2000 hours and still going strong

team fortress 2 is an amazing creative hilarious and incredibly fun multiplayer first person shooter this game is one of a kind and it is incredibly popular for many good reasons like it perfectly balances the 9 classes to make the game a lot more fun because who wants to constantly die against someone with virtualy no weakness the balancing in this game makes sure that no one class is too overpowered and encourages a lot of team work and stradegy the game probably wouldnt be as fun if it wasnt balanced to perfection valve also listens to their fans something that many game companies dont do we have the steam workshop to show fan  made items that have at least a chance of becoming in game items they also listen to feedback about for example balancing issues or a glitch the constant updates are great especialy since like the game they are all free these important updates could include new weapons taunts costumes maps or even modes like mann vs machine the 9 classes are so full of stereotypical humor bright personalities and amusing lines the scout is a stereotypical teenager from boston with a baseball bat and an awesome accent the soldier is a stereotypical american drill sargent with a bazooka who sounds exactly like what i would think a stereotypical drill sargent sounds like the demoman is a drunken black scottish guy with an accent a grenade launcher a stickybomb launcher and an eyepatch many peoples favorite class the heavy is a giant russian man with a minigun named sasha and a russian accent who punches people with his bare or bear hands and created an internet meme because of the almighty sandvich the engineer is a texan who can build sentry guns dispensers and teleporters to help the team has a texan accent and palys the guitar the sniper is an seemingly everyday australian man with a rifle that can do an instant kill headshot an australian accent a hat and sunglasses and is an assasin for hire not just a mercinary the medic is a german doctor that has a german accent stole a dove from a german prime ministers wedding and named it archimedes and lost his medical liscence who can breifly turn people invincible the spy my favorite is a mysterious french gentleman who can do an instant kill back stab has a french accent can turn invisible can use his electro sapper to destroy an engineers buildings in time is an assasin for hire like the sniper and is cruel to everybody and my second favorite class the pyro is a complete mystery since he has a fire protective suit that covers his entire body a gas mask that covers his face if he even has one and only says mmph and has a huge variety of flamethrowers secondary weapons like flare guns and meele weapons like axes who is arguably the best class in the game even with the pyros balances like mostly closeranged combat i could go on and on about the entire game but i dont want to bore any one reading this review by making it even longer that it already is team fortress 2 is one of the funniest most creative one of a kind and best games i have ever played and the best pc game ever period i would recomend this more than anything else and if it wasnt free when i got it it would be higher than 1 on my wishlist infact the one reason i made a steam accout is to get team fortress 2 it is truly a godly game get this game now
recommended
this game is more addicting than cigarettes
recommended
honestly i love the game and it has a good community once you become a p2p i was a f2p for about 150  200 in game hours and people were just major douches to me
recommended
really fun and addictive gamei really recoommend it to everyone
recommended
one of the best online fps to date characters are awesome voice acting is awesome weapons are awesome class based with a giant arsenal of different weapons to equip smooth and optimized performance awesome fan made and oficial maps has in game store were all weapons and cosmetics are execpt for a few promo items but here is the twist almost all of the stock weapons which you recieve from the start are the best weapons drop rather freqeuntly aswell as having achivements which gives weapons hint there is a lot of achivements so in short play this game if you dont enjoy no harm its free just uninstall and be on your way 1210 would play again

very fun game in my opinion one of the best games that has ever existed during my long playtime i learned a lot about the community with the probably addition of competitive matchmaking valve will revive this game since a lot of players say it is dying all i hope is that valve will add this new feature and this game will have even more players like csgo and dota 2 cosmetics are also a part of the game that keep the community alive people say traders are stupid and dont even play the game and traders say that people who play the game only for gameplay are stupid and poor thats not true at all the f2p players arent always noobs there are some f2ps with expensive backpacks and there are some f2ps with crazy skills its not the gibus or the team captain its the skills no matter what type of skills  trading or playing it is a fair and balanced game and people can easily get started playing it there arent any complex mechanics or anything just hop on and have fun lots of weapons to choose from lots of gamemodes lots of fun the perfect trio i started playing this game and the first 1000 hours i only played without trading i got premium at 500 hours and started trading after 1000 i started playing the game without trading just months ago my backpack is worth a bit and i do not need more than this as a conclusion i am both a trader and a player and i suggest you play this game for both of those things the only bad thing i can say is that the trading community is going to hell

presentation  8510 user interface shows you all you need to know solid feature set all around and great little touches of polish graphics  9510 the art style is such a forceful presence in this game adding to the enjoyment you get out of it and the allure to keep playing a strikingly coherent artistic vision sound  910 many of valves staple sound effects are mixed in with excellent weapon and voice effects to yield excellent results gameplay  910 its difficult to describe but this game just feels right from the way the weapons handle to the way your character scampers around the environments an absolute blast to play lasting appeal  8510 very lasting very lasting indeed overall  8910

its a really fun game the drops are amazing d
recommended
i totally recommend this game to anyone interested tf2 is a first person shooter kinda this game can involve wacky shenanagins like bumper cars giant strongman games silly cosmetics and watching really bad players what i really like is that you can get almost a full experiance with the free to play option with only some crafting trading and inventory space being limited the only downsides to this game are the cost of some items like keys and paints and the glitches oh the glitches although sometimes funny they can be a real hassle there are times when you cant join games have trading errors are unable to turn or quite and can only swing your current weapon glitches caused by using the chat and anything along those lines overall though this game can be a lot of fun for people of many ages
recommended
if you dont have tf2 thensigh i dont know what your waiting for get tf2 it true the hype this is a must have for any pc gamer

team fortress 2 is an amazing creative hilarious and incredibly fun multiplayer first person shooter this game is one of a kind and it is incredibly popular for many good reasons like it perfectly balances the 9 classes to make the game a lot more fun because who wants to constantly die against someone with virtualy no weakness the balancing in this game makes sure that no one class is too overpowered and encourages a lot of team work and stradegy the game probably wouldnt be as fun if it wasnt balanced to perfection valve also listens to their fans something that many game companies dont do we have the steam workshop to show fan  made items that have at least a chance of becoming in game items they also listen to feedback about for example balancing issues or a glitch the constant updates are great especialy since like the game they are all free these important updates could include new weapons taunts costumes maps or even modes like mann vs machine the 9 classes are so full of stereotypical humor bright personalities and amusing lines the scout is a stereotypical teenager from boston with a baseball bat and an awesome accent the soldier is a stereotypical american drill sargent with a bazooka who sounds exactly like what i would think a stereotypical drill sargent sounds like the demoman is a drunken black scottish guy with an accent a grenade launcher a stickybomb launcher and an eyepatch many peoples favorite class the heavy is a giant russian man with a minigun named sasha and a russian accent who punches people with his bare or bear hands and created an internet meme because of the almighty sandvich the engineer is a texan who can build sentry guns dispensers and teleporters to help the team has a texan accent and palys the guitar the sniper is an seemingly everyday australian man with a rifle that can do an instant kill headshot an australian accent a hat and sunglasses and is an assasin for hire not just a mercinary the medic is a german doctor that has a german accent stole a dove from a german prime ministers wedding and named it archimedes and lost his medical liscence who can breifly turn people invincible the spy my favorite is a mysterious french gentleman who can do an instant kill back stab has a french accent can turn invisible can use his electro sapper to destroy an engineers buildings in time is an assasin for hire like the sniper and is cruel to everybody and my second favorite class the pyro is a complete mystery since he has a fire protective suit that covers his entire body a gas mask that covers his face if he even has one and only says mmph and has a huge variety of flamethrowers secondary weapons like flare guns and meele weapons like axes who is arguably the best class in the game even with the pyros balances like mostly closeranged combat i could go on and on about the entire game but i dont want to bore any one reading this review by making it even longer that it already is team fortress 2 is one of the funniest most creative one of a kind and best games i have ever played and the best pc game ever period i would recomend this more than anything else and if it wasnt free when i got it it would be higher than 1 on my wishlist infact the one reason i made a steam accout is to get team fortress 2 it is truly a godly game get this game now
recommended
this game is a must and its free why would you even wiat to play it
recommended

team fortress 2 has changed a lot recently and you know what in my opinion its not getting better not any more unless gaben or the community does something about this freetoplay game it might just die one day the servers will be empty the only ones that will be filled is trading servers and competitive servers which is kind of  in itself tf2 was not meant to be a competitive game anyway tf2 has still changed me sorta or should i say the people ive met has changed me and how i look at the game today as an autistic little fck i am i loved the competitive community until a lot of  happened in the ugc leauge around the seasons 12 and 13 maybe theres still some  left who knows but for a f2p this game is a great experience if you want to find out what unbalanced teams and  weapons are youre more than welcome to join tf2 610 im still playing it yeah i swear a lot so <3
recommended
the best free to play game

5 star one of the best games ive ever played the gameplay is fun and kenetic the music and sfx are cool and funny at the same time and tf2 is one of those rare awesome mmos that continue to set the bar higher and higher for itself well surpassing what it once was especially loving the mvm mode
recommended
very fun all i want is weapons and ive been playing a lot for weapons since thats the only way to get weapons weapons are want i want and need flamethrowers snipers i dont care as long a i can kill people with it also i like the food this game provides food you can use as combat weapons example the holy mackerel a fish again you can kill people with it one thing i get mixed up with in the game is that if you kill someone along the rails or a fence it looks like they are standing up so i waste my ammo trying to kill a dead guy thats it and remember to get weapons i recommend this game for people who likes weapons how many times did i say weapons not including the time i say weapon in this sentence
recommended
well its hard for me to describe tf2 how can someone talk using his reason about something that he loves damn i dont know how for me there isnt no words to describe this incredible piece of  thats not just a game its clearly much more than that the only thing i can say is that this thing is really ing amazing no further comments about ps i really really love that crap d

when a fps meets team play fun and strategy  team fortress 2 is a game that looks simple at first glance just pick a class shoot kill everybody have fun but in the end you realize that its not that simple every class has strengths and weaknesses  the more balanced is a team the more chance the team has to win and once you really understand all the classes and know them all the game is just bomb so in this game being a pro at cs or quake 3 arena doesnt mean youll oneshot everybody here  youve got to think carefully about what you do and help the best possible your team thats precisely what i love in this game  each class is useful and no class is overpowered i do not count the number of games that have been won because i was a medic or an engineer which are support classes and because there were enough big guys in my team to do the rest and at last but not least you have in this game a lot of fun contents cf the pyro glasses  or when blood becomes balloons and fire becomes rainbow which is the icing on the cake the only backdrop  there is a lot of noobs in public games that dont know how to play and most of the time its the team who has the highest number of nonnoobish player who wins but that shouldnt be a problem for you if youre looking just for fun 
recommended
this game is a extremely addictive team based shooter where having everyone working togetheir is essential even if you dont like the base game valve volvo pls has had good support for custom game modes like jailbreak prophunt vs saxton hale the game has a very deep trading system basically created by the community if you have the space and and bandwith this game is a must get atleast try it

i was 9 years old i loved tf2 so much i had all of gabens merchandise i decided to play on a public server on tf2 i couldnt believe it when i pressed tab i saw gabe newell was gabenthe lord and savior really playing on a server with a skrub like me gaben sent me a trade request i quickly took a screenshot to make all my friends jelly i then accepted the request hey kid wanna give me all your items 4 this rare item he added a ghostly gibus but no it wasnt any regular skrubby ghostly gibus it was a new hat the name read gabens special hat for a special boy i knew that this deal was a once in a lifetime oppurtunity i quickly added all of my 146 items into the trade very good gaben said he hit confirm trade as did i once i got the item i nearly peed my pants in joy i asked my friend how much this new item was worth not that i would sell it but i just wanted to know he broke the news to me it turns out it wasnt a new hat it was just a ghostly gibus that had been renamed i cried myself to sleep that night when i awoke the next morning i was surprised to see gaben standing by my bed watching me he pulled out a box out of his pants he handed it to me with love and care whawhats this for i asked almost too afraid to question the almighty gaben its a surprise he told me when i opened the box there was a decapitated head in it this is the man who scammed you gaben said i smiled in delight thank you gaben i ran up to him and gabe him a warm and tight hug oh but my boy the present isnt over he said i heard a sound coming from my computer on the tf2 main screen i had pending alerts i clicked on the alert box and i couldnt believe it i got all my items back but something seemed a little strange i had more items in my inventory than before i scrolled through my inventory and was amazed to see a whole page filled with unusuals i went to go put my items in my profile display case but something seemed to be downloading i checked what was and i almost died in shock it was hl3 thank you gaben my lord and savior i said anything for a son my boy and with that he flew out the window gaben is not life gaben is a way of life

first of all i want to start out by saying that i am not the most experienced player but tf2 isnt a game where experience really matters i have around 1500 hours but i am a decent trader and have come pretty far into trading what i mainly want to review is the stuff i know about competitive and trading perhaps the most wellknown aspects of the game yet the most fluctuated in terms of rating or liking trading trading unless you are extremely experienced revolves around two things luck and patience although you do need some other skills price checking negotiation etc you hardly ever get good deals unless you are trading with some 10 yearold whose mother spent wellearned money on a virtual game sometimes i do get good deals good in tf2 trading terms means profit on some decently experienced players but it is rare for me competitive from the tf2 servers ive played on competitive can be good bad or of course just normal why because in one game you might be absolutely  the asses off the other team but then you have been switched to the other team due to autobalance another example one team might have a player wearing a burning tc yet the others are fresh out of installation roaming cluelessly around with their gibuses on well thats my review this was just all my opinion and i respect every one elses bye
recommended
so this isnt my first review but i guess i need to do it again since the first one was on 40 hours of playing so after a year i get to know 5 things about this game 1 its awesome the tons of nice people almost every friend i have is from tf2 i can make some mentions like the best player in my list is a nice guy with true heart and soemone that helped me when i was about to kill myself due to a break up with anyway other guys like a teacher from a rocket jump server that now is one of my best friends an asian guy that well is asian and a german guy with a profile pic of a girl xd you can get to know ive been playing in almost every kind of server from a normal valve control points server to a death run server hosted by nice admins also you can get to some weird servers that are full of bots or idle people but well thats something that happens sometimes 2 hats 3 the community is half good and half bad i mean you get to know nice players and some funny servers to just have fun and other servers to completely destroy the enemy team but since mannconomy update now there is another market for all the things you can have and get but you need items to do it like keys and  and they have prices and a lot of more things that i dont want to get into it i mean yeah i used the market tf2outpost and tradetf but i dont care about prices or those things if i want a thing i get the thing no matters what is the price for it so i just skip this part but if you wanna get into it you will need to use backpacktf 4 last thing this game saved my life with the friends i got from it i must say thank you for it if you have a history just ing add me and hang me with me for a while maybe i can even be your new friend  5 hats
recommended
after playing this game for nearly 3 years i still love going on it every single day this is by far the best game out their and since its free to play youre out of excuses to not try it
recommended
one of the best free to play game with good graphics and all in it is fantastic
recommended
when team fortress 2 was released in 2007 it was the result of nine years of development its now seven years later and development hasnt actually stopped a wealth of gamemodes weapons and gameplay adjustments later team fortress 2 is less intricately wellbalanced but is still as exciting and funny as it ever was going freetoplay was also a smart decision i feel as the expanded playerbase means youll never go without a match absolutely recommended
recommended
best team based hat simulator there is

words dont even begin to describe how incredible this game is i have more hours on my main account d but its alot of fun  <3
recommended
team fortress 2 does an amazing job of creating very specialized classes for every type of player whether youre the type who likes to attack from afar charge into battle or even go undercover tf2 has you covered since every character has exaggerated features based on their play style i immediately understood each character from their look for example the spys slender and mysterious physique told me he wasnt the strongest but he was probably stealthy since the name of the game is team fortress 2 the team is a major part of it to be successful you need every class on the field sure there will be a few of a certain class but a team full of snipers wont do any good if you dont have someone looking outside of a scope once in a while one of the main problems a lot of people have with the game is autobalance spreading people around to fill empty spots on the other team it annoys me a lot of the time but it makes it fair sure you mightve just scored 2 caps and someone else is about to make the third when you switch but it is for the good its just a game right tf2 constantly makes me laugh whether its the heavys quote pootispenser here or the medics quote oops zat was not medicine if there is some sort of campaign i havent heard about it at least for single player but it makes up for it best of all its free and you can conga while wearing a hat pros fun for all playerstyles hilarious dialogue and art style straightforward and easy to pick up conga cons team autobalance sometimes no real storyline or single player campaign
recommended
basic free to play game will keep you entertained for many days and years to come great game to play with friends or to make new friends also if you dont play this you wont get any of the inside jokes society makes so start playing to catch up with those people who have 10000 plus hours

probably your best first experience in a shooter but after playing a lot you can see it is lacking a lot and the major things you can notice is  non serious players bad teammates and then some good teammates who can get the kills but are only fragging i give you an advice  after you reach 1000 hours quit the game

team fortress is such a fun and enjoyable game its weapons gameplay balance and reliance on teamwork all work together in perfect harmony with 7 gamemodes 9 classes tonnes of weapons and maps tf2 is such a great game both from its great sense of balance and comical gameplay step aside battlefield and cod tf2 is the game to play tf2 isnt your usual fps its 9 classes all have unique weapons tactics advantages and disadvantages these classes include the quick fast scout the rocket firing soldier the flamethrowing pyro the grenade lobbing demo the bullet tanking heavy the sentry building engineer the ally healing medic the headshoting sniper and the backstabbing spy each class counters and is countered by another class tf2 is a masterpiece of a game and is still being updated what are you waiting for go play tf2 now its free

when i was growing up in the white trash apartment complex in the 90s i often spent my days playing outside i would catch toads fish and bugs and often keep them as pets one day my mother burned my face with a cigar a few years ago my brother and i were fishing we caught a catfish and as we were cleaning and gutting it we noticed a pair of human infant feet in the catfishs stomach contents more importantly this taught me a valuable lesson about not running on floors covered in ice or human excrement
recommended
playing this game you should remember few thing 1hat 2hat with awesome effect on it 3golden weapons aussies 4dont wear the gibus d ^ ^
recommended
nice freetoplay online game from valve that based on a team work you can play for one of 9 classes scout soldier demoman pyro heavy engineer medic sniper spy every class has its special limitations capabilities and features universe of a game is crazy comic kind of funny bloody violent enthralling by the way this game also famous for its variety of hats
recommended
fun game and lots of people to playwith
recommended
this game is turning out to be one of the best freetoplay games i have ever played the updates are amazing and so are the festive addons you get for free i would recommend this game to all who love fps
recommended
free to play or premium this game is fun no matter what
recommended
i got a hat
recommended
best hat simulator ive ever played 1010
recommended
this is by far the best f2p game on the market
recommended
fun first person shooter lots of hatstheres guns there are diffrent classes all kind of maps there are events for holidays and such i highly recommend this game if you are looking for a free quick to download game thats fairly fun
recommended
the best shooter since counter strike and we all know how fun and interesting that game is
recommended
you all needs hats to live
recommended
in short this game gives hours of fun its free to play but is strongly recommended that you upgrade to premium you can use your steam wallet to pay for the cheapest thing in the store if you wish to upgrade 9 unique classes and multiple weapons per class youll enjoy this game for a long time there are also lots of different mods gamemodes and maps
recommended
endless hours of fun protected against cheating impressive trading economy great community and well developed system overall i play this game whenever i get the chance
recommended
this game is gud
recommended
amazing i love it this game is amazing for a f2p game the gameplay is good all game modes are fun too play and all weapons and hats are very interesting and fun to use but f2ps can be anoying sometimes and ruin conga partys 9510
recommended
an incredibly fun fps game if you have steam and dont have this game you should kill yourself but not before you play it
recommended
what a really good f2p game that alot of people will enjoy i spend more than $15 on this game just for being premium and buying keys i would rate this 1110 unusuals
recommended
one worthy thing to mention one thing this game is full of is hats if you dont have hats you are an outcast until you either find one or steal your parents credit card to buy some this game in my opinion has a lot of key features that make it great first off there is no campaign so its all multiplayer based the community is very friendly towards anyone a mostly silly game but if you want to play competitive they have servers for that this game is also a good way to make money you can sell keys on the market or do what i did and play mvm and pray that you get an australium valve seems to listen to what the community wants added in to the game and will add them for the most part each weapon is unique and balance they will have something good about them but then they will have something to counter that ex a weapon might have 25% damage but then will also have 25% movement speed overall this game is great and despite being free is one of the best games i have ever played in my life im sure there are others who will agree with me ps dont buy anything from the mannco store no matter how desperate you are
recommended
the best f2p game ever 
recommended
team fortress 2 is one of the best online expirences ive had on a pc the gameplay can be mixed and matched and the players are very nice most of them anyway

1010 ignits ok time for my tf2 story one day i was at my friends house and he played tf2 and found a strange wepi wanted it so bad i went home and played it i did not care till i got my first scout hat i loved it i was tolded it was worth 1scrap so i accepted it i lost 6ref i went and cryed in bed then a light flickered on my game it said buy a hat on the store gabe gets a candy bar so i accepted i use my mums card and spend 100$ then gaben took it from me and give me a genuine gibus i cryed threw my pc and jumped out a window like dis if u cri evry tim

this game is awesome thank you valve for creating this game alsothank you for the valve ceo gaeb newell i hope you would create better games by the way thank you because i get items so many items i thought this game is not awesome but when i play it it was awesome
recommended
this game reminds me of my bathtub in my opra house
recommended
valves team fortress 2 is quite different from most multiplayer games that come out these days first of all the balance of this game is excellent seriously out of all the classes the only one which comes even close to being overpowered and unbalanced is the pyro which is terrible at long range so probably that evens out secondly the humour and the classes are enough to keep anybody entertained there are 9 classes in the game and each one has their own unique personality and traits i definitely recommend this game if you havent played it yet do so right now its free to play but i had bought it when orange box came out
recommended
an easy way to get rich on steam its fun as well as competetive
recommended
this silly and unpredictable game keeps you entertained forever with a huge amount of weapons and accesories theres always something new to be found
recommended
this game is the very reason i dont own a car have any social skills or an education but at least i can say i have hats 1010
recommended
circle of tf2 think youre good > see people with hats better than yours \   \  spend $money$ on better hats < think youre bad
recommended
my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here
recommended
oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

this is the classic tfc gameplay updated with hats and then other misc items and now even the classic weapons have been redone to look like bread with teeth you heard me as ridiculous as this game seems the gameplay is still one of the best its a balanced shooter with multiple gameplay modes and 9 different unique classes if the gameplay doesnt capture you the trading will be careful i recall a time when i spent more time trading than i did actually playing graphics 910 sound 1010 gameplay 1010 overall 9510

everybody should know what hat fortress 2 is the hats dont do anything stop obsessing over them there thats out of my system now
recommended
its amazing so addicting 3
recommended
its very good and fun all new players to steam should have this game 
recommended
this is a really good take on your typical multiplayer fps people that play cod usually dont like this because there is no way to replicate the weapons in the game since tf2 actually requires some thinking and strategy if youre playing one of the more strategic classes the balance in the game is perfect since all of the classes have their strengths and weaknesses i would reccomend that people buy this game as you can jump in from pretty much any point as the stock default weapons are just as powerful as any so its incredibly easy to just download it and join in with your friends unless you wear the ghastly gibus then prepare to be called a noob

nyaahahaahhaahaha is all i really gotta say
recommended
this is honestly one of the best games ever
recommended
i can not recommend team fortress enough it is the best game i have ever played
recommended
a wonderfull game beautiful graphics a variety of choices of maps and a perfict economy for regular players

to sum it up this game is fun its fun when you win and its fun when you lose its mostly because these characters all bring a huge smile to face no matter who im playing as though its usally scout i always have fun and thats good most games you have to win to feel like youre having fun but not here that added with the fact that its always being updated so theres always somehing new makes this game a 1010 hats off to valve and the creators of team fortress classic youve come a long way

imagine this game as the eldorado  valve and the f2p introduction as a nuclear bomb and tf2 nowaday as the aftermath of that bomb  thats how i see tf2  it used to be great  on the way before the ruin  valve added stuff  at first it was good  then it started becoming suspicious  the hat phenomenon was at first a lol thing  that we first accepted  that ingame market  that however  was no good  and then there was the nuke  the meet the medic update  introducing the free to play  what was the reward to old players for buying the game  a hat  it looks like a ww2 british hat  but for me  it evokes more like valves middle finger pointed to my face  the community  tf2 used to have one of the greatest and most friendly community i had ever seen in any fps  such perfection was anihilated in one day  now  the autistic f2ps who wouldnt even hit an afk are everywhere  is there a sentry blocking your way on your attack  youll have to destroy it yourself  because your allies will keep running on it and dying like the  turds they are  managing to bring down some of the ennemies  too bad  five others will come on you alone  some ennemy made it through your defense  then youre ed  if you defend  youll be there forever  as your team will never know how to capture an objective  if you attack  its like an instant defeat  because your team doesnt defend  nor attack  the fact im referencing here is the team system  in every ing server  it will be like this  one teams contains all the good players  one other contains the   if the team happen to be balanced  the goods will gather will the goods because its tf2 and people wont like challenge  if you happen to be in the good team  the game will say  you and team balance  putting you alone in the team full of   leaving you 1v10  lets not forget the cancer of demoknight  which make  unable to destroy sentries anymore  and the minisentry  the invention of satan himself  thats only a few cons of the modern tf2  the rest is up to yourself to see or to read by the other games review  as i assumed youve read a lot  but the most annoying thing is listed there  its not a game anymore  its valves personal milkstation  filled with the second most toxic community of videogames   you valve  for you ed us way too hard

what is team fortress 2 team fortress is a fps game made by valve i recommend this game beacuse its fun to play its also free and first when i started i got my first hat the gibus then ive been playing the game i found out the big updates that are coming are free but however the hats came in and made me just spend money over them but now its fun to play the hats everything is just great you can screw around in random server or you can play on real maps and use teamwork to win or you can be trading in trade servers and also try funny and awesome stop like airshots and double kills and more thats what i have to say about this game its free 2 play so go check it out d
recommended
ah team fortress 2 such a great game if you dont listen to those people who complain about this game being to cartoonish then you will love this game i was invited by my friend who said that this was a great game at first i thought it was alright but i quit however since its free to play you could imagine that i tried it once more and i was officially hooked so whats so great about this game it has a lot of fun and sometimes outright hilarious maps then you have the classes being the guy who likes to get stuff done and over with fast and the fact that i love fast characters in games i love the scout or maybe you like explosions i would recommend the soldier or demoman want to be helpful to your team medic is the way to go so many great options and since there are only 9 classes you would think that after figuring out how each class works the game would get boring heheheheh nope there are a lot of weapons other than the stock starter if you call it that weapons theres the black box for soldier that gives you 15 health every hit the loch  n  load sorry if you dont like the spaces its just common for me to use them a lot in which you have to directly hit your enemy but it does so much damage and so much more weapons with a total of 27 starter weapons in the game and even more weapons than just those that you can find which are extremely fun to mess around with despite these things a game sometimes messes up on a few things which therefore makes the cons one of the usual cons i see in multiplayer fps games is that the community is bad and i say so on this game im not saying the community made maps or weapons are bad which there pretty good but some people who play this game just happen to be very rude dont get me wrong i like most people who play this game but everyone is going to run across either a troll spamming rick astley in the mic or someone who is just rude usually these people are probably in bad moods that day but mostly not they just want to either grab attention or be absolute trolls another con is that if your playing the game for the first time your going to die a lot this is usually the reason why some people quit tf2 so early this isnt really a con as it doesnt bother me that much but one of my friends doesnt like this game because he isnt good at it however this game can get hilarious such as backstabbing people and seeing them get sent over a building instant killing someone with a shovel while airborne watching people on spectator on the map sawmill run into the saws and killing themselves its what makes this a great game if your alright with cartoon  like graphics and you like casual first person shooters then please get this game right now speaking of now excuse me as i go kill people with my scout

after so long i decided to make a review half a decade almost barely started playing when the game wasnt f2p and a lot has changed since then cosmetics are the biggest change pretty much creating a whole market for them but all in all tf2 is still the same its still fun to play challenging at times and the game play keeps you on edge even after all these years
recommended
free fun who dont want d
recommended
me money is gone rip me wallet 1010

a fun game and lots of hats if ur new there might be trouble starting out but in the end youll be happy
recommended
its an awsome game recommended to many people

team fortress 2 is a first  person shooter that millions of people have played you can customize yourself with hats shirts weapons and so on although you have to pay real world money for hats or trade if you are free  to  play dont bother the insults premiums throw at you youre here just to have fun right well who am i kidding why recommend this game when you should have already gotten it score 1010 stars although once you had your fill of fun you have to play other games otherwise tf2 will soon get boring
recommended
this is one of the best games ive ever played its got multiplayer coop and bots if you feeling bored its full of funny stuff and shanagans even though you start out with nothing you still got the best weaps
recommended
the best game i ever played
recommended
summary 910 a superb online freetoplay experience you and your friends will spend countless hours playing details it has the standard freetoplay microtransactions sure but it is and shall remain my favorite shooter of all time why the unique classes the classes differenciate in lots of ways some being more drastic then others including the engineer who can build sentry guns dispencers and teleporters or the spy who can disguise as an enemy teammate and backstab them literally
recommended
this is amazing
recommended
probably the best free 2 play game on steam
recommended
this is a very good game i like it so much because its free
recommended
this is a well made stylized team based first person shooter teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers there are 9 classes to choose from each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team this provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels there are two official modes of play player versus player and mann versus machine player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players within this mode there are different types of maps each type of map has its own objectives for both teams to achieve mann verses machine is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots players collect money from destroyed bots the money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots the pay to play submode mann up gives rewards upon completing a tour in addition to game play players will randomly receive free items from the game some of the free items given out are weapons hats and crates hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class crates can be opened with a key keys can be purchased from the mann co store or from the steam community market or traded for from another player most crates will list which items can be found within them i really like the game

tf2 is the most popular free to play games in the history of free to play games with over 220000 reconsiderations it easily beats any other free to play games i recommend playing this game as it offers a wide range of game play and keeps you entertained the whole game other than pvp game play there is a coop mode which can be played for free or you can buy tour of duty tickets and when you use those you can unlock rare and valuable items there and 9 classes  3 support 3 defence and 3 offence first we have the sniper this is one of the classes you can relate to if you come from cod it is a support class and once you find a good spot you become a living hell for the other team next we have the spy this class is known for its sneaky a attribute this classes load out is  a revolver a butterfly knife a sapper to sap building from the engineer a invis watch and a disguise kit so he can portray hes on the other team his knife can backstab and instantly kill any class from behind once you have got the hang of this class the other team would need to be cautious next we move on to the pyro this is the spys nemesis because if a pyro his a spy disguised or invis or any other class with its flamethrower it will immediately catch fire therefore showing the rest of the team that there is a spy this fire causes after burn on any class this means that even after the pyro is dead the fire is dealing damage now we move on to the scout the scout is the fastest class in the game and is made to deal damage and get out due to its low health a scouts primary weapon is a scatter gun and when up close to enemy deals a large amount of damage it 2nd weapon is a automatic pistol this weapon can be also seen as the engineers secondary its 3rd weapon is a metal bat this is used when you are up close to the enemy now we move onto the engineer this calls is a defensive class and can build sentry guns dispensers and teleporters the buildings of the engineer either help teammates out in a tough situation or help hold off a enemy attack the buildings are vulnerable to spy sappers the sapper stops a building from working and also destroys the building after a period of time now we have the solider this class consists of a rocket launcher a shotgun and a shovel this class is moderately effective in offence as it can kill most classes in 2 shots of his rocket launcher next we move on to the demo man this class can be helpful in multiple situations its stickybomb launcher can be used to set traps for enemy pushes and its grenade launcher deals a very large amount of damage this can be used as a very defensive class or offensive class now we move onto the medic this class pretty much is self explanatory it heals other team mates but were talking about tf2 so nothing is that simple after a majority of time of healing other players the medic will gain a power called ubercharge the ubercharge can be used once to make 1 person on your team invulnerable or about 7 seconds when used with the heavy this is a very effective way of pushing the enemy backwards last but not least we have the heavy the face of valve the heavys primary weapon is a mini gun the mini gun deals a very large amount of damage output the amount of damage gave off by a weapon combined with a medic a heavy become a very offensive class when a medic has a ubercharge it would most likely charge the heavy as the heavy becomes a indestructible tank this game has very balanced team game play and urges you to be a team player i highly recommend this game

one of the best games ive ever played 46 stars

after playing about 300 hours on tf2 for the past few months i can say that this is a very fun gameand im not even a gamer tf2 isnt your average fps and thats what makes it unique its quite balanced with tons of different and unique weapons not to mention loads of hatscosmtics and tauntswhich is a thing ive never seen in any other game and are pretty awesome what attracted me to the game were the trailers made by valve and how they brought so much character into each class and after that they grew on me i really enjoy the crafting and trading but what i really enjoy is how much more the game is besides playing the main game modescontrol point payload mvm and king of the hilland that the community has managed to make its ownprop hunt slender death run randomizer versus saxton hale ect there isnt much i dislike about the game besides the frequant confrontation with immature and roudy people under the age of 15 if youre looking forward to getting into trading be sure to check sites like backpacktf or tradetf for the pricing list its very helpful  love it love this game

recommended
great game many hours on it with endless fun i reccomed it if youre looking for comedy guns and fun another great thing is that they focused into every characters personality there traits characteristics and weapons as you play more you build skill earn acheivements and express your personality by putting on cosmeticsclothes another thing you should note is the community they are usually nice and respect and try to help you in summary i reccomend this silly game to new players and expeirenced for entertainment

tldr at the end it was 2011 i had been wandering around best buy when i saw a box case for team fortress 2 for 10 dollars i wondered why they would be selling the same minimalist game i played on the orange box on my xbox so i wandered over to the computer section of the store and looked up why someone would buy it on pc i found that the pc version had more than the 10 maps on the xbox version it had differnt weapons to pick from and hats too i thought oh what the hell and got the game i came home to set it up on my old cruddy toshiba laptop and as a result caused me to create a steam account but it couldnt hande it so i used my brothers laptop whenever he wasnt using it i fell in love instantly the multitudes of gamemodes the custom maps and many achievements to get and i was an achievement addict back then thanks to my xbox kept me entertained my brother got a virus on his computer and blames the custom maps i downloaded because of it to this day im not sure if it was the cause so he didnt let me use it anymore almost a year later it was early 2012 somehow i convinced my brother to play on his computer again when i found out that a few months earlier the game became free to play a ton of my friends began playing it which made it appealing again when i came back though everything was about trading not many went to achievement servers anymore there were spreadsheets and things that used to be worth very little buds were 2 keys and bills were 1 were now jacked up in price i got used to it though and adapted to become a good trader i even met a guy who i called my partner and we worked together to trade our way up and it worked we got a fireproof diary which i still dont know what it does out of pyromania despite me finding the deal he wanted to hold on to it and around that time i felt him becoming more hostile i was kind of afraid to ask him to much out of fear that he would run off with the whole thing and despite my pleads in saying that it would probably triple in value soon it only doubled but i was still kind of right he decided to sell it anyway and because of my conversations with him being too cautious he only gave me 25%  5 keys out of 20 and i couldnt really do much about it i was angry so i created a scheme in which i created a fake account and pretended i had some crazy amount to offer him in a spycrab look it up if you dont know what it is and knowing him he said he had an equal amount which he didnt i got lucky and i won it and just like i thought he changed his name and did a bunch of other things to hide himself i then used a new fake account which i pretended was a steam admin of something like that and told him when he was reported for the spycrab i investigated and found that the bud he used to have was duped look that up too he practically bribed me to keep quiet and i got back a good share of what was mine he still doesnt know i did this to this day i lost my tf2 privalages again until late 2013 this year when i got my own computer and this was the best time of all for me from all my previous trading i had a ton of items which raised in value while i was away i decided as i didnt need most of it to do giveaways in different servers one server in particular sodahappy i met a kind admin still good friends with who helped me do some giveaways using his admin powers this influenced me to join the community and become a moderator so i could do giveways for a while it was fun people didnt do the giveaways for only free stuff but for the fun minigames it had such as one where everyone was locked in a small room and had to try and run away while i used a zap function which killed them if i pressed a button while aiming at them but then problems started to occur my giveaways started to become out of hand as everyone was doing them people no longer cared for the game than the prize and i got in trouble with the higher up admins because of the amount of zaps  i had 2800 zaps in the 4 months i was a mod other mods had no more than 100 in their entire careers after explaing that issue and a few others i was restricted in giveaways and over time i got less enthusiastic with it i left sodahappy but i left with a ton of new and good friends on my side who i met through the server in the recent months i focused on getting my dream unusual which i wanted long since before free to play was a thing a texas ten gallon painted gold that was vivid plasma and level 3 or 33 favorite hat favorite paint favorite effect and if you look at my name you can see why the level after borrowing an entire bud from that admin mentioned above from sodahappy the first one i met i purchased the hat for 35 buds with some extra sweets while it was only worth 25 this was because the owner was super reluctant to give it up but i needed it for its level 33 after paying off the 1 bud debt i felt complete i had a ton of tf2 stuff including my dream hat and i felt it was time to move on so i gave a lot of my stuff away and stopped playing tf2 revisiting occasionally summarytldr tf2 is my most played game of all time and i kind of grew up with it and if i could go back and change anything i wouldnt maybe except for that  scamming me as much as it makes me sound like a nerd tf2 represents a chapter of my life and i wont soon forget it

probably in the top 10 for my favorite games of all time easily so many modes some fun mods well structured classes with their own deep backstories humorous not to mention that the balance and diversity of weapons is great no overpowered weapons trading in this game adds a whole new dimension for some people i dont trade for profit anymore why not give it a shot its free if you take a liking to it i would highly reccommend going premium i didnt go premium until i hit 200 hours though it was definetly worth the 49 cent investment definetly i later went on to play competitive tf2 which i found increasingly fun compared to the pubs in which i was dominating the rest of the server i think valve should add a match making rank system in tf2 it would really help the game garner more attention as an esport i think the problem is that with out these built in features few people know about competitive at all plz valve plz due to the rumors of tf2 matchmaking my rating of tf2 has been boosted to a mango out of a melon

team fortress 2 is a follower of the team fortress classic game the game itself is very unique both in artstyle and its miscellaneous functionalities i wouldnt say this game is original though weve seen fighting games where you can fight between 2 teams and pick characters etc however the extras included in this game are awesome the items the trading the character design etc i wouldnt doubt that this game would be of interest to you because the game is very accepted and very popular which theres no doubt about but overall this is just team fortress 2  theres not really any other way to explain the game properly id advice you to buy this game if you like coming home from work or school and just leaving it on the shelf while you play this game because youll completely forget about it  which can be both good and bad at the same time story 610 soundtrack 610 atmosphere 410 scenery 610 characters 810 graphics 710 overall 6510 unique but also not unique
recommended
so much fun when you start you may not like it but when you start to go into trading and such you will be attached to this game like feces on the side of a toilet as in it will stick to you until you figure out how to stop

before i got into the fandom ive been seeing my friends playing this game and talking about the game for a year so i was curious and now that ive tried it it is indeed fun xdddd what team fortress 2 is all about pootis spam e conga hats cosmetics item drops backcapping spies friendlies tryhards crates keys buds trade aimbots hackers pros n00bs gibus hat pyrovision achievement servers kids players who has no idea what theyre doing other fandoms fans sprays spawn camp idle rich people f2p p2p taunts humor glitch abusers voice spammers voice chat spammers spycheck friendly fire shippers lag  and many more tf2 never fails to enlighten and entertain me xddd best fps game
recommended
this is a very good game with cartoony graphics and tons and tons of hours of fun it is one of the best fps games i have ever played in my life the big thing in tf2 is hats it mays sound weird but everyone wants as much as possible so if youre new get premium immiediatly and get going with hats 
recommended
i enjoy almost every minute of it unfortunately the economy is falling and needs a fix also to many aggressive people are joining the game and ruining the fun otherwise gameplay is great
recommended
its free you get free hats weapons more hats taunts another update with even more hats new weapons wait for a new update more hats a map more miscs and that is tf2 updates in a nutshell 1010 would play it for 800 hours again
recommended
a good game and more hats
recommended
for a free game this is incredibly brilliant theres much to do even if it does get repetitive overtime all the drop items and achievements make it good to go back to in times of boredom a minor issue i shall complain about is the lack of inventory space for non premium accounts i did experience this issue myself but i have upgraded by now with no regrets a brilliant game which i would highly recommend to anybody who asked keep with the good stuff valve
recommended
this game is seriously one of the best games i have ever playedperiod the unique artstyle helps set it away from generic shooters like cod or battlefield and makes it addicting with the collectible hats and guns plus the 9 classes are extremely different and diverseness makes for a fun time with the amazing content patches events and great weapon ideas in the steam workshop this game is insane so what are you doing reading my review play the game god damnit
recommended
this game is so cool
recommended
very fun game i enjoy the fact that valve is constantly changing the game and fixing the bugs
recommended
only played a few hours but its great fun  never been irritated by the game at all as long as you can run it smoothly this game is a breeze the different classes are so much fun to play and easy to learn if youre willing to put your mind to them trading is still a thing but as always be careful with the waves of scammers buzzing around your high value items if you have any of the sort have fun with this game ps its f2p  robbie

this game is an awesome fps game one of my favourites it is probably the best freetoplay multiplayer game and i really like it because there is a lot of skill involved so theres always something new to learn or get better at
recommended
a giant multiplayer game with tons of things to do and dicover this is not like your ordinaery shooter no this is team fortress 2 work together closely with other classes and find a balance in your team to what is possible and what isnt pyros best tactic isnt walking forward while firing rather airblast the enemy and use your shotgun gets them every time soldiers rocket can do splash damage so they hit more while hitting the ground the community is also rather fun to play with since there are plenty of nice people recommended for anyone age 12
recommended
you need to play it belive it

crafted two wooden bats and got metal 1010
recommended
amazing game whoever doesnt play this should
recommended
my oppinion of a first person shooter done right this game has so much going for it the levels are well designed and fun to play on all 9 of the classes are unique and balance well each class has its own niche and weakness controls are smooth and easy to pick up even for a person new to the fps genre the comunity has an empesis on creativity with a workshop mod maps character custimization both cosmetics and weapon loadouts trading and much more finaly this game has something that no fps has had in a long time as sense of humor and presonality mostly stemming from the characters unique personas and how they interact with eachother
recommended
blew a 8 year old up then killed his m8 1110 it sucks ign

this game is amazing the weapons are unique the game modes are fun and exciting and overall its a very fun game i especially appreciate the fact that while there is an ingame store the game is not paytowin like most games nowadays by this i mean the weapon drop system for those of you who dont know what i mean there is a function in the game that at random times while playing you can find a random weapon or item this means that certain weapons arent restricted to paying players it allows freetoplay players enjoy all the awesome weapons paying players get theres also a lot of really cool functions and taunts to the game and an underlying sense of humor that makes the game overall extremely fun to play and sure it has its glitches and problems aghermghermgabenewallaghermgherm but if you look past it tf2 is an amazing game and i think that almost anyone can find enjoyment in it the only problem i have with it minisentries nerf them now valve drop what youre doing and nerf minisentries right now gibuspride pyrofolife

recommended
this game reminds me of my bathtub in my opra house
recommended
valves team fortress 2 is quite different from most multiplayer games that come out these days first of all the balance of this game is excellent seriously out of all the classes the only one which comes even close to being overpowered and unbalanced is the pyro which is terrible at long range so probably that evens out secondly the humour and the classes are enough to keep anybody entertained there are 9 classes in the game and each one has their own unique personality and traits i definitely recommend this game if you havent played it yet do so right now its free to play but i had bought it when orange box came out
recommended
an easy way to get rich on steam its fun as well as competetive
recommended
its a good game
recommended
a great and simply amazing game if u dont have it u need to get it
recommended
its a great game and you should get it
recommended
easily one of the best first person shooters both f2p wise and in general very balanced and very fun

good game to play but there will be annoying people on there
recommended
team fortress 2 is a very good game but some times can get a bet laggyall the class are wellbalenced and all the different weapons adds vaiarity to the gameits free for the most partso theres no reason not to own this
recommended
its an verry awesome game i recome it for everbody d
recommended
action packed crazy cartoon fun i would reccomend this game to anyone looking for comedy guns and gore the community is great the weapons are great the hats are halarious 710
recommended
very good game 1010 i recommend this game it is very fun when playing with friends you can still have fun by yourself though
recommended
its a awesome and addicting first person shooter game it can take some time to learn but its really worth a try 
recommended
this game is really good because you can play in many varying ways as a spy you could be sneaky if you like to be a support you could always play as a medic and heal injured teammates if you wanna be a bit tanky though you will probably need a medic to be in the frontlines of a fight you could play as a heavy and kill everybody with your minigun if you like being fast and capture points and the intelligence fast you will be playing as the scout theres other classes such as sniper pyro soldier demoman and engineer another great thing is that you can find new weapons to play differently definitely recommend hell i would give the game 1010
recommended
best game ever it might seem at first hard because you only have the basic gear and all that and it might seem to be a pay2win kinda game but trust me it aint pay2win
recommended
great shooter original art style and great gameplay also free there is no reason why you should not have this game

literally my favorite shooter of all time the game never gets old the community is astounding the characters are wellwritten and the gameplay is always fun there are those that think tf2 is dead or all the people online are just sitting around trading if you are one of those people please direct your attention to httpstoresteampoweredcomstats httptf2centercom httpwwwtf2pugme httpwwwugcleaguecom httpswwwredditcomrtf2 httpswwwredditcomrtruetf2 and multiple other sites i have heard people call tf2 pay 2 win and that is simply not true actually a good chunk of the time the stock weapons are better than weapons you get from dropscratesetc the weapons you can buy from the store can also come as drops be purchased cheaply through trading through sites like scraptf we are talking 2 weapons for 1 scrap which is worth no more than 3 cents or traded from friends or players in game those strangekillstreakunusual items you get from crates those properties are purely cosmetic and give you absolutely no benefit in game yes tf2 can be competitive as well just because its a silly game does not mean it cant be competitive tf2 is possibly the most balanced game i have ever played with a few exceptions cough lochnload cough these exceptions are usually banned in competitive via whitelists to make the gameplay fair for everybody every classweapon has a counter while its true tf2 trading is dying out because of players moving to csgo trading the game itself is not even close to dead tf2 has not been abandoned by valve as a matter of fact an alien invasion update will be upon us shortly and no thats not conspiracy this is the same way valve lead up to the mvm update which you can learn about here  thats not including the upcoming spy vs engineer update i can wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone who has not tried it as it is a fantastic game and a great mulitplayer experience

do you like call of duty do you like realistic generic shooters well  you because this is team fortress 2 this game is a blast and throws everything you thought you knew about an fps out the window and s you so hard that you will never be rid of it so overall  it its pretty good should you get it of course
recommended
why havent i written a review for this yet onwards to the only game in history where your friends might be your enemies people yell at a failed doctor german man to help them though they never help him a large russian man throws sandwiches and lunch meats at you to heal your wounds a sneaky croissant screws his watch up to turn him invisible and forgets he has a son in the process a boston boy breaks his own legs jumping too many times and hunts down said sneaky baguette for loving his mother a confused american finds a rocket launcher and goes mad fire thing a texan with a phd builds machines to heal and hurt everything an angry australian man urinates into bottles and throws them at his enemies before opening fire and an intoxicated africanamericanscottish cyclops manages to get a hold of a grenade launcher and hats 100100
recommended
this game is amazing even though the hat prices in the mannco store might bust ur wallet there is always the community market and backpacktf gameplay is amazing the classes depend on each other making you feel like a team and doing your part well cause its team fortress 2 not hero fortess 2 pub servers are good but if you want to have a greater challenge play in lobby servers or highlander servers but there are some downfalls in this amazing game the derped players mostly  medics are the bane of your good time cause they will only heal one guy and ignore you while your burning and dying anyway this game is amazing for what it is each class is unique and fresh if you never played this game your missing out

had it sitting in my library for at least a year having originally barely played it two hours not really knowing what i was doing until recently where i was looking for a casual and fun game to help get someone into gaming decided to try and see if this game would work and long story short they love it and im shocked at how much theyve been playing it im even quite addicted at this point too needless to say the game is great and i wish i had given it some attention sooner
recommended
tf2 an amazing shooter for its age and the first shooter that i have competitively played sadly the competitive communtity is not really big and it is all community based and not greatly supported by the publishers it offers a really interesting gameplay with the 9 classes that are available a great fun for the casual gamer aswell as the player searching for competitive experience despite the fact that it is older than 7 years valve still puts some time into making updates for this game although most of them just feature items and no game changing content it was a good time bye bye tf2
recommended
wonderful game with 9 great classes the class that dies as fast as it runs  the scout the class that everyone can learn in 5 minutes  the soldier the class that doesnt need to aim to get kills  the pyro the class that blows everything up including itself  the demoman the class that doesnt need to play to get kills  the engi the class that noone likes to play and noone loves  the heavy the class that noone likes to play but everyone loves  the medic the class that everyone plays and noone loves  the sniper the other class that everyone plays and noone loves  the spy the rest is hats buy them

game team fortress 2  genre fps action hatwearing simulator  rating      55  favorable aspects back in 2007 when it was released not a lot of people had knowledge about this nowadays masterpiece prefering to play games such as cs and its mods but what did tf2 have that none other game at the time could achieve well we can point out many reasons but ill only detach two game experience and simple gameplay combine a cartoon graphics fps game with lots of classes funny characters and objectives then youll get a different gamestyle everytime you join a match i wont extend it because pratically every decent fps gamer shouldve already played it or at least took a look just ask around  negative aspects as every work has its weak spots it couldnt be different with tf2 to summarize the addition of hats along with all the cosmetic items brought good and bad effects the good specially for valve you can customize your character outfit the way you like it for a price of course the bad is the unequal proportion between cosmetic and weapon updates since they introduce a lot more cosmetic items than weapons besides it was spent enough time to produce a new team fortress title  how much is it worth to pay [] full price [ ] 75% [ ] 50% or less  fortunately its a free to play game since a 2011 update
recommended
this is a highly addictive game with t physics and is tons of fun it also is a game of skill and new players are recommended not to play pyro or snipar for new pyros dont know how to airblast and if u main snipar its all ogre nao
recommended
cant get enough of hat simulator
recommended
amazing game great variety ingame store and items all around epic action the only problem is getting everyone to work as a team to win too many cod players and people who dont care come on here and play like they are the best of all time and f2p freetoplay racism is super thick on alot of servers if you can manage that though this is worth every penny
recommended
its ok seriously ive become cynical after all these hours wasted this game isnt really worth it anymore the competitve scene is dying and the community is just ew wait for the next big thing or wait until competitive matchmaking is a thing but then its gonna be overrun by hackers and pub scrubs
recommended
you honestly cannot beat tf2 good olf fashioned fps fun
recommended
tf2 is a balanced fun game that has given me allot of joy over the past year its class based gameplay and fun fastpaced combat never ceases to entertain me and with the seemingly neverending stream of content valve is continuing to produce along with the already phenomenally designed maps it doesnt show any sign of getting stale any time soon
recommended
team fortress 2 is a great free to play game that i enjoy espeacially when my friends play it with me
recommended
awsome game

around 2008 i had this free weekend that completely changed my life first i had seen this game in a lan where a colleague was playing and that was magical he exploded a couple of guys with a single stick and then just posed in a comic fashion as their bodyparts landed on the ground i knew i had to play that game and so i did played at first in a free weekend then bought the retail game and had loads of fun since then at first there were no items only the comic characters and as the time passed by valve included 3 basic items for most classes and what really changed my life hats[b][i]
recommended
good game so awsome best multiplayer good hats good updates and good weapons so everyone on steam should play this game super awsome
recommended
congaed past a sentry and died 1010 would conga again

if you like first person shooters hats and fun in general this is for sure the best game you can get
recommended
this is a must play for any who truly think they are a good 1st person shooter
recommended
fine game not the game id spend like 2500 hours on
recommended
a game that has everything most other games havent like holy macarels and 9 half  crazed characters who have developed their own ways of killing eachother but really its a great game and the comics are almost better 1010 would get killed by a jar of piss and a cow mangler again
recommended
i havent play it that much but its alright
recommended
please download this game you wont find any other hat simulator 2 here
recommended
a well balanced not p2w enticing awesome fabulous extraordinary and the most unique fps experience one can have
recommended
its fun play it
recommended
tf2 is the only first person shooter that i can play it has a few balance quirks as of right now but aside from that an incredibly fun game from the perspective of someone whos always hated first person shooters with a fury
recommended
great game but need more weapon
recommended
i highly recommend this game who are new to steam and its fun to play only problems that i have with this game is the amount of squeakers who ruin the fun by screaming and whining another is that people rage easily when killed or dominated it can be fun at times but can get annoying later other than that the game is good
recommended
silly review i tried quitting this game after hundreds of hours turns out i just took a break serious review its an amazing fps game with heavy emphasis on mobility and teamwork there are various game modes and 9 classes with strengths and weaknesses meaning you have to work together you could do almost a chart that shows who trumps who naturally speaking any class can take any class if there is enough skill such as spy trumps sniper trumps pyro trumps spy going back to mobility if you pick this game up now i suggest heavily you learn mechanics of the game such as rocket jumping even as the slowest classes ex heavy you never want to stop moving meaning there is more skill than just shoot thing with gun along side this is the abundance of weapons and gamemodes meaning that if you ever get a feeling the game is growing stale just mix it up a bit and its almost a whole new game if all else fails there are various usermade gamemodes such as vs saxton hale to keep you entertained and despite its age this game looks really good and each character has amazing personality giving a great sense in charm something that lacks in the majority of fps games consider the age of this game and that its still a heavily played game you can see that its worth playing in terms of issues though there are some problems such as some slightly unbalanced weapons though this makes up a minority of them this game is also at this point largely playermade as well the majority of servers arent even owned by valve and most added content are supplied by players overall great game worth playing and getting addicted to but do not expect your everday shooter
recommended
yes is very fun and lots of fun players around but i have this one problem that really fustrated and you better see this valve the one most major problem are accuracy there are some classes that when you shoot is doesnt even register same with some melee too like the sniper i totally headshot a person sometimes is bodyshot fine with that but again when i do it it doesnt even register when i totally aim right in the head now there the melee the market gardener sometimes is work fine but sometimes when i slap a person it doesnt register and i can tell i hit that person because it made the sound when the market gardener hit same with the pan it made that annoying sound but funny sound when i hit someone but is doesnt register the damage valve please fix this
recommended
you should play it its fun very fun i just want this badge
recommended
nice very nice mvm is best fighting robots because you being hero on last wave
recommended
i love this game
recommended
this game is the best ever
recommended
its ok
recommended
the most awesomeness game ever made since its team fortress classic debut go play it
recommended
i liked the amount of friendly players who would conga whenever you did p
recommended
you can buy hats and you can put them on your head 1010
recommended
team fortress 2 is the best classbased combat game out there the game requires you to take responsibility for playing a class when they are badly needed example a defending team is made up of mostly snipers and spies and the attacking team is advancing quickly what you as a player should do is take up the role of a good defense class like engineer to fill the gap created by team members in other words an effective player should be able to adapt to any situation based on how their team is performing i am not alone in saying that this is a feature that makes the game great along with some other unique features like hilarious characters gameplay different acquirable items that can drastically change the way you play unique gamemodes and of course hats for gods sake its free nothing should be stopping you from getting this game
recommended
team fortress 2 more like hat fortress 2 it is a firstperson shooter game with 9 classes for you to choose and a ton of weapons for you to try out the game is also about making profit like selling hats weapons miscs and more what i think about this game it is very adicting you just cant stop playing the game all its funny memes its fun gameplay like mvm ctf cp etc i wish i could make a game similar to this
recommended
is rly gud
recommended
really great game 910 some of the best updates scream fortress iv scream fortress v mvm smismass  love and war this game is really amazing even though valve slacked with updates in 2014 i would advise you get this game edit played deathrun lord gaben ate me 1110

recommended
my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here
recommended
oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

i highly recommend this game who are new to steam and its fun to play only problems that i have with this game is the amount of squeakers who ruin the fun by screaming and whining another is that people rage easily when killed or dominated it can be fun at times but can get annoying later other than that the game is good

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

tf2 is the only first person shooter that i can play it has a few balance quirks as of right now but aside from that an incredibly fun game from the perspective of someone whos always hated first person shooters with a fury
recommended
its fun play it
recommended
yes is very fun and lots of fun players around but i have this one problem that really fustrated and you better see this valve the one most major problem are accuracy there are some classes that when you shoot is doesnt even register same with some melee too like the sniper i totally headshot a person sometimes is bodyshot fine with that but again when i do it it doesnt even register when i totally aim right in the head now there the melee the market gardener sometimes is work fine but sometimes when i slap a person it doesnt register and i can tell i hit that person because it made the sound when the market gardener hit same with the pan it made that annoying sound but funny sound when i hit someone but is doesnt register the damage valve please fix this
recommended
tis game is good
recommended
so much fun when you start you may not like it but when you start to go into trading and such you will be attached to this game like feces on the side of a toilet as in it will stick to you until you figure out how to stop

for a free game this is incredibly brilliant theres much to do even if it does get repetitive overtime all the drop items and achievements make it good to go back to in times of boredom a minor issue i shall complain about is the lack of inventory space for non premium accounts i did experience this issue myself but i have upgraded by now with no regrets a brilliant game which i would highly recommend to anybody who asked keep with the good stuff valve
recommended
a very very very very very good game
recommended
one of the best first person shooters ive ever seen and theres tons of things to do theres different tactics you can customize your loadout and what he looks like and what weapons he uses buy items from the market located in the community tab also be careful not to get addicted to buying things i learned that the hard way buy items from the tf2 store located in tf2 but be warned you get much better deals from the market you can have bragging rights from murdering your friends and taunting at the freezecam play mvm mann vs machine and kill lots and lots of robots and all of this i mean once you play this youll be wondering why is this free

great game nuff said

now anyone who recommends team fortress is going to focus on one thing hats im going to be different and try not to team fortress 2 is an excellent pick up and rock out with your  out shooter whether its some meaty payload or a brief trip down point capture lane youre going to be having the time of your life i play heavy a lot and my favourite thing about playing heavy is screaming gutterally at people over my mic as i mow them down with my bromedic in tow the number of things you can do in team fortress 2 is limitless from shooting people to hats okay you can collect hats its a hat simulator i have lots of hats and i dye them all orange because im a ginger hats want to wear some devil horns and show all the boys what a naughty little pyro you are go ahead buy the hat want to unleash your inner killer and don a rambo hat and ram your fist up the bumholes of unsuspecting scouts go ahead buy the hat hats hats hats hats hat simulator 2 buy it
recommended
team fortress 2 is the best game ive ever played over the last one and a half years ive clocked up 800 hours on badwater and upward this game isn`t like csgo it have it`s features a lot a people say that the main tf2 problem is a hats i thinks so too but i personally think that the main tf2 problem is a hackers imagine a kid which has just installed tf2 he can`t kill anyone he`s dying a lot  this infuriates him the only way he sees is a getting a hack to get better while playing this game i understand what is a teamwork so i`ll forever remember the time that i spend on this outstanding addictive and fun game
recommended
this game was the greatest multiplayer fps ever but now valve has turned it into their money printing machine squeezing an insane amount of bucks out of people for useless or game disturbing items do not buy this game you will end up spending nights on tradeservers and writing recommendations to get virtual items op

had it sitting in my library for at least a year having originally barely played it two hours not really knowing what i was doing until recently where i was looking for a casual and fun game to help get someone into gaming decided to try and see if this game would work and long story short they love it and im shocked at how much theyve been playing it im even quite addicted at this point too needless to say the game is great and i wish i had given it some attention sooner
recommended
tf2 an amazing shooter for its age and the first shooter that i have competitively played sadly the competitive communtity is not really big and it is all community based and not greatly supported by the publishers it offers a really interesting gameplay with the 9 classes that are available a great fun for the casual gamer aswell as the player searching for competitive experience despite the fact that it is older than 7 years valve still puts some time into making updates for this game although most of them just feature items and no game changing content it was a good time bye bye tf2
recommended
a bit confusing for new players but a really fun game lots of werid weapons to play around with but its basically i hatcongatrade simulator but still a good game comp is fun as well
recommended
pretty good game blokes best quickscope simulator ive played in years
recommended
things i like about tf2  first off the gameplay is amazing as there are 9 different classes with really different play styles in tf2 its not like cod where most people just go yolo rambo around tf2 is a game that requires teamwork thats why they put in a medic class things i dislike about tf2  first off just because the guy who keeps headshoting you wears a gibus does not mean he is hacking i have come to a point where i really dislike f2p accused of hacks just because they are f2p sure some of them do but dont always accuse unless you have proof and so what if you have alot of good items and cosmetics that does not make you a good player
recommended
wonderful game with 9 great classes the class that dies as fast as it runs  the scout the class that everyone can learn in 5 minutes  the soldier the class that doesnt need to aim to get kills  the pyro the class that blows everything up including itself  the demoman the class that doesnt need to play to get kills  the engi the class that noone likes to play and noone loves  the heavy the class that noone likes to play but everyone loves  the medic the class that everyone plays and noone loves  the sniper the other class that everyone plays and noone loves  the spy the rest is hats buy them
recommended
no2 in my top 5 games of all time with great almost balanced classes fun gameplay infinitely high skill ceiling and so many god damn hats its hard not to enjoy tf2 and its free so why wouldnt you besides you cant deny that a game is doing something right when it still has it hooks in you even after 600 hours of game time well done valve
recommended
awesome game must play it
recommended
its okay
recommended
this is the best game when you start play you cant stop it isnt p2w game but it is nice to buy a keys with money and trade them for hats misc outfits weapons and unusuals the trade in tf2 is really fun you can play f2p you dont must buy stuff you can get it in drops have in this game a drop weapons and you dont must to buy them you can craft them but you can trade them for a scrap or other weapons play this game classic funny and good game

fps shooter games have been spread out around the world becoming popular but when it comes to tf2 its like no other its simply made and easy to play just like the way its made its different every day with new things to do with new updates including taunts cosmetics and loads more building up the game what makes tf2 a unique game apart from cod and bf is that its not as big as those games well ofcourse it has loads of stuff but not as sophisticated as the other fps shooters it does not have singleplayer not that extreme graphics and including other more features that other games have and not tf2 but not having features like cod or bf makes it better and unique not worse and more repetitive therefore when cod or bf players try tf2 for the first time they dont really understand the concept of the game which explains the game is unique overall tf2 is an addictive and unique game with lots to discover hoping the game gets better 1010
recommended
like this game 
recommended
this is a really great game because this game is relativly old this f2p is getting constantly updated for new things to come the game has 9 classes that make the game more interesting since all have thier own play style and all can be mastered thier are many weapons to keep the gameplay interesting this game has been able to hold up with hackers trolls and even cheaters witch not many games cant the game has been able to hold up for 7 years i think so yes in my opinion this is one of the classics and i will never forget my experience in tf2 d

you probably know what this game is lets be honest everyone has probably heard of team fortress 2 the moment they got on steam team fortress 2 is a freetoplay shooter with a cartoony art style and an unusual way of playing that sets it apart from other shooters in team fortress 2 there are 9 classes each with its weaknesses and advantages along with the basic shooting classes have their own unique abilities that help on the battlefield however this game is not only famous for the click & shoot it has one of the most interesting and complicated economy that i enjoy to participate in you can work your way up to be able trade ingame items for actual steam games this game also doesnt tax your machine and even on low settings is lovable with its computerfriendly artstyle even though its been released a long time ago team fortress 2 still maintains its freshness and uniqueness

my hours help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life i was young and didnt really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really bad pc which i still own tf2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more fun games i installed i met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side the community back then was more humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunnygross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game when really it doesnt even matter if you win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way although you never know what kinda person youre going to meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the mann vs machine coop i mainly play that now although to me the game lost its touch update wise and i moved onto other games i believe its worth a shot to try it out but other than that id keep it as a casual game i dont think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because its being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 4 years of playing it just got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it youll be more stressed than actually having fun ill tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its touch and probably isnt worth making it your main game mainly because the updates theyve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but its a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun all youll really notice nowdays ispeople really love to trade more than actually play living off as a free to play would be very tough and youd need to be patient with items you would want unless you got that money hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is bad in any way i am saying that its worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you wont like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards the community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because its nothing to be big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have fun <3

can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

if you bind forward to a button on your mouse you can play pyro and eat at the same time

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

oh and if youre wondering the new update gun mettle did not ruin tf2 for me i actually find it a lot more fun now i think jerma summed up this game pretty nicely maybe you got like two pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago they dont have any hats theyre spraying  and theyre having a blast they might even be at the wrong point they might be going backwards to the point thats already been capped on the same team theres a scout with a hales own scattergun hes got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak he just got 18 hes going i just got 18 sick he runs up the stairs hes trying his  off hes get beeping noises dodging the oh the sentry almost got me he looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on gorge and theres two sandwich heavies having a ing picnic so he stops for a second and goes two nnnggh so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldiers rocket next door the two sandwich heavies then decide to move their picnic theres ants theres ants here honey i wanna get out of here so they get up they pack their sandwiches pack up their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the  theyre eating they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think that spot near the a point for red is pretty good they walk out the door and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them they get shot a million times and blow up and theres like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions the blu scout at this point respawns and walks by the at least 34 statues because we all know theres four people afk when you play this game you go by the museum of people standing still he walks out the door and readies his weapon hes ready im going to get another 20 killstreak just you watch gaben im going to praise gaben and he goes forward and starts shooting and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds normally when i do reviews i turn into a critic and start to examine that game pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score however team fortress 2 or tf2 for short helped me make so many memories that if i actually tried to make a fair review on it it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review team fortress 2 is obviously an amazing game the teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult you need teammates in order to survive and win the graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game im not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot i love this game because of its charm the game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters you cant help to love all of them at some point scout is cocky and overconfident spy another one of the characters in the game is technically scouts father soldier is a crazed wwii american patriot he never actually joined the army but instead he had his own personal nazi killing spree his roommate was a magician named merasmus who grew to hate soldier pyro is mysterious but portrays the world as one big happy paradise known as pyroland demoman is a scottish alcoholic who due to merasmus lost his eye that is now haunted heavy although he appears to be dimwitted is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters engineer is very intelligent as well and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with red and blu continue medic isnt fond of normal forms of medicine but is still an important member nonetheless sniper is from new zealand but was raised in australia he prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to supermans spy is the master of disguise and is technically scouts father as said before of all the characters he appears to be the most mature and appears to be the ringleader at many times not only that but the game has an interesting story i would not like to get too detailed with it however it makes little to no sense but is still funny engaging and gives tf2 much more depth there is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where mann co is being attacked so the mercenaries have to defend it called mann vs machine this game mode ties in with the tf comics which explain many characters backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review the other comics all of which can be found on tf2s official website are all funny and charming in their own way as well the community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times but in the end its still an overall great community ive seen people give out stuff others mentor some of the newbs something i do as well along with much much more yes the game is considered a paytowin game but it isnt necessarily a paytowin game with lots of patience you will get what you want from the game whether it be hats weapons or whatever it is you want the game has a learning curve that isnt too steep but become dedicated and youll fall in love with it no matter how many times you rage to a wm1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak or cheer when you unbox an unusual or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things team fortress 2 has been a huge part of my pc gaming life and without it i would be as bored as hell i cannot recommend this game enough and i hope that many more memories are made on here valve may be cash cows but you cant help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games portal halflife 2 counterstrike but this game stands out from the rest to me do i recommend this game yes yes yes yes

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

quick review oh goodness i havent reviewed team fortress 2 yet designed by valve corporation in 2007 but never really lost popularity team fortress 2 is a first person shooter which embraces its cartoon design to such an extreme that its comical there are community events guildsclans that are dedicated to playing tons of achievements to earn nine different classes team fortress 2 is fun to play causally or if you really get sucked into the game you can spend many hours playing it detailed breakdown review story the story is the same every game its red vs blue  if youd like more story id recommend watching all the meet the ______ class videos the spy pyro heavy who am i kidding each class video is hilarious and you should watch them anyway game play there are nine classes scout soldiers pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and spy each class has its own unique play style if you want to know more there are plenty of guides out there to explain how to play each one respectively and doesnt have a place in this review the game controls and plays like a first person shooter you have different weapons based on your class you always have a melee weapon a primary and secondary gunweapon which you can change in your loadout  then some accessories to make your character look uniquedifferentstupidfunnyuglyannoyingcrazy one final thing worth note is that this game never seems to go out of style until theres a team fortress 3 which we all know valve cant count that high team fortress 2 has stayed one of the top 10 games played on steam since the time i got my steam account until today 052315 currently there are 79860 people playing it and its not even peak time achievements team fortress 2 has 513 achievements there are achievements for specific levelsmatches each class and certain community events halloween christmas etc  there are many achievements i havent seen anyone that has earned them all legitimately many people hack their achievements to get unlockables price team fortress 2 is now free to play theyve made so much money on hats that everyone can have the game for free but need to buy hats this was one of the first games i had on my steam account i purchased the orange box and got this game with that purchase since its free to play you can certainly try this game whenever youd like but theres a good chance you already know if you want to play it or not thanks for taking the time to read my review anyway p conclusion i recommend this game for pretty much anyone not everyone will latch onto the game and play it for thousands of hours but many will at least get 10 hours of entertainment out of the game however beware the allure of team hat fortress 2 references team fortress 2 official website 2015 url httpwwwteamfortresscomindexphp steam stats 2015 url httpstoresteampoweredcomstats class loadout 2013 url httpiimgurcomuz66fadpng team fortress 2 on steam 2015 url httpstoresteampoweredcomapp440

recommended
its good
recommended
this game is hours of great fun but the community has suffered a bit since it became f2p i have played team fortress 2 for more than 700 hours and i still play it regularly
recommended
team fortress 2 has easily got to be one of my all time favourite first person shooters and thats just from only playing it for a few months the fantastically balanced and nonlinear gameplay with its great sense of humour cartoon art style loads of constantly added new content and vast variety of game modes maps and play styles make team fortress 2 a consistently delivering and satisfying first person shooter experience like no other gabe it definitely was worth it
recommended
the best american first person shooter and hat wearing simulator 2015 congrats valve now could you count to three
recommended
it may feel at first its borring but give it a try it will make you play and play more and more rip gunslinger glitchbug 20122015 must fun is to play with friends dont have any friends you gonna get some friends in tf2 for sure
recommended
one of the best freetoplay games ever in history pros and cons very nice and balanced gameplay smooth and very cartoony gameplay great variety of mapsweapons and gamemodes has a trading community you can actually earn money from this game amazing community alot of serversgroupscommunities and others a game that has cosmetics and hats pimp up your character and make him look good balanced and different gameplay styles of other classes cons  tf2 economy is dying down real quick i think thats the only con oh wait too many god damn hats theres another big one well thx for reading
recommended
team based gameplay mostly revolving around snipers and snappy people with microphones good community nice people aside from the snappy ones would recommend
recommended
what can i say i collect hats for a living oh and occasionally play payload
recommended
gaben why have you made me pour so much money in this game fantastic f2p model balanced gameplay squeakers gibs
recommended
i recomend tf2 for new players to get started for othere games its the top of game you would play for fun and play coop and much more just play it its awesome mvm too is good but mvm is much harder than a normal tf2 game thank you for reading this and goodbye
recommended
the game has hats what else would you want seirously tho the game is extremely addicting wether youre the trading fanatic the hardened veteran or the a newb the game has lots to offer the 9 classes are all distinct with all their pros and cons even if the game is 7 years old valve still updates it adding new hats weapons maps and recently taunts the amount of care this game has got i great comparing it w other f2p games even with its microtransactions the game is balanced and item drops happen to everyone so the homeless 12 year olds get some stuff 10000000000010
recommended
i love this game its awesome
recommended
people love this game for hats but for me eh better to kill like a man and look like an idiot than to look awesome and do as much damage as those lil kids on cod but if you love hats and conga buy this game regardless of the fact that the games free hats
recommended
this is awesome free to play game even though im not a f2p anymore d keep up the good work valve
recommended
one if not the best game i ever played
recommended
i havent really had a lot of time to try this game out but it seems alright
recommended
one of the most addicting game in history personally its my favorite game so what is team fortress 2 team fortress 2 is a multiplayer actionfps game you play as 9 different classes with different abilities and roles the fast and speeding scout the aggressive and rocketjumping soldier the mysterious and masked pyro the drunk and explosive demoman the big russian heavy the sentrymaking engineer the lifesaver medic the headshotting sniper and the backstabbing spy what makes it addicting and awesome the gameplay itself needs actual teamwork to complete the objectives and defeat the opposing team you need to cooperate with your teammates to complete the objectives besides from that there are trading features that allows you to trade items like cosmetics weapons and bunch of other stuff with other players the community itself is growing and expanding 1010 would play again
recommended
uhm i dont even know where to start with you this is one of those games that is so different its great this is the first game that ive ever played that has established some sort of economy system some people would frown upon this game because of its graphics and cartoonish feel which some people like another aspect that i enjoy is the customization valve adds usercreated items to the game via the workshop so a great amount of the ideas are from the community team fortress 2 is by far one of my most favorite games of all time 1110
recommended
if you like classic looking games first person shooters teamwork and randomness this is the game for you this game introduces 9 different classes with different weapons and playstyles 910 even though its one of the best games ive played it has alot of bugs besides these bugs this game makes me want to play it all day
recommended
i feel like every year i need to come back and review this game just because my opinion shifts as does the communitys people talk about how tf2 is dead and theyre wrong the community is still very much alive but the game has been around for 8 years now and is of course past its prime the game is still really fun and you can very easily pick up and play things are really well balanced and intuitive valve has been slacking on updates for this game the last major update which we recieved the end of the line update an overhyped community update to go along with a short sfm film turned out to be a trainwreck with a release that disappointed us with pretty much everything the core problem people like me have with the updates currently being shipped for this game is that they add nothing new in terms of gameplay just cosmetics luckily recently valve decided to start up a map workshop which could be just what valve was looking for to keep gameplay fresh for veteran players so next up is competitive matchmaking thatll be fun to see
recommended
best f2p and best fps this game have everything i spend almost all my day playing this best game ever
recommended
team fortress 2 is a fun multiplayer class shooter that shows the funny and playful aspect combined with the action based class shooter it is great and i think you should get it

you probably know what this game is lets be honest everyone has probably heard of team fortress 2 the moment they got on steam team fortress 2 is a freetoplay shooter with a cartoony art style and an unusual way of playing that sets it apart from other shooters in team fortress 2 there are 9 classes each with its weaknesses and advantages along with the basic shooting classes have their own unique abilities that help on the battlefield however this game is not only famous for the click & shoot it has one of the most interesting and complicated economy that i enjoy to participate in you can work your way up to be able trade ingame items for actual steam games this game also doesnt tax your machine and even on low settings is lovable with its computerfriendly artstyle even though its been released a long time ago team fortress 2 still maintains its freshness and uniqueness
