a great list of good things about this game  get called a hacker after a killing them  have expensive knifes and if you have a low priced knife you will be called a noob but if you have a expensive one your good or used your moms credit card  you can get easily unlucky unless you play with friends who all have mics and understand the game actual good things  team cooperation  smart players who can rekt them all and will be with you all the way  helping you feel better when you get rekt  cheap trading cards for badges  you can make enemies and very good friends some friends will just make you play better

kills a chicken gets 1 point doesnt bother with players and only kills chicken
recommended
very fun but needs skill and patience get some friends to play competitive since not all people in the community will be to your liking 
recommended
if you get ever matchmaked with the russians open up your console and type voice_enable 0 that really helps ranking up or you can talk with the chickens and not rank up

if you like css i would reccomend getting csgo the game is a much fancier nicer and smoother version of css the matchmaking in my opinion is fairly well balanced the only problems with the matchmaking is purely that people go into groups with much higher stat guys which can sometimes make the game seem unfair the ui is simpler and nicer then css my favorite aspect of the game while sometimes looked down upon is the inventory system yes it has been called tf2 for having skins but they are purely cosmetic and not only that they look absolutely amazing i talk all the time about how i want that amazing skin or how i actualyl preffer a gun just because of its skin their isnt a billion different guns where as hats ya know and most of them are obtainable without even spending a dime stattrack being my favorite makes the game a lot more fun will i get a new skin will i be able to sell the skin and save for a cheap game secondly i enjoy the simplicity of competitive i never quite understood how to do comp in css and always played dm or another type of gamemode csgo makes it easy select competitive or want a different gamemode just select it and wait while waiting doesnt sound the greatest it is very nice get a snack talk plan etc gives time to think through and get friends i rate this game an 810 and would deffinetaly get it

i can say with 400hrs of game time this is definatly a game to pick up if you are not into fps it may not be a game your looking for although you can get minigames as such but i wouldnt pick it up if you dont like fps moving on if you do like fps this game is a definate game for you it has casual for people who just want to chill and play some fps and then competitive for 5v5 bomb mission or hostage rescue this concludes 30 rounds and first team to win 16 rounds wins

the game is very strange to me the gameplay mechanics the maps the coordination the matchmaking and the fun past times game modesall beautiful but if because of the people who play it the game takes the downfall more and more people hack and smurf and they are not letting the new begginer players even play the game and going 5 minutes without eating sit valve of course wont be able to 100% fix this for because if they did fair players would suffer too so get yourself atleast a 3man premade team b4 u start anything and pray that noone bad i waiting for you on the other team just cause of the bad community its a 610

this is by far one of my favorite games of all time and in my opinion the pinnacle of first person shooters counter strike has always achieved elegance with simplicity the mechanics are seemingly simple but the learning curve is massive and incredibly extensive making this game addictive and enjoyable also being made on the source engine the game is very stable and well optimized in all aspects networking gpucpu usage etc

counter strike want a game where you cant actually play with people at your skill level because that would make it enjoyable no no no you get little children buying as many game keys as possible just to take the easy shots and easy wins so they dont have to face someone near their skill level so if you like being bent over and ed with gabes vitual  get amongst this game you will love it get ed by awps m4s aks you name the gun and valve will apply lube to that barrel and just go to town 1000 hours ive burned into this game since it came out all to get hacked by some kid who cant handle using game sense good game ruined by hacks and micro transactions well done valve well done

this is a very fun game

i am not a great fan of pfs online cs go is my total exception especially because its my money grabber that feeds my steam wallet with some euros enough in time to buy games in special deals still you will find the community in this game to be erratic youll find nice people in one side and complete  bags in the other that think theyre the best players in the game just for you to find out theyre trolling you and cheating hard if you dont have the stomach consider yourself warned play this for fun and be nice to people if you do that the matches tend to be a wonderful experience and better according to the teams mood believe me

this game was cool untill i went to competitive modeafter playing this game you will know all russian swear words full of russians who wont communicate with you and only yell suka suka idi nahhui etc you cant get out of silver once you get in therethere are lots of guys who are smurfsspecially when the sale is onthere are lots of guys who have only 16hrs of cs or even 10hrs  most guys dont have sounddont know how to soundalways going to wrong plant when bomb is planteddont understand anything about this game and wonders how enemy is knifing him from behindcalling everyone who kills them hackers and then attacking teammates because they want to get kicked i find this game fun until you have great team who are trying to win the game not give up on after losing first round 1 annyoing thing is that when you go duo rank with someone you will always get guys who are unranked or dont understand anything about this game in your team and enemy team has 4 premade even with clantag or just very good players imoin my opinion counter strike should make something like this if you have under 50hrs total of csgo you cant go competitive mode if you have under 20hrs of actually playing in game vs real enemys you cant go to competitive mode i love this game but i hate the matchmaking systemim still going to recommend this game because you can actually sometimes laugh how your teammates who are very bad are playing

death is a great teacher failure in counterstrike global offensive is as it always has been for this series the greatest way to learn where you should have gone what you shouldnt have done and how you could have done better counterstrike players spend a lot of time learning  consequently they are always getting better growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years for the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continues pieces of the counterstrike formula are dated at this point but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim counterstrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard but the changes are for the best  the underpass choke point in de_dust for instance has a new escape route even in the face of genre evolution global offensive doesnt care to adapt csgo is so dedicated to counterstrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in global offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters everyone is limited to what they have and can see with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages running and gunning is a useless play style even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill walking crouching or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fire consequently killing in global offensive feels good theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim if players arent watching corners providing covering fire or using smoke grenades and flashbangs theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman the desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better team if youve played counterstrike before global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counterstrike like counterstrike source before it global offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter while doing little to disrupt the core form and function at the same time it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic too theyre particularly useful during demolition matches which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between the new and modified maps in this mode arent as big as classic counterstrike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever the lake map is a standout  theres a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots to separate demolition from defusal players cant buy between rounds instead it takes a cue from the other new mode arms race in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly the better you do the more you have to switch up the way you play and because demolition is so fast youll need to be quick on your feet unlike other game types arms race allows for respawns its the most chaotic and carefree mode in global offensive with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible its a shame there are only two maps in arms race  a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than pc if you have the option playing the pc version is unquestionably the best way to experience counterstrike global offensive mods mouse and keyboard and the usual pconly options are better than the ports plus valve is much better about longterm pc support  it abandoned team fortress 2 on consoles and portal 2s level editor was pc exclusive if you prefer to play on consoles global offensive is the same great game with the following special bits playstation 3 for those who want to play on playstation 3 but dont want to deal with the imprecision of analog sticks counterstrike go supports mouse and keyboard giving it a pretty noticeable edge over the xbox 360 version if youre feeling saucy move is another option although nuance dies with the motion controller move is accurate and your quick reflexes will score kills but the unavoidable instability of holding a remote will give your cursor some seriously unpleasant wobble worse moving the wand quickly can confuse the controller which often and irritatingly misinterprets basic leftright looks as a want to turn around 180 degrees xbox 360 aside from the lack of keyboardmouse input the xbox 360 version of global offensive is functionally identical to that on ps3  the new radial userinterface on both platforms is as elegant as it is on pc because its a hardcore competitive game counterstrike blocks party chat in an effort to combat cheating forcing players with headsets to play with friends or brave the wild west of obscenity that is xbox live the verdict global offensive is definitely a counterstrike sequel  it looks and feels familiar with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players this is a demanding skillbased multiplayer game thats as satisfying now as it ever was but its for a specific kind of player if youre not willing to learn to play different than youre used to look elsewhere otherwise this is a toptier tactics game that will probably share the longtailed legacy of its predecessors

as a recent master race convert i have no words to describe how irrtated i am at myself for never owning a counter strike game before wow no fps can currently touch this in terms of the playing field and skill based competition you are getting owned by someone they are better than you you keep getting killed in the same places stop going there or shoot better use your brain clutch like a king and ensure you have a headset a superb competitive game thanks valve

to anyone coming from cod and thinking they can dominate in counter strike like you can in cod youre sorely mistaken this game has a much higher skill level and is extremely difficult at first however its so rewarding when you can finally pull off the headshot in only one bullet like everyone else buy this game if you want to see how the first multiplayer fps has evolved

very addicting always fun to play

i recommend csgo to veteran players and beginners alike as the game has a balanced community you can meet people who are complete s yet find some that are rather tolerant the graphics are ok for a game that was pretty recent and maps created by the community are also playable if youre aspiring for an competitive environment this is the place for you

great game this game is very fun but if you are a fan of cod this is a very different sort of fps with this fps there is no zooming in unless the gun you have has a special sight there are very kind people on it and you can make so green with the crates too very addictive but when you are not in the mood it is very boring with this game instead of earning weapons with levels like most fps do this you earn money every round and you spend that on your weapons great maps though some can get very boring because it is over chosen cough cough dust ii i would say the only downside is you need to be online there is no single player mode overall great game great price can make a fair amount of money through it and is very addictive

this game what can you say about it is coubter strike one of the best games of all time in my opinion absolutely by far the best fps shooter there ever was i have played many games many of which were fps shooters the classic 007 golden eye for the n64 the original doom quake and so fourth all great games counter strike brings something different its all player vs player just your team vs the other team tactics movement angles reaction mind games strategy teamwork communication economy weapon recoil smokes flashes and nades and more all have an emence amount of importance in this game if some one fails to take into consideration all of that it can cost your team the round its a game that can be played fast its a game that can be played slow always having to think of what the other team might be doing you have to figure out your enemy as soon as possible so you can hold the right angles play better positions change it up but it has to work or its for nothing when it does knowing you outsmarted or at least figured your enemy out for one round as you watched them fall apart as a team is so rewarding and thats just one round more if you are lucky no match is the same your skill is tested every time you jump into one you might have to clutch some rounds for your team the pressure is on you pause a moment in mid doors to collect yourself before you try and retake b site 1v3 your heart will skip a beat or two there will be times you are shaking as you want so badly to clutch for yourself and your team and when you do there is no greater feeling in any game your team will congradulate you and maybe cheer you will be shaking but smilingmaybe a fist pump you just used all of the above in a few seconds time to win the round for your team and possibly save the match this is the game i will always come back to this is the game i will never stop playing as long as people play it get this game

coming from cs16 this game is an amazing step up from the last simply a fun and competitive game lives up the old expectations of any fps gamer all i could wish for is a less trashy community but i guess that could be said for any game and the skins the skins are a copy of tf2s market either the skin is extremely expensive or worth nothing but aside the gameplay is nearly perfect

counterstrike as you probably heard so many times when kids from around your place start screaming oh my god yesterday i played counterstrike global offensive it was so good you guys should try it well i stopped playing counterstrike because i felt like moving on you know but after hearing those kids i kinda felt like never old to bring back some good memories now i play this game about 2030 hours a week and i love it youre never too old for this game never

best cat grooming simulator ever 42021 would groom again

i do recommend this game but i only have one problem which is the temp cooldown the problem with the temp cooldown is that when i was in a match with one of my friends on competitive he decided to teamkill and our team kicked him and even me so when i returned to the main menu i noticed that i had to wait 7 days until my next competitive match and my friend that was team killing got a temp cool down for 24 hours fixthecooldown

it sure pisses you off but thats a good sign the game is awesome

this is a game

im not one for first person shooters but this is awesome csgo is much a game of skill as it is teamwork you are playing as either terrorists or counterterrorists with a wide range of weaponry avaliable to both sides the maps are diverse and the gamemodes extremely enjoyable and fun if this review isnt selling the game enough check out wwwyoutubecomimanderzel and watch some of his vids also ive racked up over 30 hours within 2 weeks of buying the game thats how much i love it
recommended
great game really enjoy it
recommended
one of the best of the cs series sure the first cs is the leader of them all but csgo just puts the series onto a whole new level it proves that source can give amazing graphics as well as incredible gameplay and it shows that cs will never die out i think this is an amazing release made by valve and its worth every penny edit oh and to add this review was made before release date of csgo  this is to prove to the people who dont believe me when i say i was in the csgo closed beta
recommended
its ok do not buy keys never ever
recommended
how could one stray away from the a game series that revolutionized the fps genre it isnt very different than any variation of cs however updated weapons maps gear and graphics make the game a lot more diverse that its predecessor the gameplay is beautiful and the animations are great the multiplayer keeps you coming back for more with its numerous different gamemodes not to mention its just as fun offline in my personal opinion i would give the game a 8510 i hope this reveiw was helpful to all of you reading
recommended
easier to play than other counter strikes more weapons better graphics best counter strike title to date
recommended
readlly fun best game i ever played p xd
recommended
your typical point and click game for kids you can also play it to recieve some nerf gun skins and sell it to other kids for real money

this game is like 16 and source with balanced sprays valve servers and pretty good matchmaking play this if you have nothing to do in your life anymor because you cant master this easily
recommended
yes i recommend this game because you find skins fun has great graphics
recommended
very good game reccomended d
recommended
really foon
recommended
a great cross between 16 and css with constant updates from valve and the in built match making this has the potential to be the fps of choice for 2014 on pc forget cod and bf its time for a cs uprising
recommended
its the most advanced remake of the all time favourite massively multiplayer fps game counter strike the gameplays are fairly imrpoved some character animations are added all the previous maps have been given a graphical facelift users can play in diferrent gaming modes the competitive mode is even more challenging it provides you with a rank based on your skills you can buy skins for your weapons from the workshop afterall this game is an old wine in a new bottle its not a sequel its an updated version of the previous cs updates are not bad though its a revamped way to utilize the magic of cs
recommended
this is one of the best fps i have played it is awesome <3

very good game csgostar

i mostly love this game because of the new competitive mode if you want to know more about it read the first paragraph if you want to know about every other game modes read the whole review  with the competitive game mode counter strike became one of the most interesting intensive and thrilling fps game competitive game mode is about to play 5v5 matches with your team where you need tactics skills and knowledge of the game maps and spots there are a maximum of 30 rounds  competitive game the team that wins 16 rounds will win the whole match if your team wins members of the team climb up on a virtual ladder winning more and more matches may get you better ranks by the time and with ranks of course harder enemies in the future matches when you are playing competitive mode every step move and shot matters a fault can easily loose you a round out of the 30 or a better shot or lucky move can get a win for you and your team even it makes pressure on you to prove your skills you have to stay calm to be able to do your best play it with friends make a clan and create one of the best team or just solo queue for the matches you will enjoy the game except when you get bad team mates with zero tactics the second new game mode is arms race still you can select what team you are in but it isnt really matter there are arms race specialized maps unfortunately only a few where you start with an smg and every kill brings you a new weapon you have to be the fastest to fight yourself through every weapon and get a kill with every one of them the last one is a knife golden knife in this game mode if you manage to get the kill with the knife before anyone else you win the match this game mode is fastpaced and excellent for some fun and stress beating the 3rd one is the demolition mode you can play the classic game on smaller maps with only one bomb site combined with the element of arms race what means every round you get frag makes you jump on the next weapon in the next round ofc there is the old game mode called casual where you play the classic maps with huge teams and there is a dm where you can select what weapon you want to play and then go and kill the enemy team members until the time goes down and the round ends i recommend this game for every fps player you can play dm or arms race if you want some brainless shooting casual or demolition for short time playingcasual play ofc or competitive if you have more time to play and not scared for some team work thinking and ranking 
recommended
a very tactical game that offers a good experience for playing with friends and making friends all around the world by far one of the best fps that i ever played
recommended
quite a fun game has its ups and downs but i think its more of a good game than a bad game first of all the game is very tactical and is filled with alot of different ways to play but the most important part in the game is teamwork the game is best played when you have a couple of friends with microphones the competitive system in the game is quite fun matchmaking isnt terrible no netcode problems and really i have nothing bad to say except for the community the community of the game isnt harsh but sometimes you may meet with some people which will be a little y throughout the game and may ruin your whole multiplayer experience overall the game is wonderful and amazing i personally enjoy it and recommend it to those fps game lovers though be wary that the aim in this game is nowhere like any other game you dont have recoil but the ammount of bullet spray may get a little too much when you spray you gun rather than burst firing brilliant game great competition tactical online experience
recommended
a really nice fps for a good price

what to write as a review for this game well i started playing csgo just a few days ago with my bf and so far i have been called fing idiot r3tard and they even unsuccessfuly tried to kick me out of the server lol i never knew that only macho guys with tiny dcks played this game >< they all seem to think they are pros even though they know for a fact theyre playing withagainst noobs who are trying to learn and improve oh and did i mention they sure as hell cant play with girls what a bunch of cavemen m0rons so yeah i hope you find this helpful

great community i get called a  and people say im salty every 5 seconds <3 1010
recommended
its an okay game i guess but the only thing that really keeps you engaged is the extremly toxic community they will yell at you for absolutely everything and its hilarious you got 4 kills but couldnt pull off that 5th to ace the enemy team as the last guy wow you really suck at this even i could have done that says the dead guy are you at the top of the leaderboards and die from one mistakejust die from bad luck god youre so bad it amazes me that youre at the top says the guy at the bottom its even more hilarious when you call them out on their hypocrisy they either go into denial or even just ragequit or when a guy at the bottom with no kills 5 rounds in acts like hes a savant at csgo and tells everyone else how much they suck and they will always try to blame hacks always 10outta10 never change <3

global offensive surprised me very positively i only bought the game so i could join friends when they invite me again  but after playing a few rounds on the competitive gamemode i really started to like it been of lot of fun since then and i highly recommend it

great game classic shooter really strays from the modern millitary shooters we have today the community has a large ammount of veteran players that are often rude but the game has to go down in history as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time due to its attention to detail where the bullet lands is an important role in this game and just because you get the jump on someone does not mean youre coming out alive

could be the only fps that is truley skill based if you want to win you have to play smart know the maps and have wicked good aim and reflexes every kill feels like an achievement  every now and then youll play with people that will irritate the  out of you and play against people that you are convinced are hacking if you lose a match blame your team or the lag or the hackers on the other team  if you win a match the other team will blame their team or the lag they may call someone in your team a hacker oh and the virtual knives in this game cost more than real knives \o_o 1010 cola

a really good game that takes a lot skill to play but sometimes the physics of the game can really get on your nerves for example when you get shot once you become a lot slower than normal and will most probably die there are a lot of good aspects to the game including competitve play which enables you to be ranked against other players and there are good measurements put in place for team killers and people that rage quit overall a rteally good game that i would recommend

coming from the battlefield series i cant explain how good it feels to play a game that just works has good balance and netcode i havent had this much fun in shooters since ever

counterstrike global offensive is unboubtfully one of the most superb games i have had the pleasure to play i have dedicated 300 hours as of today and see anouther 300 and then another and another the game has a perfect it depends how lucky you are balancing system and has caused countless people to sacrifice their free time to play this game and its particularly addictive game mode one of my favorite being compititive which as an excellent game mode i strongly reccamend this game seeing as its stolen most of my joy and lively hood and caused more depression then a castration

pros   competitive gameplay  heavily teambased  fun with friends  international contests  betting  addicting skins system cons   you are not always matchmaked with good players  matchmaking system needs some tweaking  player stereotypes  eg  russians  they arent so bad after all  it gets a while to get the hang of the game and get used to the aiming especially if youre new  lacks some kind of reward system for high skilled players playing in high ranks conclusion  get this game play this game get addicted to this game

aim on the head shoots above aim below shoots above aim at feet headshot

are you a casual or competitive player well either way this game is for you very fun addicting and great to play with friendclan members in my opinion better than call of duty due to its life span and skins system

rugby union fans have been starved for authentic video game representations of their beloved sport for years now with the last truly strong rugby game being rugby 08 sadly rugby 15 is not the game to break the drought in fact its an utter disaster of all the various sports that share the football classification rugby union is one of the trickiest for newcomers to wrap their heads around thanks to a myriad of rules and complexities while scoring points is the same logic as other forms of footballgetting a ball across a try line or kicking a ball between goal postsconverting kickoff to try time involves a number of key set piecesthe team in possession of the ball can run as many phases as they like unless theres an infringement or they kick the ball when tackled the player holding the ball must release it as players from both sides pile in and form a ruck which can only be entered from the side scrums and mauls can be used to drive the ball across the try line or gain precious metres while lineout kicks are essential for gaining ground in short rugby union is a tricky game to learn and developer hb studios deserves kudos for condensing the complexities of the game into a relatively simple arcadestyle control scheme unfortunately for gamers hoping rugby 15 will be the gateway to understanding union theres a lack of a meaningful tutorial or any specific training modes for the various components of the sport instead youll have to learn by way of ten static training screens and ingame control reminders for the most part the controls are all very easy to come to grips with but it almost instantly comes apart after kickoff as i played it became increasingly clear to me that the gameplay stops and starts based on what the player is doing while its nice to be at the centre of the action it makes for boring rugby as both sides stand around waiting for you to act for instance at kickoff your ai teammates only start moving after youve fully completed the dropkick start of play and the kicker stands stuck on the spot for a second or two before being able to move even if you switch players immediately after kicking its impossible to perform cheeky tenmetre startsrestarts that give you the opportunity to gain possession and make easy groundsimilarly there were times when i pulled the ball out of the back of a ruck and just stood there watching the opposing team stand around oblivious to my possession until i took a step forward the best tactics were to deliberately relinquish possession to gain easy metres i found the most successful and repeatable tactic regardless of difficulty level was to perform a boxkick from the back of a ruck to gain ground as long as the kick stayed on the field and outside of the 22metre line where the ai will take a mark its incredibly easy to force a turnoverbasic tackling is as easy as guiding your selected player into the opposing player with the ball or any opposing player for that matter as you never seem to get penalised for tackling players that arent carrying the ball in fact outside of ruck infringements i rarely got penalised for anything forward passes were never noticed or penalised whether performed by me or the opposing team and offside penalties were only awarded about ten percent of the time as for ruck penalties theyre incredibly easy to avoid once the player carrying the ball is tackled you have to push the right stick into a predetermined sweet spot that rushes from red to yellow to green then you can take possession of the ball attempting to take the ball when the meter is red results in an instant penalty yellow is a risky grab that may result in a penalty and is surprisingly easier to get away with in hard difficulty while green is safe to grab except when the referee erroneously pings you from time to time for a legal grab the ruck mechanic is glitchy when in possession of the ball meaning i had to hit the right trigger to release the ball before attempting to play the meter game if i didnt do this rugby 15 stopped registering controller input for a few precious seconds this is a problem that plagues that playstation 3 version of the game more than anything else also outside of rucks given the specific way youre forced to ruck its best not to be in possession of the ball until youre within ten metres of the try line so you dont have to deal with the incredible frustration of losing possession because the game bugs out even on the supposedly hard difficulty its incredibly easy to win back possession in a ruck once you learn the rightstick sweet spot and perfect timing combination by far the biggest problem i had with rugby 15 though was that it rarely felt as though skill or tactics played into scoring tries when running with the ball you can flick the right stick up or down or twirl the stick around completely to sidestep opponents but even that mechanic only seemed to work sporadically for me the game seems to predetermine the outcome of specific plays before the animation occurs resulting in an inability to pass the ball if it decides youre about to be tackled or a lack of a sidestep if that stationary player in front of your guy is destined to take you down similarly partial ai control over the playercontrolled footballer means that sidesteps and fends automatically occur at the games discretion while players will regularly run off on their own accord even if they have the humancontrolled icon above their heads it feels more like rugby roulette than rugby unionwhen you eventually make it to the trialanderrorstyle tryscoring mechanic youll discover that there are two ways to score a try the first gameencouraged option is to click in the left or right stick to score a try this proved to be a risky manoeuvre though as fullspeed players had a tendency to dive over the deadball line resulting in a penalty even the opposing team was guilty of this on one occasion in an uncontested try opportunity the second guaranteed option for scoring a try is to run your player over the try line and wait to be tackled theres no option to get a player beneath a try attempt to stop them touching down the ball and a button for charging down a kick is sorely lacking while theres no sprint option stamina didnt appear to come into play despite its presence in the options menu and pursuing players rarely catch up to a running player even if their stats determine they should be able to there are rare moments where the intended gameplay formula bounces to the top of the heap and local coopcompetitive play improves the rhythm as it helps get around dealing with the atrocious ai local multiplayer has its own specific issues however particularly in regard to the weird system of tracking and switching players during coop its worth noting the game looks decidedly lastgen with dated visuals that can become confusing in certain matches where jersey colours are indistinguishable between friend and foe especially when you consider how frequently players flock in front and behind the offside line the playstation 3 version of rugby 15 is particularly ugly with a lower resolution darker presentation plenty of jaggies and a terrible frame rate to boot combine the unappealing visual presentation with the aforementioned game woes and the ps3 version is unplayable in its current formwhen you eventually make it to the trialanderrorstyle tryscoring mechanic youll discover that there are two ways to score a try the first gameencouraged option is to click in the left or right stick to score a try this proved to be a risky manoeuvre though as fullspeed players had a tendency to dive over the deadball line resulting in a penalty

an unforgiving competitive shooter that could be considered easy to learn but hard to master if you decide to try out csgo for your first time youre sure to diea lotbut that shouldnt stop you from learning from your losses csgo can be a frustrating and infuriating experience but it can be a rewarding one as well in csgo there are a couple different game types that you can choose from the classic casual and competitive matches centered around an attackdefend objective the more forgiving deathmatch in which you can use any guns and respawn regularly and finally the onceunique arms race in which you kill enemies with a given weapon and begin cycling through every weapon in the game one by one until youve gotten a kill with each as a beginner i found its best to start with deathmatch or arms race just to pick up on the mechanics of the game and its gunsbecause despite what it looks like csgo isnt your typical shooter this is a game that requires not only a steady hand and controlled shots but manipulations of the games intricacies just to control the recoil patterns of the guns its a steep learning curve but this can become a fantastic game for those that give it time if theres any advice i can give its to give yourself ample time to learn similar to a moba you wont learn everything this game has to offer overnightit just cant happen take your time figure things out one by one study your highscoring opponents and teammates and above all remember that its just a game and youre there to have fun and if all else fails just buy the zeus to run around electrocuting people

only relevant competitive fps game out there right now would be 1010 if it was not for valves inability to balance the game around the competitive scene

i never used to play cs go because i thought it was just another firstperson shooter ive never been so wrong in my entire life cs go is a tactical shooter its not about charging in and spraying people down the coordination between players and invidiual skill is what makes it such an enjoyable game players have to get those one or two headshots to kill an opponent or else theyll kill you first on a completely unrelated note this is like hat simulator skin simulator you can trade and buy skins to make your guns look cool but skins dont matter in the competitive scene for someone who enjoys firstperson shooter and wants an enjoyable game to play competitively and cooperatively i definitely suggest they check out cs go thanks for reading my review guys ^^ peace > > echo

a really good game that takes a lot skill to play but sometimes the physics of the game can really get on your nerves for example when you get shot once you become a lot slower than normal and will most probably die there are a lot of good aspects to the game including competitve play which enables you to be ranked against other players and there are good measurements put in place for team killers and people that rage quit overall a rteally good game that i would recommend
recommended
its still the best fpsgame around 
recommended
maybe the best shooter game out there 1010

recommended
really good game csgo is really addicting  atleast for me i love the skins you get and if you dont like them  just sell them d this game is a really skillneeded game and not like call of duty that everyone can be a pro its fun playing  the ranks and comp matches i recommend you buy it so you can feel how it is to play and not look at the pictures and say its crappy
recommended
awesome game if youre into fps definately reccomend it
recommended
best game na needs more aztec tho
recommended
very addicting and great

you can learn alot in this game like mating and apple picking going balls deep in pizza finding out harry potter actually happened and if you havnt ed hermione grown up youre racist also cooking gingers are hard because their hair will burn too easily 69420 better than school teachings

pros  great multiplayer game for friends to spend some time on personally i love both modes of defuse and hostage missions bost scenarios are lovely and fit the game csgo is perfectly made for that fps gamer looking for a firstpersonshooter pc game great game 9510 cons  a few maps are just a little one sided such as assault and aztec but other maps are great  overall rating  9510
recommended
 zoomed in with awp trying to shoot somebody across the map i shot but i moved an inch whilst i shot bullet went behind me killing my teammate got 1 shot hsd across the map with usp teammate raging in russian because i killed him i also rage i rage quit get 8 days ban  sums up my entire csgo experience 2 reasons to like this game profit in skins gaben
recommended
counter strike global offensive is a challanging tactical first person shooter that doesnt only require skill but also inteligence the competetive multiplayer in this game is according to me the most enjoyable to watch the pros play and play yourself for countless of hours where every match feels like a new challange that you desperately need to beat if you are a person that enjoys shooters that require skill map knowledge intelligence and much more counter strike is a both great and cheap game for you
recommended
best game ever recommend to everyone
recommended
no 911 map and no planes there are terrorists still so id rate 911

russian simulator 2013 if you ask to be kicked because your team loses the first 2 rounds you might be a russian if your team calls eco round and you buy an awp you might be a russian if the only 2 weapons you use are the awp and p90 you might be a russian if you win the first 9 rounds and say gg ez game you might be a russian if you call your teammate a noob because he failed the 1v5 you might be a russian if you cant play on a us server without your ping going lower han 400 you might be a russian if the only maps you put in the queue are dust2 you might be a russian if you have a karambit fade in your inventory but your rank is silver 2 you might be a russian if you call hacks because your enemy shot you through a wall and he could see your shadow you might be a russian if you say f your mother every time you lose a game you might be a russian if you say the reason youre a silver is because of bad teammates you might be a russian if you call your global elite friend a ing noob after he carries you you might be a russian if you rush b as a terrorist every round on dust2 you might be a russian

one of the best fps games i ever played the graphics is stunning and the part i like the most is how smooth the game goes even when im using a crappy laptop the game still runs smoothly without lag this game requires skill and teamwork controlling recoil strategy which i feel like this game can improve your awareness and tactics i would rate this game 455 i would definetely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new fps game

i was in a 1v5 situtation and we were the cts i headshot a guy with my m4a4 and then went over to his body and picked up his ak47 i then went down a staircase to find a guy staring down at me i shot him down quickly whilst also seeing another guy coming i backed off and let him rush out then killed him by then the bomb had been planted i went to a bombsite and saw an awper so i killed him before he could 1 shot me the last guy was camping next to the bomb with a p90 so i picked up the guys awp and saw a small bit of his head peeking out bam hes dead i quickly ran with my knife to the bomb and defused itwell most of it anyway we lost because i was a second too late and the bomb exploded 1110 would play again
recommended
its ok
recommended
gameplay insanely realistic trained anti terrorists can not shoot unless they are completely still shotguns can be used as sniper rifles balance of weapons all weapons are very balanced especially the sniper that can 1 hit kill you anywhere but your pinky toe community friendly and forgiving except for the ocassional team of 4 smurfs and a hacker that seems to happen every game as well as the 2 members of your own team whocant speak englishare 7 years old 1110 would commit suicide again seriously though
recommended
i think the main enemy in this game are the chickens

i thoroughly enjoy csgo mostly the competitive aspect as i dont enjoy the casual gamemodes now although competitive is full of hackerstrollssmurfs it is an incredibly fun and engaging way to play it teaches you how to play and there are many helpful guides online the negatives if you have a team who dont communicate it is a large issue as you cannot give information about the enemy and disucss tactics also smurfers and hackers ruin matches but are vital in the learning curve of csgo as they teach you how to make better decisions and keep your cool as myself coming from mostly lol i didnt struggle to pickup the game and found it as a great way to relax in casual gamemodes or play competitively one large thing i didnt mention earlier is getting banned automatically for example you can become banned from kicking too many teammates which i think is ridiculous but is implemented so a few tips dont kick people unless you really have to and dont afkleave this will save you from some bans it requires you to be proactive with your learning of the game to find tutorials and learn from more experienced players to do things such as strafe shooting and headshotting if you can master these techniques you can do greatly the ranking system is slightly confusing but requires you to win many rounds and games successfuly to rank up it can become annoying but you will eventually rank up tldr great competitive scene easy to learn but hard to master buy this game if youre looking for an fps game that is unique and enjoyable to play with friends 910 1010 if hackers and smurfers were lowered but we all know that isnt possible
recommended
its the best game i ever played

i was positive about this game at first but then i realised this game has an awful community and an awful ban system i still recommend this game but get some friends to play with i got banned for a week for kicking too many trolls seriously valve

csgo is a clean and polished version of the little mod that could graphics are a dramatic improvement over source and the classic levels have received little touchups for both looks and balance its a promising title that seeks to keep counterstrike on top of the competitive shooter charts

my dad asked me where did you learn russian son and i said counter strike

1010 has minimal amount of 5 year olds

just reviewing for the badge but its a pretty nice game except for the russians
recommended
although a lot of stupid  antisocial and sometimes maybe cheating people run around in this game and unfortunately you have to play with then sometimes still it makes fun and wont let you go so easily for a long long time so beware of its addiction factor but maybe im one of the people described above dont let the game get to you so hard try to have fun and take it easy thats what i should consider more often

learn spray learn burst fire learn positioning learn aim after u learn that all congrats u can become good csgo player

note this review contains a lot of butthurt this game is actually very good the community has nice people in it but there is still a portion of terrible people people ask me why i cant get ranked the answer is simple i get placed with teammates that troll and teamkill recently i played a comp game and this is the first thing i heard oh my god guys is this league of legends in a high pitched  voice at first i found this funny what happened next was not first eight rounds in a nutshell  my teammates call me a little  for telling them where everyone is ie they are at cat  my teammates start to kill each other  1 teammate leaves  the other team is having a blast killing my teammates who are not even trying  i get teamkilled several times the next eight rounds  another teammate leaves not before killing me however  another teammate starts to troll by throwing weapons in the air running around with knife looking at sky after the first half  another teammate kills me he leaves shortly after  another teammate kills me he leaves i am left all alone  i ask the other team to just knife fight me it doesnt go so well  my team i mean me cause i was the only one on my team now loses why do i still recommed this game well except for the  people like them it actually is quite a good game however you really need to play with friends if you play alone all the other people you play with will be  thats the reason they were alone they cant get any friends because they are mentally ill just stupid this is only in competitive however casual is quite nice because no one takes it seriously including myself so most of the time you actually get nice people who are just enjoying the game i would recommend this game if you dont want to play competitive cause its just a  of stupid asshats who think they are cool for  over some persons day

i think my hours say enough 3

counterstrike global offensive the most offensive game ever created 99% of the terrorists are middleeastern

great game never thought this game would pull me away from my call of duty addiction all i ever played was search and destroy on cod but it isnt even close 30 rounds of highly competitive highly tactical and highly addictive gameplay from the originators of search and destroy how does it get any better it doesnt this is the best fps available hands down
recommended
ive played this game for a while and i will give it a 810 the gameplay is addictive and you find yourself putting actual money in for the skins and cases which dont actually affect the gameplay the only bad things about this game is the fact that high level players can easily buy an extra copy of the game and start at the beginning these players are called smurfs and they are extremely skilled players playing with newbs this makes the game kind of unfair because you are supposed to only play against people at or around your level but you just have to deal with it its still a great game with some great competitive fun

this is awesome  i love csgo and i play that every week  it has very good graphics from another counter strike games  like source  v 12 etc   very good and new weapons and another good for that game has many worlds  like train  season  workout etc   then has many kinds of game  like  casual   game with bots etc   i suggest that game for you because is the most multiplayer game ever  
recommended
it took my money and gave me a red and black assult rifle
recommended
very good games
recommended
such a great game everything is so awesome graphics gameplay everything my competitive wont work but still a great game if you could help me fix the problem please send me a friend request and we can talk about it i would rate it 1010 such a good game
recommended
i dont see the reason for call of duty being more expensive than this golden game
recommended
this game stands out from most other first person shooters as on this teamwork is really the key to success go up thru the ranks as the more time u play the better you get play with your crosshair size shape colour static dinamic loads to chose from all the classic css guns with modern csgo skins  wonderful and highly reccomended
recommended
prepare to never see sunlight ever again i r8 it 88 m8
recommended
this game is very fun to play with friends competetive is definately the funnest part and overall there is a clear reason to why this game is so popular

what is a game 110
recommended
my original review was not too nice towards csgo but ive given it some time to get updated and whatnot and let me just say it has improved greatly it has become an excellent modern replacement to css there are servers for all players from noob to elite and theyre populated all day and night graphics options are top shelf and well optimized great job making csgo what it should be valve
recommended
even if your in global elite if you dont have skins youre classified as a scrub and you will be yelled at by angry 9 year olds 1010 would bang

i love this game

cool
recommended
the only game i am currently playing and the best one
recommended
makes you feel bad about your gaming skills 1010
recommended
looking for a fun way to make money off of a game you will enjoy playing with your friends well look no further because counter strike gloabal offensive is just the game for you you can get weapon skin drops worth some money but you can also get case drops and open those by buying a key yes you can end up getting a 4 cent skin but there is also a possibility of opening a case and getting a $400 knife its not easy though its all based on luck of the case opening i myself have gotten great skins from case openings but thats not all the gameplay is great i love the competitive and deathmatch modes but this game i give it 1010
recommended
nice game but please create another csgo only for russians cuz they ed up everything 
recommended
love this game
recommended
i think this game is really fun

most frustrating game evur how can i stop playing this

csgo is probably the best shooter out there there are so many aaa shooters out there for example battlefield or call of duty every year there is a new aaa game like this and you have to spend 3060$ for this games for csgo you only have to spend 1015$ and a new counter strike game comes only all 812 years but you shouldnt start playing this game alone tell your friends and play with them so why should you buy the game it is very cheap you can play it with your friends you can earn money with it creating weapon skins bet on pro teams with skins or real money the csgo community is the probably biggest and best community there is out there  thanks for reading i hope you enjoyed my review  sorry for my bad english i am a german student

stephen hawking thinks ai is going to spell the end of mankind in the far future apparently but rest assured ladies and gentlemen play few hours of this game and youll learn that bots cant aim ai is incapable of replicating normal bloody shooting in a fps then we have a very long time before the end of humanity is upon us mrhawking my cat could shoot better than the artificial intelligence in this game

do i enjoy this game yes ive played a ton of cs 16 and css through my youth and i guess i was a bit sour about a new counter strike game i didnt like it in the beginning but i didnt give it a good try my friends forced me into a few matches saying you havent tried it i said okay and i do not regret one single hour of it the low cost and the nearly infinite amounts of hours of replayability its certainly a game worth playing if you yet havent played it its a game everyone can enjoy good or bad player hardcore or soft player its a challenge for everyone with their matchmaking system yes there are quite a few hackers due to the fact the game is so cheap but meh its still the best game i have ever played 
recommended
this is a highly skilled first person shooter with good community

counterstrike global offensive is one of the best fps games ive ever played you will never get bored playing it over and over because everyday you will learn new tricks and tips which will upgrade your skills the best veteran part is the aiming it self i highly recommend to download training maps and train for your aim because its very important to upgrade your aiming skills in order to countinue processing this game basicly the game graphics is pretty nice with low amount of bugs the only issues are random votecalls by players ingame rusty and unfair ranking system overvalued items addiction i rate 1010

its a great game that has its downsides  you will 2 out of 3 times get in a team with flaming russians that are premade so you cant kick them  the ranking system is totally ed up win 8 games in a row and then loose 2 and get deranked  you will rage and throw your computer away but after that you will still get your  together only to come back and rage some more

it is truly worth the money this next installment of the notorious counterstrike series takes it to an all new level featuring breaktaking nostalgia and even new maps to conquer along with weapons with different stats and skins your gun will be unique down to the very bone of your trigger finger dont miss out on this great game
recommended
the ultimate competitive shooter steep learning curve and a gigantic amount of fun 16 was a classic source was magnificent and this well lets just say it is a mix between those two update little things that i hate about this game that are still here  overpowered and cost effective pistols  round and bomb timers on competitive valve servers  64 tick on competitive valve servers  flashbangs still suck balls  hand grenades still suck balls  smoke grenades are still overpowered  maps are very constrictive  m249 needs buffcost reduction  shotguns should get some more shot  smgs deserve moresomething  movement is still more fast paced than previous counter strike games 810 unfortunately the game right now is all about the new skins and the new knives wow cool wow
recommended
the best mix out of source and 16
recommended
great game

this game is about many things one of the things is to switch your weapons back and forth thats 70% of the game the other thing that this game is about is spamming the f key thats 15% and the the other 15% is to use psycology tacticts and aiming to kill the enemy team with your team 900100 would spam f again

edit  after much playing time and at least 40 bucks put into the game its safe to say that i have fallen victim to this first person shooters cruel ways i cannot seem to help myself when it comes to unboxing no matter how much i tell myself its a game and how slim the chances are of getting an expensive knife to brag about i still find myself unboxing and unboxing its almost as bad as breaking an addiction to drugs it takes a good year to break the addiction and help from a few friends and by the time you have broken the addiction youre broke and miserable i couldve spent the remaining 10 dollars on my account on another game but next thing you know i find myself unboxing another crate only to earn an item worth five cents to someone who doesnt play csgo a few pixels ingame may not seem that valuable believe me i thought this too but once you start to play this game your credit card info is already being punched into steam and next thing you know youre doing a 20 crate unbox via livestream its so upsetting unless youre one of the lucky few who get something good you vow to yourself that you are going to quit but you are back and playing the next morning i must give credit to gaben for coming up with such a successful idea the fact that a man can make hundreds of millions from a game involving a few skins that dont affect game experience is amazing but once you realize the harsh reality of your purchases and such you start to feel as much misery and regret as a man who skydives from a plane only to find out he forgot his parachute now for the gameplay this game is actually fun if you can get through a week without getting yourself a seven day ban if youre an obedient player who respects teammates and never leaves games early then youre golden however if you happen to misclick and kill a team mate or the power goes out during a game youll most likely find yourself a nice fat competitive cooldown which is just a polite way of saying youre banned yes i know players who dont follow the rules should be delivered corresponding consequences but one can find themselves receiving a ban for some of the most peculiar reasons for example someone can be banned from playing for kicking too many players for starters kicking a player is majority rule so chances are if you decide to kick someone from a game theyre not doing diddly crap to help the team if you get enough of these dimwads kicked you pay the price for it kicking players for a reason is much different than kicking players for the hell of it which the game fails to understand from personal experience i have never gotten a seven day ban but i have known plenty of people who have from ways such as this most bans are well deserved but a few are unjust and unavoidable this game has a 0 tolerance policy towards the latter for a summary of things so far you pay loads of money to earn a few pixels and the ban system can be unjust at times but dont get me wrong  this game is far from bad in fact i would easily recommend it to someone whos into games this game takes time to master and actually involves skill along with strategy unlike many games today which strongly revolve around luck skill plays a major role in this game because without it youll wind up in the lower ranks of the game lastly i would like to talk about the community among the squeakers spoiled brats white kids who think theyre black neonazis and etc there are actually some pretty decent people you can meet if youre looking for a place to make friends this is the exact wrong place to do it however the community makes for an interesting experience which you can find no other place i make it sound bad i know but there are some very intelligent and bright individuals who you can learn a lot from ingame to wrap things up before this review gets so long i publish it and make it a novel i would like to say csgo is an expertly made game used to earn tons of money everyday while most of the review has a negative connotation i would like to say that this game is probably one of the best games you can find on the market today which is a major accomplishment considering all the competiton between nextgen consoles and new technology being released well done gaben well done tldr  while csgo may take your money and create mindblowing rage its still an addicting shooter with a simple concept which has unique perks that no other game has

this is one of the greatest competitive games of all time definetly the best competitive fps this game is an amazing amount of fun if you started playing in sourcein which case you probably own this already or if your a new player like i was first of all it is great to see you and your friends skill develop as you get higher up the ranks and you can sill have a good evenly matched game if you are in the lower ranks second of all the community of this game is pretty much endless and that means there are always new maps coming out and hundreds of custom gamemodes this game really diferentiates from other games on the market right now with its learning curve and skill cap if you dont own this game you are doing yourself a diservice and for 12 or $15 this game is a complete steal for the amount of hours you can put into it

csgo is a broken game with broken mechanics and broken gameplay much like volvos other love baby dota 2 although csgo will forever fail to match the unfathomable depth of trashtier into which dota so neatly fits where you are subject to internet russians clicking on you while hurling abuse and touching themselves at night amidst smurfs and angry eastern europeans one may find themselves wondering why they even bother to sink time into the game am i talking about csgo or dota you ask doesnt even matter dont matter how sht looks it all stinks in the end volvo pls pls 1010 would spend hundreds of pounds on again

recent intel reports suggests the likelihood of isis using csgo as a platform to train talented terrorists scout for new members and conduct trials for recruits they hide under common everyday aliases training 10 hours a day sometimes practising their hacking skills which explains why the servers will never truly be empty and this game will never truly die due to the underground growing population of isis during the process of training those rare skins earned by thousands daily are in turn sold illegally to the world for real cash to fund their terror operations as far as we know isis strategy & actions had been successful in globally offending everyone

this is an amazing 10 out of 10 competitive teambased fps for the pc that has all the emphases on team this game is nonstop action that requirs constant comunication and fast reactions this is no cod or battlefield this is hardcore no jokes the basic idea of the game is  5 on 5 terrorists vs counter terrorist the terroritsts have to plant a bomb on 1 of 2 bombsites the counterterorists need to either kill all the terrorits defuse the bomb or prevent the terrorests from planting the bomb in 2 minites easier said then done stay low move fast shoot first die lastone shot one kill no luck pure skill

pros  good graphics  balanced  good match making system  good trading community  steam workshop support  5 vs 5 combat  1st person shooter cons  people trick the match making system so they play with lower ranked people so they never get out of their tier  people troll and mic spam a lot  no single player  missions coins that you buy will permanently expire whenever valve wants them to so you can no longer play missions conclusion this game is a teambased shooter that has not single player missions it is a multiplayer only game this game has nice graphics that suit the style of the game and also has well made maps some maps are made by the community and so are almost all gun skins gun skins are very well made and are the little bit ion top that makes this game a lot better this game is nicely made and it mainly consists of 5 vs 5 combat with other people the only this that makes this game a little bit worse is the lack of help that is given whenever you report someone for being trolls and things like that overall rating 910

long ago exactly 359 hours ago of gameplay i was called forth by lord gaben he spoke of a world soon to enter our galaxy steam i one of the many chosen lined up row by row shoulder by shoulder inside of his commander room he stood before us wearing a jigsaw mask and said lets play a game before all went black upon the 100 hour mark i finally grasped the concept of the world the inhabitants of the world called it counter strike because the counter terrorist forces are trying all they can to counter the terrorists strike in this world of counter strike theres a raging war between two groups hence global offensive in my journeys i have kept note of everything i have learnt about this bizzar world there are many raging endless wars held in different dimentions with ten people in the battle the heart of the war lies in the sacred grounds of de_dust 2 over thousands of dimentions have been put up to hold every single battle of each ten participants but at times during the teleportation one can suddenly have a heart attack and end up canceling the twenty second count down to start the battle this happened to me too many times but i kept on going lord gaben made clones of himself using his shadow clone ability to monitor each and every battle managing them ever so properly from a birds eye view that feeling of being watched will never leave me nor the other chosen at the beginning of the battle you become able to summon a magical interface that allows you to select anything you want at the cost of money which you earn by completing objectives solve an equasion with the alien locatorlike calculator to plant it in the super secret sites known as a and b to sum it up the counter terrorists are basically aliens who plan to not only eliminate you with their overpriced weapons but to force you to join forces with them after the battle to strenghten their queen alien after 200 hours i noticed that as a terrorist after taking off my old mask and clothes that ive worn since the beginning of time i noticed that my skin was a very light green and underneath my black shades were pitch black eyes dear god at that moment i realised that terrorists were preditors but that didnt stop there one day at the 300 hour mark after hitting nova 2 they came oh gaben dear gaben no they were small blue and wore white robes as they held their mini pea shooters in their tiny arms it was them the smurfs i realised that it was this time of the year again the steam universal trade off where anyone could clone themselves to paricipate in the war of counter strike never have i been so frightened in my entrie life and on the other side of the battlefield were the legendary nip warlords of the game knights of gaben and the antibiotics of everything hell broke loose in this battle and i found myself getting beaten up by the yellow ninjas in pyjamas who resembed the bannanas in pyjamas almost perfectly then it hit me when they became terrorists one of them wrote on the tellekenetic mid 2 b i immediately knew their true identities the murderous bannanas in pyjamas 350 hours over and at this point i decided to open some of the cases i gained from air ships that passed by every morning only the ones nearby and away from everyone else dear gaben i heard from an old man that he became mentally distressed the moment he picked up an ak47 fire serpent factory new from a drop not because of the pure beauty of the gun no but because of the horrific amount of people who u wot m8 thats a gr8 b8 m8 give us ya lighterd him and now at 359 hours of play i realised that there are other people watching on gotv at that moment i knew the deadly and sorroful secret of the world of counter strike its a tv show hosted by gaben and millions of people are watching us right now watching your moves 1010ign waiting for counter strike isolation ready to kick some ct alien  910pc gamer well the could have done better with the drama 99100rock paper scissors just like rock paper scissors only with skyrim 1337 game informer love the romance element goty for sure

its a great game that has its downsides  you will 2 out of 3 times get in a team with flaming russians that are premade so you cant kick them  the ranking system is totally ed up win 8 games in a row and then loose 2 and get deranked  you will rage and throw your computer away but after that you will still get your  together only to come back and rage some more

my experience in csgo i went into this game thinking its just another generic shooter aim down the sights aim for the head all that sort of  but then i found out about skins buy a 40c gun max im ever going to pay for skins is $3 i told myself 2 months later buys a $25 gun that was a rediculous waste of money 6 weeks later buys a $63 gun im pushing it one week later buys a $130 knife and hopes one day an m4a4 howl will be in his inventory if you want to buy this game go into it knowing your not spending $15 on it your going to spend hundreds thousands tens of thousands of dollars on it in some cases oh and the cases if your going to be stupid and waste your money on skins dont try to get them via cases 1010 best money waste simulator

the ultimate competitive shooter steep learning curve and a gigantic amount of fun 16 was a classic source was magnificent and this well lets just say it is a mix between those two update little things that i hate about this game that are still here  overpowered and cost effective pistols  round and bomb timers on competitive valve servers  64 tick on competitive valve servers  flashbangs still suck balls  hand grenades still suck balls  smoke grenades are still overpowered  maps are very constrictive  m249 needs buffcost reduction  shotguns should get some more shot  smgs deserve moresomething  movement is still more fast paced than previous counter strike games 810 unfortunately the game right now is all about the new skins and the new knives wow cool wow

this game is ok with friends but randoms just suck there is no teamwork usage just like those who play cod for some reason no one ever buys wards and enemy team always ganks us as they plantdiffuse the bomb there are only 2 sides ct and t side and most maps are always t sided so we get rekt on the ct side plus the queen be saving all the money for her crumpits and tea so she raises the price of the guns on the ct side and we always poor like we in the struggle or something like wtf is up with that the t side got all the newest pairs or jordans and cts stuck with some ratchet walmart brand shoes treyarch better add a welfare system to this game or im not gonna put up with this no more my final verdict on the game is a 1010 could be better

counterstrike global offensive is a first person shooter that demands group strategy and communication in order to win i have played hundreds of hours and keep coming back for more the community can be discriminatory at times however there is always the option of muting a player the game itself updates frequently via steam which can cause delays in matchmaking but it only takes a few minutes my only qualm with csgo is the blatant lack of registry encountered in some matches it does not happen often but when it does it is frustrating overall i have played cs for 5 years and have met some talented playersfriends and wouldnt change it for the world for those of you interested in joining a good cause please visit the no troll group page for information on my anticyberbullying campaign i am the founder good luck and have fun

coming from a long history of 16 and division 1 competitive lan finals i skipped source i returned to counter strike after a long hiatus and am finding the game decent valve has done a great job of capturing the essence of what i loved about 16 and implementing it into their own game although some of the maps have changed some for the better and some for worse inferno mainly overall my experience has been positive and i have had a good time ranking up with my buddies from strokecity elpmeister he nem corn inzayn sponsored by ozbongs liam pain he nat go gym anymor he say diamond direktor he sell pill dumsan dumsan dumman feels berlin he always leav cal earli 4 sum reason i dunno and many more i find the game crispy salty not too greasy csgo is good and a buy  leonards food reviews

recent intel reports suggests the likelihood of isis using csgo as a platform to train talented terrorists scout for new members and conduct trials for recruits they hide under common everyday aliases training 10 hours a day sometimes practising their hacking skills which explains why the servers will never truly be empty and this game will never truly die due to the underground growing population of isis during the process of training those rare skins earned by thousands daily are in turn sold illegally to the world for real cash to fund their terror operations as far as we know isis strategy & actions had been successful in globally offending everyone

amazing game recomend to all to play

recommended
it may be fifteen dollars but is a fantastic game for all who love strategic and fps games it is short combat 5v5 and has weapons from awps sniper rifle to negevs heavy fire machine gun and more it also comes with a different combination of grenades and pistols the only downside is that people tend to get serious over nothing but is still tons of fun so if you want to buy it then buy it because it is definitly worth fifteen dollars if you love any valve game or shooter game than this is the game for you

the best first person shooter ive ever played it has addictive gameplay i would say more but im not even sure if its good its just so addicitve  its the minecraft of first person shooters better yet i even managed to get my money back from buying the game i even got profit the ingame drops can be worth up to 2000 now that there should be enough reason to make anyone buy it its basically free and in some cases they pay you to play the game profit from selling drops it has an economy system great gameplay on loads of maps updated frequently with new maps and operations and workshop support for community maps and even the ability to make your own skins to appear ingame it also has custom game mods such as jailbreak and zombie escape if thats your sort of thing personally i prefer competitive gameplay its not just click play and casually kill people each round is like life or death you win you could get rankedup lose and it could be back to silver i of course not literally this is metaphorically speaking although it could be literal for some players you get cooperative teams where the people dont just shout at you or shoot at you most of the time its esports for everyone overall my favourite game on steam hopefully soon my most played it already would be if it wasnt for garrys mods loading times 1010 ps if theres any spelling mistakes complain to valve not me as there is no spellcheck and i often make mistakes while typing

a game tipically the romeo & julet complex two sides who hate each other enough to kill in the end boths side find out that its pointless to fight so they make a game out of killing each other as the generation go by the forget and it turns into the pc vs mac formula where they hate each other because it bacame a thing and they both benfit and the need to keep up apperances if you lucky you can catch them both in the house on sundays

let me get this started using the 7 non sins 1 the ease of competitive use in this game is amazing having a rank system so that you can be placed with people of a similar skill and getting into a game without a 3rd party service 2    3 the game is constantly updated 4 valve actively supports the professional scene 5 the game is balanced 6 the game is cheap 7 there is no fecal matter smeared around the screen while playing

pre ordered for $1250 valve will never release a game above $20 and half life 3 better not be above $20 hehehe anyway you need to play the game to get better and better although they almost made it like team fortress 2 when they put in items because alot of people started to care about how they look the game is fun but its hard to run it on lan the game is often on sale sometimes as low as $375 its good to see that valve has finally created a new game with the source engine they added new guns  effects new maps its a new counter strike but unlike call of duty you dont have to pay a rubbish $80 the competitive feature on this game is amazing on how youre sort of ranked based on youre skill level but not really because there is always that one guy on youre team smurfs and hackers so chase chickens 1010

better than cod xd

i think that 50% of the people who play this game only have three words in there vocabulary noob kick and me

some background information counterstrike  global offensive abbreviated as csgo it is the third game in the series after counterstrike and counterstrike  source it is a teambased tactical shooter lets get down to it this is not a game for people who merely wish to rack up immense kills or boast about their threesixty no scope headshot wallbang because this is no cod this is a teambased tactical shooter with many strategies and jargon counterstrike global offensive is not your average fps game sense and skill are very important when it comes to csgo what to expect out of particular opponents and the most likely situations youll be facing is a key part of the game if you wish to rack up kills run and gun and just barge into t spawn guns blazing with no plan this is not the game for you skill is the most important aspect and the most unique aspect of csgo and in any counterstrike game at that you will gun run and be outgunned but the most important part is to rise again and to learn from mistakes how did he get me what did i do wrong someone running around with an m4 and shooting every teammate in the face with a shot to the head does not necessarily mean hacks players can always be better and most of the time will be better than you so you need to learn to be better than them all in all csgo is one of the best games i have played the amount of teamwork and skill here is more than what i have experienced from other team based tactical shooters in short if you are looking for a hard to master easy to play competitive tactical based shooter pick this game up its very much worth it

ahh one of my favorite games i was never in to cs i bought css for the garrys mod content and whenever i tried to play it i would get destroyed even by bots i do admit i was terrible at the game but it really never appealed to me the day that i got csgo i went into it with the same mentallity and opened up a match of office with easy bots instantly i noticed the updated graphics and it looks good to this day i ran around for a bit and fired off a couple shots with my pistol then a bot came to try and ruin my day i fired at him rapidly with my handgun and he actually died if that would of been css my brain would of been merged with the wall and i would of been looking at the bots on my team walk into walls suprised with myself i carried on and made it to the second round alive i opened up the buy menu to find out the mp5 had been replaced rip neva 4get with the mp7 i bought it and looked for some bots to murder i managed to kill 2 of them before getting shot in the back with a shotgun while i groaned at myself for dying and having to wait for the remaining bots to duke it out i noticed that you could take control of the bots and play as them i was very happy with this feature at the time and i am still happy with it now after getting used to the recoil and spray patterns i saw a gametype called competive and i applied to a match of it it was on de_dust2 and i got a couple of kills by luck with my trusty mp7 i was amazed by how noob friendly the game was and how it had matched me with people of similar skill levels after that match i decided to go again and again and again if you are looking to get into a competive shooter that is mostly skill based get this game also it can go for really cheap in sales thanks for reading pyro the p90 exists

i bought this game and now i have a fluent spanish 1010 comprara otra vez jajajaja

counterstrike is a very nice and sexy competitive game that will role on the steam top sells list for years to come mostly because its something in it for everyone stuff like you can run around killing chickens and not have a care in the world or play a game of competitive game with your pals and russian people on the internet bytheway all russians are not idiots only a hand full of then 911 its worte the money if you like the competitive spektrum p i finally got my first knife on may 28 gut knife  rust coat d goodbirthday p

well if youre sick of 12 year olds on call of duty and you cant deal with the hard core veterans of battlefield then csgo is not the game for you i am constantly dealing with russian 12 year olds which are like a super version of the common cod 12 year old and you cant understand them and then theres the hardcore pro players who have never seen the light of day they are the best seriously i have never been called a noob so many times in one sentence all in all one of the best fpss ive ever played oh you thought this was a negitive review nah the satisfaction of killing these guys is insanely rewarding
recommended
when my friends tell me they want to buy csgo i always tell them its unlike any other fps out there the amount of practice and hours needed to play the game right is truly overwhelming to new players my friends always say what are you talking about man you just run around shooting people and that mindset is the biggest mistake you can make when trying to learn csgo the things that make this game great and distinguish it from any other fps are also the things that make players who come in thinking they just bought another call of duty quit after their first match saying they wasted their money you will spend the entire time youre playing this game trying to master recoil and spray control gain a prolific knowledge of the maps develop a mind for strategy learn to communicate effectively as a team learn grenade positions learn timing learn callouts learn crosshair placement etc the hardest thing for new players to accept is that there is always someone better than you you must have a humble approach to the game when first starting and be willing to learn from anyone this is the ultimate fps and is worth every penny spent on it but just beware that when you buy csgo youre probably signing up for a lot more than you realized

pls buy mic before you play game thanks  1110

love the competitive side of this game awesome smoke spots crazy boosts and standing on your friends heads to get an awp kill oh yes the jumping scout spots this game is great unless you get it and go straight to competitive dont do it do not but at the same time it sucks how the community is seen as a bunch of avid gamblers between jackpot cases and betting thats what most people see cs as these days other than that great game 1110 gonna buy again

the only thing better than having great team work accuracy and always winning is doing it all with style or with reskins
recommended
so after 200hr on csgo i have my first comment ready well it is fast paced which i really love cause you never know where the enemy will be next and fast response is required you have to train hard to become actually better so be prepared if you buy this gamesucces isnt given if you feel the crossahair isnt suitable to you change right away and try others  a map on workshop gives you that with no hassle a good team is necessary if you want to win game because cs is a teamwork gamenot a i go ego on myself i hope for a shot but if you want just fun get your friends in a laugh about fails and so on d and that is basicly it for the good things here but now the matchmaking system is horrible i recently got banned by 4 russians just because i wasnt speaking theyre language i mean wtf and valve responds with its automatically we cantthats crap they could if they wanted to smurfs and cheaters that just think they are awesome for beating up other people and opthey are douches in every wayplay fair cheaters and smurfs play in your league the keys are expensive in regards of the full game5 keys is one csgo copy i think they should be 1 eur at best all together i still can recommend the game cause i think its fun to play with friends laugh at the fails and just have a good time 
recommended
that luck when you get knife ^_^ 1010

great game and a challenging fps unlike most other fpss recoil plays a huge factor in this game the online play is amazing and fun overall i reccomend this to anyone looking for a cheap fps with quality content cant go wrong with spending 15$

one of the best good work valve

counterstrike global offensive csgo for short its a sequel for the clasic shooter counterstrikesource and 16  the game its still folowing the same core gameplay like in the other games but csgo has better hitboxes than the other ones and its more polished the game started since 1999 15 and its still played this says allot about the reaplay value of this game the game its skillbased and its way diffrent than cod or battlefield there are no iron sights beside sg 553 and aug witch are still haveing allot of recoil the most famous maps like de_dust2de_nukede_infernocs_officecs_assault are back and even more balanced that they used to be in 16 or source the graphics arent great but this its a good thing because in this game you really need high fps if you want to play good at the ingame competitive mode the textures are preaty outdated but on the other hand shaders and antialiasing make the game look great even tough its runed on a 10 year old engine but masively modified source the game has its own problems like on the valve official servers the tickrate witch its a very important factor in a multipalayer shoooter game its 64 still more than bf4s 32 but still not enough  its perfectly fine if you play casual but on competitive its going to anoy you if you cleary hit a shot with awp or headshot with ak but then you see you actauly didnt do any damage cause the bullet didnt get registred for its price the game its very cheap  11 euro  15 dolars the game its underpriced in my opinion i would give 30$ for it  its amazeinly fun to play with machine guns on deathmatch servers or run and kill chickens on inferno while you should defend the bomb site  the big problem with this game on higher skill matchmakeing its that there are quite allot of cheaters and vac isnt that great this game its great game underpriceda lot of fun you can play it for a long time and you can get your friends to play too since its extremly cheap  you can make money from the ingame economy too but the problems like tickrate the cheaters and the fact that sometimes the hitboxes arent working very rare are detucting from its value the game gets an 88 from me with verdict of a great game perfect to chill out with your friends while screaming away that you just got an ace or an awesome item from cases good luck players

a game tipically the romeo & julet complex two sides who hate each other enough to kill in the end boths side find out that its pointless to fight so they make a game out of killing each other as the generation go by the forget and it turns into the pc vs mac formula where they hate each other because it bacame a thing and they both benfit and the need to keep up apperances if you lucky you can catch them both in the house on sundays

the game is really hooking really satisfying and as the price is fine it is worth it totally this is also one of gabens most vicious way to secretly take your money without noticing you will once or twice add funds to your wallet then you stop to think about it and realize how much youve spent next moment you find yourself opening yet again a new case and with gaben looking behind your shoulder once again you get nothing from it if you have an addiction of gambling i highly recommend this game
recommended
one of the fastest growing esports around and its not hard to see why pros learning curve forces improvement casual based and competitive based game modes huge community personalise your inventory with weapon skins cons matchmaking is rather broken 64 tick servers many toxic players steep learning curve for some hackers galore in matchmaking beware all in all there are 3rd party clients that can provide a solid competitive experience such as faceit  its a solid game with no real flaws apart from the community why not give it a shot
recommended
1 of the best shootergames out there
recommended
everyone has to smoke mid at least one time in their lives recommended to all 3
recommended
a bit of a mixed review its a great game no doubt if your already ranked in competitive if your new to the game beware of the 2 win 24 hour cooldown until you get 10 wins & the in general cooldown system is a bit off other than those this is a great game
recommended
this is the best first person shooter i have played
recommended
best competitive shooter period smurfs make the rank advancement hard but if you invest time in the game youre going to reach the higher ranks and if you are aware of selfcriticism you can learn a thing or 2 from those s and dont buy keys its just not worth it if you want a knife buy a knife that will be way cheaper than gambling on open cases
recommended
such a great game everything is so awesome graphics gameplay everything my competitive wont work but still a great game if you could help me fix the problem please send me a friend request and we can talk about it i would rate it 1010 such a good game

counter strike global offensive review overview counter strike global offensive csgo or go for short is an online tactical and firstperson shooter the aim of the game depends on the game mode game modes consist of modes like demolition and hostage rescue modes in demolition the terrorists t for short have to plant a bomb at one of two sites site a or site b the counterterrorists ct for short have to stop the terrorists by erradicating the enemy team each player starts off with a standard pistol and $800 which they can buy other weapons and gear with as you progress through the game winning or losing you gain more cash to get bigger and better weapons the first to win 16 rounds wins in hostage rescue the terrorists most protect the hostages from the counterterrorists while the counterterrorists must take the hostages to the evac zone marked in green on the minimap if either team erradicates the other they win in casual your rank is not affected by your winsloses other modes like surfing and cas team deathmatch are in here ranks catagory score statement gameplay 9 gameplay is fun and quick however it can get really intense at times making it more fun graphics 7 graphics are a plus for this addition to the counterstrike series it is a very good looking game to play in teamwork 9 teamwork is esential in this game otherwise the game is ruined [table]

the campagn is way to short and the multiplayer sucks because the bullets just go everywhere how am i supposed to hit anything like that also for some reason my killstreaks didnt work and when i finally got a levelup to silver 2 i didnt get any new weapons why would i play a game where i cant unlock anything better how am i supposed to kill those stupid noobs who didnt play the game nearly as long as i did if i dont have better weapons than them dont buy this game its just a broken call of duty copy without any tactical elements and rewards for playing this game for a long time 310

i learned russian in two weeks 1010

i tried the game its okay but competetive matchmaking doesnt allow you to play with your friends if they have been randomly chosen to have a better rank than you unless you have 5 friends that you can get to play at the same time if you play the game in europe youll learn fluent russian in one month it would be a nice game to play as a team but when there is one guy shouting in polish two in russian and two in english its kind of hard to play but dont worry once youll learn the russian language the game becomes playable

before playing csgo   who tf would pay $300 for a virtual knife  after playing csgo   im gonna spend my christmas money on a knife  on a more serious note i really liked the game and have invested many hours into it  38 hrs in the past 2 weeks and i can only play on weekends including fridays so basically ive spent about a third of my weekend if the math adds up this past 2 weeks on csgo  i find it really fun to play id just say if its youre very first time palying csgo on pc dont head straight into competitive i played csgo on the xbox since it was released and was decent at it so i thought it would also apply to pc but i wasnt accustomed to the mouse and keyboard and lost a bunch of games in competitive and after my 10 wins i got placed in silver however i am getting the hang of it now and am pretty much topfragging everygame just got promoted recently and pretty much im aiming to climb to nova during winter break past experiences with this series as said before ive played it csgo on the xbox ive also played the original cs and cscz but ive never touched source before id make a comparison but i was really young when i played this so it wouldnt be very accurate communitywise i havent ran into many toxic players most people are willing to communicate and are pretty nice this game does have its share of 12 year olds and people who like to constantly talk to the fact that you cant concentrate but that is very small i rarely meet any of these bad people id also say that from my point of view the game is pretty balanced between the 2 sides i mean sure the t ak is 1 hit headshot  oh yeah aim for headshots ight be hard at first but youll quickly get the hang of it  while the ct m4 is 2 youve got to remember that cts are usually the ones defending you actually have to get that headshot you can always pick up an ak from a dead t and you switch sides at 15 rounds and unless youre 015 it should even out tldr my overall rating of the game 1010 really enjoyed palying it and will continue to do so

lately i am playing al lot of counter strike global offensive sometimes it sucks reallyreally hard but i cant stop playing it i dont no why i am still playing this the game is really popular in our community maybe because even cheap pcs can run it without lags and other problems the graphics are ok but this game isnt about graphics at all its about skill experience tactics and the most importantteamwork this is what makes the game soo difficult too 
recommended
ur my gurd this is like the best freaking game ever i think i might have a gambling addiction but who the  cares
recommended
so im going to keep this short and sweet this game pisses me off so much but it also gives me the most satisfaction from any fps i have ever played 910 cause the people suck
recommended
counterstrike global offensive is one of the best maybe even the best shooter at the moment i used to play call of duty a couple years ago but friends convinced me to play csgo and i dont regret it it offers a good gameplay a decent difficulty and a large playerbase you need good aim movement and the social ability to play in a team the game offers a matchmaking system and different gamemodes to play  competitive matchmaking > queue up alone or with up to 5 people to compete against other players on your rank  deathmatch > grab a gun and kill the enemy if you die you respawn the player with the most points in the end wins  arms race > kill enemys to gain new weapons and finish your streak and the game with a golden knife kill  demolition > a mixture of the bomb scenario and arms race plant or defuse the bomb and gain new weapons by killing enemys  custom serverbrowser > like in every other counterstrike game competitive matchmaking is the way the game is meant to be played two teams compete at each other and play a best of 30 rounds bomb or hostage scenario both teams will play as ct and t during the match counterterrorists  defend the bombside rescue the hostages andor kill the terrorists terrorists  plant the bomb defend the hostages andor kill the counterterrorists within the timelimit whenever you play counterstrike keep in mind that this game is no game for i only care about myself plebs even if you manage to get some good shots and get a round by yourself you usually screw your team and lose more rounds by not playing with your team unfortunately there are many people in this game who play like this either they dont talk get mad once you lose a couple rounds or perhaps even insult you in a language you never heard of before you can get lucky and get decent to even nice teammates but when you queue alone it is like playing russian roulette warning joke inc pro  good gameplay  decent difficulty  serverbrowser  competitive matchmaking  large playerbase con  cheaterssmurfs here and there  harsh learning curve  many unfriendly players i advise you to buy this game if you are interested in a very good fps shooter with very active playerbase i hope this review helped you in any way and would really like to see you ingame

best game available on steam why dont ask just buy pro csgo is just the best shooter in my opinion okay the graphics aint as good as the graphics of some newer titles but cs was never meant to have the best graphics cs is about skill about getting better about training and about inhuman reactions eh nevermind lets just go on without training you wont reach anything in this game and thats why its nice  there is actually some challenge basically its just a competetive shooter for those who want to play a game where you have to aim yourself thats what you use the mouse for and which isnt actually a console game if you dont like that then dont cry  the next cod is almost released now cod xtreme super warfare iii now extra casual contra there is a lot they should be fixing in terms of matchmaking like upgrading their servers to 128 tick etc and no i dont hate you cause youre playing cod we just cant be friends any more d

i ed this game right in the p[ussy

as far as fps goes this is the best i had never played the original counter strike or source but heard many good things about it if you are looking for a game which requires solid teamwork rather than solo play then this is for you and the best part is you learn plenty of russian swear words
recommended
this game is pretty damn awesome its purely multiplayer based so if u dont have good internet connection do not get this game if u fall into category 2 have good internet connection i wholeheartedly reccommend this game great graphics gameplay and generally never laggy many different modes to play i personally like the arms race and classic modes and a whole hell of a lot of strategy needed 1st game that i award a 1010 i love this game

this game is amazing not ever fps game can match its physics match its teamwork cooperation inorder to win if you dont have teamwork you wont win this makes it a growing game for not only itself but for the community the maps and game in general is voted on and based off the csgo community thoughts that results in less complaints and better gameplay they even have a workshop for you to creat your ideas and submit them this game is absulutly amazing

ive played bad games and this isnt one of them

navi but besides that its 1010

at first i was hesitant about purchasing counterstrike id heard of its lack of ads and didnt know if i could possibly get into it but when i saw it go on sale i decided to grab it and holy balls its worth every penny i started logging hours into casual and got to grips with the hipfiring but i knew i needed a real challenge so i decided to try out competitive 100 percent team based you will lose if you dont communicate with your team which i absolutely adore the only problem i have with the game is the slight smurf and cheating problems that come with all games but its quite rare for me atleast to get into a server with a smurf or cheater for those of you who dont know a smurf is a highly skilled player creating alternate steam accounts to decimate lower ranks in competitive other than that its a truly flawless fps that i highly recommend any pvp fans purchase immediately
recommended
lets start off by saying this game is the best one in the cs series id say that csgo is a remade version of 16 which suits the needs of the current generation  better graphics stuff is fancy there is also this gambling aspect of opening cases and betting skins i really do not know if i like it or not some kids get happy over their new stuff while the other kids are crying after losing their whole skin collection in one click now the game itself theres a new mode called competitive people take this rather seriously you can play it to get higher in rank  in case youve got what it needs to get there which means youll get better opponents when you advance remember that you have to be on the same or higher level as your opponents to get higher you can also play it to realize you belong to the bottom floor but being on the bottom floor is okay right you can only get better note remember this is a team game try to cooperate with your team the best as you can of course csgo also has the classic server browser wherein you can browse the servers search them by tagsmapsplayer countping regular stuff some of these servers also feature funmodes which you can play when you feel like playing csgo but you cba to tryhard most of those servers are noobfriendly this game is updated constantly which means tweaks to guns if some are deemed overpowered or underpowered new skins new operations new maps and more be sure to have your credit card ready when these things happen though
recommended
in this game you can learn russian language from cover to cover

this is a wonderful and challenging game learning the recoil patterns is really fun also the skins are just so cool id definiatly recommend this for anyone

i would say this game is pretty awesome since its more realistic than bf or cod when you shoot somebody in the head with a proper weapon they die unlike in some other games recoil is pretty realistic for each weapon like the ak compare the recoils of cs and cod and u will smell  on which one is up to you also its more community friendly and is good linked with steam with the community market n stuff the idea with adding skin made by people using steam is pretty sweet too in fact i like everything about this game expect that u instantly get called bljat by joining comp 3

if cocaine did cocaine it would be no where near to how addictive this exellectly executed firstpersonshooter is great maps a competetive community and collectables such as ingameskins make this gem even better ive played both ghosts and battlefield 4 and honestly i dont think they have the competitive capabilities replayability or friendly community of this game outside the game there are professional teams that are both incredibly entertaining and extrodinarily insightful so many styles can be exploited in game whether youre defensive and like to let the enemies come to you awp or you like to flashbang your way in then spray a hundred bullets like a true god of war negev theres no wrong way to play the game csgo is one of the games i will be playing into the next decade and well beyond that 1010 would reccommend

cso is a game thatll always make you come back for more  apart from its already renowed gameplay generations have been playing  cs  go brings new features to the franchise  pros  the key to victory is teamplay  rare those days  great matchmaking system new recoil system add depth and more challenge during firefights  every bullet matters great community  till now  vac keep hackers at bay  correct graphic engine made to support the biggest range of pcs while staying pretty  thats why we love source  workshop  thousands of free maps & skins to support cons   please valve  fix the matchmaking cooldown system or at least give us more time to reconnect  we need 5 min  nothing more   some pcs and routers cant restart in the blink of an eye after a power outage  it may make things easier for  quitters  but itll also help a lot of honest players being put on cooldown injustly  otherwise  i recommend this game to anyone who wants a nervous game with an incredible community  thank you for for this great game 
recommended
worth it 3

game is loads of fun recomended to all fun to play with friends

i saw a chicken i killed said chicken would eat kfc 1110

one of the most competitive games i have ever played while the community is poop garbage and matchmaking is very stupid you should still pick up this game if you have the competitive spirit i dont recommend this game if you arent willing to spend hours learning mechanics and practicing spray patterns using and learning the weapons as well as dealing with the mindbogglingly toxic community  if you want to learn russian and german and you dont want to buy rosetta stone buy this game youll learn them fluently in about 35 months tops
recommended
cool i think i  myself
recommended
do you want to just play the same 3 maps over and over and over again despite there being many more options do you want to sit there for hours corner camping close quarters areas with a sniper rifle that one shots someone even if you only hit their toe do you want to be constantly berated and told how you got rekt by a community with a combined iq of 10 if you answered yes to one or more of these questions then do not hesitate to buy this amazing game lose your mind as well as your shame as you slowly become just another part of the problem

this game taught me what ever team is winning is hacking

a great addition to the counterstrike series filled with many servers players old and new and the competitiveness of the people is just overwhelming the game welcomes any player beginner or veteran id recommend it to anyone who likes strategic plays positioning and a game takes incredible aiming and reaction speeds to beat your opponents
recommended
this is the best game ive ever played and since i discovered it i dont play other games anymore
recommended
counterstrike russian offensive language is a fpsgame where you kill other players while learning how to speak russian these friendly russian players will teach you how to speak their language really fast their mics are also of the highest quality so dont worry about headaches or bleeding ears if you need your fellow russians to answer you open chat and write  blyat ruskis for instant reaction a hilarious one at that warning your experience may vary
recommended
the gold standard of shooters
recommended
this game right here yes here this game is perfectwhen i first saw iti tought it would be like the other boring cs gamesbut no it changed my mind good graphics good gameplay you got to buy thisreally realistic
recommended
sadly there are no sprays in this game yes this means there is no longer porn all over cs_office i am sorry for your loss
recommended
counterstrike go is great fun while still introducing strong elements of strategy or perhaps it is fun because of the strategy while this game is not for everyone i would definiteley reccomend checking it out espicially with the new refund system valve has introduced csgo is one of the few tactical shooters out there some people might say ghost recon phantoms is tactical because you get bonuss for being near your team or something csgo is tactical because if your team isnt coordinating but the other team is it doesnt matter how good you are you will lose i dont know if it will be this way for you but each game feels crucial in csgo when the other team wins i actully feel a little depressed but when we win i feel amazing i have yet to find something in life than a 1v1 with bomb down 20 seconds left no kit you have to go now
recommended
ya its pretty good i guess

thousands of hours of fun for a very reasonable price if you like shooters have a tactical mind and like teamplay this is the game to buy
recommended
one of the best fps games ive ever played
recommended
love this game <3

its an ok game better than cscz in my opinion which i previously played in an old account before switching to csgo you get connected to matches in less than 10 seconds and server quality is overall acceptable the maps weapon balance except awp ak47 and p90 skins etc are all ok what i dont like about csgo is the horrible community especially mic chat its full of raging morons and smurfs who expect that you can do everything if you cant they try to kick you which fails most the time unless youre silver 1 there are too many smurfs in the game and valve still hasnt created a solution for it when in sale the game also becomes full of hackerscheaters which is a massive nuisance unfortunately csgo suffers from many glitches and poor optimization online gameplay is fragile with wifi unlike other games the could not retrieve your inventory bug also annoys me a lot csgo isnt beginnerfriendly although there are many players who arent smurfs many of them are playing cs for at least 5 years or more veteran coin this makes csgo very difficult for new players if worse even impossible to play the tutorial is very half and doesnt even explain the important basics of csgo well final rating 65100
recommended
after playing over 190 hours of this game i suppose id better give a review for it the gameplay of this game is extraordinary  the whole game is like all counterstrike games completely multiplayer meaning that the valve team can spend 100% of their time working on the game and making it run fine instead of faffing around with a singleplayer campaign 5% of players will bother to play past the first level the community however its terrible but if you just realise that this is a $15us game dont really take any offense to the little kids theyre everywhere but more so on call of duty to summarize this games excellent buy it now
recommended
a very good game
recommended
i learned pixel knives are worth more than real ones and a handful of the russian language from this game 1110

you will pour all of your efforts into this game you will not be good to start you cannot run around the map spraying people you will move into your parents basement so you can save on rent so you can buy more sweet skins your life as you know it is over

read the original version here [textuploadercom]  what i said in the previous version of this review was a bit too harsh like ive said before this game is amazing however what breaks the game for many people is valves silly anticheating measures and decisions in addition to their laziness in fixing even the simplest of things besides that weve had no real gameplay update in a very long time  apart from new operations which arent even made by valve again in its core csgo is a masterpiece of a game without a doubt it plays great and it has incredible amounts of depth while only making use of simplistic mechanics it has the potential to be the biggest esports title surpassing the moba genre even with its catering towards both casual and competetive players what the game is suffering from right now however is catering too much towards casual players and not paying attention to competetive playerss wishes and to the competetive community altogether vac hasnt still been improved and despite many complaints it still has questionable features such as banning people in waves more about that and the rest of the anticheating measures in a minute besides that csgo is plagued with small easytofix issues a few brief examples  weapon balancing  characterobject models being smaller than their hitboxes or vice versa see mirage a triplestack or dust ct character models  hitboxes in general jumping ladder and plant hitboxes are waaaaay off see this and this   competetive matchmaking servers being 64 tick instead of 128  hit detection and many more as you can see by the upload dates on the videos these issues have been apparent for almost a year if not more this shouldnt be happening to a very popular game made by a very successful company after plentiful complaints made by the community valve has not yet commented on the issues this highlights another issue  valves inability to listen and communicate there is no excuse to this as this hasnt always been an issue they listened back when csgo was just a shadow of what it is today because the game wasnt selling that is no longer the case i think the reason for valves laziness is the fact that theres nothing that can compete with global offensive right now most of the pc fps players are drawn over to csgo simply because there are not many other games they can play right now dota 2 gets clearly a lot more attention because it has 3 major competetitors as of right now i cant say for sure but it makes a lot of sense moving on i have a friend that is a private cheats developer and has a lot of experience in making them  he doesnt make them because he thinks its not morally wrong or whatever but literally just to make money as these things cost a lot of money  selling private personal cheats pay about 500800 dollars i dont fully agree with his decisions however id like to say that neither of us condone cheating in any way he has helped me in writing of this by giving me a more indepth look at how they work most of the following are based on his answers in a game with a competetive aspect or a competetive environment such as the official matchmaking servers cheating cannot by any means be an issue and should be kept very minimal yes no game is hack or cheatproof it is not possible to make such a system that keeps all the cheaters in check but for a game of this size cheating shouldnt be as big of a problem as it is now vac is terrible  and valve is aware of it and they showcase it by creating ingame anticheat solutions that potentially break the game for legitimate players heres an example one of these anticheat solutions as seen in the above video works by having the server create a trace between a player and other players heads if for whatever reason this trace is not finished or gets abrupted the enemy is not rendered on your computer its especially bad if the other players ping is high as the information received from the server takes longer to reach the client this fix is only mildly effective but it should help prevent wallhacking however it also affects legitimate players like the video showcased redacted it doesnt break wallhacks completely redacted for example if im on cat redacted i could still see a guy on goose redacted but i couldnt see a guy from ct spawn to t spawn anymore another one of these  solutions [imagesakamaisteamusercontentcom]  is unsynchronized weapon spread between the client and the server in the picture above red is what your client sees and blue is what the server sees ever shoot a whole magazine at someone and see all the bullets hitting directly behind them but only get a few hits that happens because of this this was implemented to prevent ragehackers when in reality it doesnt prevent ragehackers ability to continue ragehacking in anyway these arent the only ones there are a dozen more and they only barely hurt the cheaters while hurting the legitimate players just as much these arent solutions these are lazy changes which are called fixes when in reality they dont make the situation any better if vac were any better and could actually detect cheats with a bit more finesse these countermeasures wouldnt be needed at all if esea a third party matchmaking service can have a fairly decent anticheat so can valve now that weve established how poor vac is lets talk about the problems caused by cheating itself in my opinion the worst part about having a game with so many cheaters running rampant and so many cheats available is having to contemplate if someone is cheating or not its absolutely disgusting to be forced to sit in a game for atleast 30 minutes and watch your team get slaughtered every round because of a blatant cheater but its even more terrible to play a game where youre not sure if the other team had some kind of external help its discouraging its not fun to wait for the game to end and get frustrated so that you dont want to play anymore because as ive said before youre essentially playing a gamble when you queue up all you can do is hope that you dont get cheaters in your game leaving is not an option unless you want to get a temporary matchmaking ban having a surrender option available at all times would make this a lot better cheating is ruining competetive matchmaking and valve hasnt taken many steps to remedy that problem if you wish to play competetively your best bet would be third party matchmaking services unfortunately however as bad as all of this may sound most of these issues can be ignored especially if youre not huge into playing competetively the game is still balanced around the fact that both players have the ability to do what the other team is doing because of the sideswitching system at halftime  honestly the only issues besides cheating that youll be in contact with are hitbox and hit registering errors the game is still a lot of fun especially if you have friends you can play with i dont regret any of the 1000 hours ive played this game with my friends because they have all been memorable and very entertaining to say that the game is flawless or the best fps ever made would be silly however all in all buy it regardless of the issues with the game i would its cheap and there is nothing else like it so you dont have much choice anyway just be aware of the fact that theres 0% chance that valve is going to fix any of the issues with the game until theres something to compete with their game

csgo is a fantasy game about a young scottish man in the middleeast your goal is to clear the land of russians and anyone else who is foreign you have a large arsenal of guns also known as the ak47 m4a14 and the awp all other guns require a large ammount of rgn which is very silver the ak47 is a terrorist weapon used by the russians usually missing all shots and screaming ing noob you let my die  the way you respond to this is by holding tab right clicking their name and pressing block communication the awp is a large boltaction rifle used to take out enemies from a far the m4a14 are used by the counterterrorist team and are incredibly accurate all in all a fun game but if there were less russians it would be 1010 my review 69 not enough water

how to be a counter strike pro 1 buy a ridiculously overpriced alienware pc with a stupidly powerful cpu and a gpu from the 1990s 2 buy the most expensive razer keyboard and mouse cos yknow razer is the best brand 3 buy a ridiculously large mouse mat preferably razer 4 set your mouse dpi to the highest it can be and set your ingame sensitivity to the max 5 be totally oblivious to the fact that although your fps counter says you are getting 3000fps you are in fact only seeing 50 because youre using your dads old 19 inch tv screen 6 when in game buy a p90 and run straight down mid 7 see an enemy spin around ridiculously fast and spray wildly because your sensitivity is too high 8 die swear and insult teammates for not covering you 9 repeat from step 6 for added effect play on the lowest graphical settings and repeatedly switch weapons and wiggle your crosshair about because thats what kennys  jw  olofmeister do 1110  would be called a in nub by angry russian kids again

this game is the bext firstperson shooter i have ever played spend about 200 hours just playing casual hostage rescue games casual bomb defuse games and competitive matches but i also just found out about something not too long ago the community server listings people can make their own modded games like surf servers and jail break servers realistic graphics and effects favorite would have to be dropping your clip when you reload this game has upped my sense of competitiveness and sportsmanship in my life and i will never be bored again

spent almost 100 eur on this game lost over 200 eur on csgolounge spent almost 3000hrs on this game thats about 2 and a half months played nonstop or basicly little over year if you play everyday about 8 hrs learned many different languages like russian polish spanish swedish and better english destroyed many nerves made a lot of frag movies and lost a lot from my social life or basicly 1 year wasted of my life and fair amount of money in skins but i will still play because you can never stop 1010

beaut force makes you wanna play it even on 4050 fps recommended for anyone who loves the cs series and wants to go hd in style you may lag like a ragdoll with your crosshair feeling sluggish and slackingflopping about your enemies but nonetheless this game will keep you begging and grinding your teeth and sneakily outstretching your hand towards that cash you had saved up for your sisters wedding but always wanted to use on updating to that shiny new gpu the new arms racedemolition competitive and deathmatch [enabled by default] are great mods added at default functionality and funny seeing the bots they actually do seem like they have a vague impression of what is happening 1110 cs16 users would shut the door the moment they first open the game if you know what i mean

everyone has this game already if youre thinking of buying it just do it yesterday you said tomorrow so just do it dont let your dreams be dreams just doooo it and lose all of your money on gambling websites and opening cases then once you get to a high rank there are cheaters in every other game your only solution is to open more cases in hope of getting something good to pull you out of your spiraling depression after losing all your skins and hope of ranking up enjoy counter strike

csgo is strange cross between old school gameplay and new school mechanics its not a mere run and gun game you need to play tactically and slowly for there is a penalty for moving and firing it is somewhat reminiscent of the gameplay in americas army as far as the stopandshoot motion goes additionally it will feel a bit familiar to those who played the original counter strike or tactical ops aot but is far from a carbon copy that could be taken eitherway but for a game that relies on competitive gameplay you will definitely experience it my suggestion is to play amongst friends as my experience has been negatively beguiled by mostly a prepubescent andor immature playerbase eitherway the mute button is your friend in that case and will make for a more enjoyable experience the weapon skin drops ala teamfortress is a nice addition for those collectors out there who may be looking for some incentive to play the game more this game is no unreal tournament or quake 3 but for fans who yearn for an environment of competition then look no further than counterstrike global offensive

counterstrike global offensive is how should i say its sometimes fun sometimes its not well since cssource went a bit down and players are shiftting to this next generation of counterstrike gaming so this game is probably the most intense fps game ive played since there are so many of these god damn hackers in the game it hits you hard with rage madness such nerve rackingness & the struggle in some of the games against them my god they are such a huge pain im starting to wonder if steam supports hackers vac3 is a complete joke overwatch is more of a joke they should put more people on the watch or valve should develop a more sophisticated banningsystem or this game will never be fully enjoyable  competitive is fun with the right players and if all players are using mics and if all are players are doing good response between players on reporting enemy locations then the games are quite enjoyable still so many players dont use mics and or are just deranking on purpose and or just fragging and or trolling thus deranking is inevitable

this game may be super frustrating and all you know with all the smurfs and throwers however after playing this game for over a year now i have come to realize that i still love and enjoy playing this piece of poop despite how butthurt i get and how much my scrubby teammates try to zeus and tk a bunch i still always come back to play this whenever i can obviously skins make you mlg pro so hopefully soon enough the hundreds on dollars ive spent in csgo will soon pay off and bless me with gabens luxurious faze powers to sum up this long as furk review this game may be the reason i lose my mind 247 however the enjoyment of getting better and playing it with my notso awesome friends makes it all worthwhile o w o would reccomend to those who want to actually be cool and not play cod on console

every player should try that game amazing but there are too many cheaterz at game and valve should stop them but it looks like they dont care what the hell are we feel about loosing to cheaterz

csgo is a fantasy game about a young scottish man in the middleeast your goal is to clear the land of russians and anyone else who is foreign you have a large arsenal of guns also known as the ak47 m4a14 and the awp all other guns require a large ammount of rgn which is very silver the ak47 is a terrorist weapon used by the russians usually missing all shots and screaming ing noob you let my die  the way you respond to this is by holding tab right clicking their name and pressing block communication the awp is a large boltaction rifle used to take out enemies from a far the m4a14 are used by the counterterrorist team and are incredibly accurate all in all a fun game but if there were less russians it would be 1010 my review 69 not enough water

read the original version here [textuploadercom]  what i said in the previous version of this review was a bit too harsh like ive said before this game is amazing however what breaks the game for many people is valves silly anticheating measures and decisions in addition to their laziness in fixing even the simplest of things besides that weve had no real gameplay update in a very long time  apart from new operations which arent even made by valve again in its core csgo is a masterpiece of a game without a doubt it plays great and it has incredible amounts of depth while only making use of simplistic mechanics it has the potential to be the biggest esports title surpassing the moba genre even with its catering towards both casual and competetive players what the game is suffering from right now however is catering too much towards casual players and not paying attention to competetive playerss wishes and to the competetive community altogether vac hasnt still been improved and despite many complaints it still has questionable features such as banning people in waves more about that and the rest of the anticheating measures in a minute besides that csgo is plagued with small easytofix issues a few brief examples  weapon balancing  characterobject models being smaller than their hitboxes or vice versa see mirage a triplestack or dust ct character models  hitboxes in general jumping ladder and plant hitboxes are waaaaay off see this and this   competetive matchmaking servers being 64 tick instead of 128  hit detection and many more as you can see by the upload dates on the videos these issues have been apparent for almost a year if not more this shouldnt be happening to a very popular game made by a very successful company after plentiful complaints made by the community valve has not yet commented on the issues this highlights another issue  valves inability to listen and communicate there is no excuse to this as this hasnt always been an issue they listened back when csgo was just a shadow of what it is today because the game wasnt selling that is no longer the case i think the reason for valves laziness is the fact that theres nothing that can compete with global offensive right now most of the pc fps players are drawn over to csgo simply because there are not many other games they can play right now dota 2 gets clearly a lot more attention because it has 3 major competetitors as of right now i cant say for sure but it makes a lot of sense moving on i have a friend that is a private cheats developer and has a lot of experience in making them  he doesnt make them because he thinks its not morally wrong or whatever but literally just to make money as these things cost a lot of money  selling private personal cheats pay about 500800 dollars i dont fully agree with his decisions however id like to say that neither of us condone cheating in any way he has helped me in writing of this by giving me a more indepth look at how they work most of the following are based on his answers in a game with a competetive aspect or a competetive environment such as the official matchmaking servers cheating cannot by any means be an issue and should be kept very minimal yes no game is hack or cheatproof it is not possible to make such a system that keeps all the cheaters in check but for a game of this size cheating shouldnt be as big of a problem as it is now vac is terrible  and valve is aware of it and they showcase it by creating ingame anticheat solutions that potentially break the game for legitimate players heres an example one of these anticheat solutions as seen in the above video works by having the server create a trace between a player and other players heads if for whatever reason this trace is not finished or gets abrupted the enemy is not rendered on your computer its especially bad if the other players ping is high as the information received from the server takes longer to reach the client this fix is only mildly effective but it should help prevent wallhacking however it also affects legitimate players like the video showcased redacted it doesnt break wallhacks completely redacted for example if im on cat redacted i could still see a guy on goose redacted but i couldnt see a guy from ct spawn to t spawn anymore another one of these  solutions [imagesakamaisteamusercontentcom]  is unsynchronized weapon spread between the client and the server in the picture above red is what your client sees and blue is what the server sees ever shoot a whole magazine at someone and see all the bullets hitting directly behind them but only get a few hits that happens because of this this was implemented to prevent ragehackers when in reality it doesnt prevent ragehackers ability to continue ragehacking in anyway these arent the only ones there are a dozen more and they only barely hurt the cheaters while hurting the legitimate players just as much these arent solutions these are lazy changes which are called fixes when in reality they dont make the situation any better if vac were any better and could actually detect cheats with a bit more finesse these countermeasures wouldnt be needed at all if esea a third party matchmaking service can have a fairly decent anticheat so can valve now that weve established how poor vac is lets talk about the problems caused by cheating itself in my opinion the worst part about having a game with so many cheaters running rampant and so many cheats available is having to contemplate if someone is cheating or not its absolutely disgusting to be forced to sit in a game for atleast 30 minutes and watch your team get slaughtered every round because of a blatant cheater but its even more terrible to play a game where youre not sure if the other team had some kind of external help its discouraging its not fun to wait for the game to end and get frustrated so that you dont want to play anymore because as ive said before youre essentially playing a gamble when you queue up all you can do is hope that you dont get cheaters in your game leaving is not an option unless you want to get a temporary matchmaking ban having a surrender option available at all times would make this a lot better cheating is ruining competetive matchmaking and valve hasnt taken many steps to remedy that problem if you wish to play competetively your best bet would be third party matchmaking services unfortunately however as bad as all of this may sound most of these issues can be ignored especially if youre not huge into playing competetively the game is still balanced around the fact that both players have the ability to do what the other team is doing because of the sideswitching system at halftime  honestly the only issues besides cheating that youll be in contact with are hitbox and hit registering errors the game is still a lot of fun especially if you have friends you can play with i dont regret any of the 1000 hours ive played this game with my friends because they have all been memorable and very entertaining to say that the game is flawless or the best fps ever made would be silly however all in all buy it regardless of the issues with the game i would its cheap and there is nothing else like it so you dont have much choice anyway just be aware of the fact that theres 0% chance that valve is going to fix any of the issues with the game until theres something to compete with their game

this game is hands down the best fps i have ever played and still playing the game can be run at max settings to look visually stunning on a beefy computer or on a potato of a computer at lowest settings you continually discover more and more things about the game and thats what entices me to play it more it has a wonderful community if you put aside the hackers and griefers and id say 90% of my friends list of currently 260 people is from this game i love it and the counterstrike series and will continue to love it throughout many years i hope get this game and get it now

its a good game after all all the russians should have their own servers though its really hard to communicate when 4 players of our team speaks english and then there is that one russian guy who just speaks russia all the way and nobody understands and you have way too much hatred inside of you russians too valve also should put a little bit more effort into vac cheaters really ruin the game especially in competitive where they just keep on popping up when they should be gone and no i do not keep every player that plays better than me a hacker its fun public servers have a lot to offer comp for some serious gaming or faceitesea

for my english 101 class i had to write a review of something so i ended up reviewing this game and here is my review hope you enjoy a series of counter strike games have been released in the past and with counter strike global offensive it has changed first person shooters with the creativity of the steam community they continue to change and make the game a new experience each time averaging 35 million unique players each month new ideas are displayed about every hour each day this game is meant for people who both like fps and are completely new to them players who are new or kist playing it for fun the casual section of gameplay allows these players to experience the game on a noncompetitive level the casual section breaks down into four sub sections being deathmatch arms race demolition and casual classic deathmatch is the perfect place to play a quick warm up game and allows players to practice using guns that they havent used before arms race is just like gun game from other fps games but sets the guns to 27 and it is a quick paced game and really fun if you play with a lot of friends demo gives the feeling of casual classic but it only has one bomb site and it is hard to plant before the counterterrorist are dead or the terrorist are dead plus it has generally small maps for me this is not the gamemode for me but if you want to play a quick 2025 minute game without people yelling at you then this a good choice to play casual is in my opinion the game type that is most like competitive but again without the ranting and arguing of players when you lose the couple of things that are annoying is unlike comp it only goes to 15 rounds and you dont switch sides this does create a somewhat of an unfair game since some maps are sided towards either ct or t with that being said i think casual is very relaxed and calming without people yelling in the microphone now here is where there is a lot of frustration and annoyance but will always be fun to play even though i personally dont think this is the best in the game i do think it is second and a close best feature of the game there are a lot of takeaways from comp but like any competitive game there are negatives the competitive game type nevers gets old with different operations coming out every threefour months communication is key in this game and with ingame voice there are a lot of negatives but ill get to that on most days youll get into a game with respectable nice people that dont really get mad and yell comp gives every player the rush to want to be the best rank or the best player in the current lobby like all games you can leave midway but in this game it punishes the players to a 157day ban from comp these bans are completely random so it does force people to stay in the game with comp it is a 3090 minute game where it lasts 30 rounds and does switch roles to balance the game unlike most fps csgo doesnt allow players to aim down sights unless it has a scope and this is where i believe luck and skill comes in and it enhances the gameplay players will normally understand if you dont know the callouts on the map and will tend to help some try hard players are not so forgiving another great part that i can think of is valve put in chickens that roam around the maps and during the holidays they will add stuff to the chickens ex last week they put in cheers and balloons so each time you killed them those would come out the chickens can also be used to figure out where the enemies are if one happens to see it killed the way that the game balances the skill of players is the best they will put same skill ranks together and dont really allow high ranks to play with the low ranks with all of the positive ideas there are sadly always negatives csgo community consists of people who do try a little too hard and care too much about the game i have been in games where teammates will constantly yell into the mic just talking trash to each other and it really doesnt help them to do better personally i dislike like the little kids that come into the game swearing and commanding the adults on what to do and i know most of my friends feel the same way they are called squeakers at times players that arent good enough to play the game will try to cheat and try to get an advantage over the other players they will use hacks such as a wallhack or an aimbot there are other programs but i am not familiar with them also players who have been playing for a while and reached a high rank cant compete with their current rank players so they make a new account and face new people these are called smurfs i know that i am missing a lot of things that people find negative about this game but these are my big negatives where all of the creativity in this game comes from is from the workshop and it is so vital to this game i find this the best feature due to all of the stuff that you can make and it can be used in the game the developers allowed players to make their own custom skins for the guns in the game and if it gets voted up by the community then it can be added the to the game and you can make money off of it right now there are skins that cost 450$ but there are a lot of cheap ones the expensive guns are the knives not only can you make skins you can make stickers that can go through the same process to get into the game people can also make their own maps but i have yet to try that feature but i have seen some nice maps valve added crate drops into the game to that contains chances at getting a rare skin for the gun or knife but it can cost 1$ or so for the case and 250$ for the keys i find this gambling system not worth the money so i recommend selling the cases because they do add up each week i ended up with 25$ from drops and bought copies of the game for two of my friends with having only 240 hours invested in the game i have seen people with over 2000 hours so that means that it must be an amazing game for someone to have that much time put into this game

ok first of all im british and i play on counter strike literally every single day playing competitive for stupid amount of hours which i love doing csgo is the topbest favourite fps game that has ever been released since the early years of 16 but the sad moment which lets the whole game down is matchmaking with russianspolish etc im british i dont want to be in a game full of russians that speak russian i want to be in a game that speak clear english cs really needs a filter so you can search for games that are local not in russiapoland 999% of russia play csgo so us uk people wont stand a chance so redicilous all im saying is that cs needs to introduce a matchmaking filter so british players can que and matchmake with other british players so we dont have to struggle playing with russians who dont speak english competitive is a game about communication teamwork not listening to other players speak in a different language leaving you out of the team csgo needs matchmaking filters
recommended
its a great game but if you have played games like call of duty and battlefield you will have some difficulty converting into csgo i have alot of hours but am still only silver 3 thats because of the 2 months i took to learn the maps and recoil patterns of each and almost every gun the ak47 is an amazing rifle on the terrorist side but is very hard to learn the recoil pattern then there are guns like the m4a1s that are much easier to use but do slightly less damage pistols are important to learn if you can win the first 2 rounds of a competitive match your team is much more likely to win the half this is a great game definitley worth the low price of 15$ sometimes even 749 so definitley pick this game up and if you would like you can add me if you would like to play or ask for more tips

currently the best competitive fps indeed  it is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning but with some practice you should get the mechanics of the game the strong point is that valve publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the esport with esport cases team sticker or event cashprize esl one dreamhack valve is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the operationseason pass like operation breakout or operation phoenix so you can play community map in competitive mode  the weak point imo is the community youre a noob ou youre a cheater furthermore there are many cheater when the game is cheap on steam but these low prices are usually followed by many vac ban this game does not look like other games as the call of duty saga this game is for child and noob and they want to make money csgo is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community  gl & hf  thanks volvo d

a great sequel of the one and only shooter game for people that like tactical play and hardcore aiming maps are good and the recoil system requires some good practice even though i think it would have been better to create a game more similar to the game counterstrike source but that is just my personal opinion the only problem in this game is the amount of cheaters and the fact that the game price gets changed to 349 sometimes which means that there will be a huge hacker wave again valve should do something about it or create an anticheat that you can choose to enable for matches on protected servers

csgo relies heavily on teamwork whilst this games mechanics are extremely well done and fun to learn the idea of forcing players to work as a team is its major downfall unless you have 4 other friends to play with more often than not youre going to be matched with trolls griefers andor bad players which becomes extremely frustrating other than that goes on sale all of the time and is a lot of fun if you have the friends or think you can meet some whilst playing then i really cant reccomend it enough nothing beats the tension of this game

game  good community  the only problem of this game is its community which consists mainly of immature little kids that have not enjoyed any form of education remember those scum kids in kindergarden whose parents would allow them to do anything this game collects all of them into one huge set of idiots with no restraints no respect no manners no common sense and absolutely no intelligence the best way to play this game get a team of friends and mute everybody else otherwise you are going to lose a lot of your brain cells and also all hope in humanity only in 000000001% of the cases you actually get to play with nice people who play for fun who dont rage at you for their own faults who can teamplay and communicate and most importantly whose selfconfidence and ego do not depend on being pro in csgo my final thought on this game rip humanity

this is my favourite game in the cooking mama series unlike the previous games this one goes through various platforms strangely the pc version is the only version thats updated i mean the snes is a pretty big competitor to the pc the game itself counterstrike terrorism x is an addictive rpg game where the player must complete puzzles with hisher teammates i personally think counterstrike a letter to his son about his father done it better most of the community seems to agree this creates a very competitive situation but luckily the community knows its all a game and is made for fun the weapons i usually use are energy sword and rail gun the community on the topic of community it is by far the nicest ive ever played with they know people make mistakes and dont have the ability to fight 5 over players by themselves there is a kick button thats never used for the players personal use so they may not face the penalities of deranking as thats ridicolous and its only a game the graphics made with frostbite the graphics are stunning the verdict 455 shrek forever after is good at what it does my actual review this game is full of people with their heads screwed so far up their asses the community is toxic enough to make the planet extinct its good

its ok

still better than call of duty

csgo is a nearperfect multiplayer shooter unlike the previous versions which were often difficult to get in to this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels it has a large community and a well supported workshop ensuring that this discountpriced game will be around for years to come in short you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster its been around for years and has spawned many imitators the game isnt much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original half life 2 was however valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis is it worth getting if you already own counter strike source yes css was always counter strike shoehorned into the source engine csgo feels far more like a standalone game valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game the best feature must be the competitive play you cannot leave these matches or youll suffer a temporary ban from the feature after 10 wins in this mode youll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level these matches are exciting occasionally scary or frustrating but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game ever there are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join really if i was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice its bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come something that cant be said for the call of duty franchise which is probably its closest rival remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year fragmenting the community plus you can customise your weapon skins in csgo surely thats the most important feature all they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in csgo
recommended
best cs game on the franchise
recommended
quite simply this feels like a reskin of css sure some backend stuff may have changed but to me as a player it feels the same this leaves the game in an awkward sort of limbo between old and new with fancy graphics that if anything make the outdated gameplay stand out more than ever if you really love cs but for some reason cannot play css without improved graphics get this if you are new to the series dont buy it or you will just end up feeling lost hurt and confused

i think it is a terrible game it stole all of its gamemodes from call of duty csgo competitive is just extended search and destroy and valve didnt even bother to rename demolition they must be pretty lazy the aim sucks because the bullets dont go straight to the center but spray all over even with that small difference it is still blatant copy of call of dewty what kind of a game steals everything from call of duty and doesnt implement some of the best features like the intervention sniper rifle as a silver 1 i would just like to show everyone how i quickscope in call of dewty i mean what engine is this game on is it that dated engine quake ran on just look at how good fall of duty looks each year since they revamp the engine from scratch every year basically you want to play call of booty csgo is for people who are casuals cod is for hardcore gamres and takes sooooo much more skill if you dont belieev me message me on steam and we can 1v1 on mw2 rust quickscopes only

great game for the casual or the competetive fps player coming from games like oc quake and uberstrike this game really forces you to improve your reflex time as well as your accuracy i wasnt much for the modern games until i tried this one out i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great fps heres a little procon pros extremely fun and addicting gameplay balenced gameplay good graphics with exellent map designs engaging gameplay great community and team aspect skill cap is extremely high playable on even low grade computers mines 15 ghz cons costs real money if youre a usual f2p gamer then this might detract you from it learning curve is extremely steep youll need to invest time into this game not really a con but for some people they just want a fun game to run around on if thats the case this game is not for you no major fov changes i realize there are a few things you can do to change it but for a quake player like myself it was rough to get used to after playing with 115 fov for a while requires a mic to be completely honest if you want to get good at this game and engage in teamplay you will need a mic  otherwise youll be hardpressed to type out strats and the status of your enemies hackers just like most games out there you will run into these  they are easy to report but be warned they do exist if you get my gist the cons are really just minor things nothing really is so annoying that i would consider stopping playing this game 910 spiegel

just moved over to pc gaming from console and after spending so much time on cod over on xbox csgo is a fresh of breath air this game is amazing and for such a small price you would be stupid not to buy it

love this game spent way too much time playing it

cool fps very good game  buy it
recommended
awesome game would recomend it anyday
recommended
csgo is the best competitive fps game i have ever played i believe its difficult enough to be a challenging game for gamers plus its a really nice and enjoyable game it has improved graphics from the other cs games and you can find it for only 1099 there are two bad things about this game one is that the competitive matchmaking can sometimes ruin your game join you with noobs the second one is that a lot of people get addicted with the weapon skins valve items and can spend a lot of money in cases and keys to sum up i recommend this game to everyone whos looking for a good fps to play my rating is 9510
recommended
010 this game is worst play stronkhold kindoms insted

this game  profit disclaimer profit will only occur if you invest initial money for operation coins to get the case drops if you want to risk it you can open cases and try your luck in getting a knife

best firstperson shooter game ever on steam highly recommmended just go for it you will find this game interesting very interesting actually good support no crashes good fps and what else do you want  the team support
recommended
this game is all around good game addicting too if youre into fps shooters youd love this one its a little difficult for starters and gets frusturating but eventually youll understand how it works and how to be accurate once you get that down its a 1010 game graphics arent the best but you get used to it its gameplay that counts you should really get this its a must buy game
recommended
only have 50hours but so far this is the best fps out there it beats cod and battlefield just the community on there brings rewards from its self i would really recommend this to my friends and to everyone if they are into fps plus ive been a counterstike kid since 2005 now its 2014 and the love is still here for the cs community keep the game the way its suppost to be   >5stars< edit its been over 400 hours now and still satified

counterstrike go doesnt fail to please me its a great competitive game with new guns new modes better graphics and a gy community thats pretty much the only downside but csgo is a very well made competitive game but if you are me you would prefer css over this game but both are spectacular games thank you once again valve 
recommended
still the best game

one of the best fps ive ever played

first the good review  its cs 1010  the weapons sistem is nothing like the others cs you can gain the skin weapons by playing or opening boxes or buying them on the market and thats very cool now the bad review and this one makes me so angry  the competitive 1  the team if can find those noob teams that kill their own partners or just be afk the whole game 2  the competitve cooldown now this one its just annoying and overwhelming stupid because you get kicked by leaving the game and thats fine but imagine that your net goes down or our pc was turn off because of some lightning you will get that same kick and you cant to nothing about it and thats makes me so angry because you get 7 days of penalty because you net was down and thats not fair hope that this will help someone
recommended
love this game besides from all the campers this is really fun join a casual competetive and you just start rampaging this game has amazing graphics beautiful soundtrack and amazing weapon sounds although some things are worse then in css wich was the ground for competetive fps gamers it still is amazing play with friends go online do what you want steam market yus made me happy buy whatever you want getawesome cool skins for your guns and be famous 910 some bugs remain some netcode bugs aswell run around corner but still die d but still amazing
recommended
inexpensive game with effective antihack system supported with good matchmaking system waste no time in finding a multiplayer game never an easy game to master and best played tactically with friends individual skills and team communications are essentials
recommended
the only thing that i can say about this game is fantastic xd
recommended
counterstrike started off well counterstrikego is different from css and cscz etc csgo has different guns different maps different spray patterns different everything throw away everything you knew from css because this game is different where the p90 was a standard smg in css in this game its used as a smaller lmg i still do love this game
recommended
very shooting much headshots wow cheaters
recommended
takes a while to get used to but after a while youll like it awp op but meh 1010 would bang
recommended
this game is the fps of the time better than call of duty better than battlefield 3 better than arma iii  the others counterstrike is in the place what a funny strategic and amazing game 
recommended
this game is definitely an improvement on the previous games now its super easy to find a competitive match i found it very hard on css and cs 16 also you dont even have to be in a group of 5 to find oneanother thing which was annoying about the previous ones if that people can lie about their skill group which left the match unbalanced csgo has a ranking system which will put you against people with a similar rank and its a good thing to strive towards reaching that next rank put that together with the custom gun skins they have brought into it it turns into a fun and very replayable game 910
recommended
this game has an amazing topology system versus counter strike source and the fact that it uses a system for item drops sellable in the market is amazing this is one fps that will most likely not be abandoned for along time a story i tell everyone is a took a break from gmod so i went to csgo and went back to garrys mod and i could headshot a pedo bear
recommended
i have played alot of counter strike 16 and the game was just awesome  but after playing this i have to say that this beats most of the multiplayer shooters out there the graphics are greatly improved  there are various play modes  new weapon designs  new voice acting etc  must buy if you love shooters
recommended
best cs game on the franchise
recommended
quite simply this feels like a reskin of css sure some backend stuff may have changed but to me as a player it feels the same this leaves the game in an awkward sort of limbo between old and new with fancy graphics that if anything make the outdated gameplay stand out more than ever if you really love cs but for some reason cannot play css without improved graphics get this if you are new to the series dont buy it or you will just end up feeling lost hurt and confused 
recommended
amazing game if you like competitive shootersdefinetly worth your moneyespecially now on sale
recommended
css was my favourite been playing since the first counter strike this game is awesome i use to play the beta and put in like 300 hours then i stopped playing for a while because all my stats got reset this game is deffinatly worth getting even for $15 most valve games are great 810 great graphics  way better than css and the sounds are improved heaps
recommended
probably the hardest fps game i ever played very fun addicting etc and it actually takes skill to play 1

worst ing gmae you will ever playits only bad because when steam takes a  which we all know happends  that random dc from servers crap it will ban you from compet game mode for hours some times weeks and nor steam or csgo support will do jack  to help you so until they fix that or care about there so called caring steam users dont buy this ing game

one of the best fps ive ever played
recommended
i am pretty addicted to this game ive been playing almost every single day ever since 16 on some days i would play all day and i would only stop when my arm muscles were too tired to move the mouse and i would hardly be able to aim right anymore
recommended
this is the best game i have ever played its my favirote game its so skill based and not just a stupid grind like cod and other shooters the aiming is skill base and matches require tactics and team play to win once 1 has mastered the game he can take down a team of 5 all on himself this game has hundreds of hours of play time that will not make you bored one bit unless you lose all the time

this ruined my social life
recommended
i remember when counter strike didnt have idle lobbies so people can collect cases and guns just to sell them i also remember when you wanted to play competitive mode and werent stuck with 14 year old little boys who just like to friendly fire since the game went on sale for 4$ at one point every kid and their little brother has an account now if you are going to play with a group of friends this is a fun way to go if you want to be stuck with a group of random idiots then this is your game
recommended
the counterstrike franchise had its highs cs 16 and lows cssource but the newest iteration was damn worth the wait sufficient to say you dont need 16 anymore if you have csgo games 95 out of 100 a must buy

great game to play with friends  fixed some bugs with new updates

i for one believe the best part of this game is killing chickens that is all there is

its like tf2 except not like tf2 at all whose  do you have to suck to get some ing hats added though i mean seriously i love the weapon skins and all but i dont like how the counterterrorists wear ing beanbags on their head oh and dont get me started on the terrorists i for one think that their headgear is culturally insensitive id love for the option to put a turban on my terrorist

really disappointed with the way paid mods have been added might be stupid to publish a negative review for a game i have enjoyed for years but this is setting a bad precedent this has the potential to ruin a great mod community there are many mods i have used for awhile now that are suddenly over $4 cdn i hope major changes are made and rethought about this new practice seems like a good time for gog to release a client seems like valve maybe needs some competition

dont get me wrong skyrim itself is a great game and will give you hours of fun but as a lot of others say the game is trying to make you pay for comunnity made mods and even if you would be stupit enough to buy it 75% goes to steam and the developer you are not even supporting the creator a great sulution the community came up with was the donation button no forced pay for the content but your able to support the creator like many other community brothers will tell you dont support this kind of moneygrabbing

as much as i hate jumping on bandwagons what made this game so great that i kept coming back for more than 1600 hours was the mods without it its bland and not very interesting with an awful story uninspired gameplay and tons of unfixed bugs still a decent game if you like exploration but thats really all that game has going for it and now bethesda moves to a new business model making people pay for mods with potentially future games allowing only paid mods which means well have to pay for bugfixes and additions to the games without any guarantee that it will work or any accountability from the developers for these paid features developed by amateurs therefore i cant recommand this game or any future bethesda game anymore at least until we see how the future games are handled in that aspect it was fun while it lasted farewell for now bethesda edit well looks like all that agitation had a result valve and bethesda backpedaled and paid mods are gone it will take a bit of time for trust to rebuild though so in the meantime my review stays negative no need to change it if bethesda tries another boneheaded move tomorrow or the next month edit 2 lol a bunch of idiotic fanboys went through all my reviews and downvoted them all to avenge their beloved skyrim this guy made a negative review of skyrim for reasons we dont agree with lets downvote all his positive reviews for games that have nothing to do with skyrim and by doing so they did exactly what they were blaming me of doing only for 9 games instead of 1 the irony and stupidity of that move is hilarious
not recommended
im sorry but the paid mods thing have completely ruined a community that has been going super for the last 10 years
not recommended
an interesting and engaging game that contains numerous hours of gameplay time though it can get a bit repetitive unfortunately is suffers from a great many simplifications compared to the older games in this series such as morrowind there is a large difference in the quality of procedurally generated content and handmade content so i would advise people to focus on what they like and not to worry about passing up quests unfortunately the main selling point mods has recently taken a huge hit leading me to be unable to recommend this game
not recommended
paid mods are simply not acceptable period put in a donate button i used to love this game but i have very quickly grown to despise its developers and steam
not recommended
this is my skyrim there are many like it but this one is mine my skyrim is my best friend it is my life i must master it as i must master my life my skyrim without mods is useless without my skyrim mods are useless i must play my skyrim true i must play my skyrim straighter than valve who is trying to destroy it i must shoot him before he shoots me i will my skyrim and i know that what counts in war is not the vanilla games we play the noise of our corrupted modders nor the money valve makes we know that it is the mods that count we will mod my skyrim is human even as i because it is my life thus i will learn it as a brother i will learn its weaknesses its strength its parts its accessories its sights and its barrel i will keep my skyrim clean and ready even as i am clean and ready we will become part of each other we will before false prophet i swear this creed my skyrim and i are the defenders of my kind gamers we are the masters of our enemy we are the saviors of gaming so be it until victory is gamers and there is no paywalls but peace

first game to introduce dlc contents and steal from content creators i would not recommenc this game

due to steams practices of selling mods other than creating a button for donating i must give this a negative review in protest
not recommended
paid mods wow just wow who in the world thought that was a good idea add a donate option as apposed to selling the mod and taking all the profit the only reason i bought this game on the computer is so that i could mod the living crap out of it shame on you valve and bethesda
not recommended
avoid like the plague this is now a dlc simulator hiding behind the mask of a way to help content creators when they barely get any of the profit
not recommended
less content than either morrowind or oblivion you used to be able to increase content with mods but now theyve nickled and dimed that away
not recommended
oh look a new dlc for skyrim oh wait wtf is that me about the paid mods
not recommended
i love skyrim because it is the best rpg up to date but i will not support the new pay to mod pratice i wont be part of the group destroying the gaming community would you be part of it
not recommended
i rly love this game its so amazing in different ways and even more fun with the mods made by the skyrim community well that was the past now the developers want to make money by made mods that you must pay for it seriously guys this is  t why the hell someone want to pay for a game that they already bought thats for a single player only game and they get 75% for every buying thats not even fair trade jeez gj guys you ruined the modding community
not recommended
really turning free mods  free since every tes game  into a corporate cashgrab if it was a donate function there would be zero issues because the creators deserve it but buyable mods and only 25% of the cash goes to the pocket of the creator and in steam cash d incredible
not recommended

not recommended
support workshop creators or support your greediness
not recommended
skyrim will go down in history books as that game that killed modding despite it being the only thing keeping it afloat rip pc gaming you had a good run

after playing many many hours of this game i come to find out that they are charged for paid mods the lifeblood of the game was free modding i took this game off my favorites and uninstalled it its a damn shame donate button should have been given instead of what they have today they had a great community like a week ago now they split it in two just like that

paid mods now huh what a disgrace

bethesda and valve are most likely testing this new mod pay system so they can implement it into fallout 4 with little resistance ask yourself why they would do this with a game that has been out for so long because by the time fallout 4 comes out they assume the internet will have moved onto the next big thing to complain about they now have a system in place where they can continue to make money off of the modding community while not investing any extra work or money valve and bethesda share equal responsibility for this cash grab of greed if valve and bethesda wanted to make sure the modders were able to ask for money a simple donation would work but with that system valve and bethesda are unable to take a cut of the profits this also leads to support if i buy a product i expect a certain a mount of compatibilitysupport what guarantees does valve and bethesda give me is there a review process for the mods to insure compatibility what about future updatespatchesdlc that could render mods useless does bethesda or valve guaranteed those will always work in the future lastly id like to a quote and reply from gabe newells qa on reddit yesterday  originally posted by gabenewellbellevue  actually money is how the community steers work  originally posted by one_long_year  funny the community successfully steered modding work in elder scrolls for about ten fng years with nothing but goodwill and thanks before you guys got involved quick review of the game  pretty boring without mods and customization too easy and not much variety in spells and fighting

was a great game singlehandedly ruined with the introduction of legally questionable paywalls for fanmade mods many modders have pulled their works from public as others began to steal them to turn a profit on steam and most of the money made from it goes to bethesdasteam rather than the creator themselves a shameless and blatant display of greed that is beginning to tear apart the modding community and pushing away people who genuinely liked and wanted to make this game more fun

1 it is changing a system that has been working fine modders arent an oppressed class working without benefit modders choose to work on mods for many reasons fun practice boredom the joy of creating something and gamers appreciate their contributions while some gamers may feel entitled most understand that if a modder is unable to continue the mod may be abandoned donations may or may not help but they are an option this system has for years made pc gaming what it is modding in my opinion is the primary benefit of pc gaming over console changing a functional system is dangerous and could have unintended consequences 2 now that people are paying for mods they will feel entitled for these mods to continue working if a free mod breaks and isnt supported that is fine because there is no obligation for it to continue working if someone pays though they will expect the mod to be updated and continue working as the base game is updated furthermore abandoned but popular mods are often revived by other people if these mods are paid then the original creator may not want people to profit off of updated versions of their mod 3 related to the above paid mods may reduce cooperative modding many mods will borrow elements from other mods usually with permission having paid mods will complicate things someone who makes a paid mod will be unlikely to share hisher work with others what if someone freely shares hisher mod and someone incorporates it into a paid mod does the first mods owner deserve compensation does the second modder deserve the full revenue this makes modding more politically complicated and may reduce cooperation 4 this may reduce mods based off of copyrighted works there is a very good chance that any paid mod based off of a copyrighted work will be shutdown modders could still release free mods of this nature but it complicates the issue many mods based on copyrighted materials borrow usually with permission from other mods to add improvements if these other mods are paid then the original creators likely wont let them use it additional many modders may now ignore copyrighted mods in order to make mods that they may profit on 5 steamthe developer are taking an unfairly large portion of the profit steam and the developers are offering nothing new to the situation steam is already hosting the mods and the developer already made the game they now wish to take 75% of all profit from the mod if the market gets flooded by lowquality paid mods the modders will likely make very little and the quality of the game will not be increased however steam and the developers will make money off of no work on there part until all mods are free again i will no longer support either company please reconsider

the entire game is based around the idea that you are special everything is very easy to the point where you could mindlessly aim at a creature click your mouse buttons and win the game you are powerful in a world that is made for you and cant really challenge you if you change the difficulty slider you are basically making the game unplayable as creatures will take forever to kill but kill you in short order this does not make it interesting it is boring the world feels empty and does not offer much at all as a huge fan of morrowind for me this game is a huge disappointment because this game is such a disappointment i tried using over 100 mods to fix the many problems i have with it the fact that other players made mods to fix these problems proves that i am not alone in feeling that this game is inadequate i appreciate all the hard work modders put into this game but bethesda and valve do not deserve to be paid for someone elses hobby

this game was almost a masterpiece when it came out  a vast world full of quests places to see people worth talking to it was a beautiful stone a true gem which was a bit rough around the edges but people enjoyed it and then came the mods they polished all that needed polishing made a game that was so great to many as to be called a true masterpiece up to this day there are always more than 30000 people playing it almost constantly 74k when im writing this and its not just because the game is great  its because the mods made this game close to perfect change whatever you want however you want and share it with fellow gamers this is what gave the game a 93% approval rating from gamers across steam platform thats how it used to be now we see a peculiar system where mods get a pay what you want price tag and you dont really know what youre paying for since you can download those paid mods after you buy it we are already getting mods that say they are a work in progress and more content will be done when its ready one mod taken down for using content made by another modder without the approval even though the borrower of content says he was told from steam people its ok as hes using free content and this is just the start of what well get in the near future we are seeing the modding communities already being shattered because of how absurd this paid mods idea is mods are becoming nothing more than dlcs only made by external subcontractors instead of the developer and the latter taking zero responsibility of the end products the industry will surely benefit from this maybe some modders as well but we gamers will loose in the long run is skyrim a bad game because of this no  its a great game 810 for vanilla 1010 with my favorite mods and will remain such regardless of what will happen this negative review is to show my disapproval for the above mentioned practices and those were introduced by no other than bethesda series owner and valve steam owner and unlike what other people who write negative reviews because of this claim mine will remain negative regardless of what happens to the paid mods idea as a boundary marker as we have crossed one and it seems there will be no turning back to sum it up skyrim  810 skyrim modded to ones liking  1010 paid mods de facto dlc  a fat 010

not recommended
i love this game and have spent more time modding the game than actually playing it but paid mods are a big no for the whole pc community due to mods being more like personal projects in which thousand of hours have been spent individually for each mod just for the sake of improving the game and adding more content where you can spend extra hours or your whole life into because the immersion is where this game excels at and traditionally mods have been released exclusively for free and of course many modders deserve to be compensated for their hard work but valve executed a really bad plan just to address this unnecessary issue where putting a donation button could have been a simpler solution the game itself is good even without mods but i do not endorse the monetization of mods by any means nor does anyone else on the whole community

it is very sad to see a good game being ruined by the greed of corporations valve and bethesda are now charging money for mods with the mod creator getting only 25% of the cut this goes against the very nature of mods and can cause alot of issues many of the modders may stop supporting the paid mods and players will be left with a paid digital paperweight there is also the issue of people stealing mods from other sources and claiming that its theirs in order to earn easy money we all know that money sours relationships and it only took valve a couple of days to destroy skyrims modding community many of the mods were removed and many modders have packed their bags and left the skyrim modding community the tightly knit modding community has been reduced by people with the lust for money and it may never recover imagine if mods are paid back when valve was still a small fry dota 2 csgo and team fortress 2 would have never taken off to what it is today valve would simply be another small fry that could be crushed easily by big companies the modding community gave life to valve and they can also take life away from valve with that i have lost all respect for valve and gaben even ea couldnt come up with this idea of paid mods first clap clap

game itself is good if you disregard the limitations of the engine with the lack of graphical options that are easily accessable from within the game i cannot however recommend this game anymore due to the recent move towards monetization of mods which are pretty much what keeps skyrim playable after so many years the fact that valve and bethesda take 75% of the cut is not acceptable so i would advice for everyone who would like to contribute towards a modder to donate via different means
not recommended

not recommended
i dont think valve or bethesda really realized it but somehow they thought paid mods would be a good idea i dont really know why they even thought that because both companies would never be where they are now without mods the entire tes series since morrowind was so good because of mods especially with oblivion the base game got a lot worse than it was before and i never would recommended them without its modding capabilities either valve should also know it better most valve games are all based on certain user created mods and its questionable if steam would have been in this position without them as well the whole thing isnt supporting mod authors either first of all there is a 75% cut off so the guys making the mods would only see 25% of that money but the main thing why this is bad is because mods always were a thing from the community for the community people put their heart and soul into those mods just to make their beloved game better without any thoughts about profit and how to maximize that now its just a question how to get the most money out of people with as less work as possible there is literally no quality control here and a lot of the paid mods have shown to be bad already while another big portion of the uploaded paid mods are not from the original creators if valve really would have cared then they would have given us one or more options to donate to the mod authors via the workshop other mod sites already have such a feature and there is no reason why steam cant have it as well its also really sad to see that gaben himself got a very weird view on the whole topic as shown on reddit hes literally acting like hes the king of the internet and now not understanding why everyone is so angry at him now i cant really go without steam since most of my games are here but i can buy them somewhere else in the future if they dont revert this back and i dont see why i should get any more bethesda games as well if they keep going this route and this comes from a person without origin & uplay

first off let me start by saying this is a fantastic game and has been potentially ruined by recent events now i do think that mod developers should be able to receive money for their work i don think it should have been handled in the way it has why not simply add a donate button and valve take a 1015% cut for doing all the hosting etc and then give the original dev around 10% which would leave the mod creator around 75% of the money for 100% of the work 2 weeks ago this review would have been positive but now well see for yourself

the quality of the tes franchise has always been iffy whether it be the poor combat of morrowind dodgey iron sights in nv or the shockingly bad ui in skyrim but at the same time free mods have always been around to fix up bethesdas bad ideas and shameful lack of quality control however now that valve and bethesda are pushing to monetise the modding community with paid mods it becomes difficult to recommend skryim to anyone knowing that at some point in the future the ability to fix bethesdas numerous gameplay misteps and bugs might become what is effectively quite expensive thirdparty dlc moreover paid modding is genuinely offensive in many ways given that bethesda and valve are taking 75% of mod revenue for essentially not only failing to make a good game but taking away one of the key selling points of the pc version of this game after the fact i would in no way recommend this game nor future games in the tes franchise

whilst the game gives a solid platform and the core story is reasonably good the real meat of the game comes from the extensive modding community whilst this has always been a huge selling point for pc gaming valve and bethesda are currently attempting to turn this wonderful aspect of pc gaming into something they can exploit the community with for $$$ the idea of paying mod makers isnt a problem and should be encouraged the fact is that the following a there is no quality assurance the mod can be utter rubbish yet until you fork out $$$ you cant know b the mod makers only get 25% of the profit yup the person who did 100% of the work gets a tiny fraction of the money c if a mod stops working tough luck d the mod must earn $400 before the creator sees a penny if it only earns $399 then valve & bethesda get the lot e this encourages both big and impressibe mods but also cash grab nonsense all in all do not support this company

i enjoy bethesda games especially when they open them up to the modding community but then the paid mod thing happened and we find out both valve and bethesda are profitting over this modding something that has been a free community driven activity for thirty years is being monetized not donation driven not a commission thing but a market that is going to drive modding into the ground bbut modders are also getting money 25% and thats if they make more than $400 if im reading things right and that money only goes to your steam wallet anything would have been better than this i cannot in good faith say that you should buy this game and support the developers edit well the paid mods system has been removed for the time being valve has aready said that they are going back to the drawing board to figure out how to better implement it im going to keep this negative review here as a reminder of just what transpired and a reminder so no one is surprised when it pops up again if valve implements paid mods again yet they somehow work then i will change this review

i remember when i got this game i went and got mods i played so many mods for so long i forgot to play the game now all i can think is how valve has fallen no paid mods no paid mods no paid mods wait for their return

pay for mods false god addendum before anyone blows a gasket about how many hours i dont have on skyrim its because i cracked mine so i could use it and xfire at the same time so my hours arent being tracked anyone who still uses xfire knows that some steam games instantly crash to desktop when you launch them if you have xfire ingame enabled

the elder scrolls v skyrim is a great game that said charging for usercreated content on a free content hosting platform is utter bs ill be accessing my mods from more reputable sources from now on steam its hilarious that someone on your team came up with an idea like this it makes you look like one of those free mobile game vendors charging for every bit of content you possibly can while still pushing the idea that the actual content is free one of the largest draws of the elder scrolls series is the player made content and if that remains a payed for feature then you can definitely expect far less sales when the next game comes out

paid user made dlc is stupid this  should not exist

game is okay would not recommend purchasing
not recommended
this game is boring

can we all just ignore this buying mods things please the ony reason that paying was invented was so that people would work becuse if they didnt get anything out of it they wouldnt work but modders does this for free so theres no need to pay for it so to all modders please dont make us pay for mods and to all pc gamers please dont ever buy mods becaue of you dont people wont make us pay for mods

i will pay for dlc content which adds alot to the game but to pay $5 for 1 simple change to the game i love this game and i love the modding community but i dont support paying for mods

if there is any game that proves studios do not need to release a relatively bug free massive content filled game while still being overwhelmingly successful tesv skyrim is it however bethesda owes their success and high ratings to the kind and good willed people who fixed  modified skyrim for nothing in return and what does bethesda do to reward these people they endorse a laughable cash farmpaid mods system where they are doing nothing and taking the biggest cut the only reason why this 4 year old game is still relevant and talked about today is because of the content modders created and fixed yes paid mod system on steam workshop has been removed but bethesda has left a burning scar on the attractive modding community with their actions i have no doubt they would try and take advantage of their greatest undeserved asset again which is why i cant thumbs up this product what i think of the game itself without mods good  graphicsvisuals are good for its time i like the combat talent tree is nice sprint bar bad  short quest lines especially for guilds dialoguestory writing doesnt live up to previous elder scrolls dragon combat seems corny to me not as many cavesdungeons as tesiv about the whole paid mods situation im not against someone making money for the things they create ^ive bought several early access games this isnt even necessary to say^ im not against giving my money to someone for the things they create i have donated money to modderserver owners in the past i am against steam workshop turning into a micro transaction nightmare i am against studios making money on mods that fix a game i am against studios having even less incentive than they do now to make an outstanding game because they would be able to sit on a cash farm known as paid mods

i was dissapointed by bethesdas latest elder scrolls but the community of modders made this a really fun game i recommend everyone to by the game used or from another site than steam and using httpwwwnexusmodscom for modding
not recommended
this game is ok without mods this game is amazing with mods it shows that the people will get what they want even if they have to program it themselves what steam doesnt realize is they just killed this game mods are by people for people there is nothing wrong with modders asking for compensation for their time and effort but it needs to be propotional and unofficial by steam making it official then they take on a lot of the responsibility from the modders what happens when one of my paid mods interacts negatively with another paid mod who will give me a refund steam the modder now steam has the liability of refunds and this could become a class action suit if there was a modder that took advantage of the system i am officialy boycotting steam untill this is redacted i urge everyone else to do the same thank you for your time

a key advantage of pc gaming over consoles is free modding which often outdoes paid dlc well lets fix that says valve and bethesda as they reveal that their plan for the steam workshop is really to make it into a paid service do not support this crap

never made a review before i enjoyed skyrim as much as anyone else mods were of course the biggest factor as with most bethesda games this new thing with paid mods is just ridiculous though its an unnecessary paywall that will only hurt the mod community as a whole the whole point of mods was free user created content to help expand the game what valve wants to do though is literally make user created dlc and i dont think anyone wants that
not recommended
nice work steam this will not end well for you
not recommended
it pains me to do this after enjoying this game so much but paying for mods  are you freakin kidding me  mods should be free

the game is fine by itself and i do not mind modders putting a price on their work but steam taking 75% is too much
not recommended
leave it to big business to take something good and cherishedmodding for fun and then completely pervert and corrupt itmonetize it

this parody has to end now bethesda and vavle greed combined will kill the mods
not recommended
one of the main reasons i bought skyrim was for the mods i considered the mods to add a lot of extra value to the game now they became horse armor dlc and i feel cheated both by bethesda and by valve its like going to a restaurant and being told that adding salt to your food is going to cost you 099$ i will never buy any product made by bethesda software ever again because i feel that they will probably try pull the same dubious measures on their future games as well it is very sad for me because i grew up playing tes games and now i will have to stop enjoying them because bethesda and steam became greedy and decided to kill the skyrim modding scene
not recommended
pay for mods just no valve ur turning into a new ea just nooooo what next pay per month to play steam games rip pc gaming 
not recommended
honestly if you have a console just buy this game on the console there isnt a reason now to own it for pc besides slightly better graphics i suppose now as you have to pay for mods mods for pc games are really the only reason to buy the pc version of a game because pc games are modable and consoles are not well now that you have to pay for mods that were previously free just a week ago most of the fun that was to be had in skyrim on pc is pretty much moot as the must have mods that fix stuff in the game cost actual real live money now take a stand do not pay for this bs on the steam workshop if you want a mod that costs money head on over to nexus their mods are still free for now until steam works out a way to tie the pay for mods to steam alone and make sure you tell gabe that as much as you love steam and as much as you dont mind paying for stuff you like you dont agree with paying for mods that for the last 10 years have been free but now they decide they can make cash off it

not supporting steam or bethesda until they completely change their business models i can certainly survive without slyrim as oblivion morrowind and new vegas are better games with free mods any way i recommend that you who are reading this review do the same and shop only at gog humble bundle and dare i say it eas origin valve needs more competition now edit 4272015 1003 pm welp they finally did a 180 degree reversal with the policy for skyrim but in the official press release for this policy change the official valve employe who annouced this change implied that they would try again just not for skyrim so no im still not supporting valve anymore they are still a monopoly they are still hypocrites but what now for skyrim and bethesda should i now give skyrim a positive review no its my opinion that zenimax and bethesda softworks not beth game studio still want some form of paid modding and were the main pushers for paid modding in the first place remember horse armor also i have my beefs with skyrim itself as a game people really should play morrowind oblivion and new vegas before spending hundreds of hours into this shallow game i cant go into specifics at the moment but there are plenty of reviews and videos online addressing concerns that i agree with view valves statement here httpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracecomments3434itpaid_mods_in_the_steam_workshop 4282015 bethesda gave their own pr twitst httpwwwbethblogcom20150427whyweretryingpaidskyrimmodsonsteam look at this particular statement horse armor gave us a start into something new and it led to us giving better and better value to our players with dlc like shivering isles point lookout dragonborn and more they seriously believe that horse armor has helped not just oblivion elder scrolls and fallout but also the gaming industry as a whole horse armor did not encourage them to make epansion packs and dlc that were planned and were in development already if they could without backlash they would follow the scamlike behaviors of other developers like ea or paradox when it comes to the most inane dlcs they said to the effect well mod sales were insignificant anyway and people who use mods and make mods are very insignificant when comparing to all skyrim players well if it wasnt that significant why risk your business and lose potential customers for future games you idiots they also said that they began discussions and planning for paid mods back in 2012 they will not simply waste 3 years of planning because of this backlash no business plans something for such a long time just to do a complete 180 and waste all the wages to people who worked on introducing a new product or service and all the data and knowledge from analyzing the market this will come back one way or another my positive review for skyrim will not
not recommended
first there had been the expansion packs and there were dlcs and now there are mods for sale  you valve make hl3 already
not recommended
what can i say halffinished game that only survived because of modability which will now be placed behind payment walls while the decision is a good one for modding in the long term the consumer is again shafted i wouldnt recommend the base game skyrim as anything close to being worth playing however if you dont mind to keep forking out money for characters weapons minor patches etc then this game might be for you was nice while it lasted though edit well now that the paid mods have been >>temporarily<< put on hold until they can put more legal bindings on them i will refrain from changing the review since its only a matter of time before its back also the damage has been done the community is in shambles modders are leaving and players are still spamming about it i feel like the modders pulling their free mods is mostly because of the players who attacked the modders more than the allure of potential profits the playerbase attacked the wrong targets here but everythings been done now we just wait and see where this develops thirdparty dlc that the company is actually getting money for and then money from publishing it is here to stay there is nothing we can do ill miss gaming

paid mods dont buy this game
not recommended
this game is being sold out what makes it so unique and awesome is the modding community and what both bethesda and valve are planning on doing here is selling the mods with a 70% margin this will not only make it way more expensive for the player to mod the game because priorly you could just download the mods from the modding forums for free but it will also kill the modding community at the nexus forums therefore my review of this game is negative as it is nothing without its mods

tes has always been a series that leaned heavily on externally generated content to sell copies almost all of us have used at least one mod to make the game better many of us use 50 100 or even more mods unfortunately bethesda and valve decided to take the community for a ride and allow mod uploaders to set a paywall for their mods with bethesdavalve splitting 75% of the profits this is absolutely unacceptable business practice and i cannot recommend a purchase when the game can cost upwards of $20000 for content that used to be free

one of my favorite games once a masterpiece ruined by paid mods it is just a broken game full of bugs and ctds without mods and unofficial fixes not recommended anymore helping the modders by robbing them 75% of the share nice move valve and bethesda i am impressed

just why valve
not recommended
although i like this game mainly for the emerson and mods not for the game itself i am all for supporting modders so they can keep making great content but that money should be donated for good work or as pay what you want at least but making mods a set price is a very worrying precedent in the gaming community not only will this meat major criticism but will only help create a 2 tier community with piracy and legal issues destroying what is a tight nit community of creatives and for that reason i have given this game a bad review for what bethesda have allowed their game to become the harbinger signalling the death of community modding gg steam wp

one of the reasons we struggle with transitioning to digital media is becuase patent owners such as apple or google takes a cut when a newspaper is sold through their stores the backlash has of course been huge and slowly we are seeing big tech companies allowing the media to sell their products with tech companies taking a smaller cut now valve comes along and learned nothing they are taking a 75% cut for every mod they sell for skyrim a game only worth playing because of the fantastic mod community i agree that modders need to pay their rent but that rent is not getting paid when valve is taking 75% of the cut stay clear folks

when this game first came out it was amazing and the whole workshop thing was a pretty nice addition after awhile in the game people made the most random mods that just ruined the game for me instead of fixing this issue they thought oh hey you know what we should do to line our pockets moremake the players the back bone of our company to have to pay for the only thing we had free on our game i feel like they didnt come up with the idea to help the artists they did it to help themselves so they can afford the payments on their solid gold house and diamond infused car so my honest opinion is that you should change it back the way it was and offer jobs to the artist to work for you so relating to the game itself is amazing and if you get it then i wouldnt touch the mods until they fix the colossal screw up they created with the workshop

look were already milking customers dry for money why not began taxing people for mods which have been free for decades great idea everyone will love it when the best part of their game is now costing them $5 each new ways to support developers my  if the mod makers wanted money they would have asked for it and they definetly would not ask for 25% of it its monopolizing on something that has never before been monopolized on and without mods lets face it the graphics are crap and the game is bland mods are what was making this game live longer already an enb is a pay mod thats one less graphical enhancer out there it is really sad because some of my favourite mods that are amazing now are pay to use i dont think i will touch this game again until the pay for mods is out of here im disapointed because if any developer decides to do this your mod will be taken out of your game without notice and youll have to pay some odd 4 bucks for it i think the word valve needs to learn is dlc

skyrim overall is a ok game there is good and bad one of the main selling points to me has always been the massive modding community recent decisions have been made basically trying to turn the free thing into microtransactions i think this is a very poor choice and will have a widespread negative impact of what has been one of if not the biggest advantages to many of bethisidas game releases such as the elder scrolls series and fallout setting aside that those who make the mods a process that can take countless hours will only get 25% for what is primarily their creation this attempt to monitise what has typically been absent of cost is a step in a direction that worries me greatly it has all manner of issues many mods are group efforts or use resources created to other modders for free if you charge for a mod with things you do not own in it what happens over all i suspect this payed mods is going to stir up all manner of resentment feuding theft plagiarism and hatred i fear that this will have a toxic effect on the community and kill the goose that lays the golden egg aka we had a good thing where nice people made stuff for the game now there all gonna fight and no one will make good stuff any more

the only reason this game is still kicking is because of the modders they spent alot of time fixing bugs that bethesda refused to the modification community of the game was a strong one with a deep passion for the elder scrolls money has thoroughly corrupted it thanks to valve steam and bethesda with the implimintation of paying for mods you can expect to spend a lot of money buying mods that make the game run as it was supposed to you can also expect to purchase mods that are stolen from someone elses work you can also expect to buy mods that will break the game or not function correctly and you will not get a refund as steam will keep your money in a steam wallet for example one of the cornerstones of several mods involves a script extender a certain program many people run on their pc will cause it not to work this will in turn cause the mod you bought not to work again this game is incredibly buggy without modification and it isnt right that you should have to do several microtransactions to get it there on a side note bethesda makes a ludicrous profit off of the modders work work that bethesda should have been doing in the first place when they released the game

much as i love skyrim i can no longer support a publisherdev who put mods behind a paywall and split and cause fights within modding community no longer can support those who dont know what modding is and its meaning therefore i have to say no do not buy this till they change their stance vote with your wallet and mind long live the nexus for free mods shame on you bethsoftzenimax learn your lesson

rge core mechanics of this game are awesome i will not downplay that however i cannot support this pay for mod move when essentially mods have kept skyrim relevant for all these years i played it on 360 then migrated to pc just for modsand now this development has me smh valve and bethesda this was a very ill advised move

valve is greedy when you hear the phrase 7525 split of revenue for modders you would assume that means the modders are getting 75% nope valve is only giving these modders 25% after spending weeks making this product and pocketing the rest then theres the issue of support what if the mod breaks a week down the line after an update and the dev refuses to fix it heshe has your money so why do they care plus people are stealing free mods and rehosting them and profiting off them valve has also given unclear advice about whether mod dependencies are okay when done in the correct way this could be a great way to support modders allow modders to make the minimum price 0 so its free  donation give them at least 70% of revenue like apples app store and make clear the copyright rules clear and dont push steam towards microtransaction hell

there is no way i can support those who killed the modding community especially ironic considering that bethesda had always used mods as a selling point valve is also as much to blame as them i hope that this cancer of an idea can be contained before it spreads to the rest of the industry i just hope that they will both be remembered as those who ruined one of the last thing that made pc gaming worthwhile

i have put in nearly 1100 hours onto this game 90% of that is thanks to a robust modding community that has provided endless patches content and quality of life game improvements all of this means that i should realistically give this a positive review but with the latest debacle over paid modding i am revoking my endorsement this whole thing is utterly shameful and bethesda and valve are wiping out any goodwill theyve accumulated over the years

valve has taken steps to put mods behind a paywall most of this is understandable however 75 percent of the profits go to valve for doing little to no work in the process regardless of what valve gets out of it from what i have seen almost all mods in the paid section are stolen a  move i believe by both the perpatrators and valve for allowing this to continue unmoderated noone wins except valve the workshop was already insurperior to the skyrim modding nexus now its a nobrainer decision skyrim workshop is now a meaningless thing nothing but a nuisance with nothing unique of value to offer
not recommended
its been an awesome ride but what really made this game a diamond in the rough was the help from people polishing the game in the form of mods its the mods that have kept the game alive this long not valve nor bethesda thumbs down to the greedy s we are doing this for the modders pfft yeah right
not recommended
the recent addition of paid mods has been a huge blow to skyrims enjoyability and longevity modders have kept this game alive for many many years and now its only a matter of time before the best mods are locked behind paywalls and microtransactions the worst part is that steambethesda are taking the lions share of the profits sevent five percent vote with your wallet stay away from any paid mods
not recommended
the workshop is a place to share creations to increase the longevity of skyrim in essence putting price tags on user created content is killing the community there is average of about 20 hours of content that you can burn through without mods now ive got to pay i have upwards of 300 mods on my game are you gonna charge 300 for it valve has simply become an exploitive corporation whose priorities lie in the vault 1110 for the game though  thanks nexus x

awesome game a little buggy but thatll be ironed out soon mod kit coming so expect infinite replayability in the future  edit i no longer recommend this game on the fact that it endorses paid for mods with 75% profit ratio to the companies that own it an example of one of the various problems is posted below by anonymous this is an oftoverlooked implication what happens when developers start making mods in their free time after a game goes gold they have a leg up on everyone else in that theyre intimate with the systems before the game even launches given the toxic vile nature of the industry chances are developers and publishers will even encourage their employees to do this encourage in this context means cut employees who dont while i doubt any devpublisher aside from the already caustic obviously anticonsumer ones will purposefully gimp their game to make a profit on mods it really does have some serious negative implications for industry employees

ill start out by saying that ive enjoyed skyrim with the vibrant modding community a game that on its own is an interesting but very buggy and somewhat tedious affair has become an extremely enjoyable experience all due to the efforts over the years by many people however with valve now allowing others to sell mods and even mods that have been free and downright necessary for an enjoyable experience such as skyui i can no longer recommend this game to others even at the current discount price buying this game now would support this atrocious move by valve do not support the sale of mods by buying this game and do not buy paid mods

look were already milking customers dry for money why not began taxing people for mods which have been free for decades great idea everyone will love it when the best part of their game is now costing them $5 each new ways to support developers my  if the mod makers wanted money they would have asked for it and they definetly would not ask for 25% of it its monopolizing on something that has never before been monopolized on and without mods lets face it the graphics are crap and the game is bland mods are what was making this game live longer already an enb is a pay mod thats one less graphical enhancer out there it is really sad because some of my favourite mods that are amazing now are pay to use i dont think i will touch this game again until the pay for mods is out of here im disapointed because if any developer decides to do this your mod will be taken out of your game without notice and youll have to pay some odd 4 bucks for it i think the word valve needs to learn is dlc

paid mods are ridiculous this sets a dangerous precedent for the future of steam mods are by nature experimental which makes them unstable customers are going to be paying for random crashes to desktop you can make them as perfect as possible but there is always going to be at least some issues and judging by the amount of garbage that makes it through greenlight you can be sure that a similar amount of trash quality mods are going to be put onto the steam paid workshop page the game itself is amazing though

what the  valve seriously trying to make more money on content that should be free because a it is user created and b people buy the game on pc for the modsthey dont buy it so they could have the game a good percentage of people have the console versions but switch in order to play skyrim with a whole new feel but with out the incorporation of big business you guys were champions of user created content and now look what you did you ruined it so you could make money well guess what you will make money but i hope that enough people see through this facade and you make nothing

i dont review that many games on steam but i will not be giving this game a thumbs up with valve and bethesda looking to make some serious dough under the guise of helping content creators we now have a bit of segregation in the modding scene modders who list their mods as paid are only seeing 25% of the money despite doing 90% of the work we also have stolen mods that are free from their original source being posted as paid mods for some quick cash worse are some modders adding nag screens to the previous free version bugging players to pay for the mod i am personally okay with modders making some money off their work much like im in favor of youtubers making money but if any youtuber were to paywall their channel theyd be shafted because it disturbs the ecosystem so much modders you should consider asking for donations instead and not let valve and bethesda rob you of those contributions its very much like how youtubers use patreon and other services to help pay for the time and effort put into their work make that the standard and im sure people will gladly toss some change your way but paywalling your content and worse nagging people about why they havent paid for the new version yet is really low and tacky this is more of an ethics review than a review of the actual game i know since i dont have much playtime on the pc version but since it is a decision that was endorsed by the developer i think it belongs here
not recommended
i love this game but i can not reccomend it to anyone else for purchase that goes for any other bethesda product past present or future i will never pay for player mods and i will never support mod authors or corporations who ask me to do so

this game is truly amazing however these paid mods are a step in the wrong direction they are atrocious

so skyrim is a decent game not amazing in fact its my least favourite of the tes games so far considering how much of the game mechanices form the past have ben stripped form the game but thats not why im writing this im writing this because allowing the sale of mods is ludacris i have always been firmly against paying money for digital content that does nothing to improve the game and i hold that stance in this matter i feel that this is a huge mistake on valves part and a cheap delusion on the part of the authors

bethesda has had a long tradition of working hard through their development cycle to make sure that bugs are not fixed it wouldnt even surprise me if todd himself works overtime during the last few weeks to add more bugs in with how many one can find in not only skyrim but all bethesda games not to mention bethesdas tradition of removing features from each tes game remember spears and the multiple amounts of weapon and armour types such as short blade long blade blunt unarmoured light armour medium armour heavy armour etc in morrowind remember how many of those were merged together or outright removed for oblivion do you know how many are missing from skyrim are you a grandfather that remembers that even morrwind couldnt handle everything from daggerfall fortunately bethesda leaves these games pretty wide open and tons of modding communities sprouted up to not only fix all of bethesdas lazy half  attempts to release an unfinished game but add in new content to add limitless hours of replayability its pretty bad when bethesdas official patches dont do much aside from fixing few of the game breaking bugs and leaving everything else and consumers have to rely on the unofficial morrwindoblivionskyrim patch to fix thousands literally of bugs that take only a few lines of code to fix but i digress as of april 24 2015 the dream is dead valve and bethesda have partnered to offer paid mods through the steam workshop with little to no regulation at all all while reaping a massive 75% of the profit leaving mod creators with a measly 25% while in the past massive free overhauls such as falskaar the unofficial oblivionmorrowindskyrim patchs the highly detailed armour sets impressive new weapons entirely new races could be found on many modding websites such as the nexus with bethesdas blessing it appears that is no longer the case for the low low price of your soul and dignity you can get a bunch of cheap looking weapons from dota 2 that dont even look like their dota 2 counterparts a hev suit from half life 2 that absolutely fits into the culture and lore of skyrim and a fishing animation mod thats already been removed from the workshop because the mod creator hasnt been happy about how this whole debacle has been handled but hey its not like fishing animiations should have been in the base game anyways right ^ dont let this continue dont support  devs who cant release a finished game then eat up their overpriced paid mods that were made by community members that are offered for free on the nexus bethesda has already done this once before with paid horse armour dlc for oblivion it was stupid then its even more  backwards now

it was good before but now we need to pay for mods i really dont like it what the gullible idiots who are in favor  or neutral  towards this toxic practice completely miss is that teleologically speaking there is a certain objectivity to what ends up being beneficial to everyone in the long run and what doesnt this objectivity of what is good and what is bad is correlated with ethics and that is what ensued this incurring torm the people who say that this practice is legitimate are the same who wont mind loads of dlc cutcontent ondisc dlc season passes microtransactions early access and the like please do notice that all the previous examples have one thing in common to detach you further away from your hardearned money in exchange for an ever lesser service paid mods will result in legal conundrums of epic proportions since most dlc infringes on various ip copyrights at the same time and with publishers meddling in a world previously untouched by corporate lawyers and legalese experts we the gamers in due time will see our mods reduce in quality variety and spectrum in due time modders will also be substituted from being enthusiastic fans who want to introduce new content to the games to being money hungry s from poor countries who want a quick buck selling tasteless reskins these new modders will  themselves out to corporate interests in exchange for a meager 25% yet again publishers win and we lose this new practice is completely outrageous no matter how one looks at it the idea of paid mods is also against the spirit of entrepreneurship voluntarism and capitalism it symbolizes the ascension of monetarism and the commoditization of every single aspect of content creation

after a very long time of playing skyrim i have decided my verdict although it took a long time to come to terms with my selfdeception i believe i can finally give the elder scrolls v skyrim an unbiased review the gameplay of skyrim is largely based on the actionrpg genre similar to the previous installment oblivion but different from morrowind you can choose to see the world through either the third or first person through that decision you use weapons that you can upgrade but also grow in strength through your characters skill level that is increased by your continued use of the type of weapon to kill everything considered hostile without a seconds thought item and gold management is largely useless at higher difficulties and is fairly pointless at lower ones as well potions can be spammed in combat by pausing the game world to access your inventory gold buys nothing you cant loot from the corpses you laid out on your journey towards wherever you happened to be going at that time using the smith skill you can get all the best items for your level exactly when they are available and most times before even that dungeons are just a sequence of rooms with enemies in them that you have to kill to get to the end after that you just take a conveniently stupid shortcut right back to the entrance there is generally nothing unique about any of them just a single track to follow from the entrance to the end like something out of wow you can become the guild leader of all the guilds in a single playthrough after just a single questline each most of the quests are so boring and uninteresting that they just stay in your quest journal for the rest of time because you cant be bothered to complete them the ones that are interesting are over in a half hour to an hour the writing is stunted by lack of imagination the world is horribly vanilla for a tes game less so than oblivion thankfully populated with generic vikings romans and evil nazis the main questline can be largely abandoned for the more interesting sidequests and often is and the implementations of dragons and dragon shouts becomes boring after killing a hundred or so the skills system is also uninspired i imagine it started with the idea that your skills improve the more you use them this is true to an extent however the fact that they still incorporated a leveling system along side the usebased skills becomes frustrating they blended their new system with the old one and it becomes counterintuitive leveling up you are given the choice of upgrading your health magica or stamina and you are given one point to put into whatever skill you choose while the original stats system may be hard to grasp by newcomers to the series the continued casualization of the series just feels like a betrayal to the crowd that helped build it all of the things i have mentioned are all symptoms of bethedsa reaching out to a wider audience just like they did with oblivion i do not agree with this practice this is not to say skyrim is a bad game just not the game it could have been

not recommended
skyrim belongs to the mods
not recommended
absolutely disgraceful this is how i would describe how valve and bethesda are acting and how much this decision to do paid mods has destroyed the community for this game
not recommended
i cant in good conscience support what steam is attempting to do with the workshop in principle i think modders should have some means of being compensated for the work they dobut in practice im extremely concerned with the way they attempted to implement this i urge valve to reconsider this course of action
not recommended
needs a crapload of mods to work oh and the mods also might conflict with eachother resulting in more crap unpolished buggy as hell simplistic boring smash buttons combat system shallow empty world  tier quests compared to oblivion

im forced to pay for mods now why not give me the option to donate back to nexus

skyrim is a good game no doubt about it and the various mods that have been made for close to 4 years now are a testimony of that  modding is about sharing and bulding a strong community  its about passion for gaming  hiding mods behind a paywall will divide us  these types of practice are unforgivable and trying to bleed people dry will only justify pirating valve and bethesda have open the pandora box and skyrim is the first nail in the coffin of pc gaming 
not recommended
do not support paid mods

morrowind was better oblivion was better skyrim was always a little off but alot of people made it better with mods and ive heard thats down the drain now so oh well

i love this game but paying for mods is bs put in a optional donation button not happy steam
not recommended
would love to say that everyone should play this game but because of paid mods im changing my review to negative valve should not be hiding community made features behind a paywall why not just add a donate button to mods pages because by putting them behind a paywall valve can take money from the money paid from the mods this is a shameful display of greed from valve
not recommended
nope
not recommended
i cannot in good conscience recommend a game when it is the flagship for an unreasonable expansion in dlc policy regardless of the quality of the game itself its incorporation in the new scheme of paid modding is sufficient in my eyes to receive a negative review

absolutely sick of what the gaming world is turning into paid mods on pc ugh what was once usually passion projects or people simply tinkering around with a game they enjoy is now becoming yet another money grab by steam whilst i certainly support modders being credited and rewarded for their efforts in such a way as set prices seems downright wrong to me what we have here is the modding equivalent of oblivion horse amour if such a system exists it should be a donation only system and not a straight up marketplace
not recommended
while the game is still good i can no longer recommend it to anyone because of the paid mods feature
not recommended
a dangerous precedent has been set by valve bethesda and those modders who choose to go pay to play sadly the last bethesda game i will be buying unless monetized mods are removed

changing my review of the game to negative i am not against the idea of supporting modders for their efforts but the newly introduced system on the workshop is deeply flawed eg using other modders resources and charging for them stealing content and outragous prices base game for 5 starter pack of mods for 26and taking a 75% cut between bethesda and valve for work they didnt do themselves i recommend everyone to go to the nexus and support content you like through their donation system
not recommended
a gorgeous open world game steeped in its own mythology with sharp tactile melee combat and satisfying archery ive never got on with magic in elder scrolls games but thats purely personal preference both the graphics and art design are great making simply wandering around immersive you can ignore the main questline if you wish  its a soso you are the chosen one save us all fantasy affair  which is not a problem as there is so much else to do personally i tend towards wandering and enjoying the harsh wintry vistas that seem to be around every other corner occasionally stumbling into a longforgotten dungeon to explore and loot when the novelty wears off and you start to see through the smoke and mirrors simplistic npcs and ai small and underpopulated towns and villages theres a multiplicity of mods for the game that do everything from expanding and populating the land creating more realistic weather improving textures adding quests and characters often fully voiced well you see the point its an elder scrolls game and its the mods that are the big draw for a lot of players and heres the rub im not against donating to modders  these folk put their heart and soul into making games different better more varied even fixing bugs but the payment model being tested on skyrim by valve and bethesda is both grossly unfair to the modders who receive only a 25% cut with the rest being pure profit for the companies and has already led to some horribly perverse outcomes with one paid mod taken down already for using others assets without permission and dmca claims against another numerous mods have vanished from the nexus website as modders pull their work for fear it will be stolen meanwhile its very likely that the mod store will fill with dross put out to make a quick buck and it is very unclear exactly what and with whom we as consumers are transacting and hence what our rights are what happens if a mod works as intended but is abandoned much like greenlight the community is not going to be able to effectively police quality  the flood of rubbish into the steam store recently is testament to this now it seems likely that modding currently a wonderful and integral part of pc gaming is going the same way for the sake of a quick buck theres better ways to do this so why cant modders players devs and valve work it out rather than have yet another illthoughtthrough scheme forced on us

the game itself is great and the modding is fantastic but now we have to put up with paid mods from valve so im giving a thumbdown just for this as if the steam workshop isnt  enough serious fire whoever the  give this idea a green light

it is a decent game still not nearly as good as morrowind you can check out my review for that if youre interested in my thoughts on it at best without mods its a blandlooking bugridden clickspam combat hack and slash game the story is mediocre and the dumbing down of the series shows if you get it cheap $5$15 with all the dlc then yeah its worth it i however bought it at launch which i sorely regret doing however with mods the game is certainly much better from graphics to gamepay its just all around better but i am not reviewing skyrim modded im reviewing vanilla skyrim so ill have to stick to my negative review
not recommended
around the time i graduated high school i found this great game called morrowind the story was engrossing the world immersive  and as i soon came to discover the game was heavily moddable this meant that even though i had already played through a good portion of this game and was soon to finish i could replay it and have a very different experience and i did so much i even created my own underground lair with the editor it was amazing needless to say mods and the modding community really set the scene for bethesdas tes series and has been a major driver behind its wild popularity fast forward to skyrim i no longer have the time to sink into creating my own material these days but i still run a little over 100 mods these mods breathe a life into the game well beyond its vanilla experience such that ive sunk over 600 hours into play time would i have done this if all of these mods cost me a couple dollars each would i be so smitten with the series still even after all these years hell no like most folks out there i am not made of money i live on a budget i am not going to pay two hundred three hundred four hundred dollars for a video game i will donate to the community when i can  a community that has done very well for itself without this hairbrained forced mods4cash scheme so far mind you  and i appreciate all the time and effort the modders have put into their work bethesdavalve dont really seem to appreciate this effort quite so much with their 75% cut off the back of folks who are breathing life into their games and keeping sales going for far longer than they would have if the games were locked to modders in light of recent events and the hollow words of gabe newell on his reddit ama which seem to point to a continued mods fer sale on steam existence  i would not recommend skyrim or the elder scrolls series going forward

its a good game but the new practice of selling mods is being handled without any form of consideration for the consumer and as such i feel the overall quality of the game is going to suffer for this think about these mods in terms of quality forget about the fact theyve been made by an outside entity youre essentially paying for early access dlc that might not even be compatible with other early access dlc theres no form of quality assurance whatsoever valve have a no refund policy and im not even sure what the legality of the situation is in regards to esrb ratings if you want to buy the game or any of the official dlc go ahead but stay away from the modding content with a price tag until theres some form of quality assurance

i have enjoyed skyrim for more than 400 hours no thanks to bethesda and their bugriddled pile of crap but thanks to the dedicated modders that polished the turd until it was a gem enough is enough i am not against modders earning a bit of cash for their work but this implementation is insulting beyond reason the entire reason that skyrim is still one of the most popular games in the world is because of the modders yet they only receive 25% off their work the announcement and the secrecy up untill then the lack of information discussion and the outright banning of dissenting voices in steam discussions speaks volumes of how much bethesda and valve value us a customers all the goodwill bethesda had built with me by being one of the only aaa developers to offer extensive modding support has vanished and i will not buy fo4 the next dishonoured or other bethesda games gabens insulting ama on reddit where he did everything he could to do damagecontrol by the corporate  book in the past i have supported steam by usually buying my games so far more than 200 through this service ven if alternatives existed but no more i have already bought witcher iii on gog instead as a protest and in the future i will never buy anything directly from steam again it will be nuuvem humblebundle or gog when available a stand against corporate greed and for the good of the modding community needs to be taken and thus i cant recommend skyrim at this time

i still do not understand what good paid mods could bring to games like this these games have always had a dedicated modding community that have pretty much made the game as popular and enjoyable as it is today within hours of its implementation it has pretty much split the modding community angered thousands of valve and tes fans and caused major damage to the modding community i will not support paid mods i dont want the modding community filled with loving highly respectable creators to be turned into another cash cow just like games did once dlc started getting abused

the vanilla story of skyrim is basic at best the openworld was good for its time but hasnt aged well its a fun game to play once that is if you dont mod the game mods are an essential part of what makes the elder scroll series good now that valve and bethesda have effectively killed the modding community i would not recommend this game maybe pirate it

first id like to point out that the game itself is fantastic and it is through the multitude of mods that make it so damn amazing now that steam is supporting paid mods more and more content is and will be put behind pay walls welcome to the new era of dlc dlc that the company itself doesnt have to make i do not support steams idea of paid mods the workshops will be flooded with absolute crap mods that took little time to make in an effort to make a quick buck i highly doubt anyone who plays this game doesnt have a long list of mods they run many running over fifty mods now imagine having to pay for all the mods you use basically doubling the cost of the game or more hopefully the majority of mod makers do not jump on this bandwagon and can see that steam is just trying to use them to make more money because of this decision i have changed my review to negative and i hope both steam and bethesda sees the folly of their decision edit apparently the split is only 25% for the actual modders so they do the work and only get 14th of the earnings shows exactly what valves intentions are money

do not buy this game you will support valves and bethesdas terrible new mod policies in case you have been living under a rock bethesda and valve have introduced paid mods for skyrim this is not only problematic because this was a service previously free but because it is a system that can be easily exploited which is what is happening on top of that the modder himself only gets a small cut of the profits if a mod gets sold valvebethesda get around 75% of the revenue made off of said mod which is absolutely inexcusable do not support this  business

bethesda and valve are steering pc gaming down the wrong path by implementing monetized modding and theyre using skyrim as a spearhead as such i cannot recommend this game to newcomers despite my love for it at this stage of skyrims life modding is whats keeping it alive for the vast majority that play it including myself to put mods behind a paywall is opening up a huge can of worms that can only be detrimental to the future of the platform and must be stopped before it advances too far for further reading refer the forbes article on the most important points  httpwwwforbescomsitesinsertcoin20150424valvespaidskyrimmodsarealegalethicalandcreativedisaster

first off let me start by saying this is a fantastic game and has been potentially ruined by recent events now i do think that mod developers should be able to receive money for their work i don think it should have been handled in the way it has why not simply add a donate button and valve take a 1015% cut for doing all the hosting etc and then give the original dev around 10% which would leave the mod creator around 75% of the money for 100% of the work 2 weeks ago this review would have been positive but now well see for yourself

the quality of the tes franchise has always been iffy whether it be the poor combat of morrowind dodgey iron sights in nv or the shockingly bad ui in skyrim but at the same time free mods have always been around to fix up bethesdas bad ideas and shameful lack of quality control however now that valve and bethesda are pushing to monetise the modding community with paid mods it becomes difficult to recommend skryim to anyone knowing that at some point in the future the ability to fix bethesdas numerous gameplay misteps and bugs might become what is effectively quite expensive thirdparty dlc moreover paid modding is genuinely offensive in many ways given that bethesda and valve are taking 75% of mod revenue for essentially not only failing to make a good game but taking away one of the key selling points of the pc version of this game after the fact i would in no way recommend this game nor future games in the tes franchise

wow i dont believe it not only has zenimax figured out a way to be even more lazy and ignorant in making a videogame but also wants to ruin everyone elses fun by selling something that has always been considered free and from the heart i understand that the videogame press has decided to defend this choice simply put a paywall for mods but when have they ever been right i mean lets apply this to reality we know that modders can code better than any bethesda employee see bug fixes and skyrim script extender but what if bethesda was an automobile dealer ask yourself this question before you even consider purchasing this game or any mods should you ever have to pay to have a factory defect fixed on a car if you answered yes please consider celibacy and renounce civilization youre better off swinging from the trees

whilst the game gives a solid platform and the core story is reasonably good the real meat of the game comes from the extensive modding community whilst this has always been a huge selling point for pc gaming valve and bethesda are currently attempting to turn this wonderful aspect of pc gaming into something they can exploit the community with for $$$ the idea of paying mod makers isnt a problem and should be encouraged the fact is that the following a there is no quality assurance the mod can be utter rubbish yet until you fork out $$$ you cant know b the mod makers only get 25% of the profit yup the person who did 100% of the work gets a tiny fraction of the money c if a mod stops working tough luck d the mod must earn $400 before the creator sees a penny if it only earns $399 then valve & bethesda get the lot e this encourages both big and impressibe mods but also cash grab nonsense all in all do not support this company

was a great game singlehandedly ruined with the introduction of legally questionable paywalls for fanmade mods many modders have pulled their works from public as others began to steal them to turn a profit on steam and most of the money made from it goes to bethesdasteam rather than the creator themselves a shameless and blatant display of greed that is beginning to tear apart the modding community and pushing away people who genuinely liked and wanted to make this game more fun

first i want to say i own skyrim for the xbox with over 180 hours played and think its a fantastic game even as a standalone ive always wanted to have the pc version of skyrim to play some of the mods ive seen for it well thanks to valve and bethesda i cant enjoy the modded skyrim experience without being sure to give them even more money i think its absolutely crazy that bethesda has made over a billion dollars on skyrim yet they want to take 75% of every paid mod offered in the steam workshop same goes for you valve im sure youve made a lot of money off skyrim and its disgusting how greedy the both of you are being you both are multi billion dollar companies but lets take some more of our communities money by doing 0 work and making 75% of the profits you remind me of congress soon as the question of pay raises for themselves is brought to the table its the fastest thing congress passes next to mexican food i will buy this game i played the trial as soon as modding returns to what it was instead of another funnel directly into valvebethesdas greedy overflowing pockets
not recommended
the game itself was great with mods was awesome but now that valve and bathesda decided to turn mods into paid dlc is damaging not only the community but also the re playability of newer games and the possible abuse from modders for a quick cash grab mods have gave birth to countless classics and it is my opinion thanks to a loyal and passionate community creating paywalls will hinder that innovations and divide the community why not add a donation button instead
not recommended
paid mods that dont even support the mod makers because they only get 25% of all sales is a deal breaker for me
not recommended
do not buy this game on steam as long as they are making people pay for mods mods are not commercial products if they want people to give money they should have implemented a donate button
not recommended
only 25% of the game was good
not recommended
love this game to death but what valve and bethesda are doing to it is just wrong mods should not become dlc and that is exactly what is happening here the community needs to put its foot down and show them that we do not support the direction they are taking our games

this game was alright without mods but mods where the reason most people own this game do i really need to carry on

the game is big only because of the modding community and instead of hiring the best people in the community to make their next game actually worthwhile even without mods they are treating them like dirty replaceable trash giving the unstable job of making fanfic dlc and getting pennies in return while completely destroying the whole modding community itself

have you played previous elder scrolls games this is just them except with nicer graphics and some systems which are either a little better or a lot worse only worth it with mods which are a huge ordeal to install and even then the combat is not good

 the exploration was good  some good mods but cannot really rate a game on what other people make for it but hey got to have more than one positive up here  rather uninteresting story and rather dull combat  almost all the side quests were bad now that they are starting to be paywalled it is hard to justify getting this game the extra conent which was paid to begin with was not worth the hassel hearthfire does add in something interesting which i have not seen in rpg other than rs and without having to spend weeks building a decent house was something to be happy with while this pay for extra things in our lackluster game because we spent too much time drawing and not enough time writing game was good with mods it does not justify spending extra just to have it tweaked to your preference reccommendation for a game which is very good with mods  mount and blade warband rpg with good medival period fantasy combat  dark souls 12 rpg with good story  oblivion had some very good moments mass effect trilogy bit wonky at times due to a writer leading at some point

these new ways to support workshop creators are a joke especially with the measly 25% cut with no quality control the desire to make $$$ will be what drives modders to flood the workshop with loweffort paid mods and they can already be found in the workshop mods have always been something pc gamers have been able to brag about theyve always been freely available to us and theyre very useful when it comes to fixing broken games heck there are skyrim mods that fix bugs and issues that only make the game much better theres an old way that actually supports content creators that isnt anything new and really does support the creator donations  you could just implement that but of course steam knows that they defend their cut by saying that modders have a pay what you want option that does absolutely nothing to alleviate the meager cut modders get and seriously no announcements for feedback on this new feature as unexpected as it was we know why it happened and steamvalve know why they couldnt let anyone know i hope the backlash shows steamvalve that while pc gamers have always put them on a pedestal for good reason the pedestal can always be kicked out under them

would pay for mods again 1010 on a serious note though this game is ok buy on sale otherwise dont oh and dont buy any workshop mods even if you want to support the modders they only get 25% of your payment and they dont get paid any cent if they dont make 400 usd at the end of the month which excludes the huge cut valve bethesda and some other people including the nexus get 75% overall now lets think about that a little imagine if i made a little mod and would sell it for 1$ i only get 25 cents of every sale now for those 25 cents to add up to 400$ 1600 people would have to buy my mod even if you wish to support modders directly donating to them via paypalpatreonwhateverthepeopleusetogetdonations will help them a lot more consider doing that if you insist on giving modders a little tip in my opinion mods should not be locked behind a paywall if you support this standpoint too write a negative review in the same vein as mine and vote with your wallet after all valve are a company that knows how to handle money and if nobody buys these mods being locked behind a paywall and if enough people speak up against it we might be able to have them stop this new practice if people will support this on the other hand mods will become glorified dlc and a lot of modders will be opportunists jumping on the train for a quick buck
not recommended
you know ive played this game quite a bit the only reason i have the low play data is due to a steam reset i believe skyrim is an amazing game with limitless potential due to the power of modding but now valve and bethesda have moved to try and put those mods behind a paywall i cant reccomend a game that does that

skyrim without mods is a bland boring game skyrim on pc without a $5 ui mod is considered unplayable by many people so the price of this game is always at least $5 more than they say dont pay for mods dont let bethesda sell you dlc they didnt create

as an almost fouryear terraria modder i just cannot support this practice to spread paid mods are one of the steps that will degrade the quality of games to a large degree and any game that has done this in the past is now dead or nearly dead combined with the dlc practices practiced by many companies this just isnt good news and hereby i do not support this practice a donate button would be fine but not locking mods behind greed what valve makes a huge profit off of just screams money and greed to me and it should to everyone who sees this practice

now that steam and gaben have sold out and opened a pandoras box shaped like a terrible idea i can no longer recommend skyrim prior to this ive logged 70h on my steam copy of skyrim 150h on xbox 360 and 40h on a nonsteam copy i never downloaded mods from the workshop to begin with because it was already inferior to other options now those other options have the added benefit of not being paygated but this stupidity has already made people start pulling their mods from free sites for fear of having them stolen uploaded to the workshop and their own work dmcad the game itself is solid and the modding community made it excellent but i fear that that may be over now i have never been more ashamed of valve and bethesda than i am now httpswwwchangeorgpvalveremovethepaidcontentofthesteamworkshop  56k signatures and counting e as of 42715 valve and bethesda relented and took down paid mods for skyrim however but we underestimated the differences between our previously successful revenue sharing models and the addition of paid mods to skyrims workshop we understand our own games communities pretty well but stepping into an established years old modding community in skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating we think this made us miss the mark pretty badly even though we believe theres a useful feature somewhere here this review will remain negative until three years have passed with no attempt to institute the same system for other newer games without a community ready to defend them
not recommended
very dissapointed in bethesda and steam allowing for paid mods the skyrim modding community has been fine and continued to steer in the right direction for well over 9 years including tesoblivion the last thing we need is for steam and bethesda to make a quick buck also according to gabe newell on the reddit ama the percentage split for paid mods is dictated by the developer if bethesda really believed in supporting mod creators the cut % would not be just 25% overall developers are looking to make a quick buck and not here to support the modding community i am very dissapointed

i cant in good faith recommend this anymore bethesda and valve trying to monetize a hallmark of pc gaming mods have a long successful history and its never been about getting rich mods are made users enjoy donations are made and often times mods get picked up by game companies now and again and are made into amazing games of their own nothing about this new system incites creativity and quality i know they wont listen to a simple review but i hope our chance to vote with our dollars doesnt come before this spreads

if there is any game that proves studios do not need to release a relatively bug free massive content filled game while still being overwhelmingly successful tesv skyrim is it however bethesda owes their success and high ratings to the kind and good willed people who fixed  modified skyrim for nothing in return and what does bethesda do to reward these people they endorse a laughable cash farmpaid mods system where they are doing nothing and taking the biggest cut the only reason why this 4 year old game is still relevant and talked about today is because of the content modders created and fixed yes paid mod system on steam workshop has been removed but bethesda has left a burning scar on the attractive modding community with their actions i have no doubt they would try and take advantage of their greatest undeserved asset again which is why i cant thumbs up this product what i think of the game itself without mods good  graphicsvisuals are good for its time i like the combat talent tree is nice sprint bar bad  short quest lines especially for guilds dialoguestory writing doesnt live up to previous elder scrolls dragon combat seems corny to me not as many cavesdungeons as tesiv about the whole paid mods situation im not against someone making money for the things they create ^ive bought several early access games this isnt even necessary to say^ im not against giving my money to someone for the things they create i have donated money to modderserver owners in the past i am against steam workshop turning into a micro transaction nightmare i am against studios making money on mods that fix a game i am against studios having even less incentive than they do now to make an outstanding game because they would be able to sit on a cash farm known as paid mods

im in two minds whether to change this review back to positive or not because im still neutral here thing is skyrim is only an amazing game because of the many thousands of mods that prop it up take the mods away and youre left with a simple fps rpg game with an even simpler plot it looks wonderful it plays rather smoothly the combat is nice there are other things you can praise skyrim for but the sheer power and tenacity of modders is what makes skyrim so strong thankfully the skyrim paid mod workshop fiasco has come to an end but my trust has been shaken for now i will leave my review as negative a fitting scar for the scism that now runs down the community on an unrelated note dont buy the dlcs on their own its often cheaper to just get the ultimate edition whenever its on sale for 10 or so  you save yourself a good bit of money

let me break this down to you when skyrim came out almost four years ago it was a buggy awful mess stuttering everywhere npcs breaking down and if you went in the wrong place at the wrong time it crashed today it is still a buggy awful mess stuttering everywhere npcs breaking down and if you go through the wrong door at the wrong time it will crash but luckily there were mods to fix that stuttering removal scriptfixes for the npcs and magic ritual powered by the blood of children to stop this thing from crashing every time you go in a building now mods are behind a paywall now you have to pay for the very things that made this game playable in the first place on top of the games actual price its a scam theres literally no other word for it except for synonyms for scam you are now being treated exactly like the little consumer plaything bethesda and valve see you as and not a lot of people like it i definitely dont so i cannot in good consciousness recommend you a buggy awful mess where you have to pay extra for communitymade addons for the same reason i cannot recommend you a crappy free to play mmo where you have to pay for an edge over every other player dont buy this game

ok so id like to point out that this game is amazing the storyline the quests and sidequests the land available even without any dlc will have you hooked for hours then the dlc come which are exceedingly good and worth every penny then it comes to the bad mods well paid mods the mods themselves are amazing getting chased by the trololol troll while riding flutter from my little pony is something that never gets old however paying 5 for a mod on a 7 game is an absolute joke there are many other ways around this which im not allowed to nexus ahem talk about if you dont own this get it but do not for the love of god pay for any mods the devs have always done ths out of the kindness of their heart and have always said you can donate to them great game 1010 would take an arrow to the kneww for whereas screw paid mods

what can i say halffinished game that only survived because of modability which will now be placed behind payment walls while the decision is a good one for modding in the long term the consumer is again shafted i wouldnt recommend the base game skyrim as anything close to being worth playing however if you dont mind to keep forking out money for characters weapons minor patches etc then this game might be for you was nice while it lasted though edit well now that the paid mods have been >>temporarily<< put on hold until they can put more legal bindings on them i will refrain from changing the review since its only a matter of time before its back also the damage has been done the community is in shambles modders are leaving and players are still spamming about it i feel like the modders pulling their free mods is mostly because of the players who attacked the modders more than the allure of potential profits the playerbase attacked the wrong targets here but everythings been done now we just wait and see where this develops thirdparty dlc that the company is actually getting money for and then money from publishing it is here to stay there is nothing we can do ill miss gaming

edit even though valve & bethesda withdrew paid mods from skyrim i am still not changing my review them pulling it back doesnt change that they tried to push the idea in the first place the game itself is great many hours of fun in just the base game add mods and it becomes a whole new experience why the negative review you may ask mods are the lifeblood of this game and valve & bethesda see fit to lock them behind paywalls just to make a quick buck this is not acceptable

first id like to point out that the game itself is fantastic and it is through the multitude of mods that make it so damn amazing now that steam is supporting paid mods more and more content is and will be put behind pay walls welcome to the new era of dlc dlc that the company itself doesnt have to make i do not support steams idea of paid mods the workshops will be flooded with absolute crap mods that took little time to make in an effort to make a quick buck i highly doubt anyone who plays this game doesnt have a long list of mods they run many running over fifty mods now imagine having to pay for all the mods you use basically doubling the cost of the game or more hopefully the majority of mod makers do not jump on this bandwagon and can see that steam is just trying to use them to make more money because of this decision i have changed my review to negative and i hope both steam and bethesda sees the folly of their decision edit apparently the split is only 25% for the actual modders so they do the work and only get 14th of the earnings shows exactly what valves intentions are money

less content than either morrowind or oblivion you used to be able to increase content with mods but now theyve nickled and dimed that away

used to be good until are you forced to pay for other peoples mods they even started banning people on the forums and started forcing mod sites to pull the mods so steam can make a profit

they want you to pay for features made by amateurs that should have been in the game to begin with

doesnt deserve all of the praise an overhyped oversimplified rpg with frustrating combat overwhelming and unnecessarily complex skill trees and braindead ai the only justification for buying this game is for modding which is the only thing that makes this game half bearable as the vanilla version is completely bland use your money somewhere else

good dammit valve this greed for money is insane put a damn support modder button in not turn mods into dlc put good use to your time and instead of screwing up one of the best games of all time jesus edit i am keeping my review up only because valve and bethesda were being stupid and you dont reward somone for being stupid though i do like them just that was a low moment

i loved the game and the release but the prototyping of mods for sale is just an extension of dlcs that happens to poison the intelectual property of a great game dispite the obvious legal issues and community backlash bethesda and valve have decided to go with the option that nets the most money in the short term by spending their community trust

what i like about skyrim is its high modability and wonderful supportive community what i dont like is that that community is being turned upside down and against itself through the prospect of paid for mods it wasnt needed before and it wont be needed now nor in the future

microtransactions & you valve and bethesda are now servicing paid mods to gamers the mod creators themselves only take 25% from it these modders are selfemployed bethesda and valve are not legally bound to these people valve and bethesda reinvented microtransactions the most unethical business practice of the decade and it is now an indirect source of revenue exploiting modders for their hard work now its a business it involves money trademarks and possible litigation over ownership of intellectual property bethesda can now rely on modders to work for a pittance while cashing in the profits at the same time avoiding legal issues if there are problems with said mods no support from bethesda either they clearly state they do not support modified games but they sure like the money from these mods bethesda is taking pretty much half the profit and modders who are not employees thus bethesda doesnt owe them anything are left to dry in the sand no rights no protection and if you think 25% is bad youre not taking taxes into account its worse than bad

skyrim isnt a very good game without mods the fact that we might have to pay for mods to make bugthesdas game playable is rubbish

bethesdavalve have spelled the beginning of the end of the real modding community the magic of mods are dead if they become paid dlc microtransactions say goodbye to free modding in future bethesda games not that ill be buying them anyway now and yes of course there are still free mods but this is the turning point no one wants to see except money grabbing publishers and a few modders who cant see the forest for the trees
not recommended
paid mods edit the above review went up shortly after bethesda decided it was a good idea to dehumanize everyone in the modding community i have elected to still not recommend this game to set a reminder for what i and many others are against if i were to really review skyrim it would go something like the following vanilla 610 the game is entertaining for 60 hours but seriously lacking in many departments the questlines are boring tedious and short the main storyline is particularly awful the world itself is not very interesting the ui is absolutely broken the rpg elements are shallow the combat and gameplay is generally fun but not noteworthy the previous titles except for oblivion are much more engaging deep interesting fun and worthwhile i recommend morrowind in particular with mods 8510 many of the above issues can be fixed with mods paid mods 010 and a further loss of respect for bethesdavalve

wonderful game after i paid $30 for the gamei only had to pay $80 for mods dlc only half of them workedand most of them were fake or stolen to get a quick buckbut im glad to be supporting steam the modders who spent hard time contributing to the communityeven though they only get 25% of profits
not recommended
with the addition of paid mods i can not support this game anymore its sad
not recommended
seeing as valve has been totally unreponsive in this issue and even going so far as to block dissent this seems to be the only useful way to express opinion on this whole paid mod issue the issue here for me is that monetizing mods means that developers are going to be able to skimp on game features and expect them to added later by mods which they will make money from without work betheda games are notorious for being buggy and their ui are terrible mods like skyui fix this but if mods are monetized skyui has confirmed that they will go to paid mod status we will have to pay extra for the same utility in a game not a good move for the health of pc gaming or the modding community in his reddit post gabe newell expressed that this move was not about making money if thats the case why not back off and work through this slower address community concerns and then make a decision maybe its about not showing weakness but ignoring community concerns or giving nonanswers like gabes reddit post are not helping the issue

the game is fine but having to pay for mods is out right outragous valve hid their microtransactions behind supporting the mod developers the gaming community isnt stupid taking 75% of their costs is one way to make it obvious that this was for valve and not for the mod developers if it wasnt so why not just add a donation button

this games time is over and thus no longer worth playing after the initial 12 or so hours it takes to beat the main quest line youll find yourself bored with this sparsely populated sandbox the real magic comes from the mods free which extend and enhance the experience to well over 500 hours no exaggeration in fact mods even fix the bugs the developerpublisher either cannot or care not to fix however with paid mods the modding community that has kept this game worth playing after all these years has been washed away i would not purchase this old and buggy game without access to the mods without the free mods it is only a weekend before youre bored  not worth the price

the introduction of paid mods as a way to supplement bethesda is absolutely outrageous i used to love following gamespots featurette on weekly skyrim mods but with the introduction of this nonsense i just feel sick no longer can i be imma get that instead its geez i wonder how much that costs absolutely ridiculous this game was released nearly 4 years ago the continued revenue seen by bethesda from the mod community was already significant but this cash grab is absolutely shameful 25% to the modder 75% to valvebethesda absolutely insane

the way that this game has been warped the way the modding community  the community that has kept this game alive for 5 years  has been forced to turn on itself has ruined this game there can no longer exist an innocent modding community a community built solely on mutual respect and love of a game and a hobby i cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone in its current state there is nothing so positive that can supersede the massive negative implemented by valve

alright listen up instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians im going to tell you how dota 2 really is at its core in a nutshell dota 2 is a great game but a terrible experience at the same time you want to keep going back to it but you also hate to go back why one word community dota 2s community is for the most part rude and hateful and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting moba its unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away at the best of times often its much worse and i would prefer not to go into the details sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you havent actually done anything wrong occasionally though you come across friendly players and when that happens the game is a pure joy to play however since the game is 5v5 coming across four nice players at the same time if youre solo queueing is a rarity why then have i played the game for over 2000 hours the sensation of winning your determination to keep playing despite of the discouraging community is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory that sweet moment when you see the enemy ancient blow up and look back on the match remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying but even a victory can come with a grain of salt many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning there is a mute option but that doesnt stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat people can intentionally feed the enemy team ignore their own team teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player its really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time going ranked doesnt really solve the problem either at least not completely ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill it feels much more professional and tryhardish although you meet nice players more often nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell having played some matches in ranked i can say the mode isnt hate free i had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode another problem with ranked is that like i said its more tryhard many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the this is ranked you better be a damn good player mentality but dont get me wrong dota 2 is a great game in itself and thats why i keep going back to it the core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well no technical issues to speak of not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so of which i have had none myself graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them all the various spells and abilites look great the game is very deep and complex with tons of items skill and item builds and strategies to learn it can be a bit terrifying to beginners but once you get the hang of things its engaging all the playable heroes are well balanced although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being op and free to play from the start thats another thing the game does right all the heroes are free and playable from the start unlike dota 2s undeniably very successful competitor league of legends dota 2s microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff which means there are zero pay to win elements in the game it really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game if youre one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you you have a better chance of not finding dota 2 so terrible to put it roughly in perspective playing dota 2 is like playing skyrim but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make calling you a fooping idiot every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective failed to kill alduin uninstall skyrim noob dont know how to make dragonbone armor learn to play tard it would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures would it not sadly thats how dota 2s community is having played the game as long as i have i would say that you are better off not playing dota 2 the game is fun when youre winning because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine which is 50% of the time and sometimes not even when youre winning it isnt the losses that make the game unpleasant its the unfriendly people often your day will just be worse after playing dota 2 instead of it cheering you up as games do people will tell you that dota 2 is great but that greatness comes with a price do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view this review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what its really like not just the great things if you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis then youre good to go the game is at its best when you play with friends and dont have to worry about getting a stick in the mud player on your team great game with bad community

i originally played dota when it was merely a ums on wc3 so take this review for what its worth dota 2 is an addictive experience however this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society if that statement is an insufficient description of the game continue reading this game is not for the casual gamer this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game if you play this game i can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard i have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play no matter what you do you will encounter someone who will complain about something youre doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you i can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with so here are what i consider the pros and cons of the game pros this is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing free to play with optional cosmetic costs gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection this in effect increases replayability tremendously wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more this in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game cons this game has a steep learning curve believe me there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance unlike hero customization in league of legends not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either it can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection but thus is dota secondary to the steep learning curve games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team this can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of fundamentals of gameplay video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have suffice to say many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team the player loses gold and the other team gains gold this doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay unlike other video game developers steam does not region lock this brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference you can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when theres a russian only speaker spanish only speaker and a portuguese only speaker on the us west server blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in america unfortunately this is by far the worst aspect of the game the game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future more often than not an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions there is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 1020 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier this review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary of course if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy final rating game 910 game community 310

after wasting my 1500 hours on it i think i can say something about this game first of all this review is not a humorous one im writing it seriously to give information about this game because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters i think this review will be informative for these people gamers who has spent couple of hours like me knows everything i am going to try to tell after this short introduction we can start russians problem is not about being russian due to the games popularity among russian players there are too many bad always swears doesnt play as its a team game doesnt speak english in eu servers etc russian players but there are also too many nice russian players briefly the problem is not about being russian if there are 10 gamers in dota 4 of them will be bad players if there are 1000 400 of them thats the point if you want to play this game to get relaxed dont do it after few matches you will find yourself more depressed angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed the bad players are the reason for it as an illustriation you started a game to get enjoyed looked the picks someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said me mid or me solo etc ok thats right you are still relax you picked a support for your team they somehow fed the enemies ok still you are relaxed they started to argue with each other they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry and then you will lose the game this type of games are not so rare in dota 3 over 10 games are being played according to this nutshell therefore it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota then why people still playing it too much why there is not just bad players in the community now because it is addictive you can not get rid of it if someone trolls your game you want to play again and wish to play with better players if you win the game you want to win again and increase your mmr if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back shortly you will want to play again after every game however if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want this reason is pointless for you meaningless mmr system when i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players however the system is completely meaningless player profile and skills are same at 1k2k and 3k mmr once you get your mmr it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it 25 every lose decrease it 25 and as i said before player profile is same at 1k 2k and 3k when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc it is completely up to your team so how people get too high mmrs they have this mmr at the begining and how they did it there is no clear information about it valve does not announce how it is being calculated for example i played 10 first ranked games with 8 wins i played support and carries buy wards and couriers when i was support i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry but my mmr was 2200 when some people get 4k starting mmr this system also a fact about this games addiction but doesnt help kind players about creating a better environment all in all i dont recommend this game just because of its community the game is a master piece master of mobas it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game it has great graphics etc however it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it on the other hand if you have a great mental power and patience play it i completely recommend it this review was written for normal patience leveled people i dont say dont waste your time go and do some social activities if u want to play video games dont play it go and play more enjoying games lastly i have an advice for valve it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota people who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players as defined at the beginning they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased now it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling i hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends d some suggestions i wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate i lost my will to play dota however then thanks to some sensitive comments i started to play dota only with my friends now i have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as i mentioned in my review months ago as some people say in comments of this review play this game with your friends after writing this review i have rarely played solo games and it feels better participate in some tournaments after lots of bad pub match experiences that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience you can participate in esls or other platforms open tournaments for free finallynever give up you can encounter very kind players as well after a bad pub game performance your teammates maybe say uninstall dota etc but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends just do not give any importance what they say you can see similar things in this reviews comments section there are very kind sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing offensive comments same is true for the player profile in dota just dont give any importance what the haters say final note for the guys who say why dont u recommend the game while playing it too much please read the review again this review is a complete answer to your question good luck & have fun d unfortunately io lost the arcana showdown  edited game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected some suggestions section added thank you all for suggestions comments and rate ups

at first i thought this game was pretty good but that was until the first time i was called a feeder dota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork except the community only does three things 1 call each other fgs and berate one another for slightly foolish decisions 2 do solo farm and try to win the match by themselves which never works especially if they are playing against a team of 5 players in a party also known as a five stack 3 make fun of and ruin everything for new players if you want to learn how to play dota 2 you either need a really good guide or a good friend who has more than 500 hours into the game the tutorial just teaches you the basics no you cant learn by yourself by playing matchmaking with random people all youll learn from the other players is that you suck because youre new and dont understand any of the tactics and that the best course of action would be to uninstall theres also the fact that some people create new steam accounts so they can be matched up against newbies and annihilate everyone also this game stole all my friends we used to play other games now they play nothing other than dota 2 and one of them has spent $40 in the game on skins cosmetic items that add nothing to the gameplay you can buy some of the best games on steam for less i repeat less than $40 and then he told me he only plays dota because he cant afford any games on steam so there terrible community steals your friends incredibly addictive for some people dont touch this game i spent way too much time hating myself while playing this never again edit 172 people read this review wow also i have to say i think the ingame tutorials are better than the actual game because the actual game has only one map unlike the tutorials i know this is pretty standard for moba games but for me this contributes greatly to actually ruining variety and fun in the gameplay its just all the same tactics over and over on the same map this doesnt only mean less variety but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better on another note this game is like the opposite of everything i like about tf2 unbalanced classes according to google every dota herochampionclasswhatever the hell is overpowered only a single map relies too much on teamwork when its hard to find online whereas tf2 benefits from teamwork but still its not the key to winning a game and its much easier to achieve teamwork because tf2 doesnt rely nearly as hard on your earlygame the earlygame in dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you setting the outcome of the match in stone almost literally during the first ten minutes of the game and also a horrible community not saying tf2s community is good but hell its miles above dota dont really know why i am comparing this game to tf2 maybe because valve made both games but still just wanted to throw out there some actual criticisms about the game itself and not the community now some people have been telling me pfft just block the trash talkers that doesnt change anything theyre still horrible at teamwork which like i said is the entire point of the game and if you block them you cant coordinate with them basically its not only a bad game for new players because you suck its also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks except for koreans whenever you see one in a game bam you already know his team has won overall i think dota nay the whole moba genre has great potential but its just too bad ive yet to see any game in the genre actually achieve to fulfill it edit 2 i just came back to this game and tried it out again the hopes that maybe it has gotten better no theres still absolutely no communication between the players except for casual pings here and there seriously there are tonnes of balancing issues in the game and the one character that stands out the most is sniper he has good abilities and does real good damage at a real fast rate if you play the game right he can easily annihilate two to three heroes by himself later on in the game frankly he is cheap and it is incredibly easy to kill steal with him valve is a company structured in a way that if youre employed there you dont really need to do these things you dont need to patch bugs from a game you dont need to fix balancing issues at valve the employees primary concern is getting recognition if you add something that looks cool youre gonna get recognition if youre going to fix something youre not because youre not showing off your creativity or imagination youre doing an important job to ensure that the product works as intended noone cares for that give me more cosmetics theres also the kill stealing now you get much more experience and gold as well as the kill credit if you actually deliver the killing blow yep just the last hit no questions asked it doesnt matter if youve reduced someone from full to 1% health and someone from your team pops out of nowhere to take the kill credit and leave you with a measly amount of gold and little experience a lot of players hate these kill thieves but you know what thats exactly what this game encourages to screw other players over couldnt say the gold and experience be divided equally between the two players based on the damage they did nope instead the players are forced to hate each other and if you are an actually fair player who doesnt want to rely on these cheap tactics youll be behind in the game what is this defense of the capitalists i mentioned that one friend spent $40 on items in dota 2 i actually played this game with him again and he has spent about well $300 on the game thats enough to buy 4 copies of gta v here in australia he was also recently hacked and had $200 worth of items stolen from him thats what you get when you blatantly overprice some items and drive the games economy into the ground refer to the previous joke on capitalism now the worst part of this game in my opinion is the long matches matches usually take anywhere between 30 to 50 minutes the longest ive seen is 70 minutes youre not going to have time to go to the toilet people with indigestion beware i bet valve is in on a conspiracy to make profit from increased adult diaper sales youre not going to have time to eat youre not going to have time to speak to people while playing the game or do little chores around the house that youre parents need you to do because youre impatient and if youre gonna get addicted to the game like a lot of people are youre not gonna have time to have a life see my russian cousin it also really sucks that when your early game sucks youre going to be stuck in a losing match where you know youve lost and all your team is doing is delaying the inevitable its not enjoying to lose and if you quit at that pointthe consequences will never be the same literally the more you abandon games doesnt matter if the game crashes on you or if you have a slow internet connection and the entire thing stopped working or if you have a really slow connection and it messes up and boots you out of the game or if you have a slow computer like my $300 friend and your entire computer crashes and you cant get back in the game the more you will be punished so on your first few abandons you will get low priority matchmaking games low priority games are pretty much like the normal priority games on steroids so more insults less teamwork more s more kill steals then as you keep abandoning games the punishment gets more severe each time the amount of low prio games you get for abandoning never goes down this game would be much better if it was made by communists

this is the best moba game ever made simply a masterpiece but has the worst community you will ever find i sometimes end up frustrated tired and in a bad mood when i cant win a single game in 6 hours of straight gameplay just because of bad players who get in your games to ruin them theyrere not just noobs they just love trolling and ing up others people fun if youre noob and wish to play dota make sure you have patience and time becoming good in this game is really hard takes years to master and youll never get to call yourself a pro if you decided to start dota do not play online practice with bots first read guides read items and abilities descriptions first you got to study before playing in a real game with humans it can be very frustrating for old players to deal with people that simple come to try out a new game into their matches and ruin them please someday you will realize what i mean with this i play dota since 2007 dota 1 and i have hit my keyboard laughed yelld to my father for no reason and confesing my frustration to people because of a bad streak in dota let my bad mood affect my scores in school and made me lose friends lost many good stuff i could have done outgame because i said one more match which became 10 more matches and ended up totally frustrated without winning one of them unable to sleep at all those nights due to this to the careless community and the fact that your entire life can be affected by dota and how it makes you feel i cant recommend this game dota is not a simple game you have to be very careful at the moment you decide to play this

reposting since under the old review system i would be forced to recommend that people play this this game is like a shower fight between you and another naked man youre both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay when you slip over and land painfully on your  the other guy completely by accident gets his soapstained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though its the other way around youre the noob who cant get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try the other guy in the tub is the  from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter antimage puck ursa or some other broken class and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end the guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who even though youre farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them insists youre killing them the wrong way and are therefore an idiot noob the naked shower fight is also a oneway road once you jump in there is virtually no returning you become enslaved and before long all youll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota you wont even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved by dota or lol the video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality people who play mobas and people who dont neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave starcraft and wow in the dust if you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is people will just yell at you because youre terrible at the game and dont consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute individual step taken throughout the game if you want to get good you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference ingame if at all if you do otherwise you will get yelled at every single time without exception to not get yelled at you have to assimilate into the formless mass this is all a part of the selfenslavement process you wont come back ever and within a month youll find yourself just parrotting the same  people were yelling at you for earlier because youll be one of them by that point and you literally will not return youll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language

dota is less of a game more of a tool of self discovery in fact thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake games are designed to be enjoyable and fun  enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota especially for those in low priority they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either every facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know theyre destined to be although it seems at first to be a team game of 5v5 this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers barracks and ancient these objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat dont worry about the other team theyre fighting amongst themselves and dont matter anyway  remember youre better than your teammates and its inconceivable that theres any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes the interface and minimap should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as   and no courier gg my team are  ff but dont worry if you cant understand its not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that dont need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful if you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding dont fret they are likely jealous of your superior skills and cant understand that they are actually the ones letting you down just remind yourself of that one game you had that went freakishly well and make fun of someones build 1010 worst game ever

the game itself is good had a lot of fun but the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry and then fail at it what results in a waste of time it usually starts already a hero selection people dont communicate only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy too bad because the game itself is good the community is for 80% flamers egotrippers wannabe carry players very rude

valve is afraid some fat kid might commit suicide for being called a noob and with this horribly broken matchmaking i see no sane reason to play this game anytime soon and because icefrog and the his devs ignorance about the eu servers turning to shit because of russians who select english on purpose because their own servers on east is unbrearable with the horrible people who mostly feed and rage in their games talking smack all the time now dont misunderstand this is a great game with huge potential but the truth of it is its rotten from the bad matchmaking and somewhat horrid and lack of brain community main reasons not to play this game goes undisputed as follows 1 russians ruining games talking russian when they clearly selected english as the preferred language in case anyone hasnt noticed dota is a team game 2 solo queue has been removedthis means that you can be matched against an enemy 5 stack when you are playing alone 3 no real community q&a support from developers and complete ignorance on the game dev forum mods deleting posts thats not deemed worthy even though there is issues surrounding the topics 4 ranked is viritually a joke in comparison to normal mm the only difference is a number for self gratification purposes it viritually means nothing when most mmrs you are still playing with complete  5 broken soloqueue at times matches you whether you are alone or 2 players playing together you will often or notdepending on your luck you will be matched with an enemy full 5 man team communicating in game while your team is just 221 or just all solo players this creates a huge disadvantage at the start of the match now valve has it ever occured to you in the small strains left of what corporate moral fiber you have that you should fix dota 2s blatant community issues is this really how you get out of your responsibilities by ignoring and deleting users expressing concern in a noninflammatory way its shameful considering how much of a profit youre making on it at least youd have the dignity to give us something back no ive personally almost quit this game two times because i cant handle the community and players i am matched with constantly they dont speak my language share my mindset or my skill level the least except an actual good match on some occations which leaves me with a horrible experience most of the time

its fun till you realize you get reported for no reason and have no way of countering the report or explainning yourself the issue is if you get reported you can not get items in the games till you play a number of matches which takes about 30 to 60 minutes to play this is a problem cause anyone can report you for the three following which is not your fault or a way to avoid them its ridiculous they dont even tell you why and you can end up either playing those matches without any rewards or forced to not to play ever again this is a major problem who the hell thought this was a good idea

dota 2 is a bad game for multiple reasons it has some nice rewarding moments during gameplay but most of the time you will find yourself screaming at your teamates pulling your hair our throwing the computer across the room and cursing russians brazilians and pracitacally any other ethnicty that does not speak english never have i played a game that has made experience such pure rage towards other players and towards myself pros team based mechanics that require cooperation punishment systems for people who grief or abandon good art lore and character design large free roster of playable characters a valve spin off of the orignial dota a warcraft iii mod cosmetics cons crappy boring tutorial and does not prepare new players terrible match making system broken  gameplay no true skillshots with the exception of meat hook hookshot and sacred arrow support heroes are generally unattractive and no one wants to buy wards or courier exessive intentional counter picking which ruins your game from the very beginning filled with people from different nationalities who do not speak english usually russains which means communication lots of griefers and trolls who threaten to feed abandon or simply say mid or feed and claim the middle lane by their divine right usually resulting in them feeding the enemy team and never ganking if they are arrogant pubs are awful and unless you queue with a friend you will most likely suffer by yourself 100% team game meaning it requires synergy and cooperations which most pub teams dont possess the game is super addictive and you wont want to shut down the game and do something else unless you are pretty much forced to you wont even want to get up to eat or  harsh cruel community ingame and out of game even towards the games devs diretide 2013 incident lucky alpine stalker set controversy etc cosmetics yes its a con aswell due to the fact that it ushers in a wave of casual players who dont really care about actually gameplay this game has some good points but the cons clearly outweigh the pros despite the hours i have clocked on this game most of my experiences have been terrible and it has negatively impacted my social life and made me a hateful person at times dont even bother with this game

how to describe this game this is the first valve game where i havent had fun at playing it and made me question their work after a year of gameplay i can easily say that if you dont play it with friends you can end up with a brain tumor or end up in a nuthouse you need to play it with friends because its the only way to enjoy the suffering the artstyle and voices are great but the gameplay can be a little tricky and it can go unbalanced very easily the only time where i found the gameplay balanced was in the greeviling because everyone was in the same level but the gameplay its not the biggest issue with this game the community its really toxic and valve itself suffered this recently they are equal or worse than the cod community the only good thing about this game is the business model the big difference between dota 2 with tf2 and csgo its that those games gives you fun and money this game only gives you money no matter if you win or you lose a match you will always end up with the same bitter taste i only recommend this game for those who lost their minds or just want to make a couple of bucks to buy another game if you are sane please make a restriction order to anyone who invite you to play it

game was good got terribly broken i quit thats the long story short want a long story long well read ahead then my dear nolifer says the one that spends time writing game reviews in steam so where should i start of course from the start a friend of mine invited me to play this super badass game with him and after days and weeks of pleads i finally bent to his will entered the game all felt fine he was a pro player and guided me through it i am also a sharp person that never does anything if hes unprepared so i read a few tons of guides from dota legends and watched plenty of tournament videos before my first game i started high above all the newbies and my lerning curve was quite fluent this means i rarely got to deal with raging idiots though rarely is not the same as never even i that played at a higher level than my matches got raged at from time to time imagine how a normal player felt brainless super confident brats keep yelling at everyone they dont like even if he is playing well that he is terrible and should uninstall the game heck the best guide ever writen for the game starts with a description on how to mute players and how to shield your psych so yeah nail number one in dotas coffin the terrible playerbase yeah there are some nice guys that survived but their numbers are rapidly dwindling and honestly even the kids at lol are nicer these days well dota could have still sprung out of its coffin if that was all but it isnt things like the terribly broken matchamking system count as well even if you rock you can hardly progress through the ranks and as gamers say leave the trench since all depends on your partners and you mostly get raging kids and gameabandonig russians no racism simply plain facts and statistics hell im a fan of putin you will never be able to roll up enough wins to play with skilled people yeah valve says its fair and it doesnt rank your winslosses but your overall performance in the game but yeah you guessed it thats pure  the heroes see the game has this goat fella named riky that is wrecking public games because of his easyto playiness and he is overpowered as hell to any unexperienced player yeah good ones can counter the  out of him with plenty of heroes so instead of getting this guy nerfed reduce his stats he is getting boosted with every update same goes for plenty of heroes which ruins the game the balancing of heroes and skills is being lost gradually over time and lately if you see a certain hero in a team on a pub game you know he will win and yeah only jerks pick such but thats almost all the players youll meet other heroes that are so fragile and weak like the poor crystal maiden which gets killed 50 times per game are getting nerfed instead and another nail goes in i can keep this up for quite a bit but i realise readers are dropping off from the review like mosquitoes near raid with every line i add so lets cut it here and shoot the word the game is duying and unless it gets a restart it will keep degrading dont bother you lose a lot of time playing it matches take ages at times no one pauses for you if your mom gets a blackout next to you well either help her or lose the game you see its not a good game to play you wont learn russian apart from swears you wont get smarter quite the opposite you wont make cash unless you sacrifice your whole life to play professionally you pour so much nerves time and effort in this game and you get nothing apart from a few and far between games where you actually match with good guys who pick normal heroes and dont spam the mic with swears well the game isnt a  as someone who is on a rage spree might claim its a decent one but its not worth it i would mark it as a 46510 yeah indeed 465 what a nice number and advice you against playing it thats all really excuse my lenghtiness and if you actually read that well go reward yourself with a treat from the fridge

alright listen up instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians im going to tell you how dota 2 really is at its core in a nutshell dota 2 is a great game but a terrible experience at the same time you want to keep going back to it but you also hate to go back why one word community dota 2s community is for the most part rude and hateful and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting moba its unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away at the best of times often its much worse and i would prefer not to go into the details sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you havent actually done anything wrong occasionally though you come across friendly players and when that happens the game is a pure joy to play however since the game is 5v5 coming across four nice players at the same time if youre solo queueing is a rarity why then have i played the game for over 2000 hours the sensation of winning your determination to keep playing despite of the discouraging community is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning that sweet moment when you see the enemy ancient blow up and look back on the match remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying but even a victory can come with a grain of salt many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning there is a mute option but that doesnt stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat people can intentionally feed the enemy team ignore their own team teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player its really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time going ranked doesnt really solve the problem either at least not completely ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill it feels much more professional and tryhardish although you meet nice players more often nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell having played some matches in ranked i can say the mode isnt hate free i had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode another problem with ranked is that like i said its more tryhard many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such but dont get me wrong dota 2 is a great game in itself the core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well no technical issues to speak of not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so of which i have had none myself graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them all the various spells and abilites look great the game is very deep and complex with tons of items skill and item builds and strategies to learn it can be a bit terrifying to beginners but once you get the hang of things its engaging all the playable heroes are well balanced although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being op and free to play from the start thats another thing the game does right all the heroes are free and playable from the start unlike dota 2s undeniably very successful competitor league of legends dota 2s microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff which means there are zero pay to win elements in the game it really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game to put it roughly in perspective its like playing skyrim but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make calling you a fooping idiot every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective failed to kill alduin uninstall skyrim noob dont know how to make dragonbone armor learn to play tard its like that having played the game as long as i have i would say that you are better off not playing dota 2 the game is fun when youre winning because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine which is 50% of the time sometimes not even when youre winning it isnt the losses that make the game unpleasant its the unfriendly people if youre one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you you have a better chance of not finding dota 2 so terrible but realistically why should you even have to videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you cant have fun half of the time the game isnt worth it people will tell you that dota 2 is great but that greatness comes with a price do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view this review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what its really like not just the great things if you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis then youre golden the game is at its best when you play with friends and dont have to worry about getting a stick in the mud player on your team great game with a bad community

of the majority of games that feature animal people i dont think any other game of our generation can shout blatant furry culture forcing more than dota 2 ranging from the down and dirty gondar lines like for the right price anything to the drunk pitiful mangix and you thought disney was bad on top of that they even added a character called troll warlord which is obviously a homestuck reference these guys are really milking the fandom department why cant a game just be about boobs like the old day i mean what ever happened to good old christian family values like monopoly and scrabble now weve gotta fill our games with fanservice and sell out to an audience that is somehow greater than ours i dont think so and theres even a character thats a flamboyant homosexual i had to bring my children to therapy after they heard the words puddin pop from one such storm spirit on the topic of inappropriate directive i cant believe a greek gorgon such as medusa would go so far as to talk about her gays this is simply not alright this game is nothing but a manifestation of what our society is becoming and we can only petition to have valve remove funding for this project to save our youth

have an urge to review this game with its latest situation we had a down time during christmas time and lately it seems that the players were more frustating than before closed beta inviteonly period also the leavers and the disconnected players are more rampant now which make this game more and more unenjoyable now noobcalling negative notteamplayers and the blame games involved yes those kind that you have to expect when playing with total strangers youll be wasting 3045 or even 60 minutes of your life thanks to them losing easily so this time around you have to prepare yourself mentally to face those kinds d good thing is that they have implemented the local lobby feature so that you can actually play locally within your lan should be a very good game worthy of having a lan party again i like the balance changes they put into the game the item changes and things that make the early games more fun but im putting this as a no for those who play only with a friend or two you better play this with a full fivepersonteam to fully enjoy this game and the time not wasted or perhaps due to its current state players similar to me might not have the reasons on how to fully enjoy this game hope valve and the team can continue to improve on this game more

i dont usually write reviews but this is a game that i played really much because i enjoy the genre and tried many games in it to compare dota 2 with basically in tems of speed dota 2 along with strife which is basically dota 2 in graphics style of lol with a petitem system which you can level up by playing is average so if you think a moba should be slower you should try league of legends and if you think it should be faster you should try heroes of newerth if you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try heroes of the storm since you dont have to learn as many item effects dota 2 in a nutshell after 2400h of playtime new players if interested in cosmetic items will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious if you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for you cant sell the items since volvo put a trademarket cooldown 2 months i think on every new item that gets released yay so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest rng is strong in this one youre better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market volvo greed simulator the old loot system in which you could acutally gain items after a game for dota 2 profile levels and a leveling chest you had in your inventory which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later was successfully reworked into greedmode the chances to get any items after a game are as low as getting a legendary or higher before sure they drop entire sets now but most of them are common to rare which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both item quantity and value maybe you should try some never change a running system in this particular function mostly developersupport abandoned game the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releasespatches are just really really rare special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% countbasednot reviewed by support employes for example if you express your annoyance towardslets say russiansfor not being able to communicate in english on eu servers you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a eu game 3 probably more are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english these days russianinfested to the max810 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam even though they have their own servers because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language thanks volvo for letting that happen maybe one day the eu servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual eu will have to play on american servers after all d editin addition to the listed issues the game servers are now absolute  1415 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasnt possible conclusion if you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing in terms of cosmetic effects andor profile progression this probably is not the right choice anymore because as stated you dont get level rewards or similar stuff anymore just really rare item drops probably in the 02% range if you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be your gamechoice 1 the community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is not your game for some serious gametime at least not in solo matchmaking i didnt check the other games these days but the community in hon was much more friendly and less russian in my personal opinion dota 2 isnt playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly without being annoyed by trolls or russians gameplaybalance 910 community 2510 rewards system 110

you see as a true christian i was raised to to believe the true saviour gaben but when i heard about this game i said this game has everything i need religion no sinners and a very casual experience i praised the lord for this mighty gift from the highest heights of heaven so like any other true christian would i decided to play and not stray away from the reightous path but when i loaded up the game the loading screens were riddled with satanic images and meanings i was outraged by this atrocity more than when my son told me he had sinned by doing some dispicable acts as matthew mcconau said in chapter 169 thou hou slay thou demonic presence shou nourish in the heighest points of heaven so after i got away from them satanic signs i started to become somewhat suspicious of this game i pressed play and began to sweat as the jesus juices excreted from my body i crossed my heart and prayed to god to forgive me for this act of satanism and waited for the match to started upon the game starting i was stunned by the amount of pagon rituals and signs that were in the game i closed my eyes and picked a random hero only to discover something truly horrifying my beer had run out my bacon stained sweat soaked vest had ripped the russians were here they were everywhere my ears started to bleed as the russian flame began i tried to continue on the righteous path but sin was inevitable i pressed enter i started to flame back my fingers were numb and then i realised i had sinned my heart stopped i could hear god reaching down to me but even he could not stop this i had become the thing i dreaded most more than a gay person a dota 2 player

a team game were over 90% of people dont want to cooperate play as a team talk plan do strats and so on game looks good at first but at the end of the day its just a horrible online experience if you have a 5 man stack with good game knowledge good coordination yeah matches can be decent but i recommend setting up inhouse matches with another 5 man stack if you dont have a 5 man stack its a pub train all day or just plain badnoobish you win 505 then you lose 457 then you win 4117 then you lose 6028 and so on its all about the lucky roll of the dice named matchmaking most players that play this game have lvl 01 accounts with only dota or other free to play games so dont think if you report them they care they just make another account to troll feed or we also alot of people play this game drunk stoned or just very tired that can be ok i guess in a 1v1 game or a 2v2 with one of their buddies but in a 5v5 team game its not nice they just ruin the experience for alot of other people most people use their own language chatting or writing teamspeak or just skype is not on their menu so most russians will speak russian most turks will speak turkish and so on there is no region lock again for a 1v1 game maybe that could work but for a game like dota having a player from australia or peru joining the euro server with 300400 ping is not cool and alot of people just check more servers for faster queue times and also check more languages so if you check eu west or us east and expect all people to have good pings and speak english think again  at least some of the dota 2 players played wc3 or dota 1 dont even get me started with the other mobas its the only genre that makes me feel ive wasted my time in most cases when i play the game bonus people either flamecurse etc or just dont know what the hell they are doing in most cases both ^_^ so i recommend using your free time  gaming time playing other games and stay away from all free to play team games  mmos they are a magnet for trolls kids or just noobs that dont care and you know why bcuz they can make 1000 accounts so if they get banned or their ranking has gone down its no problem new acc on the way its kinda sad game could have been fun but its not and thigs will never change bcuz of all the reasons ive stated above the game at its core is good but the overall online experience is bad cant recommend this for a new player a true newbie cant recommend this either for an old skool rts player these guys online dont even look at the minimap so most of the time the gamesmatches wont be good and fun even most of the wins are fun just bcuz you had fun  a good talk or we with a real life friend that you had on skype or a gaming friend that you laned with not bcuz of the dota match tbh so just go and drink beer with that mate or just play other games with himthem with this concept of f2p and team gameplay i cant see valve fixing this so i cant see a reason to recommend this sure you can get random good matches but after all my experience playing this i think you are better off without this game  genre completely peace

its worth maybe somewhere between 1000  1500 hours but once you become fairly decent at the game you realize theres not much to it its neither complicated nor possesses too much variety the most fun portion of this game is irking the other players actually it also becomes fairly monotonous as you find players who dont even know what last hitting is despite attempting to employ advanced tactics however the game ios intrinsically bad not in result of the players like i said once you get somewhere between 1000  1500 hours of playing every character it becomes boring they end up playing too much like one another i never feel a difference between playing lion lina vengeful cm etc as support sure the abilities vary but the use of those abilities dont youre still going to stun when you need to youre going to harass when you need to etc its all the same unfortunately a majority of people ive met who are actually social are the ones whom ive seen play dota frequently

a very confusing game that strives to continue where heroes of legends left off but resorts a bit too often to slavic jumpscares to create an immersive slendermanlike experience current main issues pros  a friendly and positive community  possibility to make friends and discuss delicate topics with new people from various ethnic backgrounds chat comes with emoticons and other essential stuff  strong focus for learning new languages  full of fun minigames if the main game is not compelling like the shopkeepers quiz buying stuff from the valve shop ingame advertisement clicking guessgames for dota 2 network offline times etc cons  i picked the sniper class but had trouble aiming in the first person mode needs to be fixed asap  playing the game with oculus rift resulted in nausea  low replayability after their first game everone i know has practically reached their skill cap  basic things like ingame quicksave and quickload functionality is missing  raid bosses like roshan and troll warlord are hard to understand and severely imbalanced  steam achievements were teased but are still not working i already ate my 500th tree but didnt get the achievement  the crafting system is confusing and unintuitive  want to create a drum well you need a robe and a bracer of course want to create a buckler yep you guessed it you need a chainmail shirt armor and a branch  hitboxes are off and often clipping for example i bought a bigger sword for the sven class but game doesnt register hits that clearly happen against smaller models like the phantom assassin  npcs like the mud golem and the shopkeeper only have few lazy dialogue lines i was more interested in hearing their immersive part of the story while constructing a hut in a nearby forest out of treebranches  rts system for building or repairing base components are limited to only a few heroes and could use a revamp  character wipes happen a bit too often in the servers ive been at without going into too many spoilers finishing the campaign left me with more questions than satisfying answers for example why was the evil dragon knight so eager to hurt the seemingly innocent creeps for monetary gain why did the mysterious drow ranger attack our valiant hero why does axe look like a tomato so many questions yet so few answers overall the game is ok for an early access fpsrpg hybrid but doesnt entertain the more hardcore gamers for very long for a smalltime indie developer team i guess its acceptable but id wait for more available dlc expansions before paying anything for the main game

its a good game and all but it has so many flaws first off the pros the game is getting massive content every now and so and it feels fresh the map is fantastic and simple to learn same with the heroes too and the community made content is fantastic but the cons where do i begin now i love this game and everything but the community is just what ruins it ive been into games and i have over 800 hours plus and still being called an noob and everything and blames me there is some situations that i couldnt do anything and my friend keeps trying to help and no one else trys to come to the lane and im the one getting blamed also the game seriously need either more servers or region locks because i am sick and tired of being matched with peruvians portugese russians etc and not to mention if youre in a parties more chances youre gonna find some stupid clan team that does nothing but just does stun stacks while we just wanna have fun the worse of all is the people who always spam umadbro and take insults from  but seriously its impossible to not be frustrated in a video game espacilly dota seriously its just sad that these kind of communities just ruin a game and i can no longer have fun to me the game is just not fun anymore some heroes are broken as hell heck valve tried to nerf riki but they just buffed him more instead well gg

this game creates an astonishing level of rivalry between two friends i was at the company of my friend whilst we played some jolly dota 2 when we was contacted by a wild russian then another and so forth we fealt threatened so i used all that i had in my power to fight back against the russian scourge with a twisted grin and keg of ale the dapper whale clicked report again and again on each russian within my grasp my grin was growing crooked now stretching across from cheek to cheek i began to laugh and squeal with delight at the power that was bestowed upon me imaging what i could do with this button first i will report the russians then america why stop there i might even attack china i had reported every teamate but one my friend with a wry smile and a cackle i whispered one utterance to my friend through a messenger pigeon called skype with a click and a report i felt that my work here was done and the game had lost all enterainment value for the day so i exited the game and now im in low prio for another ing week because i refused to play with russians because the language filter dosent ing work

ive played this game since it was a mod for warcraft and i have to say its one of my favorite games however much like tf2 it has its fair share of problems for starters this game has a stupidly high learning curve theres no one true way to play any of the 100 heroes and it can get very frustrating very fast trying to find what you can easily work with for any of them with the gigantic selection of items other than a small pool of heroes that im confident enough with to pick on a regular basis the largest part of the roster is alien to me with my success {or lack thereof which is normally the case} depending largely on the skill level of the enemy team and my teammates which brings us to the next point 90% of the people who play this game are stupid now i dont claim to be good at this im slightly above average at best however its hard to play on anything outside of solo bot servers when youre constantly thrown in with stupid people first timers people who dont speak the server regions language people who are only there to prance around in costumes or dont want to follow simple ordersuse common sense or any combination of the above meanwhile you can rest assured that your opponents will almost always have their act together and be an unstoppable force that you futilely try to at least hinder which is made even harder when your teammates insist on throwing themselves into unwinnable battles further feeding them until the point where theres a 10 level gap between you and the lowest leveled enemy on the other hand you might go up against a team thats super bad as in its a game that lasts less than 20 minutes in which case youve learned nothing and your time is wasted just as thoroughly as it would be against people out of your league or on the occasion that you get teammates that know what theyre doing you can expect them to whine about your choice of hero your starting itemsabilities your lane choice or god forbid your costume at which point 910 of these people will purposefully feed the enemy or go afk and then either rage quit or stop when youve ceased your apparently unforgivable behavior or they might report you to try and get you thrown into low priority which is dotas equivalent of hell and unlike tf2 you cant just drop out whenever you wish without taking a heavy penalty for doing so so have fun being in matches where there will be almost no fun a majority of the time now there is a report system which in theory is supposed to shoo away the vermin that dont need to be playing this in the first place in practice its horribly broken due to being automated doing amazingly good but youre the odd man out in a peruvian 4 stack that youve somehow managed to offend expect to have the low priority message pop up when you exit to the menu after the match or maybe you want to report that 025 treant that refused to do his job and started purposely dying to feed the enemy the entire server could report him but he could still easily slip through without getting lp in all seriousness its down to luck if it does work when you want it to and doesnt when its being abused up next hero balance thankfully this isnt quite as bad as it could be but there is still silliness here and there some heroes have one or two overpowered abilities while others are all around unbalanced and others still are in sore need of buffing at the same time some heroes are nicely balanced but are easily outclassed by other heroes who can perform the same role only much better and easier why pick legion commander and eventually out damage the enemy team using skill when you can pick ursa and out damage them from level 3 onwards and rarely have to press more than one button why pick weaver and alternate between your 2 escapes when you can pick storm spirit and have an escape with no cooldown why pick centaur warrunner to be durable when you can pick axe and not only be durable but be so durable the lane gets locked down for your enemy theres tons of examples like this also youll see some heroes almost every match {pudge sniper zeus who all have skills that can be more or less mindlessly spammedhave low risk high reward play styles} but lots are seen either rarely or rarely outside of comp play {io meepo dark seer who all take some degree of skillhave high risk decent reward play styles} what it sadly boils down to is why play a hero where you have more than 1 button to press and risk being overwhelmed but have a more rewarding experience when you can pick a hero that more or less does the same thing but with less complexity as with tf2 valve is slowly but surely turning this into another hat simulator i played a ton of the original dota and i sure dont remember any customization because that would have been silly this game is hard enough without being distracted by someones super pimped out loadout or worrying if youre going to get a nice drop {if any only 23 people usually get drops at the end of the round} the main problem with character customization though is that much like tf2 it attracts half wits that only want to play the super easy classes and dress them up then look down on everyone else who isnt wearing a 20c wolf hat yeah take your little wolf hat into a ranked match see how they like it also like tf2 valve focuses more on cosmetic items than the game itself which started off small but in recent months has led to them 1 canceling popular game modes in order to {in their own words} focus more on cosmetic sets 2 building entire game modes around expensive sets {although in fairness said sets only enhanced the modestracked stats for them but still} or just flat out making new modes pay to win {the year beast brawl was p2w to the point that disgusting amounts of money and cheap tactics trumped genuine skill almost 100% of the time} 3 doing inane things like changing the perfectly fine models of heroes and then using that as an excuse to make more money {shadow fiends model was just fine but then he got a redesign that looked like an angsty 12 year old made it and a $35 cosmetic that looked like an even more angsty 10 year old designed it} 4 possibly the worst outright ignoring critical server issues to focus on cosmetic item bugs overall the game would be greatly improved if valve would do the following things 1 mandatory region locking for everyone to heavily cut down on the language barrier 2 a proper {and required} tutorial for new players 3 rather than adding new cosmetics every week finally adding the remaining heroes from the mod as well as much needed balancing for all the heroes as fun as this game is i reccomend it to no one other than someone willing to go through absolute misery to occasionally have fun

dota 2 is a very intensive video game that is just as good as league of legends although it is somewhat lacking in its misogynistic protrayal of women where all the female heroes are highly sexualized and often oppressed by the patriarchal standards of the game there is only one strong female character both metaphorically and literally named legion commander and even she is highly sexualized and often the target of pornographic parodies although they are perfectly equal in the terms of gameplay valve has quite a ways to go before they reach the same plethora of wellcharacterized and nonsexualized female characters as riot games managed to do in league of legends therefore although the game is reasonably fun i cannot honestly recommend it to any mature gamers out there

this game is complete  here are a few reasons why 1 there is no creativity when it comes to them naming the champions heroes for those of you who are butthurt 2 the camera does not auto lock so you gotta keep moving the mouse to see where your character is going 3 half the map is all sunny but the other half is really dark and edgy that i get cuts while traversing through it and 4 the items are  the casting is terrible no summoner spells and no b to recall tldr if youre not a wow  stay away from this game

the game where all s gather if you thought annoying cod kids were too much then you havent experienced dota2 yet its full of obnoxious rude people who have absolutely no idea what a coop  team game is about and constantly whine about stolen kills like if this was some fps the following list contains the type of people you will meet in dota 1 12 year olds thinking they know everything and play dota for life while skipping school 2 people who cant speak english at all despite playing with the english language filter 3 reporters who do nothing but  about everyone else and report them for everything 4 multiple account pros who constantly swear about how their team sucks 5 idiots who tell you to attack 1v5  close range against long  ask you to help and then run away 6 quitters 7 mr afk who gives up at the start of the game and just hangs around spawn 8 new players who get talked down for not completely understanding the game after 2 seconds 9 extremely rare but nice and helpful people worst community ever

most games reward the player to some degree when they have sunk hundreds of hours into them dota 2 is the only time sink i have experienced where you get absolutely nowhere for your troubles thanks to a heavily broken matchmaking system that can take forever to queue up a game as i am writing this a 5 stack for a ranked match can take up to 20 minutes dota 2 is less about how skilled you are and more about who you know if you dont have at least a dozen experienced friends who are consistently competent prepare to queue with some of the worst players you have ever played a multiplayer game with as an added bonus you will often get players who do not speak your language  even in ranked games i have often wished that i never started playing this game

dota 2 prefectly inherited the play style and cs feeling of dota the game flows pretty well with the new visual upgrade and getting rid of the old warcraft3 system its entirely a nice try however it is an embarrassing situation dota 2 and its valve behind it are facing first the same old problem of dotaits just too hard for new players to play even a seasoned player of warcraft3 find it pretty hard and need months of practicing to become an ordinary player not to mention those young players who never touched warcraft3 before second for old dota players the old and familiar sound of each hero vanquishes instead are newly created heroes that lack the lore backup them from warcraft i dont know how other old gamers feel about it to me its a completely different game lost the contest by his young and more energetic grandsonleague of legends sorry to say but the golden age of dota has faded dota 2 is merely a replacement of the greater past when we play it what haunts in our head are the night beckonsus here to obeyim here as always nonot really you are not always here farewell

i only recommend this game based on the fact that this is the most generous free2play title youre ever going to find the amount of content and support here is insane theres a reason why seemingly millions of people play this game for years on end chances are youll like it if youre looking for a free game but if youre looking for a free game chances are youre young unemployed with tons of time to kill which is what most of the fanbase here is it also happens to be the only kind of person who can learn this game properly youll need months and hundreds of hours before youre any good i want to say that besides all that its a great game but i cant ive dabbled in dota when it was just starting to get attention it was the only reason i installed warcraft 3 a second time my overall distaste for rts games is actually not a factor here as dota has very little in common with the game it was built on top of no my problem with the game is almost every core mechanic it expects you to learn is not fun at all to implement into your sessions i disagree completely with the tasks at hand that are in every moba out there i dont like the pointless constant neverending flow of creeps i dont like how everything is a race to earn exp at the fastest rate instead of using actual tactics and if you die or leave the proximity of a fight for 60 seconds youll never catch up to the enemy leveling so you better just give up the item shops are super convoluted and have nonsensical upgrade paths i dont like the essential systems of last hits and denying as they make no god damned sense killing your own infantry so that the enemy doesnt get the exp is ludicrous its the dumbest videogame logic i have ever witnessed and i cant get behind it if all this stupid crap were removed i feel like we would be left with a fun game but perhaps that game has already been done elsewhere like the pvp arena battles in guild wars i just feel like if this were simplified down to heroes battling each other directly with their core abilities id have a good time its so beautiful so well crafted so much innovation in the networking features presentation is tops epic as all hell everything you could want its a shame that all this is pasted onto a core game that is incredibly busted and dumb

do not play this game unless you have already been playing it for 2 years or more as a new player you will get matched against players with 2000 games or more experience and you will get matched with players who have 100 games or less even after years of playing and no matter how good or bad you are you will still lose about 50% of the time unless you have 4 more friends who play with you every game this game is just as bad as lol and hon in every aspect people will rage quit go afk feed on purpose give up after first blood the game is so well balanced most games will have 1 team with less than 50% of the other teams score not just in kills but in experience and gold earned also if you are thinking of switching to dota 2 from lol or hon do not waste your time it is the same game with the same issues and you will be 2 years behind the learning curve if you have never played a moba before do not waste your time more experienced dota 2 players will just treat you like garbage for your first 300500 games and make you want to not play

alright listen up instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians im going to tell you how dota 2 really is at its core in a nutshell dota 2 is a great game but a terrible experience at the same time you want to keep going back to it but you also hate to go back why one word community dota 2s community is for the most part rude and hateful and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting moba its unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away at the best of times often its much worse and i would prefer not to go into the details sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you havent actually done anything wrong occasionally though you come across friendly players and when that happens the game is a pure joy to play however since the game is 5v5 coming across four nice players at the same time if youre solo queueing is a rarity why then have i played the game for over 1300 hours the sensation of winning your determination to keep playing despite of the discouraging community is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning that sweet moment when you see the enemy ancient blow up and look back on the match remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying but even a victory can come with a grain of salt many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning there is a mute option but that doesnt stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat people can intentionally feed the enemy team ignore their own team teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player its really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time going ranked doesnt really solve the problem either at least not completely ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill it feels much more professional and tryhardish although you meet nice players more often nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell having played some matches in ranked i can say the mode isnt hate free i had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode another problem with ranked is that like i said its more tryhard many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such but dont get me wrong dota 2 is a great game in itself the core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well no technical issues to speak of not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so of which i have had none myself graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them all the various spells and abilites look great the game is very deep and complex with tons of items skill and item builds and strategies to learn it can be a bit terrifying to beginners but once you get the hang of things its engaging all the playable heroes are well balanced although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being op and free to play from the start thats another thing the game does right all the heroes are free and playable from the start unlike dota 2s undeniably very successful competitor league of legends dota 2s microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff which means there are zero pay to win elements in the game it really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game to put it roughly in perspective its like playing skyrim but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make calling you a fooping idiot every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective failed to kill alduin uninstall skyrim noob dont know how to make dragonbone armor learn to play tard its like that having played the game as long as i have i would say that you are better off not playing dota 2 the game is fun when youre winning because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine which is 50% of the time sometimes not even when youre winning it isnt the losses that make the game unpleasant its the unfriendly people if youre one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you you have a better chance of not finding dota 2 so terrible but realistically why should you even have to videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you cant have fun half of the time the game isnt worth it people will tell you that dota 2 is great but that greatness comes with a price do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view this review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what its really like not just the great things if you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis then youre golden the game is at its best when you play with friends and dont have to worry about getting a stick in the mud player on your team great game with a bad community

i hate dota 2 i hate it with a passion > it is not that the game itself is bad  really it is rather fun albeit somewhat repetitive given the lack of change in the battlemap  same map every time same hidespots same store locations etc  though during events sometimes some minor artistic features will be changed in any case a simple game as far as setting variety or lack thereof goes but a neat idea lots of variation with the heroes though some are considerably more powerful than others  not the best job balancing them in my opinion the problem with dota 2 is really the community which is lolstyle atrocious in all the times i played dota 2 i met a grand total of 2 friendly people both in bot matches i met a massive number of people who were just downright nasty pushy demanding immature not in the fun way unnecessarily combative just unpleasant to work with  not that there ever seemed to be much teamwork in this team game i suspect the atrocious community is why steam added the reporting system but really that just made things worse the system is frequently abused leading to players constantly reporting each other for made up things just because or out of bitterness at losing or because you dont switch upon their demand to speaking spanishrussian in the englishlanguagefiltered server etc this overreporting wouldnt be an issue if steam actually followed up to see if the reports had any merit and maybe removed the reporting option from players who constantly sling false accusations  but from what ive seen there appears to be no such oversight hardly surprising  there really is no incentive for valve to follow up getting reported kicks you into low priority matches which basically means that you have to go up against humans other players in this awful community who have also been reported and kicked into low priority there is a certain number of matches you must play in low priority before you are free to once more play the matches you want also locks you out of bot matches there doesnt seem to be any appeals process for this oh you can also get shuttled into low priority for spending too long without getting experience so if you are playing techies one of the heroes and want to go out and spend a few minutes planting mines the game may just decide that you have abandoned and kick you into low priority anyway i think ive wasted about enough of my time warning you off its a free game last i checked so i imagine youll download and play it anyway be my guest maybe these things wont bother you

felt like giving dota 2 a try and like most other moba games its very addicting i played a fair amount of the game as well as going through training the heros were interesting and had a lot of diversity selecting the lane you preferring in hero select was a nice feature thats the end of the good things i have to say about the game now for the bad still full of bugs no good information on how to cancel auto buy resulting in odd issues with ui which you cant tell if its a bug that prevents you from buying things and putting a large item icon on your screen an insane amount of leavers during games then when you attempt to disconnect when its safe taking minutes for it to give you the disconnect screen region ques seem to be a joke always selected just the two north american ques and one in three matches getting multiple people who do not speak english pretty rediculus when this is supposed to be a game where you need to communicate with your team this is also in addition to the very long que times more time spent in que today then actually playing the game this ultimately made me quit playing in digust summary some great heros with unique abilities ui has great features when they work correctly drop system that keeps you wanting to play worst community i have ever had the displeasure of playing with que times far too long picking a region to play in doesnt seem to matter though its out of beta still a large amount of bugs training system needs some work

i can not stress how bad this game is no words can describe this crap that was put together by someones five year old kid and said hell my kid smurt haha lul and then valve secretly buys this game and improves on it tell me how in the world do you improve feces well you dont and valve will never know that because they released games like csgo which is just a reskinned version of css also they added hat simulator aspects to get people addicted and shoving this  down your friends throats will dota 2 ever have a downfall you say well frankly it has russians are allowed everywhere and brazilians and africans and spacemen but why stop there why not add a reskin of a reskin oh wait they have and do they even have different voiceovers i cant stress how stupid the community is everyone who has 3 hours is already trying to find a simmilar if not better game that looks like dota for example league of legends which is a good game if not great game shunned by the dota 2 community as evil hell i have seen dota 2 fans hate starcraft 2 because it was a rts game it makes no god damn sense i actually did like one thing about dota 2 and that was uninstalling it i had so much fun you guys should try it too but really this game is running on so much swag and yolo it will be more hated than the actually it is one of the most hated game aready if you remove halo and cod out of the way at least trace ps this game is bad and you all should feel very bad

yes dota 2 is a true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming yes dota 2 is one of the best mmo  mmorpg game and it is true that it is one of the games that have awesome heroes with their awesome abilities and lores it is all true what they say defense of the ancients may be the best game in existent i can actually say that dota 2 was one of the most addictive awesomest and best experience in my gaming life but it may be also one of the worst guess what there are over 108  112 heroes and over 20 difficult heroes 40 relied heroes 40 carries in which you will be expected to be excellent in fact when you first enter the game you are already expected to be excellent and skilled in that game even now i am playing this game and may be planning to quit it but it is not the game i blame it into nope i have been through hundreds of heavy or light games from super mario to pacman to minecraft to zelda to call of duty left 4 dead and every possible heavy game you might even know yes i have been through dying games like crossfire mercenaries twelve sky dead game and world of tanks and i recommend for you not to play this game why its community is one of the worst im not talking only about the russians which most people are probably too concerned about im talking about everybody in generalized everyone repeat everyone will bring you down once you cling to this game this game may have lots of good recommendations but i beg to differ those people are the ones who will also tear you apart from this game trash talking coarse words harsh statements bullying its just like school only 100x worse and they tell you not to play the game if you cant take it its like saying dont bother living life if you cant take the hurtful words not to mention the imaginary boundaries between choosing heroes people tend to choose the less skilled ones even though they wanted to practice hard ones because they might bring the team down its that feeling when you want to use an invoker a very hard hero to use where people expect you to be good at him when you use it but you say nevermind just to avoid being blamed for loss people tend to treat this game as their life and may change their characters just because of certain problems with their peers this is one of the most ungodly and evil games yes i am a filipino and i am not proud of my trash talking inhibitants and neighbors in fact i am ashamed of it there will probably even more of them who will comment on this review adding more insults to me yes they might say i am weak or noob just because i cant play the game the way i want it to doesnt mean i have to give a bad recommendation no i have the right to speak my fellow brothers let us enjoy the game like we enjoyed minecraft and super mario let us embrace loss welcome our fellow newbies teach them our ways if they fail to do so give way to them let us respect our professionals embrace this game as one love our enemies as mentioned in the bible love our teammates forget trashtalking it doesnt bring you any good i just hope that this message will be viewed to all to remind them of what true gaming is like god bless happy gaming

the core mechanics of this game are fantastic and the diversity of gameplay is a strong selling point however it is a multiplayer game and the matchmaking is one of the worst i have ever come across it does not matter how long youve played or what level you are level is a good indicator of timeexperience you will be matched with complete noobs and elite players alike this is an attempt to balance the teams but all it does is create a scenario in which 95% or more no exaggeration of the games played are one sided stomps theres already been numerous complains about region locking i will not expand upon anything said by others it is a team game that requires communication and yes its difficult when a team mate does not speak the same language as you regardless of that language is not the main problem the main problem with dota 2 matchmaking is the enforced 50% winrate valve fanboys and other people will claim it does not exist but anybody who has played the game long enough knows otherwise it works by judging your skill level in one game and placing you with appropriate players in the next game if you do very well you may be matched with 4 very inexperienced players if you do poorly you may be matched with 4 very experienced players this wouldnt be a problem if dota 2 was not such a complicated game new players will be absolutely destroyed due to their lack of knowledge at the time of writing this i am level 50 in the game this has taken me over 1000 hours to achieve to put my next point in perspective as i said most games are onesided stomps and to prove this i usually check out the levels of every player before or after the game in games that i win my team usually consists of players lvl 50300 in games that i lose my team usually consists of players lvl 150 yes ive actually had a few games with lvl 1 players while i was lvl 30 when the total level of players on one team is hundreds higher than the other something is clearly wrong with the matchmaking system when one team has a few thousand more total hours played than the other something is clearly wrong with the matchmaking system playing well in one game will almost certainly cause you to lose the next game unless you are on what i like to call a valve permitted streak wherein the matchmaking decides to pair you with good players or awful players for a number of games in a row yes valve actually punishes players for doing too well and rewards players for losing too much a typical week of dota2 matches might look something like this wwwwwlwlwlwllllll repeating there can be longer or shorter streaks this is just an example this is not to alleviate myself or any player of fault everybody makes mistakes and we are not all professional players however when the teams are grossly imbalanced as explained above the fate of the match is decided before it even begins the reason i keep playing is those 5% of games where both teams are equally matched and the game is actually funchallenging winning a game in under 20min because the other team are mostly noobs not fun same goes for losing when its your turn on the noob team if valve ever fixed the matchmaking this game would be amazing both mechanically and socially that will probably never happen because dota2 has a lot of players and matchmaking isnt easy to begin with but please anything would be better than the 50% enforced winrate that is ruining my and many others desire to play this game if i know im going to losewin every game for the next 3 days why bother playing at all ps the community is notoriously toxic i would recommend avoiding if you have thin skin or get frustrated easily

oh man dota 2 dont get me wrong here at the negative review hear me out first i say with confidence that dota 2 is an addicting moba game with great gameplay and fun then why the negative review you say well for one the community is scarcely better than russia under stalin if you play on any server you must be 100% prepared for racism s jerks and 12 year olds not only that but even if you put your language preference as english half the players you play with are obnoxious peruvians this does not make the game unplayable but can seriously  you off if you have played this game as long or longer than me you will understand this another bad thing is that i would willingly compare playing this game to a adrug addiction you literally cant stop playing it when you start and when life interrupts you you will start to think dota 2 is more important that my friends is when you quit the game i had to wean myself off of it for like weeks until i couldnt stand looking at the icon anymore needless to say i uninstalled my advice for new playes get a friend to play it with you and dont become addicted that is all

ive been playing dota since dota 1 came up a decade ago in dota 2 the game mechanic is quite balanced every hero has its own strengths and weaknesses just like in the previous one definitely not a p2w kind of game however the solo mmr pairing is really awful i dropped from 3k to 2k in just a week and forever stuck in this level no matter how hard i play heres a few suggestions that i could think of they should also consider hours of playing and kda ratio instead of just mmr level to balance the pairing players who got into low priority should get more severe punishment eg longer period and add extra requirements to get away from low priority so they would think twice before they trashtalk and not obidient at this rate a skill in par with ti players is the only way to break out unfortunately you need to play a lot to get there if youre really lucky you could be paired with decent players and thats a one big if a casual gamer like me has no place in this game

edit 1 of course you would nerf wisps stun to slow yes because io is the hero who is totally op in every single game you play its not huskar its not pa its not sniper who need to be nerfed if that should be necessary at all never would such idiocy even slightly tickle my ans now that io finally recieved a more or less reasonable skillset dota 2 is the most balanced game in the whole universe edit 2 hey icefrog i came up with a totally cool idea but first let me lay down to problem for you you know all these poor people who only want to pick and play their totally imbalanced heroes they actually have to go through loads of serious trouble believe me until they can finally become overpowered beyond reason   that sucks so why on earth not provide them with a bit of a starting bonus right look at poor old huskar for example a possible maximum of 98% magic resistance so if i may ask you dear developers how to make up for those missing 2% heres where my idea comes into play why not just give huskar a set of six hearts before start so he can casually drain away half of his enemies health with one single burning spear at lv1 but this time without having to worry about maybe loosing an eighth of his own etc 010 worse than league of legends disclaimer review suitable for pub scrubs only not suitable for players of mmr >1000

poorly balanced lots of rng like runes and skills with chances to do certain things heros that are clearly op and yet somehow the developers icefrog and co thinks are balanced then you have the childish community who i dont have enough reports in the world for much more frustrating and emotionally taxing then any other game ive played its really not worth it just go play something else not to mention the new ranked matchmaking which is just a glorified pub with numbers attached to it its no different and you will get russians and  teammates as usual the game is  plain and simple

dota 2 has a horrible community that makes the game far less enjoyable than it could be new players are turned away because of this and older players have a worse time leading to further negativity towards other players the graphics arent the worst but they arent that good for a game that thrives on detailed teamplay and champion strategies it stunts the potential the only reason this game could be considered as more difficult than other games in this genre would be the graphics and lingering hero gameplay the graphics make it difficult to see what exactly is going on and doesnt get much easier as you progress pretty much every hero has at least one ability that will rootstunslow ect for around 4 seconds when a game has that kind of kill security it doesnt matter if the champions are balanced ive played many other game in this genre and they were all much more enjoyable than dota 2 when i first played a game or two it was extremely easy compared to league of legends or other similar games it may be more difficult to see whats going on but the spells are so overpowered on all the heroes that it was easy coming from game that have underpowered spells the worst thing about dota 2 would be the item system that has been implemented its just ridiculous how its not user friendly at all this game has such a bad ingame and community experience that players uninstall it after playing 13 matchesat me after 1000 matchesit was just sadim ing done with this game 610 edit ok ok i cant stop play it xd

defense of the ancients 2  known more colloquially as dota 2  is a masterpiece of modern video game design harkening back to the ageold starcraft 1 custom map aeon of strife dota 2 nearly perfects the elements introduce in that original mod the mechanics and gameplay are ageless simple in their implementation and flawless in their execution everything about dota 2 is a triumph of engineering  the individual heroes have fantastic character designs both thematically and mechanically and the game is perfectly balanced around its seemingly lack of scaling and at times stagnant nature it is a game where levels and planning take precedent over gold advantage and items and teamwork is a union  a celebration even  of independent player skill this variety of complex mechanics themes and interactions that coalesce into a truly unique experience i recall the time i forgot to ward bot rune and when mid lost illusion to a pudge from top lane i was only blamed four times as opposed to dozens in other similar competing games this unparalelled level of community benevolence and powerful inclination towards skillful play make dota 2 the best game on the market if not all of human history four hundred years from now when the paragon hyperscholars are uploading digiedu to the modbrains of the neo bourgeoisie dota 2 will forever be imbedded in the siliconcortex as the zenith of prehuman ingenuity 010 it sucks

terrible game the tutorial was so boring that i didnt even bother finishing it though i wasnt too excited at what await me after the tutorial either as ive heard this is one of the most unforgiving and antinoob communities out there i dont understand how that yields people 1000s of hours

had a friend who played this game a lot got along with him well for a few years i played this for a few hours and its a total trollfest nervewracking how terrible the community is in this game it is not worth the price of free one mistake early and you lose the whole game but it takes about an hour for that loss to happen so during that time you are forced to play a losing game or get penalties for quitting anyhow my friend played this nonstop for a few years turned him into a totally rude nutbar to the point that i unfriended the prick i think the community of this game rotted him out luckily i never met him in real life that would be sad to see a real life friend get degraded into an animal before you this game is toxic i played enough online games to see this right away stay away this is a moneymaking machine for valve with psychological sideeffects not worth the free pricetag on the game

after 6 years of dota here are my thoughts on dota 2 mmr is broken as  skill gap between players is as big as valves profits made from tf2 hats matchmaking is horrible even in rankeds got matched up with someone with 100 hours fed 317 as riki at least two russians guaranteed on your team on euw eu pubs are even worse dont get me started on them uninstalled also 682 ew ew ew ewwww

this is about how long it took to get through the horrible unskippable tutorial and random crashes ive heard league of legends is pretty much a good version of this game although you might wanna avoid this euwthing since it seems to be hated more than the black plague and hitler together

when i hear the phrase dota 2 is good just look at how many people play it i cant help but make myself blue from facepalming so hard call of duty has millions of players the thing is theyre all 12 year olds with tourrettes and particularly ignorant mothers the gaming society is so fanatic about numbers that they forget that criticism and praise are reflections of an individuals formed beliefs that being said dota 2 is a terrible game and thats not an opinion its the truth valves fear of the number 3 has thrown them afar by pushing number 2s yes i did just say that laugh it up of all their other series portal 2 left 4 dead 2 and half life 2 as well as half life 2 episode 2 but now they are doing it to games they dont originally own repetition is useful in debates and extremely rarely in games a lesson valve is eagerly forgetting to the point where dota 2 doesnt even have multiple maps to change things up i see its up to the players to pose new situations how inadvertently lethargic i cannot comprehend how players can have over 3000 hours doing the same thing let alone 5 to put this in todays terms dota 2 is so stupid your mum asked me what i was doing and when i replied im playing defense of the ancients she freaked out believing that i was attempting to prevent her murder i weep for future generations that when asked to list 10 goods things about the 21st century can only find numerous references to swag justin bieber and the mindset that a large amount of players in a game means everyone in the whole world should enjoy it and before you ask yes i did just put a your mum is so old joke in an analysis thanks for noticing

normally i would reccomend this game as i have played it for a long time however it is now simply unplayable screen constantly freezes and crashes even when using a high end pc and updated drivers i have researched how to fix this problem and i have literally tried everything and nothing helps a lot of people experience this problem online and the valve tech support is nonexistent and useless for more than a year i tried to give this game a chance as i used to love playing it but with lack of consideration towards a great number players including myself i feel it is a waste of money and time until it is fixed here is a link to my thread and another related to this issue on the developer page please valve pay attention to your players and actually fix your product httpdevdota2comshowthreadphpt144013 httpdevdota2comshowthreadphpt141150

i think people who gush over this game do so because its not league of legends this often strikes me as being the same as the person who plays say the secret world and bashes those that play world of warcraft where world of warcraft is accessible easy and enjoyable for the masses secret world is deep complex and very rewarding to those who really enjoy the minutae of figuring out how to get the most out of an mmo dota 2 is the game you play when you dont want to the handholding comfortable ease that league of legends has brought to the moba world i found dota 2 to be overly awkward and not particularly rewarding but for those in the mood for the more hardcore experience this is where to be i just wont be there with you
not recommended
just another  moba to be honest games so boring and dull i spent over half my hours afk or alt tabbed or when the computer is on i wouldnt bother with it
not recommended
