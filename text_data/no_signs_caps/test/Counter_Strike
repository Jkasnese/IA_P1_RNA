basically this game was released back in the year 2000 and still is one of the most played games on steam so clearly it must be good because so many are still playing it i definitely recommend this game and if you dont like to shoot terrorist or counter terrorists you can always try different game modes like zombie modes 1010

honestly it does nothing to explain to the player the concept of accuracy and it ruins the experience how with just a crosshair am i expected to understand the difference between it being a little wider and a little narrower its a fun shooter dont get me wrong but the whole crosshair  is bad and should have been reworked instead of kept in every cs game

when u buy it u are happy when u have play counter strike in a 1h u will  kill u self

very good game aprt from the cheap  servers running 64 tick and need upgrading with the amount of money people spend on the game
