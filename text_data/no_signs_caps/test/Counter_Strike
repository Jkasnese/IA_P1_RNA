basically this game was released back in the year 2000 and still is one of the most played games on steam so clearly it must be good because so many are still playing it i definitely recommend this game and if you dont like to shoot terrorist or counter terrorists you can always try different game modes like zombie modes 1010

one of the best games in the history it made a big difference in the game industry when it was released just like half life did it is shame that it is being left behind for games that were released after it but it did survive for a long while for an old school game even longer then the new gen games i hope the player base of it will be back to the way it was the past or even abit of it
recommended
its simple terrorist x cts few minutes to complete objectives the more you play the better you get i used to be professional but now i suck at this and i dont think i can play as i used to but it still worth playing this game counter strike is about competition ill always like to shoot at my friends faces counterstrike is the best gamemodgame ever valve wins

recommended
counterstrike 16 is one of my best games ive ever played even if i played alot of games the graphics doesnt matter but the gameplay is the important 
recommended
recommended here is the proscons of this game in my humble opinion pros  nostalgic  buy menu shortcuts  you can buy bullets as much as you like  some unique server mods like warcraft  some unique original maps which dont included later versions of cs even they are not so great  active community cons  literally ed up server list probably server owners do that fake pingfake player counts etc  except buy menu shortcuts buy menu isnt so useful especially if you hit esc to close the menu it doesnt works  weird hitpoints and lucky headshots  724 de_dust2 de_inferno playing community
recommended
standard run and gun game that says it tries to stop cheaters and hackers out of the game instead all it does is ban people who are having internet trouble trying to blame them for lag switching it does not hitting those who you can obviously watch and see they are using aim bots by spectating after death and always aiming at people through walls at their heads ready to shoot the moment they turn corners
recommended
its a good game d

amazing game  totaly adictive and loads of fun  have been playing from quite long now never did i get bored of playing counter strike 16 
recommended
so i just played the original counter strike cs16 for about an hour and after over 100 hours of both css and csgo this game is amazing but so different i love this game and its game series it taught me tactical gameplay and how much communication is key but this game lacks a bit of that but not much i absolutely love this and highly recommend it
recommended
played this game for the first time in 2008 since then i have clocked more than 5000 hours thats how addictive its multiplayer is father of all fps in mp plus has several mods deathmatch hns kz gungame scrim zombiemod and paintball its been 14 years and the game is still going strong atleast in the indian scene

1999 is when this came out but when i was born gladly though i grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece there was no other game that i played once i purchased this with some bday cash on steam first time playing i got mutilated like the noob i was but when i started playing more often i became better and everyone else can too this isnt like the cods or battlefields that i have played here and there today no its much more different counterstrike is a tactical fps which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action you dont unlock weapons you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies completeing objectives or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing think of the game as cops & robbers robbers blow things up and the cops dont them too on the extra note this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there there too much to do or put in here but i can slam a bit down zombies survivalescape soccer or football for the europeans surf bhopkz climbing zone pokemod gungame those new may have heard such from call of dutys spinoff and more etc so now that ive explained the game i guess i can lay down some pros yet cons to playing counterstrike 16 pros fununlimited gameplay possibilities booming community that has been alive for 15 years plethora of servers to choose from competetive and casual at the same time fun to play with a group of friends more skill based than many other games out there cheap price cons graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting not an easy game to jump right into as it takes lots of time to become better may seem repetitive after a while i came into cs late but im glad this was the first one i owned

the classic if you havent played it yet give it a go oh the pun and dont let the lack of shineygrafix disappoint you i have both the later source and currently latest go versions but still come back to the original version from time to time because it is still fun and its classic style is still completely fine and a lot of people who still play cs regularly shares my view
recommended
this game is a classic master piece and has amazing replay value as a young gamer my self growing up in a world where most casual gamers are xbox humping cod playing graphic s it is shameful that this game is not played this game made and broke friendships and made a childhood for many people even if you dont play the game often please just get it for it to be in your library 810 for some bugs and a now strange community but nonetheless a great game
recommended
playing the scrim mode in counter strike is just awesome 55

counterstrike is the best firstperson online shooting game because it depends only in your own skills there are no advantages like in call of duty series you will need to aim correctly know the recoil of your gun and shoot your enemies to death

recommended
this game is not a multiplayer game is the multiplayer game this game is classic is a monster counterstrike i love those words this is my 2 favorite game of all time to be good in this game you must be a strategist to have a good team relationship and takes dedication this game has tons of weapons to choose the game modes are perfect the other community gamemodes are even better you like cod with zombies well this game haved zombies before cod and better zombies in what game are you gonna do a deathrun where you must be alert to everything and to have skills to survive and kill a terrorist in what game are you gonna kill zombies while they run at full speed and all your teammates throw granades and shoot as if there was no tommorow in what game are you gonna surf on wall in what game are you gonna find this quantity of maps and good maps in what game battlefield and cod can have better graphics destruction campaing and more guns but they will never have the community that counterstrike have we made counterstrike counterstrike made us english is not my first language
recommended
heres my story i went over to my friends house one day he was playing cs i tried it for myself i was instantly hooked and have been for over 10 years with the counter strike franchise best online action franchise ever for the pc in my opinion counter strike is like a drug that you will never be cured from trust me
recommended
a great game

im not one to criticise a game but this has to be a great title mostly for its your role affects your teams success your teams success affects your role system even if it had many problems the gameplay is great with plenty of user created content to play vanilla gameplay is not advised as it gets repetitive fast overall gameplay is a 85 out of ten the sound isnt very good with its annoying tracks the only way to fix this is to download custom gun sounds but thats a pain the sound wasnt even good in 2000 when the game came out and thats telling you something overall 40 out of a possible ten i know this is odd for me to review a game off of this but online community the community if few and far between there are barely any good servers up and sometimes the community is awful still not as bad as team fortress 2 imo xd overall 60 out of ten graphics usually take the backseat in my reviews but i do have to say the graphics are ok i mean in 2000 they still werent as good as unreal 1 or idtech 3 but they get the job done overall 65 out of ten my verdict is that this game is good and still is i have to say this is a damn fine game earning my score as an 80% out of 100% btw this is all criticism because i am a critic i go into detail about every problem a game has therefore i recommend monstercat signing out

counterstrike is a pretty old game of shooter which was developed in 1999 and since 2000 supported by valve this game immediately caught on millions of players around the world the game is a confrontation of terrorists and counterterrorists representing the forces of good and evil objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map in which the battle and here is my thoughs this is the most entertaining video game ive ever played since 2007 i think ive played this game like 2000hrs i guess played only the cracked version in that day i finally i bought this game and its worth 10 bucks indeed i still play cs 16 because i had an amazing childhood with it by that i didnt mean online or with bots but i had lots of lanpartys in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still lanpartys sometimes in my country ^^ the game is still fun and it never gets boring i mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is zmzecsdmgungamefuriensurfdeathrunbasebuilder and more and more and more its just fantastic d 1010 would recommand it
recommended
although im keeping this a thumbs up i never liked 16 cool to see how the game evloved but i never liked the 16 update from 15
recommended
used to be my favorite game till i was introduced to csgo this game is the basic for all the players whom have just started to play cs they should slowly grow up simply by starting off from this game
recommended
back when counterstrike was good of all games in this series the other games arent as complete as this one though this game maybe feels outdated it does pack alot of fun for anyone who is a fan of fps games the fps function in this game is superb and it feels great to get headshots and so on if youre intrested in this game and if youre full aware of what you are getting in to then get it
recommended
great game hours of joy recommended

recommended
best game 
recommended
quite possibly the purest form of first person shooter only rivaled by quake in my opinion it is undoubtedly the best game out of the counterstrike series only downside with this game is that it has already had its primetime
recommended
this is real good game
recommended
this game sucks

cs 16 <333 
recommended
counter stricke 16 is a great game recommends all players counter stricke is an action game if you play for a clan you have a lot to think about stack areas enjoy these in it gg & hl
recommended
1010 better than all cod and bf games
recommended
the original cs this is where it all started 16 while many forget about 14 15 and those versions 16 is a great standalone title graphics wise you have to be able to run this if you cant run cs at all not sure why you have steam simple and basic is what a lot of people would describe the look and feel of cs to be if you havent played hl original it make look a little stupid but the game is still great inside original cant get more original here  when talking about the base game ideas great for people with low end comps and internet like link freeman and his dial up this game was made a while back so keep that in mind 710

you have this game to thank for modes like call of dutys search and destroy cs is arguably the most widelyplayed online shooter of all time and its still got a thriving community going on 12 years later its got simple easytopickup gameplay thats spawned a massive competitive community unfortunately its extremely stale thanks to the fact that there are 3 game modes luckily there are tons of customization options available online still worth checking out for the sake of history
recommended
this game is very hard for beginners like me however i recently watched a guide that upped my skill by like triple httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgs5trovyftg so if you plan on buying this game i definately recommend watching this guide before doing anything
recommended
the best online multiplayer game ever
recommended
this game ruined my life its an awesome title i never knew a game 14 years old would be so good and still its active in the community thats really nice this game is a huge hit in the market and still there are lots of buyers it is a little thought for a guy like me who just plays non fps games but still it is really interesting and amazing to play with friends and online too

i remember being a younger kid i had a brother take me out and walk for about 30 minutes to a gaming cafe where they have this game being played 90% of all computers playing this for the first time as a kid i felt it was so realistic lol it was like being in a new world basically we came back to gaming cafe every once a while whenever we can afford it one time my dad came home early and we were not home lol somehow he figured out where we were at good times good times this is one of few games that made my childhood memories

one of the best classic multiplayer games ever best gameplay in multiplayer games ive seen most people who play csgo never played cs 16 which is kinda sad not a single cs game can replace 16 btw most esport tournaments were held in cs 16 so since csgo came out cs 16 kinda lost advantage mostly cause of the years it already has i will miss you 16 <3 rip remembrance of counterstrike 16 httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvnrumzzihelu

recommended
counterstrike is a game that i recommend because  is one of the legends from the category shooting  is cheaper than the rest from the category shooting  is a method to banish boredom  is a good method to increase your performance at aim  you can easy change the type of default skins by the skins from internet  have a fair vac staff  and why you dont try enjoy
recommended
one of the best and evergreen games which i would like to recommend to people interested in fps games
recommended
the best of the best d
recommended
this is my opinion your experience may vary counter strike a name that almost anyone will recognize before i played counter strike i knew that it was a game loved by thousands even millions and that people play it every day the graphics this games graphics are good imo and it may not look to good by todays standards they hold up just fine the gameplay the gameplay in counter strike involves starting out with some money to buy equipment you earn more mony by killing members on the opposing team rescuing hostages deactivating bombs or plant and explode the bomb also 1 life per round so work together my verdict i love this game the people who play it are pretty cool most of the time and the game can really suck you in and $10 may be kinda steep in for a game this old but it comes with counter strike counter strike condition zero counter strike condition zero deleted scenes wich all come in the $10 asking price and i would give this game a 910
recommended
nice game
recommended
one of the best games ever
recommended
this is probably the game that set the foundation for steam this game has aged quite well with its balance of original team based strategy and maps like de_dust 2 are legendary this is without a doubt one of the greatest computer games of all time

invaded by ethnicities with bad computers and awful ideas with their server management it is now impossible as of today to get a decent match without paying for esea even in pug servers not being racist this is what actually happened surf servers and fun servers finally died around 2011 whilst vanilla servers that aint running dust 2 all day long died before steam even came out and all thats left is a bunch of latinocontrolled servers with awful maps and enough plugins to give you a seizure and a thousand hats
recommended
this game will always be the best out of all the cs

best game known to mankind no enhanced engine captures the reality of this original 15 was even better per headshot boxes have never been the same and since vac i miss seeing the cheaters getting caught redhanded and added to the international blacklist i still keep a black book of every ip at the scene of any crimes if you want to experience the original awp trying playing op4 shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast if you are still mad that they cliff and whoever took the silencer off the colt i got the sob back visit antplanet to get skin pack ii original was from 01 and is still downloadable as general sphinx brothers of steel bos skin pack i was there playing uks ganstawars last man standing gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get cs skins on gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible sort of like a prank if you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a luke skywalker bad a$$ skin pack ii has the starwars lightsaber replacement for knife and the ak to plasma rifle from 1980s movie alien the skins out compete csgo any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel i got a duocore up to 1200fps well i should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character [au] deathwish settled it when it got to cs with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible my first game was cs canyon_siege and i was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators i am not the prodigy inc sphinx i have only made autoadmin called 3 forms of punishment it was for admin mod then rewritten for amx lost no need for it anymore anyway people still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix etc give them enough rope and instead of being slapped killed kicked ban was in effect for short period essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buzz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth talking crap about admin was a slaying lag was a slap it was based off trinity and the server was the spirit if trash talk is about the spirit that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set that resolved major breach of security suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally due to buggy 3rd party plugins such as statsme

counterstrike is a firstperson shooter in which players join either the terrorist team the counterterrorist team or become spectators each team attempts to complete their mission objective andor eliminate the opposing team each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously the objectives vary depending on the type of map and these are the most usual ones bomb maps the terrorists must carry a bomb plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counterterrorists before it explodes to win the counterterrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion hostage maps the counterterrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win the terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion vip maps one of the counterterrorists is chosen to act as a vip and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game the terrorists win if the vip is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion

this is the game that started a genre every shooter since cs has copied its competitive teambased style of play its the original to a legacy and many people still play it to this day it has older graphics for people who might not have an expensive computer plenty of dedicated servers and the core gameplay that is known worldwide is right here where it belongs but obviously you know this already unless youve been spending your life playing on xbox and playstation right

recommended
call of duty ripoff
recommended
spray  run  duck  jump  repeat  its a classic never ending game  final verdict  the best competitive fps till date  might not be fun for casual gamers 
recommended
classic
recommended
i used to play this game with my friends when we had to do military service it was a lot of fun pretending that we were fighting russians while putting to use what we would learn during training however it seems that the only people who play now are turkish children who hack and have bad ping so i would not recommend this game any more
recommended
best game i ever played put so many hours in to this the clan games climbing the ranks ah the memories
recommended
in my opinion cs is the single greatest firstperson shooter ever created complex addictive challenging intense precise and infinitely replayable cs was the defining game for an entire generation of gamers but be warned this game is absolutely brutal if you are new to shooters
recommended
realy nice game  <3 d
recommended
really really nice game to play with friends 
recommended
so many girlfriends lost cause of this back in the good old days  everything on this game is absofckinglutely great  well maybe a bunch of players behave like 8years old spoiled kids sometimesbut killing them in game dont get me wrong is the purest satisfaction

recommended
true gamemust play
recommended
addicted  
recommended
it may be old but it still fits the word awesome its not all about gaming its also about meeting new people ive met new friends through this game and i hope the others too overall its still one of my favorite games
recommended
counterstrike is the mainstay of competitive shooters with the kind of prestige the likes of call of duty strives so hard to achieve a number of gameplay modes ranging from what used to be the highly popular vip to the traditional hostage and bomb maps to eventually leading directly to two nowreleased sequels and one upcoming release leaves plenty to keep one busy remember your roots with simple designs to keep things tight and easy to practice yet nearly impossible to master counterstrike proves that a good shooter can stay in the forefront for over a decade
recommended
a fantastic game that improves your fluency in the foreign languages every server you visit has the charming alure of mexicans and brazillians an honorable bunch of players who praise your skills with phrases such as filho da  xiter and jajajajaja they are also very skilled players ingame i often see a single player moving at the speed of sound headshotting everyone in a blink of an eye and getting all the praise from his fellow brethren usually in the form of xiter fdp overall i recommend this game to all individuals seeking to have a fun nonhacker nonenglish gameplay experience
recommended
better than source or even global offensive traditional old game that comes from another awesome game halflife you can not end your gamers life without playing cs
recommended
best fps game d
recommended
still the best counter strike ever
recommended
ruined my life
recommended
this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games
recommended
every server is spanish or french i can now fluently swear in both languages 910
recommended
still better than call of duty ghosts
recommended
i met a lot of people who slept with my mother 1010
recommended
i never played a better first person shooter graphics doesnt matter for gamer gameplay only
recommended
when you crouch you lift your feet in the air and fall to the ground 1010
recommended
warning  do not buy this game if you do youll never see the sunlight again 
recommended
cs is one of the greatest and undermined games in history it is in my opinion the best game to ever have a crosshair it is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in it starts off with a team trying to kill another team i started playing cs when i noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer i started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks as well as a boom box to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game i wanted to play every chance that i could on my road of cs adventures i encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as i was about playing and that when we did play nobody was good enough so it wasnt a lot of fun then i discovered that i could sign up for a class with dboorn i was overly excited and signed up but with skepticism at how the class was going to be sure enough i was proven wrong we started off by practicing a little bit then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class i made some friends and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course when i play counterstrike the whole world disappears only i the mouse and my teammates remain we are united in a common goal we strive collectively towards an end we all desire each player has a spot to hold they stand ready and waiting eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory thus cs celebrates the unity of man the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence when i play cs i play until my veins pump battery acid and then i play some more cs is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny what destiny might you ask i spoke before of unity and it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family that is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one one machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves not that these small metal objects are actually animate im of course speaking only metaphorically over the course of the years i have increased in skill but i have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player i have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share even if that team is less than ideal i have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the ak the awp the deagle the sands under my feet in d2 or inferno and more importantly the teammates at my side i love them it is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness in conclusion i love cs i love to win i love pushing myself to my physical limits its that feeling that first drove me to the computer for every second that i am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play a thirst that grows as every minute passes by when i am outside sitting at the television or playing sports i had an extraordinary time playing this game and i will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how i used to feel this review may be over this game may be dead but i will never stop playing counerstrike 16

counterstrike destroyed my life i had been playing hl deathmatch and was waiting for team fortress 2 some of those early tf2 screens are still etched in my brain i came across a new mod called counterstrike it had just been released beta 1 there were only 3 maps i think and the player models were so similar that in the darkend corridors of mansion you couldnt see who was what so there was team killing galore even a console command for extra money but it was awesome id never played anything like it so i played it allot id come in from college stick it on and play untill i was ready for bed screw school work i had people to shoot in the face anyway i failed my alevels and got stuck with crappy jobs but looking back it could possibly have been worth it because damn i had fun i dont know what its like nowadays i did get fed up with the bunnyhopping awp gits and from what i gather that is the way the game went but this was it where it started for me and if you havent played it once then you should just so you know where all your call of duty and all that balls came from
recommended
cool
recommended
16 is the best game of all time
recommended
one does not simply waste 600 hours on this gamebe sure to buyplay itbesides its classic game
recommended
one of the best older games thumbs up for valve
recommended
that game is suck amazing its counter strike thats all i gotta say 
recommended
most legendary game 
recommended
when it boils down to competitive long lasting first person shooters counterstrike 16 is king the unique money system on a two team map design is what puts counterstrike apart from other run and gun fpss many custom maps and mods are available while still boasting a steady player base even 15 years after release
recommended
well spent money
recommended
best competitive fps ever still fun to play even now with multiple other versions of cs out
recommended
my game is best

i love this game xd

i ran out of spawn in a map called de_dust 2 running for b bombsite and got awped in the head 133710 would run again
recommended
counterstrike is a firstperson shooter in which players join either the terrorist team the counterterrorist team or become spectators each team attempts to complete their mission objective andor eliminate the opposing team each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously

why are you reading a counterstrike review you should already own it just buy it for yourself now 
recommended
you can do thingies and shoot heads
recommended
16 was a revolutionary shooter inspired by some of the greats like team fortress classic theres a reason why counter strike is practically a household name now and why its one of the most popular multiplayer games because its a powerhouse of effective design and balance
recommended
this game shows the graphics has not matter
recommended
i like this game because u can do everything in this game
recommended
old school

counterstrike modifies the multiplayer aspects of halflife to bring to it a more teamoriented gameplay  counterstrike provides the player with an experience that a trained counterterrorist unit or terrorist unit experiences 
recommended
this is what todays fps games are based on in one way or another if the community was as big today as back in 2004 than this would no doubt be ahead of alot of other skill based reaction times sound direction skill fps games i would certainly suggest this game above others the only negative is ofc the age of this game this game is about how good you are not about how fancy it looks
recommended
why are you reading a counterstrike review you should already own it just buy it for yourself now 
recommended
$1000 for my new comp and all i play is cs 16
recommended
if you want a first person shooter that takes skill this is where major first person shooters started

the original counterstrike is a game one cannot forget albeit having 3 successors the gameplay of the original is incomparable the title number 1 online action game was truly deserved during its glory days that said the game is tactical and the guns handle close to reallife counterparts either you plant a bomb defuse a bomb defend hostages or try rescuing them theres also a few deathmatch maps but the tacticalcompetitive gameplay is a lot better if you find yourself struggling to get kills while revisiting one truly legendary game try condition zero as its quite useful to understand the mechanics in the counterstrike franchise

best tactical multiplayer shooter ever

the best competitive multiplayer fps experience for low end computers even an old laptop can run this probably bit of a learning curve with weapons condition zero expansion has halflife style campaign though not as groundbreaking but also additional mp maps and a singleplayer bot mode that is goal oriented and challenging

recommended
started at the very beginning to play counter strike at 13 and since then it was my favorite online fps game played it very long and have to say since than it was and still is perfect sad but its old and lost its support still coming back to remember everything but now spending time on csgo if you have an older machine i recommend it to play cause there are still many servers and game mods active
recommended
personal rating excellent  55 pros  great gameplay  big active community  great choice of weapons  huge amount of mods  lots of community created maps weapons ai soundtracks etc cons  older graphics  rare issues with graphic cards especially for laptops  has replacement in form of newer cs games comment what is there to introduce this is a fps game that most gamers know and the ones that dont should the laughable half an hour i have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game in reality i have played many many many hours with my friends i played it in high school i played it in college i played it with friends after work while the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time while i am no longer able to get my friends together and play this  this game will always be a fond memory for me and who knows maybe i will pick it up some day again what i can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy the basic concept of terrorists vs counterterrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless so grab it if you can it is very much worth it
recommended
love the game the server is not dead yetyesterday i just played 12 hours 1010 rip cs classic

counterstrike has changed a lot from 2000 to presentday 2015 even with the release of csgo counterstrike 16 still remains a favorite for me there are still many dedicated servers with ten or more people in them the graphics are outdated of course especially in maps like nuke but they still look decent on a few maps  this game is the beggining of one of the game series out there i would give this game 810 and would reccomend this to any retrostyle gamer

counter strike is a game that will be in the gaming history books for centuries to come it is valves turn in the competitive scene and this is their weapon counterstrike stupendous game which has proven to many gamers that gameplay strategy and quick thinking comes first and graphics second unique because of the ability to completely control the recoil of your weapon astounding as pretty much all the maps are beautifully designed even now i appreciate the creativity the player and modding bases allowing for some of the best content by the people you to create the gun mechanics are by far the best seen in any game i have ever played the way the guns fire and flow syngerize and play so well its almost mad why they never copied this to css and csgo planning rather than rushing is another reason you never know what terrors come across counter strike is no longer updated but however is still alive and played by most of europe where small teams and clans are still existing to this day veterans also still play this game i dont play comp on this but i have met and played with players totalling 3000 hours on it which is insane inspiring and completely awesome the game itself is in no way glitchy or bugged and is in fact for a better word for it nearperfection valve will be remembered in the glory that is counter strike

i was sitting in ct spawn in de_dust2 after i found my entire team afk sitting right next to me i decided to sneak up on cat when i heard bomb has been planted by the terrorist opposition i proceeded to act like a slick ninja by avoiding all terrorists only to find out most of them went to look for our team and killed them in ct spawn i went around on cat walk threw a smoke and went to cut the wire of the bomb the terrorists had planted i almost cut the blue wire and it could have cost us the round 5 seconds goes by and it says counter terrorist wins at that very moment i just realized i had won the game that is my story counterstrike  thumbs up

recommended
if you like shooting the bad guys then this is one of the games for you when counterstrike was originally released in 2000 i didnt play it because i was like 1 year old i play it now because of the fastslow paced actions and the guns there are a bunch of guns in counterstrike that you can use there are little guns that are cheap and big guns that are expensive but here lies the problem with counterstrike people dont even use all of the guns whenever i find onto a server all of the players are only using the black gun the brown gun the silver gun and the green gun even though there is a bunch of weapons they arent really all used much of the time in the end i play counterstrike because my computer is afraid of counterstrike source

i was told to be done with it through closed shutters flooded floors i wanted to sail out the front door morning anew im counting the texts you sent me im trying hard to take this well but the cradle has been rocked and my feelings are a stir and im not really sure how to approach this landing despair and so many eyes on me i felt like commiting suicide open the door 40mph dead forever more and so little time we we kids just exploring trying to find a way out of this surburban story and that my friends is an emo song straight out of the state of new jersey taking back sunday thursday pffftt this is way more garbage tier than that
recommended
umm i guess this game is good what to expect is trolls tryhards and bads and ummnope that sums up all the people who play this 11  year old game
recommended
counterstrike 16 not one of the best nor one of the worst  good gameplay   bad graphics as it was launched in 1999  if youre going to buy this game at this time i suggest buy counterstrike global offensive 710
recommended
love this game to be honest great game which has its ups and downs base of my pc gaming career best game franchise based off of halflife what can i say
recommended
you gotta have to love this game

recommended
get this game if you love repeatedly hearing sounds of fire in the hole not respawning after you die and having to deal with players hundreds of times better than you when you first begin playing if you enjoy a game of frustration with a terrible community who will look down on you for not having reflexes like a cyborg this is the right game for you also if you dont already have this game you are a  please either buy it or leave steam immediately
recommended
old school fun love it reminds me of my first childhood pc games
recommended
it has been 2 years since i played counterstrike in my other account i have at least 400 hours in this game on another account as i loved it very much as far as i know i have csgo now and i play that instead i missed this game very much i hope to get it again this is just like the other cs games you play as a terrorist and counter terrorist the objective of the terrorist is to use the c4 and blow up 2 areas either one could do a or b while the counterterrorists objective is to stop the bomb from being planted if it is planted they have to eliminate all terrorist and defuse the bomb it takes around 5 seconds or 10 to defuse it depends if you have a defuse kit its a good game and i recommend it

a wise man once told me maybe you should load up some counterstrike 16 and  around on some pub servers for a bit and that was what i did and it was good then i entered a server with a bunch of  plebs sometimes there would be a player or two that could challenge me and wed have fun little fights wed make jokes back and forth with the radio but when i started asking for nude  pics no homo the dude didnt respond _  two hours later i noticed a player wouldnt stop trying to jump on a single ledge failing he would back up and then try again and again and again without end and never shot back i just sat there are watched him that was when i realized the entire server was just bots and my conversations were with the rare amount of human players didnt know what to think
recommended
best game for understanding your mouse

this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games
recommended
every server is spanish or french i can now fluently swear in both languages 910
recommended
still better than call of duty ghosts
recommended
i met a lot of people who slept with my mother 1010
recommended
i never played a better first person shooter graphics doesnt matter for gamer gameplay only
recommended
when you crouch you lift your feet in the air and fall to the ground 1010
recommended
warning  do not buy this game if you do youll never see the sunlight again 
recommended
cs is one of the greatest and undermined games in history it is in my opinion the best game to ever have a crosshair it is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in it starts off with a team trying to kill another team i started playing cs when i noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer i started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks as well as a boom box to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game i wanted to play every chance that i could on my road of cs adventures i encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as i was about playing and that when we did play nobody was good enough so it wasnt a lot of fun then i discovered that i could sign up for a class with dboorn i was overly excited and signed up but with skepticism at how the class was going to be sure enough i was proven wrong we started off by practicing a little bit then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class i made some friends and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course when i play counterstrike the whole world disappears only i the mouse and my teammates remain we are united in a common goal we strive collectively towards an end we all desire each player has a spot to hold they stand ready and waiting eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory thus cs celebrates the unity of man the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence when i play cs i play until my veins pump battery acid and then i play some more cs is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny what destiny might you ask i spoke before of unity and it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family that is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one one machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves not that these small metal objects are actually animate im of course speaking only metaphorically over the course of the years i have increased in skill but i have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player i have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share even if that team is less than ideal i have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the ak the awp the deagle the sands under my feet in d2 or inferno and more importantly the teammates at my side i love them it is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness in conclusion i love cs i love to win i love pushing myself to my physical limits its that feeling that first drove me to the computer for every second that i am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play a thirst that grows as every minute passes by when i am outside sitting at the television or playing sports i had an extraordinary time playing this game and i will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how i used to feel this review may be over this game may be dead but i will never stop playing counerstrike 16
recommended
its aight
recommended
this is a game ive played with friends ever since i was very young so it means a lot to me it is the definition of classic games and fun to play with just friends where nobody is extremely good and everyone just have fun

few years ago we first heard that cs 16 is dead some organizations have dismissed their cs  team people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to cs go it seems that now it is not so if you pay attention to the broadcast with iem 6 wc we see that cs 16 by views prevzashla sc 2 not only is this game broke all past their records so why cs 16 is dead i beg to differ according to spectators iem 6 cs was the best in the tournament i think cs 16 hardly died she would die only if we want to do as for cs go it grows developers even began to read the feedback the game has changed a lot of things open beta version of the game was to be released after the new year but i think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result as for the keys to the cs go something im working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys i will write how i succeed

i dont like tactical shooters but counter strike is one of the best fps games there are tons of peple playing fun mods on servers it is hard for new peple if you played call of duty or tf2 you can go in as a one man army but in this game its not like that if you go by your self you will get killed one problem i have with the game is if you die your out for the round and if your new you will get killed alot overall 910 great fun game but hard

recommended
chronos sucks at it
recommended
shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike
recommended
1 of the best games i ever played 
recommended
best game of all the time
recommended
it takes reaction speed and accuracy to be good in order to achieve skill it takes practice which is the aspect that makes cs fun and competitive
recommended
this was my first game who maked me love him  i love it 
recommended
nice game
recommended
i like this game also going to buy cs go
recommended
the best online game ever d
recommended
how to be csgo pro 1 buy cs 2 launch it up and leave it on for 2 weeks straight 3 get over 100 hours of cs and then brag about it on your next csgo comp game how you played with the best pros back in the day 1010 still best game and s better than csgo
recommended
really good old school shooter if you love old fps games or youre pc is to slow i would recomend this game to you
recommended
very good game

good nice and beautiful game ^_^
recommended
oldschool but csgo still better

recommended
this came out 14 years ago and it still has better graphics than your average call of duty game
recommended
do you still remember this game xdd 
recommended
the original
recommended
a fun classic fps game made by valve that takes strategy and teamwork
recommended
the game that started it all but past its time i only recently played cs its only been 16 year so maybe the hype is dead but staying optimistic here right i will say that im sure this game was huge during it time as it was the first of its kind but i played it for 2 hours and it didnt really interest me this is the game that spawned an entire series such as css which had some very cool mods and csgo which has become a esports standard for professional players so it deserves our respect bottom line this game is past its time and offers nothing that css or csgo could offer but it was the original that started the series but because of that id recommend it to any fans of the series 610  game was the first of its kind and defined the series but offers nothing the newer titles dont already have
recommended
the best game ever 
recommended
nearly noone plays it anymore but it is still the best
recommended
property rating explanation graphics 55 the graphics of counterstrike 16 are very dated compared to the next installments cs source and csgo not really strong here gameplay 10 this is maybe the best most addictive fps multiplayer game ever created for pc the gameplay is stellar multiplayer 9 really addicting multiplayer from public matches to gathers mixed teams and clan clashes also valves anticheat is present story na multiplayer only soundmusic 7 the sound effects are very convincing from gunshots to grenades and running optimization 9 optimization is great this game can run even on the more weak laptops without any problems cons na no achievements also many cheaters on public matches no automatic ranked mode like csgo has overall 9 best multiplayer fps game ever created
recommended
there is n0thing see what i did there better than this game
recommended
shoot at body  nothing shoot at head  dead before bullets hit
recommended

yes good game go kill every player
recommended
best fps game i have ever played since 2006
recommended
a classic that is the best way i can describe this game but if you only played csgo or even css and then you decide to go on a nostalgia trip to test the game prepare to feel like you are in a very alien environment the 2 hours that i tried yes tried to play the game were filled with learning the controls adapt to the different recoil and aiming system in geral and then dying over and over again by the more experienced players i recommend the game if you want to expand your gaming history horizons and give it a try but you can expect frustration and rage its a piece of gaming history and it should be preserved as such but new gamers will probably never get it
recommended
best shooter of all times
recommended
cs 16 the best game of all times 
recommended
>never used green text before >used to hate this game >went to a cybercafe to meet some friends they were playing this game couldnt wait for them to finish playing so i decided i would join them even though i never really played it >died 100 times with 4 kills >my ego got injured >got home downloaded the game illegally then started playing >got good >bought good gaming hardware >got even better >got to my friends level while they were getting better as well then got better than them for a while >nothing else really >bought this and the other cs games couldnt get into them so i got back to this now i hate my friends for stealing my social life

counterstrike is a tactical firstperson shooter video game which originated from a halflife modification and features realworld weapons counterstrike pits a team of counterterrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force the game has both individual and multiplayer options bots can be added into the game the onlinemultiplayer option is activated via steam other than similarities in basic gameplay counterstrike is not in any way related to halflife the original version was marketed as a commercial mod but since then it has grown into a separate game in itself
recommended
forever my lovely game im start to play at this game when i was 6 years old
recommended
1 of d best games ever released d
recommended
lets see where to start i dont think there is a single person who has ever played any fps games and doesnt know cs 16 this is an epic game an evergreen a classic this is where fps gaming begins yea its a bit old its a bit buggy the graphics are outdated but thats how we love it cs 16 is just perfect  well on its own way if youve never played it buy it 1010
recommended
everythings fine
recommended
awsome game y my first play on 2004 no steam p
recommended
one of the best fps games 
recommended
this my favroite game  d
recommended
this my beast game <3
recommended
not good graphics but best gameplay y
recommended
a great game of catandmouse where you either play as a terrorist plant bombs or hold hostages or counterterrorist defend bombsites or rescue hostages either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round counterstrike is a fastpaced realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend its also more fun the graphics hasnt aged well but the guns still looks authentic one thing i hate about counterstrike is when you die you have to sit and wait until the round ends even if the rounds are usually short its frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive fortunately counterstrike has tons of mods available so youre able to play the game in many different ways this helps the game from becoming repetitive and keep the game fresh theres also not a lot of detail in the sound other than the guns but thats a minor complaint the mods dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and thats why millions of people still play this oldschool game although there are many better shooters on the market now counterstrikes unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time 810  great game
recommended
i recommend you this game if youre 12 years old who just discovered weed

precision fps you are rarely rewarded for spraying your weapon its all about controlled firing for headshots somthing that is unique to this release

the game is good but not a lot of people play the original anymore if you dont have any friends who play this one stick to cs source because the few servers in the original that are populated are not exactly your standard modes usually but a good competitive shooter nonetheless

if csgo never came out id probably be playing this all the time instead still fun to jump into once and a while even for nostalgias sake

recommended
excelent game old but still awesome
recommended
classic fps fun nothing beats the original except maybe source but youll be happy to find that both 16 and source still have thriving communities the best thing about 16 is that its requirements are a potato lamp recommended and chances are it will run flawlessly on your system i dont need to praise the gameplay because what else can be said that hasnt already deathmatch gun game bomb defuse and many more and with what seems to be an endless amount of fun and creative maps at its disposal its no wonder people still play it today if you have steam cs 16 is essential i also recommend source
recommended
i cant get the game to work it starts but i dont se the load screen i just see black

recommended
a classic great game literally hundreds over hours played since i acquired during initial release
recommended
classic shooter 
recommended
a great game of catandmouse where you either play as a terrorist plant bombs or hold hostages or counterterrorist defend bombsites or rescue hostages either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round counterstrike is a fastpaced realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend its also more fun the graphics hasnt aged well but the guns still looks authentic one thing i hate about counterstrike is when you die you have to sit and wait until the round ends even if the rounds are usually short its frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive fortunately counterstrike has tons of mods available so youre able to play the game in many different ways this helps the game from becoming repetitive and keep the game fresh theres also not a lot of detail in the sound other than the guns but thats a minor complaint the mods dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and thats why millions of people still play this oldschool game although there are many better shooters on the market now counterstrikes unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time 810  great game
recommended
i recommend you this game if youre 12 years old who just discovered weed
recommended

hello people i would like to spread the world about this game graphics kinda bad but its about the action eh so it is mainly based as a game terrorists vs counterterrorists terrorists have to plant the bombat de_maps or secure the hostages at cs_maps counter ones needs to do the opposite defuse or deny the bomb at de_maps and get the hostages back at cs_maps there are a lot of mods if you dont like the classic mode but i really think that everyone knows about this game  ps im doing this for a steam badge d

recommended
awesome game but ended cuz of cheaters 
recommended
the origin of addiction one of the most fun games ive had the pleasure of enjoying and the one who threw me to the vibrant world of fps my favorite genre til this day now important information do not be fooled by the amount of hours marked by steam there when the beta versions were launched in 1999 when the game was free then 16 was launched until about 4 years ago i had it in a different account which i do not own anymore over a decade of gaming several hours every day which certainly have accumulated thousands of hours by far the most played game throughout my life you see the first sentence that illustrates this review was not chosen at random i had to stop playing completely cold turkey or i would fail high school just decided to buy it again and play for nostalgia sake im not afraid im much more self controlled now and the fact that im not even half as good as before kinda takes away the compulsion to play by far the longest relationship i have ever had and we are getting back together this is a good day

most think cs was released in 2000 it actually was released on june 19 1999 before hl opposing force as a goldsrc mod for free later when gooseman joined valve it was released as a retail game for about 10 dollars overall you cannot deny the fact that cs was one of the best games of all time and in my opinion it is slightly better than go but thats my opinion
recommended
no words just awesome game
recommended
it got at least 10 times better love story than twilight and counterstrike global offensive

recommended
by far the best first person shooter ive ever played

classic great game if you have not played it you should
recommended
best game ever made and the beginning of esport and after 17 years it still a very good game but dont much people play it that is very sad because its very good and the best game ever made the graphics dont really matter or it looks like minecraft fps its about the game how you play it it still is the best game ever made and is the start of counterstrike series but not a single counterstrike that has been made after 16 is not comparable with 16 the game engine is so good are nice and the graphics arent good but that how i think cs should be like the bad look and back in the days when you couldnt do very good 3d models of the map and the weapons etc now when csgo came the game looks very good and beautifal it look like cod and you dont get the counterstrike feeling
recommended
there are more people playing on this 16 than source

best fps out there no doubt with so many different mods maps and time it takes to get bored with this game i just cant think of a better fps game best of all its all fun usually  except when you get kicked from a lithuanianpolish server for speaking english or asking to ban a wallhacker 910 because server list is so big and many of the servers are full of bots only serving purpose to redirect players to join someone elses server it can be hard to find a real server

worst game ever worst graphics the graphics are that bad because the game is older than your mothers fanny and the game is awesome itself brings all the good memories back for example when i was 7 installing the cracked version of that game and then just shooting anyone who gets in my way without controlling the recoil   and lol traded this game for some crappy ak47 in cs go huehuehuehuehue i give it 88 m8 pls liek no hate no homo tenks oh and btw the funniest thing about this game is brining your cs go skills there doing 1 hit kills and then getting banned from servers for hacking like ive joined a sever once done 7 headshots in a row without dying then some speccy  is sayin wh and aim off or im banning you so yea this game is fabulous 88 would rate again

wait what is this counterstrike yes its counterstrike the old fps game ive loved this game very much its my childhood game this game doesnt have its amazing duper 2014 graphics but instead its the gameplay were talking about so the gameplay its very fun but bit serious if you can ask me this game made me very serious at some period of time but the gameplay is still pretty fun and to derp around with it such as editing its textures and etc ive seen people having troubles playing this game online because full of tryhards or any pros out there well theres no bots included in counterstrike but you can go practice at counterstrike condition zero it has bots this game isnt free and you have to buy it ill only suggest people who really likes old fps or competitive gaming around here game on mates i highly suggest you buy this game for the people who really likes fps here
recommended
this is most famous online game  d
recommended
this is the best multiplayer game really its the best 
recommended
the best first person game ever
recommended
i love counter strike i should end it here but ill be honest and say i grew up with source wasnt old enough to experince 16 sadly but giving it a try its very different having to buy ammo see what the original maps looked like before being changed in source and dealing with pros that somehow can deal with the game choppyness and inaccuracy ill stick with source but great game 910
recommended
better than  go no cheats
recommended
its one of the best tactical team shooter game that is still played by masses even today do i really need to explain why

best shooting game ever played
recommended
welcome to the worlds most fun over rated pile of  since i first got a pc nearly 3 years ago all i have ever heard is counter strike counter strike counter strike and after about 15 hours of play time i see why right away i can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fpsmultiplayer genre and i can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike its nonexistent learning curve for the first maybe 3 hours i played on a few different servers and never killed a single person i figured im new to this and it seems as thoe these guysgirls have been playing much longer than i have been so i began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later i had killed maybe 6 people not much had changed and then remembered that thats stupid i shouldnt be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while i have 5 another problem is the weapons i can understand the weird names valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesnt mean i wont still make fun of them the damaged ratio is also complete  the sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and i was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast the knife is a bit under powered but thats better than it being a light saber and for some reason the only guns that are ever used are the ak look alike the m16 look alike and the sniper rifle i should say that counter strike is not a bad a game its for sure a sextillion times better than any call of duty ever made and i will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends adhd kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy but its also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat
recommended

recommended
classic it is
recommended
underestimated it i never really liked cs perhaps because i was a cod player cod games have descent graphics better movement and alot more features than in cs and keeping this in mind i always kept myself away from cs trust me dont do the same mistake though both these games are fps yet they are completely different in terms of gameplay cs is a game only for serious gamers thats what i think and the level of difficulty is way higher than cod seeing this game was relesed in 1990s it cannot and shouldnt be compared to the newer fpses its a legend in its own

possibly one of the greatest first person shooting games ever made try it out and see how you like it too bad that numerous number of hackers are around these days but not a probem if server admins are present you can try maps like dustdust2 assault or even fy maps like snow and iceworld awp maps are also great if you like scoping and killing opponents with one shot maybe even go for some of the fun surfing maps that are still around lastly fyi it does take some time to find the optimal sensitivity setting that you play the best with

the real pillar of all fps games ever to sprout out into the competitive scene its been around for as long as i can remember and has literally changed the esports scene very balanced and runs on one of the smoothest engines every made for a first person shooter the game is outdated now and its successor csgo is doing a good job at satisfying the professional scene while maintaining a very challenging and exciting gameplay

counterstrike is one of the most nostalgiac experiences ive had with that being said i enjoyed the steam version for my 24 hours playing it however there is a great bit of lag on most servers in this game although i shouldnt have any putting that aside however counterstrike is still one of the most revolutionary games for its time the multiplayer may be dying down and i have yet to convert to go which i dont know if i will if you got this with half life you remember getting this with it this is still the same fun game from that period that has come to be a cult classic it plays very well and is fun to play with friends although i may find team fortress 2 more enjoyable from my short time playing that game i shall still enjoy counterstrike for what it was
recommended
counterstrike 16 is game best for action

this is not a game this is a life im so sorry that there are too much cheaters on servers but if valve can make it better  it would be great d remember old good times waiting to start a new match between navi and fnatic <3 and all other teams then somebody made a cheat and destroyed a game this game changed many lives many people i think this game become the world best game ever for me its the best game i play it every day but it isnt like sometimes now graphic is important well it isnt i know that this game is dead already i want to get it back but there is no way to do that cheaters are everywhere now in every single game you can buy cheat for csgo for 5$ i think my friend bought it i asked him   why did you bought that  isnt it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats  he told me  i want to beat everyone i want to be the best no one can stop me now  i dont know why are you doing it this is beautiful game when i played it for the first time it was awesome d finally a game that i can play with my friends on lan and till today im playing it i never downloaded a cheat i dont need that i want to learn how to play to be the beast in the world now everyone is wanting money money money i heard about csgo lounge aka cs go betting site now everyone is watching matches because of skins to get free money well when i was young in 2005 i waited with my friends a cs 16 match it was beautiful now i sit here and watch this csgo matches so many people watch matches but 90% watch them because of fing bet it will never be like sometimes or we can change everything valve please get this game back to life <3 thanks

recommended
its aight not the best tbh
recommended
really nice and smooth game
recommended
one of the best first person shooters ever the thing that makes this game so awesome is that you will always have competition and theres no excuse for losing or winning because the only thing that can make you good in it is experience there are no ingame purchases and its really hard to get pro or even decent as it doesnt have autorecovery as many fps nowdays highly recommended
recommended
so sad that the activity of such a great game has seriously decreased over the last few months the gameplay still reminds me of so many memories
recommended

best game ever made domination of movemenet shooting mechanics  recoil exaclty what a fps game need when developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good fps they will make a game as good as cs 16 is csgo does not have these major aspects and doesnt deserve name of counterstrike imo as a third very important thing for fps game i would say the animations the animations of player models such as runnig walking crouching gun holdingfireingreloading etc graphics isnt so important doesnt need to be sooo good but decent due to visibility
recommended
oh yes this is the best game to play with friends
recommended
best steam game ever
recommended
i love this game
recommended
still the most epic game ever created yes csgo is great and is a definite cs reviver but 16 will forever be the game that ruined our lives commited thousands of hours to 16 15 and all previous iterations started way way back when it was still a mod for hl1 growing up and watching the game grow and turn into what it has become has been a truly great experience this game is still alive and you can still have hundreds of hours of fun on it so give it a go

great game and what i suggest is getting it on steam because it comes with condition zero and its better like that because condition zero has a campaign and normal counterstrike is great with multiplayer so get this game

this game is the game that started the counterstrike series it started as a mod for the game that started it all halflife like team fortress counterstrike became a standalone game after its popularity as a mod if you enjoy the old halflife engine goldsrc and want to play a shooter that doesnt have a complicated story and chapters counterstrike is the game for you condition zero is the same game but with a campaign mode that allows you to play with bots and unlock maps as you go

recommended
ive played this game since i was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever i launch it to this very day over 12 years of endless entertainment no other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than counterstrike 16 has and i doubt no game ever will reason ive only got 38 hours here is because i no longer use the account i originally played cs 16 on func_vehicle is what makes this counter strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise
recommended
nice game

best fps game ever played
recommended
counterstrike 16 the very first game i played using steam i used to play it alot now there are counterstrike games with better graffix but the original is still damn good

recommended
the one and only back when games had simple mechanics and very little nonsense remember when a bullet would go where you actually fired it remember when recoil patterns were easy to understand remember when it was possible to take a game seriously and become ridiculously good at it the counterstrike franchise is very much like super smash bros  they had brawl we had cssource and csgo lets hope valve decides to play a proper homage to this game in the future much like nintendo did with the new smash bros
recommended
it is one of the best fps game available online even today its craze has not ended from a navi player i heard that steam version provides very low lag due to which i purchased the game and for sure i was 100% satisfied you would not believe my ping dropped to 1921 from 2001500

best competitive game ever rip
recommended
this game was initially launched in the year 1999 this being the first shooter of its kindcompetitive and challenging in a new manner although the game is outdatedupdated a bit by valve on their steam release in late 2000it is still extremely fun to play the initial game experience is the casual feel of csgo when you defuse and plants bombs with others still very fun to play but the game has evolved with the community of cs some of the most fun things i do is the kz maps and other new and different game modes that are best on the original counterstrike if you enjoyed any modern shooter you should play counterstrike for its nostalgic feel and rewarding game modes
recommended
the best game ever played  enjoing abou 12 years  thanks valve
recommended
not b  r friendly came for the dusters stayed for the rats 1110

recommended
counterstrike is one of the most nostalgiac experiences ive had with that being said i enjoyed the steam version for my 24 hours playing it however there is a great bit of lag on most servers in this game although i shouldnt have any putting that aside however counterstrike is still one of the most revolutionary games for its time the multiplayer may be dying down and i have yet to convert to go which i dont know if i will if you got this with half life you remember getting this with it this is still the same fun game from that period that has come to be a cult classic it plays very well and is fun to play with friends although i may find team fortress 2 more enjoyable from my short time playing that game i shall still enjoy counterstrike for what it was
recommended
counterstrike 16 is game best for action

i just <3 this game

recommended
cs16 in my top 10 all time favorite games including its previous versions of which ive played 1315 without a doubt the keystone in fps gaming history and a must for all who claim to be hardcore gamers 1010
recommended
really addictive game with great players
recommended
fifty years later people will remember this game it is timeless just as super smash bros melee is dota12 and starcraft etc at the competitive level no other game tops this as a team based esports fps so many mechanics to learn bhopping ladders russian walks spamming crouch to short hop grenades are 1 pixel width floaty nade physics flashes smokes all these raise the skill ceiling too much to say for what i have experienced try it yourself and goodluck finding the niche gametype you prefer
recommended
its wasting to much of your free time
recommended
ruined my life
recommended
this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games
recommended
every server is spanish or french i can now fluently swear in both languages 910
recommended
still better than call of duty ghosts
recommended
i met a lot of people who slept with my mother 1010
recommended
i never played a better first person shooter graphics doesnt matter for gamer gameplay only
recommended
when you crouch you lift your feet in the air and fall to the ground 1010
recommended
warning  do not buy this game if you do youll never see the sunlight again 
recommended
cs is one of the greatest and undermined games in history it is in my opinion the best game to ever have a crosshair it is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in it starts off with a team trying to kill another team i started playing cs when i noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer i started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks as well as a boom box to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game i wanted to play every chance that i could on my road of cs adventures i encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as i was about playing and that when we did play nobody was good enough so it wasnt a lot of fun then i discovered that i could sign up for a class with dboorn i was overly excited and signed up but with skepticism at how the class was going to be sure enough i was proven wrong we started off by practicing a little bit then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class i made some friends and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course when i play counterstrike the whole world disappears only i the mouse and my teammates remain we are united in a common goal we strive collectively towards an end we all desire each player has a spot to hold they stand ready and waiting eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory thus cs celebrates the unity of man the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence when i play cs i play until my veins pump battery acid and then i play some more cs is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny what destiny might you ask i spoke before of unity and it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family that is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one one machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves not that these small metal objects are actually animate im of course speaking only metaphorically over the course of the years i have increased in skill but i have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player i have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share even if that team is less than ideal i have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the ak the awp the deagle the sands under my feet in d2 or inferno and more importantly the teammates at my side i love them it is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness in conclusion i love cs i love to win i love pushing myself to my physical limits its that feeling that first drove me to the computer for every second that i am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play a thirst that grows as every minute passes by when i am outside sitting at the television or playing sports i had an extraordinary time playing this game and i will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how i used to feel this review may be over this game may be dead but i will never stop playing counerstrike 16
recommended
its aight
recommended
like half life 1 counterstrike is an undeniable classic
recommended
even though i was vac banned seriously dont remember hacking or anything this game is still better that cs go and css in my opinion i dont know how to explain it i honestly think its just nostalgia but i dont think i will ever hate this game as the other games counter strike has alot of gamemodes zombie  deathrun  hide n seek  etc i would suggest you buy this game if you like cs go or css
recommended

its super awesome  yeah
recommended
old game but i never get tired of

lock n load this is the game that marked an era indeed it did and its not very bad today either in fact some people prefer this than the newest addition to the cs franchise well what do you know it is highly unlikely that you dear reader has never heard about counterstrike in case you havent the gameplay is very simple there are two teams counterterrorists the good guys and the terrorists the bad guys to the general public in addition there are two official gamemodes hostage rescue and defuse in hostage rescue the ts terrorists have captured a few gentlemen and are holding them hostage the cts counterterrorists have to go in and shoot the bad guys and save the day meanwhile the ts have to kill the cts but not the hostages no hurting a hostage will cost you money quite alot of it well almost all of it the second gamemode is called defuse and is the most popular the ts have to plant an explosive device also known as bomb in two select areas of the current map called bombsites they go by the name of a and b respectively the choice of where to plant the bomb is down to personal preference meanwhile the cts have to shoot the ts and defuse the bomb preferably both but the cts will still win the round if all ts are dead if the cts die or run out of time the ts win the rounds last about 5 minutes each and is divided into 30 rounds until map change which is very rare since all the servers just play on de_dust2 in counterstrike you have a money system you start the first round with 800$ which is enough to buy an improved pistol or body armour the winning team will receive a set amount of money while the losing team will recieve notably less once you advance the second round most of your teammates will switch to automatic rifles but investing in submachine guns and shotguns can be a sensible choice albeit not the most popular for some reason mainly becuase you need more skill to master smgs than what is needed for a rifle there is a good amount of weapons to purchase each divided in their own category pistols shotguns smgs rifles machine guns and equipment it is not advisable to buy the most expensive weapon you can buy when you are losing its best to hold on to your money and buy a cheaper option this is commonly known as eco round economic round you might be outgunned but at the start of the next round you will have sufficient funds to buy a better weapon and so on as you can see the gameplay is very simple the communication consist of commands over the radio cover me enemy spotted and the most used fire in the hole you of course have the global and team text chat and normal voice chat using your own microphone once you get into the game you will probably be the first one to die expect that to be outcome of every round yes counterstrike is easy to learn but very difficult to master to make it worse in counterstrike there is no option to play offline with bots this only applies to 16 the first cs so youre probably going to get harassed verbally by your fellow teammates quite ironic dont you think good thing there are many guides in the internet available for you to read about how to improve yourself in cs were almost done here except for a few things the counterstrike community to begin with i wouldnt call it cancerous but the community isnt very friendly or welcoming so to speak if you decide to hide instead of killing the enemies even though theyve outnumbered you your teammates will make great use of their very rude vocabulary or you will get votekicked off the game same thing goes for weapon choice tactic choice etc etc do keep in mind that yelling at someone for something in a video game isnt really a sign of strength more like the opposite if you spend all day screaming at people in a video game you shouldnt take people seriously ignore them or change server also the map rotation on all the servers if the server isnt playing some poorly made custom map you will be playing de_dust2 thats it even though there are more maps even a map called de_dust you will always end up in dust2 few servers play on cs_italy or de_nuke yes dust2 is the most popular map but people play on it so much i could make a fully detailed sketch of it in my head if i was woken up in the middle of the night so in the end if you are looking for a fun shooter that will present you a great challenge look no further gameplay doesnt change much but you will get better and better at it so it never gets boring and its very fast paced what youll need it two minutes and you got yourself a great dose of entertainment also its suprisingly compatible with windows 8 although this was released at the time when windows 98 was the huge hit and it doesnt take up much space really so a low end pc can handle this really good well depends on your graphics card and other stuff but you dont need military grade hardware i hope my review has come to great help in deciding whether you should spen money on this or not thanks for reading counterterrorists win

best shooting game ever played
recommended
welcome to the worlds most fun over rated pile of  since i first got a pc nearly 3 years ago all i have ever heard is counter strike counter strike counter strike and after about 15 hours of play time i see why right away i can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fpsmultiplayer genre and i can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike its nonexistent learning curve for the first maybe 3 hours i played on a few different servers and never killed a single person i figured im new to this and it seems as thoe these guysgirls have been playing much longer than i have been so i began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later i had killed maybe 6 people not much had changed and then remembered that thats stupid i shouldnt be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while i have 5 another problem is the weapons i can understand the weird names valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesnt mean i wont still make fun of them the damaged ratio is also complete  the sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and i was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast the knife is a bit under powered but thats better than it being a light saber and for some reason the only guns that are ever used are the ak look alike the m16 look alike and the sniper rifle i should say that counter strike is not a bad a game its for sure a sextillion times better than any call of duty ever made and i will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends adhd kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy but its also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat
recommended
best oldschool fps shooting game ever we never forget you 
recommended
still the best game ever
recommended
the most aggressive awesomeshooter that dated back then when it was madeit was the best shooter ever since halo combat evolved came out and its still popular todayso ipersonally think you should buy itits only 1000and thenif you have kids let them play it when there olderand then let their kidskids play itand so on and so on so really buy this game to experience what the gameplay feels like
recommended
you get kinda bored after a while its interesting until you meet players with cheats and so on this game was a good rps but his time has passed x
recommended
alive cs 16
recommended
great way to spend some down time
recommended
one of the best counter strikesold but gold
recommended
best multiplayer fps title of all time nuff said
recommended
the game may be old but it still gives hours of fun
recommended
father of fps
recommended
best fps game in my opinion definitely a must buy this review goes to all cs series
recommended
great game 5
recommended
its a multiplayer game can be played on lan or net ip address its simple and strategy one of most played games
recommended
this game is amazing if you like any counter strike try this one out the recoil is diffrent but oh well
recommended
if you like classics here is something you should probably get a mod from halflife released one year after halflife it is still one of the most played games in the world bringing players from all over the place to enjoy together it has a rather simple gameplay and youre able to get most of it in a few minutes but at the same time it requires training if you want to be able to play well
recommended
perfect bad game
recommended
i dont need to say anything about this masterpiece csgo has been out for 2 years now as a long time cs fan yes the hours on steam are short but if they logged the data on my game disk there would be at least 3000 hours on it counterstrike 16 just gives me a certain feeling none of the later cs games give me listen if you happen to be reading this because you are thinking of buying it get it it will be one of the most actionpacked amazing $10 youll ever spend
recommended
this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games i am glad that i lived through the golden era of shooters and if id have to rate it itd 1010 ofcourse
recommended
best classic game
recommended
a game of skill master this game and youll be able to dominate in any other fps games

good one
recommended
counter strike 16  what else their is to say
recommended
this is counterstrike 16 the latest version of the original counterstrike the graphics are far inferior to the source version but the gameplay is considered better by most counterstrike veterans this has some maps not found in the source verison and has the riot shield which is not in the source version either the riot shield allows you to avoid bullets but you cannot have a primary weapon if you have it equiped so you can only use your sidearm this version also features a gamemode not available in the source version the gamemode is where you must protect a player controlling a vip while they make their way to the rescue vehicle if you want to see how different this is from the source version then go right ahead its only $500 on steam so you have nothing to lose
recommended
best fps of all time
recommended
 one of the best games fps games ever made counterstrike 16 left its mark on the fps genera the community  the once prospering community has now reduced the number of adepts simply because the time for counterstrike 1016 has passed by a little bit and more and more of the once players of counterstrike are attracted now to these new big fpss and they are right to do that because we need to move and and progress the graphics  not so astonishing if you put it against the today graphics we must remember that it is an old game the graphics we look at today for this game were some hits back in 2000 and personally i still enjoy the graphics a little because they are bringing that simplicity not an eye heavy graphics style the sounds  well for me i still love the sounds in this game the guns sound like proper powerfull weapons when you press the button to fire you really feel like you are engaging somebody and you really feel like you are wielding a firearm that could take someones life not like some of todays fpss where guns sound more like the pops of the popcorn put in your microwave so here counterstrike still takes the point from some of the new fpss  even with the fact thats counterstrikes 16 time passed by a little bit i still recommend it and me too i still come back to it from time to time to enjoy this nice simple and clean graphics style the still impressive gun sounds and sometimes just to see where have we started from and where have we come with the fps genera note this is a personal opinnion you may agree or disagree with it but on whatever side you are you can leave a nice criticising comment instead of some hateful messages thank you
recommended
this game is one of the best games i have ever played

this is just a classics

recommended
this is simply a legend who never played and enjoyed this game cannot call himself a gamer
recommended
classic
recommended
the best fps team based tact shooter on the market hands down if you dont believe me just check its history
recommended
although this game was made 100 years ago it still retains its core value being a great fps shooter that requires team work and not just 360 no scoping this game wouldnt mean anything to a 13 year old because the graphics arent great but to a person my age this game holds many hours in my heart 8510
recommended
thats a very nice game and its a pleasure to have it
recommended
13 years play this game and i never get bored
recommended
an old timing classic but gets quite bored in the end
recommended
counterstrike is a good game for the most part adding characters and stuff to the half life franchise and universe there are several canon discrepencies but they can be ignored for the gameplay and overall storyline and even how that fits into the orignal half life game d overall its worth paying for and playing
recommended
very nice game 
recommended
one of the best games ever
recommended
the quintessential modern combat fps multiplayer often imitated never duplicated i spent the greater part of a decade enjoying this game much of the fun however came from the great friendships developed over years of online play
recommended
play for funn

just the best of the all games in the world
recommended
youre not a true pc gamer until you own this game

cool game 
recommended
a true classic multiplayer fps difficult for beginners
recommended
counter strike is a great fps simply about terrorists doing things like bombing supplies or keeping people hostage while the counterterrorist try to defuse the bombs or save the hostages this game has many great mods and maps that make it fun to come back to no wonder this game used to be the worlds number 1 online action game if that isnt enough you get counterstrike condition zero with it i would give this game a 9 out of 10
recommended
a cult classic of culminating counterterror camaraderie
recommended
filete la wia

great game the best cs ever made
recommended
best classic action shooter ever was created
recommended
the beest <3
recommended
cs 16 is probably the best yet team based fps game go is a step up from source but its a very debatable topic that it is as good as 16 definately not better though
recommended
wait you dont own this game already whats wrong with you how have you not owned this since its release for shame you might as well just wait for counterstrike global offensive to come out since you waited this long to even get counterstrike im ashamed of you
recommended
just the best
recommended
good game very nice
recommended
hd graphics better than battlefield 5
recommended
i really like the game but i couldnt find the stupid cake
recommended
a very good game
recommended
over a decade later and this game is still the mostplayed game on steam and for good reason solid gameplay controls usergenerated maps and mods the list goes on this fps personally serves as a model of comparison whenever i play any other firstperson games
recommended
play the worlds number 1 online action game engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular teambased game ally with teammates to complete strategic missions take out enemy sites rescue hostages your role affects your teams success your teams success affects your role
recommended
one of the greatest games ever made not active now but in its prime this game was amazing
recommended
did anyone not play this game at some point or another as elusive to me as football and stock car racing in its ability to transfix the lives and minds of some shall we say unenlightened gamers out there
recommended
this game is just awesome
recommended
how bots are taking
recommended
verry old but verry good game this is the gold game of steam
recommended
the simple fact that this 10 years old game still shows up in the top played games on steam clearly says something about its quality i feel like i shouldnt even recommend it as its name speaks for itself easy to pick up difficult to master counterstrike is one if not the best multiplayer fps out there and itll probably remain that way for many years to come the fact that this game rivals it sequels in number of players worldwide only shows how great this game is so do yourself a favour and get it
recommended
yes i do recommend this game
recommended
counterstrike 16 is much more difficult to get used to over css but it is much more satisfying to succeed in recommended
recommended
thi is the best game guys own t
recommended
the best game ever 
recommended
still the best imo

classic cs counterstrike never gets old ka_ maps were the best game type for me loved round after round dodging blade swings and countering with a sweet headshot no game mode more tense than knife arena getting stormed at by several opposing team members hungry for frags using all skill and wit at a 51 ratio and coming out victor epic
recommended
the next best version of counterstrike after the now defunct cs 15
recommended
nice old game 
recommended
best call of duty community simulator with old outdated graphics so far
recommended
one of the best fps games ever made d
recommended
back in high school i used to live and die by this game  then got a girlfriend and my gaming time diminished to an almost nonexistent level for a couple of years and i just fell away from cs still it was great fun ran a clan competed in ogl team matches etc great game especially if you get a group of friends together to run with
recommended
it has 13 years since it came out and a lot of people still play it as you can see gameplay is more important than graphics

bralgh
recommended
love this game
recommended
where it all started
recommended
this is an interesting game it is incredibly difficult to rate it either yes or no there are far too many points to consider counterstrike was released nearly fourteen years ago yet it is still difficult to find an open server it is incredibly fun and can make you laugh or tear your hair out this game can be excellent for fans of strategy games and shooters but its very rare to be able to enjoy it fully unless you play on competitive servers most everyone goes rogue and does not work as a team there are frequent cheaters using programs to increase movement speed look through walls or assist in aiming if you look through the community page many of the posts are pictures of cats or pornography when joining a new game you always feel paranoid about what the server is downloading the community can be very scary you must play on servers you trust with people you respect if you can do this you will have a blast counterstrike is still played by a huge number of people you can find great servers with great communities in nearly every language imaginable theres a wide variety of weapons to choose from and it is simple to get in on the action there are no paytowin or customization featuresonly action counterstrike can be a fantastic game if you know how to use it properly things to note  there are no bots in cs however the counterstrike condition zero package probably the best way to purchase the game includes condition zero which has support for bots and can be played without an internet connection  this is not 16 to my knowledge there are no shields and a few things are different the difference is negligible however counterstrike condition zero still has these features  this is considered a mod for halflife however it can be downloaded independently note that counterstrike will be saved inside the halflife folder on your computer
recommended
very good game i think more people should be playing it 
recommended
this game ffs the bans are ing dumb jesus banned cuz of to many recent kicked matches  but i was kicked from 1 match at 1 game and i didnt play it for 2 weeks  you valve

recommended
if you pick up this game now you will most probably get wrecked by people who have mastered the game just a warning bloody good game though
recommended
really addictive game with great players
recommended
fifty years later people will remember this game it is timeless just as super smash bros melee is dota12 and starcraft etc at the competitive level no other game tops this as a team based esports fps so many mechanics to learn bhopping ladders russian walks spamming crouch to short hop grenades are 1 pixel width floaty nade physics flashes smokes all these raise the skill ceiling too much to say for what i have experienced try it yourself and goodluck finding the niche gametype you prefer
recommended
its wasting to much of your free time
recommended
my favourite game
recommended
best counter vs terro game
recommended
cant wait for counterstrike 20
recommended
enough said  buy it
recommended
pew pew grew up with this pew pew so i cant say anything bad about it i do think it has aged a bit and that css has preceded it but i also know there are people who think that there aint no better cs than 16 or 15 or 13 well to each his own pew pew with a rough difficulty curve if you come from the casual cod mp crowd you quite possibly will hit a wall straight away but this game is far more rewarding to get into the better you get at it the more enjoyable it gets
recommended
1010 would play again

recommended
ah counterstrike what can i say about you that hasnt been said already by your millions of fans as one of the most popular halflife mods to become into a full retail game by valve i surely can say this counterstrike 16 started it all as an original mod from valves game halflife counterstrike grew increasely popular til this day spawning updated verisons such as source & global offensive even the overly repetitive call of duty has been influenced by counterstrike even thou activisions changed its view after modern warfare 1 but now im getting off topic in conclusion there really is no explaination from me to describe this popular game counterstrikes gameplay explains its self to the community 1010
recommended
the one of my favourite games of all time i played it since 2000 so it was a lot of fun for me to play if u dont have it buy it now ruined my social life too 1110
recommended
great game

one of the best games ever created

awesome game to play still after so many years
recommended
you kill someone they die you get killed you die heart breaking story
recommended
classical if you looking for the basics you should start with this game good community and lots of fun the gameplay is easy but can be repetitive after a few hours but there are so many servers with so many modes that it cant be boring for more than 10 minutes

the only thing ive spent time on cybercafes playing while others where watching porn
recommended
counter strike is the best fps multiplayer actionshooting game i have played till now
recommended
oldschool fps beats all the newer counterstrikes 1010
recommended
gameplay 1010 lan fun 33 good servers 27 counterstrike perhaps the most competitive game of its time hasnt aged well graphicswise but the gameplay remains more precise and consistent than most fps games today this game is a great lan game for gettogethers but otherwise you may have come too late on perhaps one of the greatest games of all time servers that i have connected to show that i have horrible ping and the lag assures me of that i have come across a server or two that i can connect to and enjoy as well as being vanillacs considering all the servers that mainly run modded games which is about 45 of the servers so here are the reasons to buy the original counterstrike pros can run on a potato plays smoothly no matter the settings however you can connect to a server somewhere in latin america or the middle east and lag like heck great fun to play with friends as it can get really competitive but at the same time your friends may not have this ancient gem so this is dependent on the situation solid gameplay nothing else really compares to the precision that went into it over the years large map selection as well as custommaps found all over the internet mods but many are not as good as some of the others you have to dig through garbage to find the fun ones cons very few good servers hard to convince people that dont already know how great this game is to buy it considering its more than a decade old somanysoundfiledownloadsfromservers custom maps are very rarely as balanced as maps packed in with the game verdict if youve got the money and are curious as to what this legendary game is like then it wouldnt be a complete waste but if you are coming here from the latest cs or cod or battlefield without having played other older fps games then you might regret the buy because this is a game that is quite outdated in terms of ui and such and might not be appealing overall 710 now after more than a decade since release
recommended
clasic but outdated game great tacticle gameplay with the best shity graphics this game had a solid decade as the best fps out there and still rates one of the most famous and highest rated and most played fps of all time this game is still fully playable and hella fun although with newer versions of this game out its just outdated 2 point game play 15 point quality 2 point technical 2 point value 2 point fun 9510 i rate the games i play out of 5 points of interest

pew pew grew up with this pew pew so i cant say anything bad about it i do think it has aged a bit and that css has preceded it but i also know there are people who think that there aint no better cs than 16 or 15 or 13 well to each his own pew pew with a rough difficulty curve if you come from the casual cod mp crowd you quite possibly will hit a wall straight away but this game is far more rewarding to get into the better you get at it the more enjoyable it gets
recommended
old but still an amazing game

cs has got to be one of the best fps of all time it really was the game that made gaming what it is today i still remember at high school everyone going to the internet cafe and paying to book out the whole place to just play cs with all our friends a great game which will always be an epic part of fps history

new into cs counterstrike is in well actually counterstrike is a good game incase youre starting new carrier of gaming counterstrike is the best in my opinion before playing counterstrike globle offensive i chose to go in line counterstrike > counterstrike source > counterstrikegloble offensive ive been playing csgo from a pretty long time but i loved counterstrike this counter strike is counter strike 16 so id like to recommend this game
recommended
the best of his kind
recommended
cs 15 or 16 was the birth place for me to be a pc gamer  1010 
recommended
cool game
recommended
counterstrike can join in with golden eye in taking credit for defining the comman fps game as we know it today its servers are still active over a decade of entertainment you customize your gear then choose to either use tactics to disarm the bomb or you can just rush in like an insane person grip the hostages by the arm as you say follow me now and get them to safety it is pure greatness and the system requirements are not demanding so virtualy any computer nowadays can run it
recommended
cool game
recommended
best game in my <3 4ever 
recommended
great game
recommended
simply the best fps game ever  played since 2001 
recommended
best game on world old school 
recommended
alltime classic game will always be my number one counter strike version
recommended
very cool and balanced game superb gameplay and unbelievably good for tournaments once youve played it youll never regret it the only bad thing about this game is the community its full of scrubs lamers scammers spammers and hackers its very hard to find a good and clean from all those dudes server but when you do find it you will forget all about them and will enjoy all your hours of play
recommended
the best and most original fps of all time bow down to what has overtaken over 10 years of my life gg
recommended
the quentissential competitve fps get it you wont regret it unless you suck balls
recommended
rating 1010 the game which basically brought me to the world of gaming from 105 to 16 i have spent enormous number of hours playing this game and even its now getting old and pushed out by csgo i still have nostalgy best nonstory fps at that time and still better than many modern fps moviebased games
recommended
its 16 nuff said
recommended
why did i buy this game in 2014
recommended
same old cs good game one of the best shooters of all time nowadays its graphics seems a little outdated but hl engine still works pretty nice still better and less robotic than csgo
recommended
may be old but still worth it to get it
recommended
wasted almost all of my free time on it when growing up 1110 would play again
recommended
good game no comment  1010
recommended
its just counterstrike i dont know what to say
recommended
the best realism halflife mod as its the one everyone remembers causing incalculable rage in dialup users for years and years if youre bad youre a nub if youre good youre a hacker if youre just mediocre then youre just right
recommended
back in the dayy
recommended
probably this game doesnt need any introduction old and good still played by a large number of gamers on of the best online shooter that was created still remember my first days finding a good version of the game and playing with bots
recommended
ruined my life
recommended
this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games
recommended
every server is spanish or french i can now fluently swear in both languages 910
recommended
still better than call of duty ghosts
recommended
i met a lot of people who slept with my mother 1010
recommended
i never played a better first person shooter graphics doesnt matter for gamer gameplay only
recommended
when you crouch you lift your feet in the air and fall to the ground 1010
recommended
warning  do not buy this game if you do youll never see the sunlight again 
recommended
cs is one of the greatest and undermined games in history it is in my opinion the best game to ever have a crosshair it is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in it starts off with a team trying to kill another team i started playing cs when i noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer i started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks as well as a boom box to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game i wanted to play every chance that i could on my road of cs adventures i encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as i was about playing and that when we did play nobody was good enough so it wasnt a lot of fun then i discovered that i could sign up for a class with dboorn i was overly excited and signed up but with skepticism at how the class was going to be sure enough i was proven wrong we started off by practicing a little bit then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class i made some friends and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course when i play counterstrike the whole world disappears only i the mouse and my teammates remain we are united in a common goal we strive collectively towards an end we all desire each player has a spot to hold they stand ready and waiting eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory thus cs celebrates the unity of man the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence when i play cs i play until my veins pump battery acid and then i play some more cs is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny what destiny might you ask i spoke before of unity and it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family that is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one one machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves not that these small metal objects are actually animate im of course speaking only metaphorically over the course of the years i have increased in skill but i have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player i have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share even if that team is less than ideal i have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the ak the awp the deagle the sands under my feet in d2 or inferno and more importantly the teammates at my side i love them it is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness in conclusion i love cs i love to win i love pushing myself to my physical limits its that feeling that first drove me to the computer for every second that i am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play a thirst that grows as every minute passes by when i am outside sitting at the television or playing sports i had an extraordinary time playing this game and i will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how i used to feel this review may be over this game may be dead but i will never stop playing counerstrike 16
recommended

counter strike is a classic game fun addictive and customizable its incredibly easy to mod texture and map for so you could expect a whole lotta mods pros great gameplay bit of a learning curve but itll become second instinct soon enough servers are still up even for such an old game it still has a whole crapton of servers modding community is great cheap as in really freakin cheap not indie game cheap but still very cheap cons most people who you will play with have been playing for longer than i have been alive expect to get pwned very very often netcode is a  adjusting settings using the console takes a hell of a while people are sometimes way too serious when playing for graphics junkies graphics are pretty damn oldlooking what the hell do you expect its goldsrc while its not a perfect game it still provided me with tons of fun and i love playing it its a bit slower than csgo and the weapons behave differently conclusion if you want a nice classic shooter thats light on the pocket and the computer then this along with halflife should be in your library

the classic the original the first and last of its kind the beginning of a legacy or just hours upon hours of time wasted while your brain controversially shouts to you just one more round the excitement of a firefight is a standard of most firstperson shooters but counterstrike is different the game tries to focus on communication and teamwork coincided with skilled aim and complex maneuvers rather than just freeforall deathmatch game failure to comply with the games train of thought winds you up in the lovely thing we gamers call spectator mode gotta love that although becoming proficient at the game will take a lot longer than most games it is worth the time put into it gamers that are looking for a game that requires teamwork skill time practice and communication will not be disappointed presentation 810 gameplay 1010 graphics 510 sound 6510 difficulty 810 lasting appeal 1010 overall rating 8510

why should i even recommend this game to anyone new to this if they get their asses kicked by the real counterstrike professionals who have been playing this little bad boy since it was released i think theyre the only ones who actually play this game anymore its not even played in many esports tournaments anymore since there are newer games out there sad tho

this is a good game if you like fps shooters
recommended
all time favourite game till this day
recommended
addictive
recommended
yes  this is awsome game

recommended
very nice game 
recommended
great game i started with source and felt that this was going to be a downgrade after playing for about four minutes i learned how competitive the game was i learned i wasnt good at the game and trained for once that was something i had never done on counterstrike source now its time to talk about the bad things first of all although there are more servers than tfc has there is still hardly any servers you can find a server and join it but most of the servers have custom maps and free guns obviously the graphics are a downgrade but who plays games for graphics i sure as hell dont and for the year 2000 the graphics are great there is a misconception with this game where people think that bunnyhopping is still in the game its not they removed it in 14 and it is now 16 overall buy this game
recommended
i love counter strike i have played it since my cousin nickname mafia al capone showed me i now have played counter strike off and on for about 8 years now keep it going valve and steam
recommended
if your computer is a toaster this game is for you while challenging you can still pick up and play this game despite the assumption that youre 10 times worse than literally everyone else
recommended
the first and possibly the best counter stirke over a decade later and still thousands play it a day other than nintendo nobody has been able to master something like this as well as it is here with a huge install base small game but wonderful gameplay this is worth your $10
recommended
i really like th1s game
recommended
game even if not played by as many people as before not played at tournaments and releasing updated version of it still has this something that surely would catch eyes of many people interested in that sort of games dynamic gameplay and not too bad graphic are for sure advantages of cs 16
recommended
high community game simple and easy shooting 
recommended
a pretty good fps poorly to graphics compared to counterstrike source or global offensive i recommend

recommended
the first counterstrike game that started it all amazing game and also tacticle at the same time

its the best game ever people who say that it sucks they are just noobs who cant even kill a weak bot this is very great game even if it is very old game people prefer to play it instead of csgo or css anyways this is one of my favourite games
recommended
best oldschool game i love it d
recommended
good game rofl
recommended
my fav and best game till now d <3
recommended
first game i played competetive enjoyed good watching the professionals play
recommended
very fun game graphics are disappointing and just not nice i personally live in israel israel has a lot of multiplayer servers and their sons loads admit most enjoyable so it makes up for the graphics  also has the option to fight against bots you can practice with it or simply pass the time i wish there was such a nice single player so in short if you are looking for a game with many indians multiplayer servers easy and fun then this is the game for you
recommended

the first time ive played counterstrike i remember i was just 11 years old back in 2001 since then it had me nailed its just so awesome you come home turn on your teamspeak  ventrilo form a party play 5v5 just for fun train and become better step by step for anyone new to actionshooter genre i highly recommend playing counterstrike its just a musthave
recommended
great
recommended
well i guess since i have 117 hours clocked into this game cough cough steam bug cough cough i am obligated to write a review for this game so this game is most definetly timeless as it is basically super smash bros melee to counterstrikesourcecounterstrike global offensives super smash bros brawl this game is unique as when you die you dont respawn until the next round meaning that your team can lose by having all of its members die as well you need to buy your weapons or take them from the bodies of your enemies instead of just finding them scattered across the battlefield like other games of its time did today the game can seem a bit outdated with a lack of ragdoll physics making aerial deaths look weird and unnatural as well as the obvious outdated graphics which can be fixed with a hd patch that just looks weird and unnatural compaired to games made at the time of the patchs creation 2003 overall i would recommend this game if you buy the retail copy or if they fixed the bug that is the only reason why i have logged 117 hours into the game
recommended
my non steam no lag but steam lag  fos is onni 4 help
recommended
i love itawesome gameplay hard go prop

this game is really fun and i reccomend it to people with computers of any speed and are just looking for a fun fps
recommended
there simply is nothing like this game whether its the nostalgia from years past or the fact that i still have fun playing it 14 years after its release it is one of a kind they will keep releasing newer versions of the game condition zero source global offensive and not that these are not good games they just do not do for me what the original has always done even coming back to the game after not being able to play for years i still find the fun that i had in the very beginning if you are into cutting edge high graphics and realism it probably isnt for you if you have a taste for the classics however then cs 16 is for you

this is a best game  ever

for many the original counterstrike remains the definitive online shooter tens of thousands hop onto servers every day to continue the eternal battle between terrorists and counterterrorists cs is an almost perfectly balanced mix of teamwork and individual skill with enough depth and nuance to inspire countless esports competitions valve have attempted to improve on the formula with counterstrike source and counterstrike global offensive but the original remains the goto choice for online action gamers with top twitch skills

check out those 2 hardcore s on the cover that should tell you all you need to know about the game and what kind of name is counter strike did they name it counter attack and realise that sounded too genreic and decided to name it something off or maybe this game is about the strike of countertops we may never lnow like i said look at those two hardcore gsg9 and gign operators and that should tell you all you need to know money and time sink like the philadelphia experiment only with less government coverups i should be studying ss what is this 010 struck too hard would not counter

theres nothing about counterstrike 16 that hasnt be said already the game will always remain flawless in many gamers eyes throughout the world tactiacl shooter at its finest cs 16 offers not only perfectly balanced matches and good maps but intense sneaking real quick scoping amazing weaponry strategies and so much more it is the easiest game to just pick up and play and it would totaly fit in things any human beings should try atleast once list

recommended
da grafics r bad but dis game is still good
recommended
every counterstrike is a must buy not only are they all really fun but it is really interesting to see the progression of them 16 is the start of the series and i thoroughly recommend looking up and downloading the original beta maps from 1999 like docks as they were originally part of the game although most of them removed due to unfair map design [except docks] cs 16 is a fun game but if you arent interested in playing older games then i wouldnt bother source and global offensive are newer and more replayfriendly games
recommended
old but gold simple mechanics lots of mods and a great game to blow off some steam
recommended
the best
recommended
its my favorite game and the best game

the graphics arent as good at css but im not too upset about that
recommended
spent many years playing this game and it was amazing console commands and the simplistic gameplay makes it a great game mods such as wc3 uwc3 shero make the game half fps half rpg which i loved  however like most fps hackers ruin the game and is probably the main reason for the low population aside from the repetitiveness
recommended
fun fps but there is a high learning curve suprisingly fun after 15 years
recommended
this game is sux i cant quit playing it 
recommended
this is the best game i ever played

after many years of being out by far one of my favorite games ive purchased it many times for myself and friends even tho the graphics are shakey with a decent modern computer and recent hd features this game looks remarkable the physics in this game are remarkable relastic and complicated its a hard game to get a grasp off but now that you cannot just spray at ones head and get head shots this game alongside dota and starcraft were pioneers in online competitive play and this game should recieve high acolades for its contribution to esports

this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games
recommended
every server is spanish or french i can now fluently swear in both languages 910
recommended
still better than call of duty ghosts
recommended
i met a lot of people who slept with my mother 1010
recommended
i never played a better first person shooter graphics doesnt matter for gamer gameplay only
recommended
when you crouch you lift your feet in the air and fall to the ground 1010
recommended
warning  do not buy this game if you do youll never see the sunlight again 
recommended
cs is one of the greatest and undermined games in history it is in my opinion the best game to ever have a crosshair it is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in it starts off with a team trying to kill another team i started playing cs when i noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer i started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks as well as a boom box to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game i wanted to play every chance that i could on my road of cs adventures i encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as i was about playing and that when we did play nobody was good enough so it wasnt a lot of fun then i discovered that i could sign up for a class with dboorn i was overly excited and signed up but with skepticism at how the class was going to be sure enough i was proven wrong we started off by practicing a little bit then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class i made some friends and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course when i play counterstrike the whole world disappears only i the mouse and my teammates remain we are united in a common goal we strive collectively towards an end we all desire each player has a spot to hold they stand ready and waiting eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory thus cs celebrates the unity of man the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence when i play cs i play until my veins pump battery acid and then i play some more cs is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny what destiny might you ask i spoke before of unity and it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family that is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one one machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves not that these small metal objects are actually animate im of course speaking only metaphorically over the course of the years i have increased in skill but i have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player i have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share even if that team is less than ideal i have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the ak the awp the deagle the sands under my feet in d2 or inferno and more importantly the teammates at my side i love them it is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness in conclusion i love cs i love to win i love pushing myself to my physical limits its that feeling that first drove me to the computer for every second that i am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play a thirst that grows as every minute passes by when i am outside sitting at the television or playing sports i had an extraordinary time playing this game and i will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how i used to feel this review may be over this game may be dead but i will never stop playing counerstrike 16
recommended
its aight
recommended
all of those highschool feels

upgraded to mac os x 109 and it broke it the mouse dsnt work anymore ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling

recommended
probably the game that kickstarted the steam success counter strike still is a game of choice of the top worldwide electronic sports leagues and championships with a vibrant and huge community of players and tournaments no one gets called a true gamer until it plays it
recommended
classic game nuff said
recommended
great game no dought about it but if ypur going to play online make sure there is alot of people or it will get bored fast
recommended
a classic from the heyday of quake warcraft 3 and brood wars the game that gave esports a face and a true legend in its own right still rocking 13 years later with one of the biggest communities on steam the one the only counnnnnnterrrstrikkkkkkkeeeeee
recommended
classic superb multyplayer game but till steam the hot air is out is it the servers the players the stupid fanmods i dont know

its old  but still the best game  3
recommended
the best game <3
recommended
a friend of mine just gave me his xbox with a copy of this game i was happy
recommended
best online shooter ive played also because you can mod it for fun this game takes more skill than a multitude of other games and for anyone to ever miss out on this game is doing a complete disservice to onesself note to get the original onscreen multiplayer skins set the game models to not be hd in the video options menu
recommended
all of those highschool feels
recommended
upgraded to mac os x 109 and it broke it the mouse dsnt work anymore ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling 
recommended
nice game addictive as hell and you never will be tired playing this awesome game
recommended
thats game that will never die

4th world graphics with a free spririted romp through illustrious landscapes makes this game a thumb thats shaking around and about to fall off after being shot with a glock so its still there but it hurts so good
recommended
classic

steam is what it is today because of this game 1010

da grafics r bad but dis game is still good

every counterstrike is a must buy not only are they all really fun but it is really interesting to see the progression of them 16 is the start of the series and i thoroughly recommend looking up and downloading the original beta maps from 1999 like docks as they were originally part of the game although most of them removed due to unfair map design [except docks] cs 16 is a fun game but if you arent interested in playing older games then i wouldnt bother source and global offensive are newer and more replayfriendly games

this is one my favorite games of all time everybody should play this game
recommended
this game was saved because of the amx mod x scripting otherwise i believe it would have been dead years ago
recommended
the best for his time  
recommended
this game is massive time killer it manages to be both simple and addictive while having no customization no unlocks no achievements nothing to distract you this game will have tens of thousands of players from all over the world for all eternity those players are generally silent but trolling and griefing is not at all unknown this game is also very well known for cheaters several admins have bizarre rules that only make sense to them on their servers so expect to be banned from a few there are a few popular mods for this game one being the warcraft mod you are generally required to read the notes on how to use these mods but there are plenty of vanilla servers
recommended
one of the most popular online shooters your role affects your team success and your team success affects your role
recommended
in some cases a multiplayer gamecomponent gets just about everything right this is one of those cases
recommended
im gonna let you finish but cs 16 is still the 1 played fps of all time
recommended
the game is ing awsm
recommended
this game is verry good as i am a huge fan of the counter strike series only the bad thing was it took me ages to actualy get the hl1 games to work as of a compatibility glitch
recommended
no life 
recommended
i put probably 5000 hours into this game between the ages of 12 and 14
recommended
classic fps after quake and halflife this was the game that brought pc gaming to mainstream light behind starcraft professional tournaments sponsored by large tech companies was the tip of the iceberg strong communityran servers proved to be invaluable when considering how easy it was to find a place to play without hackers purest first person shooter game i have ever played

the multiplayer fps that started it all might be a old game but its better than cod also even though the graphics are  that doesnt mean the game is instead of picking your loadout you get ingame money to buy weapons from a menu there are no attachments to the weapons there isnt that much to say but its still very good final verdict 1010 classic

i dont need to say anything about this masterpiece csgo has been out for 2 years now as a long time cs fan yes the hours on steam are short but if they logged the data on my game disk there would be at least 3000 hours on it counterstrike 16 just gives me a certain feeling none of the later cs games give me listen if you happen to be reading this because you are thinking of buying it get it it will be one of the most actionpacked amazing $10 youll ever spend
recommended
this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games i am glad that i lived through the golden era of shooters and if id have to rate it itd 1010 ofcourse
recommended
my first game ever` good memories it helps you to play csgo 100000100
recommended

recommended
the original classic at its best

a very well made fps the grand father of csgo it has a lot of bugs indeed but sometimes its cool to play with a bunch of old friends 
recommended
cs go is mother

i havent played too much counterstrike but ive played css csgo and cscz a lot more cscz is basically cs but with bots and i really enjoyed it i got this when i got the counterstrike 1 anthology bundle but mainly played cscz and some dod i decided to try out the original and i loved it id say the only con to this game is the fact that not too many people play it as much as people used to do cs is a great game and will still be one of the best fps shooters ever made 1010
recommended
still better than csgo
recommended
knowledge is power
recommended
let me just get my windows 98 up and my dial up ready so we can play with the new 3dfx card better than software rendering
recommended
ive been playing cs source and go for a while now i bought the valve pack and thought itd be fun the play those games since ive always been a halflife fan ive played it when i was younger and it brings back memories the game is really nice still to this day i love playing new maps do scrims and have fun with my competitive team would recommend although most servers are spanish its still fun if you dont know the language

recommended
oh god i love this game d
recommended
simply the best
recommended
for many the original counterstrike remains the definitive online shooter tens of thousands hop onto servers every day to continue the eternal battle between terrorists and counterterrorists cs is an almost perfectly balanced mix of teamwork and individual skill with enough depth and nuance to inspire countless esports competitions valve have attempted to improve on the formula with counterstrike source and counterstrike global offensive but the original remains the goto choice for online action gamers with top twitch skills
recommended
the game speaks for its self  one ov the alltime best fps games on the planet fact this was the game that got me in to pc gaming meny yrs ago
recommended
old but nice
recommended
jucam un ce se 
recommended
recomendo counter strike 16
recommended
this will serve as a recommendation to all games in the cs series they are all better than call of duty just go get it
recommended
part of my childhood right there playded it on a old  computer for about well over 100 hours 10\10
recommended
i think this game is great it is a old game so the graphics are not as good as some of the newer fps but its a fun game its not a game you would play for hours day after day but it is great for playing when you get bored or to play now and then and i would recommend buying
recommended
great game
recommended
kool love this game grew up on it
recommended
cool
recommended
counterstrike originally a mod for halflife is a game where youre put into the boots of counterterrorists with a objective of stopping the other team the terrorists players can play as counterterrorists or terrorists from killing all of the pedestrians true to the original counterstike mod it uses the goldsrc engine what i did dislike however is that the game is abandoned if more players started playing then this game could be so much better
recommended
this game never gets old the only thing you can improve is your skill 1010
recommended
i cannot play because this  the game waas actived with a product code that is vailid only in a specifig geographic region since you are not currently in that region counter strike is not avaible to play  pls help meeee i already was disable beta updates but nothing 
recommended
despite my hilariously low count of 06 hours on record i can attest to you that nay i have played this gameand its sequels to the ends of time ive literally sunk close to 15000 hours into the various derivations of cs over the years i found out about cs from some irc chat i used to frequent back in the dayit might have been an icq chat with one of them namely i started with the first alphayea not beta alpha i can recall the loading screen and everything from there i progressed through the initial betas introduction of maps and various weaponsanyone remember the old cs_siege complete with working apc and sniper tower etc i then became a player in various leagues i wont name drop but i was a baller at one time so yes this game is good some people recommend csgo as the modern return of 16 but i disagree csgo is better than css yes but still not onpar with 16 nothing will ever be  goodbye wonservers
recommended
how can a game this old still be so fun a great community
recommended
the one and only back when games had simple mechanics and very little nonsense remember when a bullet would go where you actually fired it remember when recoil patterns were easy to understand remember when it was possible to take a game seriously and become ridiculously good at it the counterstrike franchise is very much like super smash bros  they had brawl we had cssource and csgo lets hope valve decides to play a proper homage to this game in the future much like nintendo did with the new smash bros
recommended
it is one of the best fps game available online even today its craze has not ended from a navi player i heard that steam version provides very low lag due to which i purchased the game and for sure i was 100% satisfied you would not believe my ping dropped to 1921 from 2001500
recommended

as with most oldschool multiplayer shooters you will get your ship wrecked without learning some tactics and gaining skill but then the fun sets in it should be noted that this game is alive with plenty of players but most are silent if you want to do more than just play the game

possibly one of the greatest first person shooting games ever made try it out and see how you like it too bad that numerous number of hackers are around these days but not a probem if server admins are present you can try maps like dustdust2 assault or even fy maps like snow and iceworld awp maps are also great if you like scoping and killing opponents with one shot maybe even go for some of the fun surfing maps that are still around lastly fyi it does take some time to find the optimal sensitivity setting that you play the best with

the original counterstrike was one of the most played games of my life ive spent countless hours playing this game from 1999 to the release of counterstrike condition zero i can remember so many things about this game like the old punkbuster antihacking program the transfer from a standalone game to being forced to use steam to play my valve titles the countless hackers using ogc and the amazing community created maps there are more maps weapon skins and character skins released for this game than probably any other game ever made this is truly a classic and will be one of my favorites forever long live counterstrike 16
recommended
just love this game <3 d
recommended
you kill someone they die you get killed you die heart breaking story
recommended
classical if you looking for the basics you should start with this game good community and lots of fun the gameplay is easy but can be repetitive after a few hours but there are so many servers with so many modes that it cant be boring for more than 10 minutes
recommended
it started it all

it used to be a superb game now its just too old to stand simple as that when i was young i had tons of fun with it though 810

the most legendary game of all time it was released in 1999 but players do play in 2015 so the game itself tells alot about it moreover its version r updated about every 4 to 5 years latest is now i think is counter strike global offense  some of the most famous players were markeloffpottyget_rightguardian nd some famous teams were  navi sk gaming etc in india there r teams like nsd who won asian champoinship from 2006 to 2012 till cs go released  it was now suffering from ddos attack in india nd because of that players r shifting to csgo thankyou
recommended
i love this game

recommended
still there is no any game like this one full of fun 
recommended
big up stole 10 years of my life
recommended
this game is very good to play on lowpower pc since it is old and it even can make you better at csgo since the basic gameplay mechanics are extremely similar i use this game as something to do with my adhd hands while listening to music which i find to be great just turn the game sound down and join a deathmatch server
recommended
anyone else feel the need to look through the ironsight or downsights  when playing a cs game

wow this is a game i grew up with and its one of the most popular online firstpersonshooters out there or atleast it used to be the game was everywhere and it had its reasons to this was the game that was seen on the computer screens of the lan parties tournaments and other major computer related events its actionpacked skillbased and it had a huge following even today you may find lots of server filled with players the gameplay surrounds around you and your team if you play the de maps youre a terrorist you must plant the bomb and make sure that the cts wont defuse it and if youre in the ct team you must defuse the bomb before it goes off if you play the cs maps you must rescue the hostages as a ct and if youre on the terrorist team you must keep the hostages heldup and eliminate any ct that tries to stop you any round can also be won by eliminating the opponents this game spawned a franchise and will always be remembered as one of the starting grounds of multiplayer teambased firstpersonshooters the game is from 2000 and is outdated by its succesor global offensive but if youre into old games you should check this out but i highly doubt you havent heard of this game before

that moment of pure passion when your enemys lifeless body slumps to the ground and to the topright of the screen you see your name and feel your score increase you might have played this game for 50 hours or you might have played it for 5000 but it doesnt matter how experienced you are because its all about that moment
recommended
counter strike 16 the game that set the standards of shooters and paved the way for new video games on my old steam account i racked at least 1000 hours on counter strike and counter strike condition zero and all for a good reason because it is probably one of the best team shooters in the world 1010
recommended
almost 7 years of playing this game and still goin on i hope it will not die because of global offensive it will be a good idea to introduce steam achievementstrading cards for it because its a very played game
recommended
playing for 12 years and counting 1010 best fps ever made
recommended

im proudly to say that i played this classic since beta 4 and followed its history to unknow mod to a blockbuster online game and to its downfall csgo it was one of a kind game at the time that featured detailed real weapons and real everyday maps cs i salute you

so the original cs where it all begun great game which made a great series
recommended
cant call yourself a counterstrike player without trying this one out at least once people are still playing it after about 15 years just imagine how much support this game got from the community and how popular it became within the hearts of many players

let me just say one thing who likes to play counterstrike 16 just play as the saying goes spomenite childhood  the game is excellent but other versions of counterstrike is also awesome the very rare i go because i play counterstrike source and other games i advise everyone to play if you have not played in counterstrike 16  that you have not had a childhood  
recommended
i recommend it d
recommended
best emotions have been feeled in this game
recommended
i do believe this was the first fps game i ever played and i remembered i really enjoyed it this was the game who started esport growing with players as heaton get_right etc and you can really tell how it has embarked the industry and media cs is the top esport game in the world there is reasons for that great gameplay voice maps gamemodes servers and many fun things to explore in this old fps game if you want to play serious or just want to have a fun this game has it id recommend to buy it if you want to be apart and feel like you own something that has revolutionize the gaming industry and the esport genre or you could just buy csgo thatll work aswell 
recommended
ya its cool
recommended
still the best competitive fps
recommended
many people in this game have been playing since 1999 and certainly have the skill to prove it this game changed the gaming industry greatly and is of very high quality though ages like anything but a fine wine only get it if you have someone you know that can teach you how to play it otherwise stick with csgo
recommended
1010 best cs game ever
recommended
cs forever 
recommended
i dont think that a reveiw could ever possibly do this game justice regardless of wether youve played any game in the counter strike series before everyone will find something they love in this well populated multiplayer fps be warned people are good at this game
recommended
this game doesnt need a review
recommended
the game

a good fps but i would get source or go first

recommended
yep its the original countre strike be a terrorist or a counter terrorist and shoot points to score beautiful smooth gameplay much better than that crappy source engine updates come up with a good spraypaint logo to reach the bonnus round i like the surf levels as well valve when will you finally listen to the community and make surfing an actual game mode it is a very respectful game for its age and i give it a good score in the end
recommended
nice game  ilkie it so much

recommended
15 years and it still has a somewhat strong multiplayer community thats just enough reason to buy it 1010
recommended
does anybody still play cs
recommended
probably would be better if the playerbase was actually ing english
recommended
boom headshot 5
recommended
play the original that started it all complete with no skin no crates no keys and a whole lot of nostalgia
recommended
the greatest online multiplayer game of all time

its as outdated as the nintendo entertainment system but it will always have a special place in my spleen

screen problems it is sucking up cant put back the screen in original way after it gotten wider no opption at all
recommended
the king of all fps games

best game of all times hope it will have match making system like csgo with a bit better graphics
recommended
ive been played this game all versions since i was a kid this game will always be in my heart forever ive played more than 330  hours before even steam came out played always this after school when i was a kid and i always wanted to go home earlier to play this it feel like now when the new generation has come ive grown away from cs 16 ive tested global and the newer cs and i dont like them its not like before i recommend this game hardly  loads of fun in all ages hours of replay all kind of maps  still graphic looks cool  nice gore you feel overpowered when you have warmed up
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
good game even though it is an older game still has many players 1010 would get quickscoped again
recommended
best fps game of all time
recommended
great game
recommended
let me start off by saying that the counterstrike pack is a standalone product you dont need the original halflife to play this game in the retail package you get a full version of cs as well as team fortress classic opposing force multiplayer and the wanted redemption and firearms mods the entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun but of course the real focus of the retail release is counterstrike there is a singleplayer component to cs and while it provides a good primer this mod is all about online action you basically play a game of cat and mouse with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counterterrorists as a terrorist youre goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages as a counterterrorist its your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the illfated hostages taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory cs is an action lovers dream with games lasting only four or five minutes if that in some cases because unlike halflife one shot to the head can mean instant death cs is the perfect mix between fastaction and realistic damage you cant just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away working as a team is a must and while youre in the game taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killedand fast its the teambased tactics that make cs so fun i cant stress how important it is in this game to act as a team if your team is on the defensive side youll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy if you team is on the offensive side you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well im sure youve seen movies or television show demonstrating this conga line style of infiltration well thats exactly how your team will have to act this creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more itll also keep you from thinking about your school work your job and interaction with your loved ones and often work around the ign offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with cs visually the game will not disappoint while the halflife engine isnt the prettiest beast out there there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available the environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden but not be invisible as in real life the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult but the balance to this is if you cant tell who it is then you probably wont be able to hit him with your gun now if youve purchased sniper rifle you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counterterrorist but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar as good as it is a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating at first but over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming one feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round this takes a little getting used to at first since in most shooters you just run around picking up weapons at your hearts content usually by the time you figured out which guns grenades and armor you were going to take in your early games the bad guys would come over and kill you but a couple of tries later after getting the gist of things youre off in no time the other feature that took some getting used to was the wait and watch feature after you get killed once you sustain a lethal injury you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again  you dont just spawn again and start shooting this actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective but like i mentioned before the rounds are short so you shouldnt have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again not surprisingly the user interface is very halflifeesque gamers who have played halflife or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through the only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the update on the server page firsttime users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of cs not true it actually means update the list of game servers but the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound sure the realistic guns sounds are spot on we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game some levels have lighting and thunder when the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy we were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning in most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on the sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved as it stands now its hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone so how long does the magic last well weve been playing this game for over a year now and we still cant get enough of it are we tired of it hell no were still surprised by how fun this game is this game actually made some of us squeal like little schoolgirls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high on the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor i guess well just have to get them next time in a nutshell if youre looking for the next step in online first person shooters then look no further cs is fast paced intense and satisfyingthis game will not disappoint this is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever and the retail package of cs is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness if you like to play shooters online get this pack
recommended
the best game forever

graphics doesnt matter
recommended

recommended
if u want to learn to play this game all over again after one week break go ahead
recommended
this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games i am glad that i lived through the golden era of shooters and if id have to rate it itd 1010 ofcourse
recommended
the best multiplayer game
recommended
the phantom exterior like fish eggs interior like suicide wrist red i can excerize you this could be you phys ed cheat on your man homie aaaah tried to sneak through the door man cant make it cant make it  stuck door stuck man door stuck door stuck

recommended
i played it for a while died a lot and didnt kill anyone but i had a damn good time doing it
recommended
love this csi remeber for ever
recommended
counterstrike awhh what can i say about this master piece well its one of the best firstperson shooters that have ever been made still today you can find tons of peeople playing online dont be fooled by how many ours ive got playing this game on steam ive played since early 2004 this game is practicaly my childhood lol you cannot compare this game to csgo with modern graphics and  yet both of them are incredible on its way i love the fact that you dont have scope blur when you walk the fact that m4a1 and usp have enough bullets love it i rate it 1510
recommended
old but good

recommended
i love this game
recommended
almost all the games that i have in the library  excellent in a review on counterstrike go i have already stated my opinion
recommended
do i really have to review this game
recommended
ive played this game since i was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever i launch it to this very day over 12 years of endless entertainment no other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than counterstrike 16 has and i doubt no game ever will reason ive only got 38 hours here is because i no longer use the account i originally played cs 16 on func_vehicle is what makes this counter strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world you can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it do i need to say more mods on this game are amazing too there is a mod where you can catch pokemon level them up train them and use their skills call of duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self warcraft mods zombie mods basebuilder and so on there is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles 133710

cs is one of the greatest and undermined games in history it is in my opinion the best game to ever have a crosshair it is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in it starts off with a team trying to kill another team i started playing cs when i noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer i started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks as well as a boom box to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game i wanted to play every chance that i could on my road of cs adventures i encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as i was about playing and that when we did play nobody was good enough so it wasnt a lot of fun then i discovered that i could sign up for a class with dboorn i was overly excited and signed up but with skepticism at how the class was going to be sure enough i was proven wrong we started off by practicing a little bit then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class i made some friends and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course when i play counterstrike the whole world disappears only i the mouse and my teammates remain we are united in a common goal we strive collectively towards an end we all desire each player has a spot to hold they stand ready and waiting eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory thus cs celebrates the unity of man the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence when i play cs i play until my veins pump battery acid and then i play some more cs is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny what destiny might you ask i spoke before of unity and it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family that is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one one machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves not that these small metal objects are actually animate im of course speaking only metaphorically over the course of the years i have increased in skill but i have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player i have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share even if that team is less than ideal i have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the ak the awp the deagle the sands under my feet in d2 or inferno and more importantly the teammates at my side i love them it is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness in conclusion i love cs i love to win i love pushing myself to my physical limits its that feeling that first drove me to the computer for every second that i am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play a thirst that grows as every minute passes by when i am outside sitting at the television or playing sports i had an extraordinary time playing this game and i will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how i used to feel this review may be over this game may be dead but i will never stop playing counerstrike 16

many people in this game have been playing since 1999 and certainly have the skill to prove it this game changed the gaming industry greatly and is of very high quality though ages like anything but a fine wine only get it if you have someone you know that can teach you how to play it otherwise stick with csgo

yep its the original countre strike be a terrorist or a counter terrorist and shoot points to score beautiful smooth gameplay much better than that crappy source engine updates come up with a good spraypaint logo to reach the bonnus round i like the surf levels as well valve when will you finally listen to the community and make surfing an actual game mode it is a very respectful game for its age and i give it a good score in the end

this is the best game of all the cs games the only downside is that it is an outdated game and its not really worth getting into it now if youre barely getting into counterstrike then just go for global offensive its the better choice for the new players

i know what youre thinking did he fire all 7 shots or only 6 well to tell you the truth in all this excitement ive kinda lost track myself but being this a 50 desert eagle the most powerful handgun in the game and it is a oneshot kill with a headshot youve got to ask yourself one question do i feel lucky well do you punk
recommended
its a good game for haters
recommended
its really nice game i know its old but its really still batter than call of duty
recommended
counterstrike set the foundation for online competitive teamplay fps and its still a viable game over 10 years later

one of the best counterstrike games in my opinion dying out but still worth playing
recommended
cs is love cs is life <3

love this game you can play it for 5 mins or 5 hours try hard or barely try it will always be my goto game
recommended
one of the if not the biggest essential to the online fps genre seriously any of the cs games are brilliant but 16 will always be my favorite buy this one if you want to get into the series for its suprisingly thriving community and the basic yet addicting gameplay

let me start off by saying that the counterstrike pack is a standalone product you dont need the original halflife to play this game in the retail package you get a full version of cs as well as team fortress classic opposing force multiplayer and the wanted redemption and firearms mods the entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun but of course the real focus of the retail release is counterstrike there is a singleplayer component to cs and while it provides a good primer this mod is all about online action you basically play a game of cat and mouse with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counterterrorists as a terrorist youre goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages as a counterterrorist its your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the illfated hostages taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory cs is an action lovers dream with games lasting only four or five minutes if that in some cases because unlike halflife one shot to the head can mean instant death cs is the perfect mix between fastaction and realistic damage you cant just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away working as a team is a must and while youre in the game taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killedand fast its the teambased tactics that make cs so fun i cant stress how important it is in this game to act as a team if your team is on the defensive side youll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy if you team is on the offensive side you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well im sure youve seen movies or television show demonstrating this conga line style of infiltration well thats exactly how your team will have to act this creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more itll also keep you from thinking about your school work your job and interaction with your loved ones and often work around the ign offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with cs visually the game will not disappoint while the halflife engine isnt the prettiest beast out there there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available the environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden but not be invisible as in real life the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult but the balance to this is if you cant tell who it is then you probably wont be able to hit him with your gun now if youve purchased sniper rifle you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counterterrorist but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar as good as it is a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating at first but over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming one feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round this takes a little getting used to at first since in most shooters you just run around picking up weapons at your hearts content usually by the time you figured out which guns grenades and armor you were going to take in your early games the bad guys would come over and kill you but a couple of tries later after getting the gist of things youre off in no time the other feature that took some getting used to was the wait and watch feature after you get killed once you sustain a lethal injury you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again  you dont just spawn again and start shooting this actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective but like i mentioned before the rounds are short so you shouldnt have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again not surprisingly the user interface is very halflifeesque gamers who have played halflife or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through the only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the update on the server page firsttime users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of cs not true it actually means update the list of game servers but the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound sure the realistic guns sounds are spot on we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game some levels have lighting and thunder when the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy we were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning in most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on the sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved as it stands now its hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone so how long does the magic last well weve been playing this game for over a year now and we still cant get enough of it are we tired of it hell no were still surprised by how fun this game is this game actually made some of us squeal like little schoolgirls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high on the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor i guess well just have to get them next time in a nutshell if youre looking for the next step in online first person shooters then look no further cs is fast paced intense and satisfyingthis game will not disappoint this is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever and the retail package of cs is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness if you like to play shooters online get this pack

the classic shooter upgraded with modern controls counterstrike was something unseen yet highly needed in the late 90s and early 00s it carried with it the idea that you didnt need a single player story mode to make ripples in the video game industry as future competitors would attempt to reflect all cs needed was an incredible skillbased gameplay with a startoftheart ability to play against players from around the world toss in some alternate gameplay styles to help break up the chance of monotonous moments and throw it all over a large assortment of levels for good measure youll end up with a dish that for years has been best served with a dedicated server and a good group of friends its no wonder that cs gave birth to some of the best online team play the world has ever seen and continues in that tradition to this day if you havent played the original counterstrike yet youre missing a small part of your soul hurry go get it back by quick scoping with an awp down long a on de_dust2

this is by far one of the most fun online shooters ever if not the best ever made and in my opinion the game that pretty much started the genre ive been playing the game off and on since its release and still to this day it never gets old the game runs really good on modern pcs and its really a game that when your doing good you really feel a sense of accomplishment plenty of fun maps to play on plenty of servers to play on plenty of customization options this is one game that you can really taylor to suit your style plenty of user created skins for your weapons that can really make this game look amazing and i still prefer counter strike over counter strike source i dont know call it nostalgia or whatever but there really is something about just good ol counter strike 16 that is just simply magical it truley is a classic in every sense of the word and still is just as enjoyable if not more enjoyable then any online shooter on the market today so glad i got to grow up with this game i would definitley recommend it to any fan of competitive online first person shooters come join the fun

recommended
twas teh game
recommended
this is a great game made in 2000 and still has a reasonably high amount of players definitely recommend buying
recommended
this is still the best fps out there it has not undergone significant changes and therefore remains good and competitive but only on esea coz apparently the valves support for the vac on public servers no longer works since csgo has taken place over the professional scene you know its a dirty strategy for old school players to buy and enter in the csgo world so if you want enjoy this game atm you must spend money and raise your level coz if you plan to play on public servers youll only see lots of cheaters and id lans lol valve should update vac for cs 16

the classic genredefining fps counterstrike may be 16 years old but there are thousands of servers with an overflowing amount of players the difficulty curve is no joke but once you get used to it you never get tired of teabagging dead players after a headshot since it is only multiplayer you get practically infinite replayability 810  a big heavy dose of fun
recommended
this game was my childhood this was litteraly the best fps ever you should get it on sale its wourth it
recommended
ive played it off and on for the past 8 years of my life it is a true classic game and it is still alive the multiplayer community is alive and thriving you wont have to deal with annoying russians depending on if you actually pick a russian server or 8 year old fps kids pick this game up if you love classic fps action with an amazing community

having only played csgo for the past year or so it is really nice to see what that game was rooted off of i now know playing 16 what all the hype about counter strike is and the history behind it 16 for its time period was such a benchmark game really awesome
recommended
great purchase and great experience
recommended
this is the only pc game which i play till to date from the time it was released i am playing this game for past twelve or thirteen years and i am still very much addicted to it the game play is phenomenal highly challenging and had a very realistic feeling during then the recoils are amazing and very realistic this was the only game of its period to have gun recoil the whole game playing skills revolved around the ability to control the guns recoil which was its best feature great game of all times  cheers

this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games i am glad that i lived through the golden era of shooters and if id have to rate it itd 1010 ofcourse
recommended
old but gold

lock n load this is the game that marked an era indeed it did and its not very bad today either in fact some people prefer this than the newest addition to the cs franchise well what do you know it is highly unlikely that you dear reader has never heard about counterstrike in case you havent the gameplay is very simple there are two teams counterterrorists the good guys and the terrorists the bad guys to the general public in addition there are two official gamemodes hostage rescue and defuse in hostage rescue the ts terrorists have captured a few gentlemen and are holding them hostage the cts counterterrorists have to go in and shoot the bad guys and save the day meanwhile the ts have to kill the cts but not the hostages no hurting a hostage will cost you money quite alot of it well almost all of it the second gamemode is called defuse and is the most popular the ts have to plant an explosive device also known as bomb in two select areas of the current map called bombsites they go by the name of a and b respectively the choice of where to plant the bomb is down to personal preference meanwhile the cts have to shoot the ts and defuse the bomb preferably both but the cts will still win the round if all ts are dead if the cts die or run out of time the ts win the rounds last about 5 minutes each and is divided into 30 rounds until map change which is very rare since all the servers just play on de_dust2 in counterstrike you have a money system you start the first round with 800$ which is enough to buy an improved pistol or body armour the winning team will receive a set amount of money while the losing team will recieve notably less once you advance the second round most of your teammates will switch to automatic rifles but investing in submachine guns and shotguns can be a sensible choice albeit not the most popular for some reason mainly becuase you need more skill to master smgs than what is needed for a rifle there is a good amount of weapons to purchase each divided in their own category pistols shotguns smgs rifles machine guns and equipment it is not advisable to buy the most expensive weapon you can buy when you are losing its best to hold on to your money and buy a cheaper option this is commonly known as eco round economic round you might be outgunned but at the start of the next round you will have sufficient funds to buy a better weapon and so on as you can see the gameplay is very simple the communication consist of commands over the radio cover me enemy spotted and the most used fire in the hole you of course have the global and team text chat and normal voice chat using your own microphone once you get into the game you will probably be the first one to die expect that to be outcome of every round yes counterstrike is easy to learn but very difficult to master to make it worse in counterstrike there is no option to play offline with bots this only applies to 16 the first cs so youre probably going to get harassed verbally by your fellow teammates quite ironic dont you think good thing there are many guides in the internet available for you to read about how to improve yourself in cs were almost done here except for a few things the counterstrike community to begin with i wouldnt call it cancerous but the community isnt very friendly or welcoming so to speak if you decide to hide instead of killing the enemies even though theyve outnumbered you your teammates will make great use of their very rude vocabulary or you will get votekicked off the game same thing goes for weapon choice tactic choice etc etc do keep in mind that yelling at someone for something in a video game isnt really a sign of strength more like the opposite if you spend all day screaming at people in a video game you shouldnt take people seriously ignore them or change server also the map rotation on all the servers if the server isnt playing some poorly made custom map you will be playing de_dust2 thats it even though there are more maps even a map called de_dust you will always end up in dust2 few servers play on cs_italy or de_nuke yes dust2 is the most popular map but people play on it so much i could make a fully detailed sketch of it in my head if i was woken up in the middle of the night so in the end if you are looking for a fun shooter that will present you a great challenge look no further gameplay doesnt change much but you will get better and better at it so it never gets boring and its very fast paced what youll need it two minutes and you got yourself a great dose of entertainment also its suprisingly compatible with windows 8 although this was released at the time when windows 98 was the huge hit and it doesnt take up much space really so a low end pc can handle this really good well depends on your graphics card and other stuff but you dont need military grade hardware i hope my review has come to great help in deciding whether you should spen money on this or not thanks for reading counterterrorists win

the best cs in the world
recommended
cs was the very first fps game i was introduced to over 10 years ago omg and ive been in love with it ever since makes me a lil giddy sometimes and compared to the graphics and simulation of todays shooters the quality is pretty  im prepared for some flak but really its like that bottle of wine that has aged and mellowed on the beloved alcohol shelf hicnothing can beat the classics a bottle of the finest chardonnay for this veritable hic shooter and another just for me collapses in drunken stupor
recommended
classick

recommended
best steam game ever
recommended
i love this game
recommended
still the most epic game ever created yes csgo is great and is a definite cs reviver but 16 will forever be the game that ruined our lives commited thousands of hours to 16 15 and all previous iterations started way way back when it was still a mod for hl1 growing up and watching the game grow and turn into what it has become has been a truly great experience this game is still alive and you can still have hundreds of hours of fun on it so give it a go 
recommended

recommended
tis is real classic
recommended
this game is absolutely amazing even though the graphics are not one of the best but still the game gained popularity if you will know how to play counterstrike it will be easy for you to play other games and there is no game like counterstrike  in my opinion that will give you pleasure when you are doing 5 kills and all are headshots and im 100 % sure that this game is a legend
recommended
basically the best competitive fps of all time if you dont already have 10000 hours invested then its probably not worth playing

nice whateva
recommended
ah the beauty of old gaming remains this game is more than just alive and kicking even though its old by now its a nice game which focus more on skill and reflexes than cute graphics and advanced functions if you like fastpaced shooter youll probably like this one too theres lots of mods addons and maps out there since this is an older game which allow people to create their own through 3rdparty software in my opinion that alone make this game awesome
recommended
classic game that will not die
recommended
classic game its great what more can i say 910 everyone should own this
recommended
its like sex for the first time
recommended
a classic multiplayer fps with many different servers for gamemodes such as casual hostage and defuse deathmatch and more the community still lives after 10 years because it is such a great game

counter strike is an first person shooter that was released in the late 90s whats it about well counter strike is an online first person shooter where you either play as an terrorist or an counter terrorist the terrorists objective is to transport a bomb to a bombsite located on each map marked as a or b whilst the counter terrorists main objective is to stop the terrorist force from planting the bomb theres also a gamemode where the terrorists will have hostages and the counter terrorists objective is to rescue the hostages before the time runs out game ends when the counter terrorists has saved all hostages or the terrorists has whiped all counter terrorists is it worth buying since this is an really old game and the graphics are really outdated compared to the games we have today i would still say this game is worth buying the game is over 15 years old but still has a alot of active players and playing with friends make it even better counter strike also has alot of maps mods and other stuff that makes the game better in any way graphics 710 sound 810 gameplay 1010 this review is based on my own opinion and noone elses
recommended
very classic game this is one of my memory from childhood

recommended
amazing game for very fast fps actions 
recommended

recommended
one love shoot in the head
recommended
so this game have poor graphics and its really old but it still awesome this game is based on strategy team work game thats why i love counter strike games yes  almost all fps are based on teamwork but counter strike 16 is special you play just for play no rewards here you can improve your teamwork to play other games for example or you can simply kill players with no reason the community have already sent some funny mods for this game and its currently running in some servers you can join zombie mode deathrun jailbreak repetitive well it depends on you if you play all time in the same map in same gamemode of course is repetitive but if you make pcwteamclan war with your friends in alternated maps the game will never be repetitive
recommended
still the best fps
recommended
may be old but still fun if ya want to play cs go with out the items and just play then ya better get this or source its way more worth it  the graphics suck but the gameplay makes up for it

its nothing like csgo as far as mechanics go i say this because of how you control your character and spray control seems to be very different the ak47 has completely random spray pattern its not consistent however the game itself is good and provides a fair challenge for those who consider themselves to be good at csgo trust me you will struggle at first
recommended
best cs in history what is bad  there is no matchmaking like it is in csgo but still really really great game 
recommended
fun for the 3 seconds of each round im alive for
recommended
best counter strike out there screw css even with csgo i still think cs16 is still the best
recommended
russian and spanish simulator
recommended
this first person shooting game is quite good but the developers might have worked on the bugs its pretty much addictive best for lan gaming less suitable for internet gaming in india
recommended
old school fps game
recommended
its a must have no question asked if you dont own it go to the nearest mirror slap yourself look how stupid you look once youre done with this bad advice i gave you return to your computer & add the game to your steam cart & purchase it right away [dont do tomorrow what can be done today]

the most classic fps game counterstrike is a mod of the legendary halflife by valve even if it was released at 1999 people still play it due to its essential playabillity it contains a lot of different gamemodes and you can easily learn how to play it i recommend it

first game i got on steam played it so much best version of counterstrike no doubt

i heard that when i was made it was a huge succsess and now its still popular d
recommended
this game is a bit old sure but it was revolutionary back in its day the first time i played this i was hooked  both into counterstrike and steam as a whole i love the simple yet complicated gameplay brilliant fastpaced multiplayer action with also singleplayer and coop missions for counterstrike zero lets you experience quite a rush if you enjoy this title be sure to pick up the later cs titles too global offensive and source definitely recommend this to everyone both young and old new and experienced

what a fun game as a single play mania it was a little bit shame to see no bots in counter strike but there were still many servers running so youll have no problem playing it since there were no active asian servers because nexon got hold of asian market with counter strike online i had to play in a brazilian server which made me go through horrible lag but even with the lag it was still enjoyable gear up you can still enjoy the beginning of counter strike series  easy and straightforward game play shoot on sight  optimized aiming

this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games i am glad that i lived through the golden era of shooters and if id have to rate it itd 1010 ofcourse
recommended
simply a classic game nothing will ever match the tension of being the last terrorist on your team and trying to detonate the bomb has it aged well pfft no but if you want to experience what got many people into online shooters then buy it you honestly deserve it unless you have the new counterstrike

 counterstrike   overview  the basic point of the game is to play as terrorists and counter terrorists stopping the terrorists planting bombs is the key feature to this game as terrorists you can plant the bomb or on other maps you can try to stop counter terrorists from saving the hostages  any addons  you can download gun skins and let them be visible to you and you only no dlc for this map because you can make your own custom content this is not easy to do  the community  the community is still live and active so this game is not dead there are still hundreds of 247 servers active on every map and even on custom maps  final rating  i think this game is outstanding 9510 definatly pick it up if you just want to shoot some people 
recommended
what means smurfing

might be the best game ever made in the history of fps shooters 1010

second best game
recommended
nice game 
recommended
the counterstrike series is without a doubt the best fps games of all time
recommended
the hand models animations weapon textures and custom maps all make this game an enjoyable experience oh yeah but just add functional bots so i dont have to download  zbots which are not realistic in any way possible aimbot movement patterns staring contests with enemies although the game is a classic representation of how modernized tactical shooters should be produced the hackers are always going to be there to ruin the fun also some seriously dysfunctional hit detection occurs during most matches also not trying to be too judgemental but the game would have been a lot easier to play if the crosshairs had center dots i say this because source and go have center crosshair dots which make aiming much more persistent 8510 final statement its a damn ugly game but thats what makes it good once modded it can look like it runs on a completely different engine however the detail and missing physics are not present due to the limitations of goldsrcs dated capabilities oh and this game does not deserve to be ran with mods just simple and complex retextures of the weapons provided within the game i would like to tell you that this game is better than source and go but half the community sticks to the newer iterations rather than the original
recommended
time to say goodbye to the grandpa  however it is one of the most popular online games ever
recommended
played better than most of russians then get banned from server 1010 would rek again more russians

based off of the acclaimed halflife mod counterstrike is one of the most beloved fps is recent memory a team based tactical shooter with a simple concept but complex way of using it for any counterstrike collector you have to get the original

oldschool as  best game if you are good at shooting games

old school game she is beautiful but time has passed
recommended
ruined my life
recommended
inventor of the first person tactical shooter genre aka mmorpg also the first known instance of anger came from this game
recommended
this is the game that started it all for me when it was a mod for half life and steam didnt exist those were the days since then the counterstrike franchise has only expanded and has only increased its esports realm the original counterstrike may lack in graphics for todays standards however for its time it was awesome i enjoyed as_ maps like oilrig arctic and various other maps that are no longer in the mainstream csgo scene 1010  sometimes i play this to remember the good times i wouldnt pay more than $250 for this game or buy the valve complete bundle to get this great game and more great valve exclusives
recommended
old but very beautiful game

my most played game ever countless hours played since march 2000 when i first discovered the mod its still a great shooter to this day people talk about how many days played they have in world of warcraft but that probably doesnt come close to what some of us have in cs its hard to imagine that ive played a single franchise for this long and it just doesnt get old 15 years down and probably another 15 in future iterations d2 247

its good i guess

i spent a better part of my childhood playing this game back before steam became the ubiqitious gaming medium read valves moneymaking lovechild for shut up and take my damn money how can i describe this game what one phrase summarizes the ostensive thrust of epic time sink that is counterstrike easy  just one more round and the whirlpool of regret washes over you as dusk turns to dawn and you realize that you didnt study for your freakin biology exam for shame too bad this box isnt large enough to contain my stories of grand lan parties needless to say this was an amazing game though after years passing the humor lies in sadness that the same 13 year olds that i left behind are still playing worse yet theyre being domineered by server admins who are exactly 1 year older i figure a bedtime extension merits you the ability to ban & kick players so yeah before the new cs comes out spend some time acquainting yourself with this fps tour de force
recommended
ive been playing since the days before steam ive spent hours upon hours playing and i still talk to some clanmates from our cal days great times great game
recommended
heres my 12 word review for this beautiful game every time i play this it takes me back to my childhood

been playing it since it came out
recommended
the best action fps game ever made hands down 1010 would play another 1k hours
recommended
better than source

before switching to csgo this was one of the best cs ever 
recommended
wouldnt mind this game if the community wasnt full of wife beater enthusiasts and nazi supporters just sayin
not recommended
ruined my life
recommended
old but very beautiful game
recommended
before there was a call of duty before there was a battlefield before there was a halo there was one multi player fps that reigned supreme because all the new comers migrate to cs go the community is made up of mostly older more mature people

this game ruined my life played beta15 30 hours at a time easily have hours clocked in the 6 digits between versions just not on this steam account stopped going to school stopped eating dropped out

hey there remember all the good old gaming days searching for mix teams joining up with some random dudes playing all night long totally missing some school days here and there then you probably like me played this game countless of hours you know all the default maps better than your first name and have surely tested out thousands of custom maps hundreds of aimmaps hundreds of kzjumping maps warcraft 3 mod a mod to a game that was a mod how ironic zombiemod gungame mod evenly and evilly slaughtered all your friends in deathmatch met thousands of players from all around the world even from africa and pwned unimaginable amounts of hardcore and noobplayers this game will absolutely never die players will keep trying to find and therefor create new servers and the old pcwmixgames are still going to be played in the silent even though the competetive gaming scene has gone over to csgo and thank you scene for doing that this game really needs the cult status in the shadow of newer and more refreshing games let it still be there reminding newer generation of players how the good old times were let all the videos be there on youtube especially of the bigger contests it makes me happy so what is this game all about well it is simple the main theme of the game is either bombplanting terrorists vs bombdefusing counterterrorists hostagerescuemode or save the vipmode a competetive first person shooter game that has immersive actionpacked gameplay all over your screen you will most likely be flashed smoked out shot from far away by a sniper spawnkilled by your sister knifed by your brother exploded by either a bomb or a thrown hegranade or camped to death by a noob sounds good then join in the action you are not just late you are very late

i put counter strike and battlefield as my two favourite online fps games now those two are way too different to say whos better but this is definetly a very fun game that every fan of the franchise needs to try out the fact that it still has a tone of competitive servers make it still a relevent game and as fun to play as its ever been id recommend csgo for higher end machines but if youre playing on a lower end pc like me this is a must have game

after all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that cant be ignored no other shooter is as accessible easy to play simple nor skillful as this it can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64mb portable version for lan parties its all about aim accuracy quick reflexes but does have a strategical element since it is a tactical shooter and theres no respawning this game was a major turning point in the history of fps and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular

this is the original counterstrike game that started the series it started off as a halflife mod made in 1999 and valve got their hands on it to make it standalone im sure a good deal of you guys are familiar with the concept of counterstrike but let me explain there are two official gamemodes in counterstrike you have a gamemode involving bombs and you have a gamemode involving hostages counterterrorists the good guys have to defuse the bombs and rescue the hostages they also have to kill the terrorists the bad guys which is another way for a victory on their side the two factions have different weapons such as counterterrorists having a maverick m4a1 carbine while the terrorists have an ak47 there are six types of weapons in counterstrike you have pistols pistols are the secondary weapon of the game they have decent accuracy a good rate of fire and low damage the next group you have is the shotguns theyre designed for close range combat one is pumpaction while the other is automatic you also have submachine guns which are automatic guns often used for closerange they dont do a whole lot of damage you have automatic rifles such as the ak47 these guns have good accuracy a high rate of fire and moderate damage you have sniper rifles which are the most accurate guns and they are very good at killing theyre not very easy to use at close range though the last group is the machine gun group the machine gun group only has one gun that has a large ammo reserve decent accuracy and a lot of damage some weapons cost a small amount of cash like the pistols but some guns can cost a lot like the awp sniper rifle or the machine gun other advantages include the game has a large community you dont need a good computer to run it the community has made custom maps and gamemodes your skill from other counterstrike games can transfer pretty well the game is simply just fun and addicting its just ten bucks go for it

recommended
i didnt even play this game when i first reviewed it what the  why did i review this counterstrike if you dont know what this game is you should probably slap yourself and stop playing games because this  literally founded multiplayer firstperson shooters okay not founded quake did that first but it sure as hell helped them develop into what they are today while the graphics definitely havent held up to standards today kind of obvious since this game was released in ing 2000 and started development in 1999 this game is still fun why theres a lot more maps in the game and as a result of low graphical quality its a lot easier to run on old systems or just bad systems in general and the gameplay is still just as fun as css or even csgo this game used to still be the 3rd most played game on steam next to team fortress 2   and dota 2 but that changed when csgo actually started to become a good game back in 2013 now theres really only the most dedicated cs players that play this game i dont recommend going into this game unless youre a dedicated cs veteran who wants to relive the history of cs and see what the first game got everyone hyped for this games great im not going to lie its just the learning curve as of right now is steep and that can be good or bad for some people im definitely going to be spending more time in this game in the future just so i can get hours in the game and act like im actually good at counterstrike for once thats about it though
recommended
wins counterstrike source and counterstrike global offensive
recommended
the alpha and omega beginning and the end one of the finest competitive shooters of our time

having only played csgo for the past year or so it is really nice to see what that game was rooted off of i now know playing 16 what all the hype about counter strike is and the history behind it 16 for its time period was such a benchmark game really awesome

i think this game is one of the best games what ever coded in the written history
recommended
honestly it does nothing to explain to the player the concept of accuracy and it ruins the experience how with just a crosshair am i expected to understand the difference between it being a little wider and a little narrower its a fun shooter dont get me wrong but the whole crosshair  is bad and should have been reworked instead of kept in every cs game
not recommended

this fps game should be a example of what a true fps game should be none of perks upgrades none of that only youyour skillsteammates and guns talking about guns then all of them take skill to master because every single gun has its own spray pattern taking look at player count shows that this fps game is much more popular still after all these years than its competetors it is a must buy for someone who wants to play high learning curve strategic first person shooter

albeit being over a decade old its still an amazing game i have played it both non steam and on steam making total number of hours played well over 1500 counter strike does not come with built in game mode like deathmatch hence servers employ amxmodx [amxmodxorg] to create new game modes and modfy game experience of existing ones some of game mode i came across are deathmatch classic half life dm capture the flag a classic mode with each team having a flag and is required to bring opponents flag to their base jailbreak a role play mod where prisoners must find a way to rebel and overthrow guards missile mod choose a missile from missile menu and kill your opponent beware for your opponent has missiles too pokemod pick up pokeballs lying around and choose active pokemon youll get its ability for instance water pokemon give you heath regen while you are in water deathrun a path laid with terrorist controlled traps is awaiting to be crossed by a huge pack of counter terrorists thristy for terrorists blood but if you fall off you die hence deathrun hide n seek although the name says hide n seek hiders dont hide they simply run away and try to out trick seekers in a map skill and experience dependant hiders get an he grenade two flash grenades and a frost grenade while seekers have knives kreedz kz kz mod is a non violent mod where players find their way through curvings and tricks of map by use of strafe bunny hop etc it is a sport type game where players compete for the best times amongst the games several courses super hero mod youll be given a list of heroes to choose from you must choose two of them to get their powers trouble in terrorist town ttt this mod is about a group of terrorists who have traitors among them out to kill everyone whos not a traitor cod there are various classes to select from giving you different abilities including becoming near invisible when wielding a knife zombie escape zombies are infecting everyone around you and you must survive for given time period zombies with hp of over 2000depending of server are coming for your brains if they infect you you become one of them and carry out their mission infect all humans surf mod a fun mod with ramps all over map you must surf these ramps and get kills by perching on a vantage point to get killsor to get killed nightcrawler nightcrawlers are around you totally invisible pay attention on your team mates if one dies you have an idea of where the nightcrawler was at that time all in all it is a very amazing game
