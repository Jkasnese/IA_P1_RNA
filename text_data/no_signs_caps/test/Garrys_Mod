this is garrys mod a video game developed towards those with a creative edge you are able to use a wide variety of tools to construct intricate structures with which you can kill other people for lulz if building isnt your thing you can join screaming children and their feeble attempts to carry out a decent roleplay on the darkrp servers if getting stomped by minges such as myself isnt for you either you can always try singleplayer overall i recommend this game as a result of its unique abstraction however queue adhominem garry newman is one of the least intelligent game developers i have ever come to know of the least intelligent of all time being phil_fish on top of this facepunchcom the games website is run almost entirely by tea drinking monkeys each wearing a tuxedo and holding a glass of fine 67 chateau latour it is indeed possible to get banned for absolutely anything but here is a short list of my favourite reasons  using internet memes  inquiring as to why another user has been banned  posting a joke if you do buy garrys mod do not sign up to facepunch

garrys mod is a sandbox game you have a wide variety of props from various source games depending on which you own and multiple tools at your disposal with these you can build different contraptions make vehicles construct buildings etc as well as all the content included in the game you can find a ton of mods online via the games website or steam workshop you can also makescript your own but the fun doesnt stop there multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely you can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes from hide and seek to role playing there is a huge variety of unique modes to play a few i would recommend are trouble in terrorist town a group of innocent terrorists must work with the detectives to discover who the traitors are and kill them the traitors must take out the innocents preferably without alerting anyone else no one knows who is innocent and who is not making for a sometimes tense experience morbus a group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens or kill them all there are two types of aliens brood aliens and swarm aliens the brood aliens get upgrades and can transform into humans allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one the swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die assuming they were killed by another swarm alien or human these have a melee and ranged attack but no upgrades their role is to weaken the humans and try to kill them the humans have needs every now and then you will have to either sleep eat shower or pee you cannot move during this time so must be wary of those around you in case they are brood aliens overall one of the best game modes a ton of fun especially with friends darkrp darkrp is one of the more casual rp modes in gmod you spawn into the map as a citizen and can choose a job to play as from drug dealers to civil protection there is a wide variety of roles to pick you can go around earning money commit crimes buy and furnish your own house etc great if you find the more serious rp servers to be boring if you plan to buy the game be sure you own counterstrike source too a lot of maps use textures from css and if you do not own it you will see purple and black squares everywhere i spent about 350 hours experiencing this and i would not recommend it overall the game is absolutely brilliant one of the very few that i can keep going back to and not get bored i purchased the game around 4 years ago for 599 and have since put almost 600 hours into it one of the best purchases i have ever made

garrys mod where to start  with a decent amount of hours in this game i can say i am able to write a fair review  when some people see garrys mod they only think about the sand box aspect of the game and nothing else well they do not know garrys mod garrys mod has 100s of amazingly built gamemodes into one game yeah sure sandbox is fun and its a great starting point for a newbie to garrys mod but there is just so much more to offer  gamemodes  sandbox  sandbox is great you get to build whatever you want and upload it so people all across the globe can use it it gets a bit repetitive over time i just wish they added more tools such as precision and stacker to it without having to download a whole entire mod but mods oh that changes sandbox you can be spiderman in a delorean that travels through time from bttf whilst running over a bunch of halo elites and your friend trying to gun you down with a epic sax guy saxaphone that explodes anything in sight  trouble in terrorist town  trouble in terrorist town is a great gamemode that is fan made i have not played much ttt but the parts i have it was really fun yeah its fun playing online with random people at times besides when people scream  rdm   howd you know i was a terrorist    banned by operator  playing with a bunch of friends can be a blast all join a teamspeak server or a giant skype call and you will have a bunch of fun  jailbreak  jailbreak where do i start jailbreak is basically a gamemode where a bunch of prisoners have to either listen and do what the gaurds say and play a bunch of fun games to be the last prisoner alive or you can be a sneaky prisoner and rebell you could sneak out of your cell and sneak into the armory where all the guns are kept then you start a revolution to kill all the gaurds and win the round jailbreak does get a bit sketchy when you join a server and people arent playing right or there is always that gaurd that runs around killing all the prisoners rdm random death match and people saying  recorded   getting admin  but when its played right its a blast  dark rp  oh god i have played a bunch of rp and it really depends on the server you get to choose your job you can buy a house and do whatever you want my friend and i made a drug empire and became loaded we got every car and it was just fun then we had enough of that so we made a gang called the bloods to fight against our rivals the crips we recruited a bunch of people and had a gang war and to be honest it was one of my greatest times in garrys mod dark rp is a pain when you have to explain your self to an admin every two seconds on how you didnt rdm this citizen or how you didnt mean to go back to the place you died but if it runs smooth it is just fun   i hope you enjoyed this reveiw it took about 20 minutes to think up and write so it would be appreaciated if you thumbs up this review  thankkkkkks <3  my rate  9510

amazing game but remember its only as good as the addons you put into it the very basic singleplayer itself is fun but lacking in parts as a sandbox game however this can be fixed by a quick visit to the workshop where you will be able to find virtually any addon you wish do you want to parachute out of a black hawk while quickscoping osama bin laden in the head you can do that do you want to nuke a base made completely out of couches during a slow mo sequence that is also possible there are also many multiplayer servers ranging from sandbox to roleplay to tdm or to trouble in terrorist town virtually every sort of multiplayer experience possible is in this game the multiplayer games have themes like zombie survival or military life and arcade deathmatch however it should also be noted there are many bugs while these bugs are virtually non existant in vanilla singleplayer you will encounter them once you download some addons having many addons will slow down the game load speed if youre on a lowend computer 910

the game known as garrys mod is not a game it is actually a highly effective time travel program which was secretly stolen from the us government by the infamous hacker garry newman the exact purpose of the game is uknown but most agree that by running the program you will be teleported anywhere from 2 hours to 3 days into the future because the program which is known as garrys mod was stolen while it was still unfinished leading to the biggest problem in the program it may randomly crash at any moment the us secretely gave garry amnesty for his crime in return for not telling valve that they had not reimbursed them for using the source engine in the development of the project i advise you to avoid garrys mod entirely because playing it often results in these side effects withdrawl after play major obsession selfneglect selfmutilation typically when the game crashes emotianally distant and sever cravings do not let what happened to me happen to you do not play this game

its gmod how much more do i need to say every single pc gamer everyone on steam knows what it is already and knows how fun it is its important that you buy counter strike source with this game because this game uses its textures and without it everything looks ugly pink and black an amazing game if you want fun multiplayer in amazing gamemodes in great maps download the mods from the workshop and the gamemodesmaps and youll have an amazing multiplayer game that you will spend hours with also remember when you get this game to play trouble in terrorist town ttt  its amazing fun if you havent heard of it which i seriously doubt basicalul there are traitors and the rest are innocent traitors also detectives traitors try to kill everyone else tries to stopkill them everything else its best to figure out on your own every pc gamer should own this i give it a rating of 1010  the multiplayer section of this game is massively populated and you just cant afford to miss this out in your life

are you not sure about buying garrys mod ask yourself these questions 1 do you like playing with people ages 612 on every server 2 do you like constantly having ddos threats from 9 year olds with booters 3 do you like having constant fun on a game that never gets old 4 want to waste your life i do too buy it best game ever with over 1500 hours so far id rate this my favourite game

people talk they say that ten years of progress has been ruined by little kids who watch gay youtube videos by socalled partners and internet celebrities who only play darkrp and shit up the vast mountains of custom content with fnaf saves and brainnumbing sexy dupes they are wrong this has actually improved the games multiplayer experience vastly do you know how fucking hilarious it is to tell a kid they can unlock all of the achievements by telling them to enter unbindall followed by bind x voicerecord and then hearing them rage on the mic quitting the game and then never returning them because you cyberbullied them my friends this is the greatest game ever made
recommended
a world with your creativity at your disposal the game is one of the greatest open sandbox games probably in history and i say that cus its inspired so much creativity both through the youtube gmod community which i am part of and through the world of artwork and just general fun and gaming however i say this based on what gmod has always been now however there are times it barely even works thats thanks to the dreaded 13 update its getting back on its tracks though and can still be used rather well for what ever your purpose or desire worth the buy and worth the time hours of fun with this beauty
recommended
its a mod made by a man named garry garry was no ordinary man he made a mod that mod was called garrys mod you see pretty clever right since this game is in fact a mod and that mod is made by garry he named it garrys mod garrys mod is therefor obviously made by a man named garry but what if this game called garrys mod is not in fact made by a man named garry then what would that mean that he is a man who likes to lie about his name or perhaps he just wants to conceil his identity that might be the answer identity theft is a common thing you know if that is his reasoning behind calling garrys mod then that is indeed pretty clever you can never be too careful these days its like that time when garry bought a teddy bear which he wouldnt confess was meant for himself and said that it was a gift for his niece in spain although he thought to himself that it was a pretty clever lie it really wasnt youre most likely asking yourself how did we end up in this situation well young man that answer is not one youll be hearing about any time soon see you next year

honestly probably the game that got me into most of what i like to do computers pc gaming just almost anything without this i probably wouldnt be a pc player at all the game is overall perfect you can do basically anything you want within the source engines limits and that of your computers hardware and has a very strong player base anything from hide and seek to role playing in a deserted world this game more or less has it all with mods a plenty customizing what your character looks like from almost any game movie tv show ect as long as you or someone modeled it its great fun with friends and just random people overall if you havent even touched this game or tried it i highly recommend you get it because its jack of all trades game and it may help you discover yourself overall 1110

after hundreds of hours and screenshots in gmod i think its time i gave this a more proper review this is a sandbox game in which anything goes want to make a vehicle covered in guns you can do that want to make a goofy screenshot or screenshots you can do that want to mow down scientists with an ak47 you can do that want to use hundreds of addons that add lots of weapons ragdolls tools etc you can do that want to sit down and watch a youtube video in a movie theater with the right maps and addons you can do that want to pose kevin spacey you can do that want to play on a roleplay server and get banned for killing people you can do that want to go to the forums and see a lot of people complaining about fnaf you could do that but i would avoid that bottom line if you want a game where you can just do whatever you want this is the game for you

its okay ive only played a few hours but ill reccomend it

garrys mod garrys mod isnt a game for everyone some will like it and other will hate it but in the end you need to accept it not everyone has the same taste in games im here to talk a little bit about the downside aswel so i will start with that maybe a downsidedislike about the game would be that i heared a couple of friends saying they dont like gmod i asked them why and they all replied with this sentence i watched a youtube video of gmodttt on seananners his gaming channel and it seems so fun playing with your friends but i dont have a group of friends like that that keeps you thinking what is the downside of this game and the answer is in the sentence before the word friends not everyone starts playing gmod with friends most of the people that start playing gmod had totally no friends thats also not a bad way because i started that way and it all worked out for me some of those people that liked the game chose a random server in the servers list and then they go after a couple tries into a good server but some of the others were less fortunate and they went to bad servers with annoying and hatefull people my point here is if you find a server that is worth playing on and make good friends then you will have hours playing the game why you should like the game is because of the many awesome addons also the people on it are very nicethe most you will never get bored if you have nice people around you so thats the first thing you need to do find a good server with awesome people that are always on the server and also dont forget to check if the staff of that server helps you out is friendly etc the many gamemodes are def a like on this game you have ttt murder prophunt and many more trouble in terrorist town in this gamemode you are all terrorists however hidden amoungst you are one or more traitors kill the traitors before they kill you murder  in this gamemode there is a murderer amongst you but like ttt you dont know who to trust or who to kill prop hunt  in this gamemode you can take control of either the hunters or the props and try to see who can survive the longest if youre a prop try to not get caught by the hunters who are out to get you advise you just need to buy it and you will see that im right gmod is an awesome game even if it isnt a real game but a sandbox of many gamemodes and you will make tons of new friends friends that will stay on your side 141213 my first good server with nice friends special thanks to daniel who is one of those friends i hoped this helps you a little bit of making your choice zeus

ooh what does that do  curiosity core portal 2 the good there are so many gamemodes and way to play the you wont be bored in the gamemode department the problem with this however is that if you have a favourite gamemode that isnt trboule in terrorist townttt murder mystery darkrp roleplay or sandbox sandbox then the best of luck finding a local server also with the 198000 items in the workshop to date it makes it the second biggest workshop on steam if youre looking for a particular thing such as charcter modelsskins then you have to sift through a lot of rubbish to find what you want the great the gmod community is huge approaching the likes of l4d2 portal 2 or even getting to the stage of team fortress 2 at least if it werent ftp this means new servers new addons new workshop creations all new each day it is never the same game twice unless you choose it to be of course it is possible to mount games on gmod so long as they run on the source engine even so this means your content from the half life games source portal and l4d series team fortress 2 and many other games are all able to be mounted from the word go and arguably the best thing about gmod is the fact that you can do anything not like most realistic first person shooters which say hop on your bike you can go anywhere you like so long as its in this general direction no if you can think of it then it can be made and yes there are some pretty crazy things out there but that makes it all the more fun the ugly if you have a favourite gamemode which is fairly unknown and obscure then there wont be very many people playing it if you can even connect to the servers also the amount of rubbish in the steam workshop is appauling to be clear they do no give a proper description of their item they make it unoriginal and generally trolly this raises another problem some of the greatest mods for it are lost in all of this but those are just nitpicks the worst thing about this in my opinion is the fact that you need assests from other games to play much of this game you will need couter strike source for ttt half life 2  episodes for darkrp and so on it feels like a newly released game has a glitch in it and the devs make you pay for the patch you can feel cheated and your wallet will feel lighter the verdict gmod by itself is about $10 us the pack that includes css is about $25 us if you would prefer not to have all the errors play ttt use player models from css then i would suggest getting the pack with both of them in it however if you are willing to save x amount of money by going and finding addons which will cover that that will work as well but it will take up more of your time similar games think of a game any game its most likely been covered in garrys mod thats how expansive this is for more reviews check out httpsteamcommunitycomgroupstruereview

garrys mod the most enjoyable and mod filled game on steam garrys mod garrys mod is an amazing game with a good amount of gamemodes and lovely servers you may want to play sandbox and smack around batman or play ttt and rage because you were rdmed gameplay garrys mod does not have a specific type of gameplay ranging from prop hunt to stop it slender however your gameplay can be significantly improved by using the steam workshop and adding items mods garrys mod is a game focused upon the premise of random and fun addons i personally enjoy being a watermelon and firing pizzas from a bazooka garrys mod has an amazing amount of mods including characters and items this is a game focused around its modding community ttt trouble in terrorist town ttt is the most famous gamemode in garrys mod the premise of the game is simple at the begining you are assigned a role you are either an innocent bystander a detective or a traitor however do not worry if you are innocent for this is trouble in terrorist town meaning everybody had guns the innocent and the detectives try to find out who the traitors are while the traitors try to kill them all off the gamemode is fun and server usually will have cool player models or gun the main downside with ttt is rdmers rdm stand for random death match and an rdmer is someone who out of the blue will try to kill you this means an innodetective randomly kills an innodetective or a traitor kills an traitor or an inno just randomly kills someone who is a t this really spoils the gamemode making it unenjoyable at times but usually admins or mods will be on to help you or they will have an option to directly report it to kickban the person sandbox sandbox is where creativity and stupidity flourish sandbox is where you can get all your downloaded mods and just have fun sandbox is just fooling around and having fun it is one of garrys mod most hilarious game modes if you play with the right people singleplayermuliplayer so if your planning on playing sandbox i would recommend playing singleplayer or creating a hamachi or another program to play with a select group of friends if you plan to play other gamemodes i suggest playing multiplayer and trying to find a nice server which you can enjoy rating pros  fun alone or with friends  many gamemodes to enjoy  massive amount of creative and fun mods  overall great community  highly enjoyable cons  rdmers  will end up overloading computer with mods final thoughts garrys mod is a must buy with its countless possibilities it may take you a while to find a nice server or the gamemode that is for you but when you find it good times will be waiting the mods are just so amazing that i salute all the mod makers for their effort and allowing me to become a watermelon with a portal gun

this is a mod thats a game it even says it in the title this game literally has no definition the best way i can describe it is that it is a true sandbox game where there are no limits to what you can do  download its $10 for endless possibilities note you must own counter strike source  most valve games or else you will have a lot of missing textures
recommended
total freedom to let your stupid side out very fun to play with friends as well

you can do anything you want in this game there is such a lot of choices of game modes that you will never get bored of it so much choices in the workshop that you can always make this feel like a new game all the gamemodes are so much fun as long as you play with friends making it even more fun

ah garrys mod what is left to be said that has not already been written about this whimsical sprite of a game chances are you have a friend that already plays this and has been telling you play it for a long time its time you took their advice and find out what all the fuss is about its a unique blast of a game that will keep you wating for not only hours but weeks months & years

this would be known as a steam classic if you like to build random and strange things mess with ragdolls enjoy a good rp or maybe killing zombies and terrorists i would recommend this for you games that are recommended so you dont see giant error signs everywhere counterstrike source halflife 2 halflife 2 episode 12 and lost coast for some maps any other valve games when mounted will just give you an enchanced experience as well as more models from those games to  around with

now you may find it interesting that i have so many hours invested into this game you may also find it interesting that i continue to play a game many would view as limited i would certainly say that i have studied this game more than most men would study a new natural element now this is where you ask for my indepth analysis on such a game a thesis on everything i have learned from my experience yet i only have a short few words this game has robbed me of my soul robbed me of my life it has shown me that my life is an empty shell that i fill with fake memories in the form of online gaming and more specifically this game i and all that participate in online gaming as well as garrys mod are currently doing this building fake memories with fake people that are hidden behind a fake setting nameless people behind faceless screens ever changing never moving but the game was okay 810

introduction garrys mod or gmod for short as many know it is a game that doesnt have any boundaries that hinder creativity you dont play to win you play to have fun its pretty difficult to review gmod due to its unique nature and everyones playstyle is different to which i am not excluded from unlike my other reviews i made this concise to make it easier to read but preserving the important details things to do in gmod you can spawn props ragdolls etc to make a scene which can be funny or depicts art download addons from the workshop to fire new weapons explore a map or enhance graphics and even make action scenes by setting off chain explosives or start a firefight among npcs upon being bored with singleplayer you can join an online server and do roleplay survive in a zombie apocalypse and compete with other players there are also tools created by others to help with whatever actions one partakes in gmod improved phototaking management better faceposing the list goes on problems some major issues i encountered was its not easy to play coop and what i mean by that is you only want to play with a couple of friends in an isolated server you have to use evolve to do that or some other method downloading too many addons like i did can make the game sluggish to load and it may take a while for it to load a map moreover if an addon conflicts with another it will crash the game gmod doesnt include all the materials and resources from other valvesource games thus they must be purchased to enjoy the game fully if not errors can occur and they are most abhorred conclusion gmod is a game that everyone must play it is adjustable to anyones preferred method of enjoyment and its hard to not have fun

amazing this started out as simple mod for halflife 2 in 2004 and transformed into a fully modifiable sandbox creation started with only a physics gun balloon gun wheel gun and entity  prop spawner then became much much more as the years went by a true testiment to the powers of community created mods for retail games a show of reason why developers should always allow communities to create more upon their masterpieces bravo valve for allowing garry to do as he pleased with halflife 2 and the source engine
recommended
personally i love this game because of the unlimited things you can do in it you can join servers and make new friends you can make a server and play with your friends and a lot more

recommended
pesonally my favorite game i own you can probably tell this because it says 217 hrs last two weeks  4133 hrs on record garrys mod is a first person sandbox game that has almost no limitations due the to workshop community because of the amount of gamemodes it is almost impossible to get bored of darkrp trouble in terrorist town prop hunt gmod racer gun gaym yes it is spelled like that apoc melon runner just to name a few but do keep in mind if you do not have really fast internet speed or major patients you may not like this game generally when joining servers it takes a while to download all the workshop item skins and textures also to play most gamemodes such as darkrp or apoc the game requires other games such as css or hl2 to play but the textures needed can be downloaded off the internet personally i give this game a 1010 do i think it is worth the price hell yes i would be willing to pay around $40 for this game i would reccomend buying this with keys from a game dealer on steam or buying it during the steam summer sale just because it has dropped all the way down to $250 before as i said erlier this is my favorite game and definantly worth the price get buyin steam community
recommended
just an awesome game made on the source engine  do whatever you want to 
recommended
i can kill anything with anything while looking like anything and doing all this in any map ever the vanilla game is amazing but mods make this game what it is

ive had over 1300 hours in this game id have to say the most fun modes are dark rp and flood this game is definetly worth the $5 it is usually on sale all the time what i would say the worst thing about this game is all the godamn ing squekers that blow my godamn eardrums out does it look like i want to come home from school and babysit a bunch of ing 12 year olds no you should be able to report squekers and maybe theyd get a vac ban from garrys mod or some  idk but anyways you could mute them but i dont really want to take 15 seconds out of my time to find their ing name and mute them although that is the only issue i wish there were more tutorials within the game that taught you how to make stuff even though i know how to make alot of stuff using wire mod and all that jazz i wish i didnt have to teach my friends everything anways 6910 would play again if there arent in 12 year olds on the server if there are then 010

countless hours have been lost way into the night due to garrys mod and im still finding enjoyment from playing it garry newman may have made the base game but without the wonderful community of creators garrys mod would be nothing an absolute blast with friends i recommend trouble in terrorist town for the most laughs and a general meaty package of worthwhile content
recommended
cried a bit at the end of it
recommended
actually this game is very famous so a review is not that important garrys mods real sense is to simulate physics and to be a sandbox game when you play it like it this i agree that it can be fun but its more fun if you play other gamemodes first of all there is trouble in terrorist town in this gamemode you have to uncover traitors or as a traitor you have to kill the innocents thats a really short describtion but its basically it ttt is a great gamemode to play for several hours at a time secondly there is prophunt in prophunt you have whether to hide as a prop or to find the fake props this gamemode makes a lot of fun as well as ttt last example is deathrun like the name says this gamemode is about to run away from the death or actually to run and avoid the death deathrun is a bit more difficult sometimes and has a decent rate of despair often nevertheless its fun of course all of these gamemodes require friends to play with so if you want to play funny games with your friends and only buy one game then get garrys mod
recommended
garrys mod has countless gamemodes for you and your friends to play i really recomend playing it with friends even without friends there are tons of things to do that make garrys mod an amazing game

tldr ill make a honest review about this game garrys mod is a physics sandbox which means that there arent really any goals in this game but you make your own goals on what you want to achieve in your sandbox they give you enough tools for constructing a bunch of things that come up from your mind like rockets vehicles catapults robots and a lot of crazy things this game isnt really all about imagination or constructing things theres also many unique and fun multiplayer gamemodes to play such as trouble in terrorist town prop hunt hide and seek cinema darkrp elevator source and many more some gamemodes require a game to avoid missingerror textures but that doesnt mean you need to buy the required game you can download game files and place it in the garrysmod folder but however i still recommend buying the games one of my favourite features about this game is the workshop where you can subscribe to many different addons and gamemodes i also highly suggest you dont download too much addons as it can lag the game and sometimes break it another thing i like about this game is that you can make posters and screenshots of ragdoll poses which can be also fun the best thing about this game is that its worth your money buying this game pay once and have hours of fun the thing is that i didnt buy the game myself but a kind and generous person bought it for me when it was in a huge deal i would also like to thank that person for purchasing this game as a gift for me overall i would highly recommend this game if you dont own the game yet and youre reading this please do buy it now if you want to have loads of fun if you cant you dont need to this isnt really related but i felt really shocked anyway a famous youtuber who has made many garrys mod films and shorts by the username of kitty0706 has passed away on 1252015 after 2 years of fighting leukemia and he was one of my favourite youtubers of all time he has inspired me to type all of these i expect a few downvotes but it doesnt really matter as this is how much i love garrys mod if you have read all of these i would like to thank you for using your time im sorry if my review had any gramatical errors but if youre reading this i hope you have a great day

recommended
i think my hours put into this game speaks the loudest its fun addicting and ive made almost all of my friends on it you can spend hours at a time or minutes on it and it fits pretty much anyones busy schedule high replay value and definitely worth the iffy price the community has a huge influence on the game and although the graphics are terrible who really plays a game for the graphics some of the best games ive ever played have had awful graphics but that doesnt mean they are trash games the creative can flourish here with more gamemodes than you can shake a stick at with endless scenarios and possibilities

this game  if you do not have it  sell all you have  but buy this game  and stop reading reviews and buy this game now d

ever since garrys mod 11 came out i was sticked to the computer screen since then gaming have never been the same to me in the good way garrys mod made my creativity explode in my mind because i had so many oppertunities everything from the weirdest tf2 content to amazing machineries and artworks dupes saves maps weapons everything imaginable can either be made or found on the workshop even with amazing gamemodes the only thing i have encountered as a problem yet is crashes which is easy fix i most certainly recomend this game to everyone

from ttt to darkrp garrys mod is the one game that you can really do anything with sort of realistic graphics want to play a zombie survival gamemode done want to do a survival gamemodelike minecraft and rust but just smaller done the point im trying to get across is that when you buy this game you can technically call it buying a bunch of games to me this is just the kickoff point of the game games like murder and slender are fairly new gamemodeoh and dont forget the workshop the community is great which is actually where you install some of the game modes also the classic sandbox mode is a great way to get used to the game from the workshop i can spawn in a dubstep gun in sandbox mode and spawn in a few npcs to test it on so anyhow if you are looking for a game with a wide choice of playing choose this game you wont regret it

garrys mod what can i say in my opinion a great game that allows you to do what you want to designate his own target in the game and build a variety of strange and interesting buildings because the game has no main objective the game has a lot of different games modes so everyone can find something for everyone it has a lot of interesting modifications in the workshop steam created by the players in my opinion the game is really interesting and cool graphics which have created on the source engine the game gives me really a lot of fun in boring evenings i would recommend to anyone who is looking for a really nice atmosphere created by the players and of course fun ^_^ my rating 1010
recommended
you just need to know 1 thing  get this game and dont look back  you make it  you create it  you play it  easy to use gui and nice feel to the campaigns those have made  huge community and creativity some servers are egh 12yr old admins but beyond that fun game modes  have a blast with the friends or scare one another in some intense gamesgamemodes
recommended
a brillient game of creation imagination and utter fun i have played gmod the most as i loved playing it my way you can create anything to your imagination like your own gamemode a car that has lazers on it and erm i better not discribe that evil on my computer screen but in general gmod can inspire alot of games being made to mmorpgs to classic shoot them ups i recommend this if you want to let all those ideas out of your head and express your creativity

garrys mod is one of those games that you have too much fun on and that is not at all a bad thing single player or multiplayer there is always a way to entertain yourself whether its just playing a sandbox game with your friends and making all kinds of kooky contraptions playing on your own a building a scene for a comic screenshot or animation or even getting the pants scared off of you by playing some of the custom horror maps the workshop has to offer not to mention all the fun game modes like trouble in terrorist town murder prop hunt and many more so yes garrys mod is a must play for any gamer who still knows what a game is supposed to be about pure unadulterated fun

to positively review any single aspect of this truely excellent game wouldnt do it justice  garrys mod is what you make of it to me its my creative portal  anything i want built can be built be it a wooden shack or an autonomous aircraft carrier it can be done with some of the amazing things that come from the workshop and formerly garrysmodorg the game knows no bounds when using custom game modes garrys mod can transform into any kind of gameplay experiance imaginable  from the classic freedom of sandbox to the backstabbing drama of trouble in terrorist town to the simulated communities of darkrp and perp to the intense clockrace engineering of floodmod and many many more game modes that simply havent played yet this game holds a special place in my heart

an invigorating sandbox game created with no rules or goals youre able to play garrys mod however you see fit with a large community of modders youre able to download their work directly to your addons library mostly anything is possible with this game mostly just dont get to crazy with the mods you may end up crashing you game or being surprisingly irritated with crazy long error codes spamming your screen other than that if you happen to grab a copy good on you 1010

ive spent numerous hours playing this game and i simply love it its a great game to get together with friends and just joke around and supports great gamemodes 1010

the game that just never gets old garrys mod is amazing even on its own and even after years of running a outdated engine its still an incredibly popular game with many modifications to expand the fun for ever and ever theres soo many addons in the steam workshop to ensure this is the game youll never get bored of it doesnt need a good computer runs smoothly even on a intel hd 4000 although being an outdated game it cant use up all of the cores on a modern computer making single player quite choppy during intense calculations it also is heavily dependent on a good ping to ensure that online gaming is fun your ping is a important number you need it to be as low as possible for some gamemodes but for some even around 300 is fine garrys mod can be funny and entertaining you can do whatever you want and forever if you have the skills you can build anything you want and then share it with the duplicator to the steam workshop for all your friends and people of the internet to download and spawn in their game id highly recommend this to a friend and already have 1010

have fun with this sandbox gamemostly i recommended you guys to play trouble in terrorist town

yes i know this game is no longer that modern in comparison to other major game series such as call of duty or fifa but i feel that this game deserves all positive reviews none the less so ill get started im going to presume that none of you have ever had sex before why else would you be here sitting in front of your computer reading reviews of a game released in 2006 im also going to presume that at some point in your life you want to have sex but lets be frank here youre probably never get to have it well now thanks to this game you will no longer need to as this game is easily comparable to sex i have owned this game for well over a year now and i have had over 2691 s purely from playing this game the only complaint i have about this game is the fact that there is no way to get physically intimate with this game and the fact it occasionally gets compatibility issues with out of date workshop mods but other than that this is one of the greatest games i have ever played so on that note i shall wrap up this review before i go on to much about how bootylicious this game is or how much of a sex pest this game has made me or the fact i had to replace my computer because my cooling system was so full of  so in conclusion if you dont get this game you will be guaranteed to die a virgin although this game wont change that fact it means you wont be bothered by that fact as playing this game is just as good if not better than sex  so buy this game now or youll never know the true meaning of pleasure

just watch this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvunesopqqafw thats my review on garrys mod
recommended
there is so much fun to be had however it requires friends to play it otherwise you find yourself wandering around in and out of servers with strangers who dont care about you and will kill you the game itself is extremely versatile with so much scope for adaptation and expansion a more simpler easiertonavigate interface would have been prefered but thats my own opinion as a mature gamer for instance there is a lot you have to learn before you can even figure out what you have to do to play this game my advice is find a friend who knows how to play the game or the basics at least and take it from there remember you have to own and have installed any game with the source engine be it halflife2 counter strike source etc there is a bundle on offer at the moment for cs source  garys mod i would recommend this game to everyone who is into roundbased team deathmatches and the like a headset and mic is very advantageous

i gave this game a try

my brain exploded with this game 3 times

garrys modabbreviated gmod is a really really really really open sandbox game garrys mod provides its players with all of the tools to practically do whatever the heck they want when the want to do it in garrys mod you may either choose to play singleplayer and screw around with things or you may play the multiplayer of the game and participate in one of to 100 gametypes to choose from these gamemodes themselves also provide plenty of servers for you to choose from in the sandbox gametype alone the servers can range from being a simple peaceful environments where players can gracefully construct whatever their hearts may desire without harm being brought upon them  to a sandbox server with frequent violent occursions while some players are building  to an extremely hecktic sandbox server where players are fighting for their own lives to even try to build in the innovative darkrp gametype you have servers that can range from realistic goodsporty experiences  to a serious roleplay server where gangsters cower away from the patrolling police instead of jumping out like freaking lunatics  to darkrp servers with very frequent unjustified shootouts random deathmatching spawnkilling and propkilling  to roleplay servers where there is a perfect blend of chaos and serious roleplay  to half life 2 roleplaying servers in which you try to roleplay as a citizen during the combine oppressionthis actually has its own gametype clockwork  to other roleplay servers that include vicious mindless bloodthirsty zombies that come out to try and murder you while you attempt to properly roleplay in a wasteland environment there are also other popular gamemodes such as jailbreak flood zombie survival trouble in terrorist townttt deathrun and prophunt just lying out there waiting for you to join right in and participate in the uniquely fun experiences that each of them has to offer dont think that garrys mod would be a waste of your $10will be less on steam sales because garrys mod will provide you with enough gaming entertainment to last you up to several years the only issue about garrys mod is that some maps in the gamemost of the maps are customly created by players along with some weaponsm9k is a popular custom weapons pack entities snpcsscriptednonplayercharacters or ai that are customly made and vehiclesscars is a popular custom vehicle pack require you to own csscounter strike source httpstoresteampoweredcomapp240 dodsday of defeat source httpstoresteampoweredcomapp300 hl2ep1half life 2 episode 1 httpstoresteampoweredcomapp380 hl2ep2half life 2 episode 2 httpstoresteampoweredcomapp420 tf2team fortress 2 httpstoresteampoweredcomapp440 portal httpstoresteampoweredcomapp400 and portal 2 httpstoresteampoweredcomapp620  in order to see the textures of the corresponding custom files you may still be able to download the textures from these games from the internet without actually purchasing the game itself however all of that mess aside garrys mod is definitely worth your $10 if not even more this game will offer limitless entertainment to just about any age groupsbut please no 8 year olds you will have the world of physics at your fingertips if you purchase this game and that world will be worth everything you put into it it offers you the freedom of using your imagination in order to do whatever the heck you want when you want to do it and all you have to know how to do to make that happen is  well  to know how to do it

with over 1000 hours 1418 as of this review [i even got the 1337 hour mark d] i highly recommend this game tons of replayability games for days communities to be in overall its an amazing purchase for what its worth however a game like this does have its downsides its all minigames unless you want an immersive game to delve into half of the time its in minigames sometimes also communities are gone in a week you join an amazing server and the next thing you know its gone but this is only 30% of the whole game i have spent many an hour to play various gamemodes which pop up frequently if not everyday and each offer hundreds upon hundreds of fun even more with a friend you can even have a roleplay server aka you roleplaying in halflife 2 stalker fallout and even more again this game is a must have its spectacular in everyway even if there are some bad apples but its a good game note  do buy this as a bundle with counterstrike source it saves you a bunch of money also halflife 2 both episodes preferably

recommended
you would not be able to imagine the wide variety of emotions i feel while playing this game in garrys mod the tale starts out with you margaret waking up in a strange city not remembering what has happened in the past the city seems quite empty and quiet despite the constant screams of pain coming from all corners of that area of torture doom and loneliness along the way you help a man garry who seems to be suffering you agree to take him along with you although youre unsure of what to do next you both share a mutual agreement to leave the city along the way you may get jumped by some thugs garry and margaret share about themselves in spite of margaret not knowing much once garry has been informed of her lost memories he says hell help her margaret slowly remembers as they venture parts of the game inside and out of the city she begins to wonder if she wants to remember anymore the game has many fantastic twists itll make you feel very genuine emotions the story and gameplay is spectacular nothing is too predictable and nothing is too overthetop ridiculous everything is so moving and it portrays the growth of garry and margarets relationship perfectly

wow purchased this game around a week ago i believe i loved it until the kids came and jesus are they annoying mic spam  chat spam saying theyre gay and swearing nonstop delaying games and screaming and raging funny is they dont get banned the people that get banned are the ones playing normally and not doing and of the things i mentioned wtf o0 that isnt garrys mod but just ed up admins abusing their power game is ok sometimes could get annoying with people not following the rules and all the bans i still think its a 910 game and should buy it imo its only 1099 for me and thats a cheap price for an amazing game could get very boring by yourself without a mic but with friends it turns into the best game and could kill thousands of hours on it and wouldnt want to get off 910 play darkrp and raid an admins base if you have balls meow has banned you for rdming xd

i love the ability to play in a game where everyone can make everything theres no such thing as a playing wall in this game because someone will just make a new gamemode for you to play i wrote that christmas 2012 ^^ still true to this day  story 1010 you make your own or play in someone elses always new gameplay 1010 depends on the game but that excels still presentation 810 gold source well ok soundtrack x10 none default replayability 910 gets boring sometimes but youll always come back

garrys mod is a mod where you can mess around with models maps and can create almost anything sandbox is where you can explore maps from valve games like team fortress 2 or some fan made ones found within the workshop on steam i usualy play around in this mod a lot and brainstorming ideas to make gmod videos which are very common on youtube or on the fourms gmod videos are very similar to stop motion videos such as nightmare before christmas with a lot of practice work and a huge amount of patience you can create smooth animation which is what i have yet to accomplish tools are very handy for videos such as easy bodygroup which changes the different colors or styles of a model bone merger is useful for tf2 items to properly weld things together face and finger poser is what they are for posing the facial expressions and finger gestures or if you get tired of single player there is a lot of multiplayer with tons of different mods deathrun is where you survive a series of traps murder is where the buystanders have to kill the murderer by collecting clues flood is more for advancd players where they build a boat out of junk and have to take down other peoples boats in a flooded room then you have the classic prop hunt where a group of people disguise themselves as props and the other team has to track them down i have experienced some issues with gmod some of the textures still maintain that purple and black checkered color and some maps have errors and issues youll need to have half life 2 tf2 and counter strike source to have th maps and props appear but sometimes thats not enough i also have no idea if you can favorite random servers cause i have played some fun servers and the completely forgotten what they were managing the addons from downloading content from the workshop can be a real hassle it would be easy if you were ableto create folders to orginize your modles and props like say i made a folder to stash all of my sonic modles into 1 folder another downside would have to be their website where most of the props and other things originated nowadays theyre all out dated and impossible to load into gmod with all of this complicated file dragging and all this other stuff but other than that gmod is fun to play around with and create random snapshots of characters and props if they can make tf2 and left 4 dead 2 free to play why not do the same for this one well than again there is some gory stuff and some sexual stuff that can be thrown into gmod so in other words is it worth a buy yes it is as long as you have most of the content that requires you to be able to play this properly

garrys mod is one of the best sandboxcommunity driven games on pc and possible in gaming if you are going to buy this you should buy css with it since many game modes use those textures in it sandbox mode is nice you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes i would recommend ttt as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in gmod gamemodesactaully it is the engine but eh there are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garrys mod and you will get you 10525 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers a great game with a good community if you know where to look

this game is simply amazing sure it has great gameplay and many different gamemodes for players of all kinds but its even more than that the community is simply amazing the people who play this game are as varied as its gamemodes compared to triple a games where everyone parties up and plays competitively this game puts a whole new spin on the concept of gaming with others imagine you are in a room with three other players in game you all have guns in any other game you would instantly shoot each other some people would rage quit others would cuss and scream into the mic this is not so with garrys mod in this game the people would talk to each other either via text or mics and create their own scenario that has nothing to do with the way the game is meant to be played they would mess around have some laughs and make friends it is no longer simply about the game objectives it is community it is about friendship if nothing more it is about laughs no matter what you look for in a game this game has it all if you want to be competitive you can be though i dont recommend it if you want to laugh and make friends this game is the absolute best in the industry garrys mod simply put is community
recommended
the ultimate physics sandbox game probably the best game of all time i dont even know where to begin just try the game yourself
recommended
everything about this game is glorious not only does it give players the freedom to do whatever they want from both creative and objective standpoints but it encourages people to be interested in programming and game development it is easy to see how hugely it succeeds in this aspect as its community creates an unfathomably massive amount of custom content including entirely new gamemodes prop hunt is my personal favorite the potential this game has to inspire people to be imaginative is huge there is nothing you cant do in it i have spent countless hours building insane things with my friends and i think that has furthered my career in programming thanks to how fun it is to make your own mods thanks to garrys mod i have made countless friends and become a better developer this is the best $10 youll ever spend trust me

for a game that will only run you $999 garrys mod is one of the most popular steam games and the best sandbox game ever to be created in my opinion the game has sold millions of copies and trust me i wouldnt think any game thats so cheap moneywise would sell that many the main point of garrys mod is to build contraptions and make them work these can range from cars to boats to trains to helicopters and a countless amount of things you can do to build these you use props simple models that were taken from existing games speaking of existing games the other main idea is that you collect as many valve games as you can so that you can use its resources in the game to start you off you get quite a lot of stuff from half life 2 such as npcs weapons models from the game and ragdolls my personal favourite category is the hl2 vehicles section where you can spawn usually wrecked car bodies and try and bring them to life with the wheel tool and two thrusters on one side garrys mod also has its own range of premade models such as jet planes railways trains rollercoasters and even has its own mascot gman sometimes building can be easy other times it needs a little bit of perfecting for example to make sure a train doesnt go flying off a track you have to decrease the force of the thruster that makes it go forwards or backwards if youre making a helicopter you might have to resort to using hoverballs which can go ape if youre not careful you would think that building a car is as simple as placing four wheels on a box and making sure the wheels turn the right way when you press a key on your numpad wrong you have to add thrusters on both sides of the car if you want it to turn and not have too much force if you dont want it to drift but its fairly easy once you know how to do it besides sandbox there are also a plethora of other gamemodes one or two of them have you live in a city get a job eat food etc or it could be a simple deathmatch obviously i cant list every single gamemode that exists so lets skip to the next part of this review the graphics are amazing the lighting is up to perfection and everything is just so detailed the water deserves a real praise it is absolutely beautiful the player models are also perfectly detailed and everything is just perfect in general well done garry well done the game was completely made to be multiplayer but you can also go singleplayer if you want to the community obviously varies depending on what gamemode youre playing for example sandbox players can be helpful and can make pretty cool stuff darkrp players can be a little out of order otherwise theyre generally ok overall the online is aok the game has completely realistic audio all of the props have their own material so for example wooden crates obviously sound like wood when they collide with something or when they get hit glass props will shatter like glass metal clangs when it collides if you die you hear a heartmonitor sound that decreases to a long beep if you get killed by an explosive you hear a highpitched sound as if your hearing got damaged when youre underwater the sound is modified to fit exactly that even the voices of other players are changed npcs get voices too though all of the hl2 humans call you gordon since they think youre dr freeman i love how the zombies sound like especially the fast zombie and the manhacks the audio is again up to perfection the controls are really easy to handle you can walk run sprint crouch and jump you can also fly around using the v key this is called noclip and it makes you able to go through almost anything though strangely bullets can still hit you so watch out when you have a contraption going such as a helicopter or car you can control it like an rc toy with your numpad or you can hop in if you added a seat and can drive it the handling of your own contraption depends on what you added and how you modified it other than that everything is great being a game that can be expanded by the many valve games out there it obviously takes every resource from any valve game you have in your steam library and allows you to use it to your taste if you have team fortress 2 you can pose a scout ragdoll in any way you want though some of garrys mod is original such as having its own models otherwise its a real resource user with all the gamemodes maps addons and various other stuff you can add to the game this game shall never end up being defined with the word old though sometimes you can end up not knowing what to build but thats a different story entirely its guaranteed that you can play this game forever garrys mod is the best sandbox ever created as i said earlier most of its features are tuned up to perfection and the game never gets old im still quite new to this game and already ive joined communities about certain servers on the game its definitely a great game in all its might if youre a pc gamer you have to at least try this game especially if youre on steam its one of the most popular steam games and i would completely recommend it to every gamer i meet i love this game so much i cant see who wouldnt

garrys mod has something for everyone with so many gamemodes such as roleplay ttt and just plain sandbox you cant go wrong theres something for everyone in garrys mod i highly recommend it its a fun game with so many possibilites

very silly game

my review of garrys mod singleplayer only what do i know about garrys mod well its a tool for posing making screenshots and showing off screenshots which look to be processed through movie filters often if using the right graphics card a picture can look crisp clean and even outperform source film maker in terms of quality however there is one massive downfall that garrys mod regularly faces this downfall is its addons not that the content is bad a large majority is awesome to say the least but the real downfall is that there seems to be no means of accessing any content you have subscribed to on the workshop sometimes thats what really makes it fall down massively as an example you might be biding your time casually playing around in a different game when suddenly wham a bolt of pure inspiration hits you you happen to have the skill and the addons to make your wildest dreams come true but then you load up garrys mod and check to see if all your mods are there you see that it says no mods found it is more common to find your game unmodded due to errors regarding either the workshop or the game itself and its rather dull without the mods as you have very limited resources to play with even if its a sandbox game truth is the game is still confined to all the items within the source engine these mods allow you to completely bypass this reliance as long as you have the neccessary source textures so youre probably wondering why the hell would someone buy a game thats so plain boring and buggy well let me give you an answer the community there are literally billions of mods for garrys mod that exist as of this current moment in time there is also a random peice of information that i happen to know and its the following at least one thing is submitted to the garrys mod workshop every 05 seconds at least this means that the workshop is still growing even now whilst you are reading this but thats not all thats on offer you have the whole internet at your fingertips trust me google is your friend if you are ready and willing to sift through all the bad stuff and find the huge goldmine of good stuff itll be incredibly enticing to buy garrys mod overall id say yes to reccommending this game but id attempt to get it at a discounted price from somewhere its not bad but its not exactly value for money either

garrys mod a game where you kill water melons and bananas pretend to be friendly and then shoot somebody in a face you may think thats boring thats only one game mode this thing has game modes coming out every year or so its crazy i could log 1000 hours into this by a year if i wished to it is addicting you start you cant stop some game modes get repetetive you dont know anything about this game even the people with 1000 hours probably havent explored all the games full possibilites also this gives you a new code lua mmm gets annoying at times but you can learn it and be a master of creating servers adding items to your server theres darkrp the 2nd most popular game mode roleplay were you can do anything you want in a very urban enviorment 1110 chased somebody around a fruit stall with a knife

with its mixture of gameplay and artistry this game is fun for both the aspiring artist and the man who just wants to have fun as well although it can be a little much to take in at first with all the tutorials tools and maps provided by the community youll get the hang of it in notime and will soon be creating your very own masterpieces the amount of things you can achieve with this game are almost limitless whether it be building a rocket ship or posing a wacky picture gmod has something for everyone

garrys mod is just straight up fun garrys mod takes everything from the great halflife franchise and gives you the power to do whatever you want with it wish to run over a lot of headcrabs and zombies with a jeep that have balloons attached to it done want to set up ragdolls and props then destory it all with all the weapons in your inventory sure this game has no limits and with the new gmod 13 update there is plenty of gamemodes to choose from to play in multiplayer such as trouble in terriost town prophunt zombie survival darkrp hl2rp and of course the classic sandbox gamemode with plenty more with new content being constantly released on the steam workshop made by users for garrys mod it becomes endlessly fun with every click and turn of the mouse definetely a fun game for anyone interested to make some good memories but remember to play the half life series first for maxium enjoyment

what is everyones favorite source sandbox game while garrys mod of course as the name suggests garrys mod was orignially a mod and still is  in some regards the mod was originally created by garry newman with not much more help than the source sdk once the mod reached a certain point of interest among the players so did it over att valve being that valve is very good at taking modmakers under their wings and helping them to reach its full potential  for a cut of the cake of course therefore valve naturally became the publisher of garrys mod and the game could remain the rights and to accumulate profit profit unlike some other notoriginallyvalveprojects such as counterstrike portal and left 4 dead garrys mod actually got to remain an indie game somewhere around here garry founded facepunch studios and released an actual game  garrys mod 10 this time they could charge money for the mod as valve was getting a share of the sales income the game has always been pretty cheap and has been on steam sales at least a billion times so everyone and their cats have this game rightfully so if you have other source games on your steam account you can link them and add some of its content into garrys mod giving even more stuff to balls around with garrys mod is the perfect game if you want to kind of pretend to be a game designer and just play around with the source engine which is an awesome engine for this i might add build your dream dollhouse featuring all your favorite source characters tank gordon freeman terrorist demoman gman etc then blow them into pieces garrys mod 11 a recent free update added even more stuff to the game you can do endless stuff in this game you might want to look up som tutorials or guides on how to use all the different tools and such i never got too deep into garrys mod i dipped my toes in the water and tried the basic stuff everything from just flooding the place with npc to building airborne vehicles i am always amazed about the sheer amount you can do in this game but i will probably never get there myself i am hoping that this game will move on live to see source 2 and to get more stuff ported over to it everyone likes sandbox games you already have this game so why are you still reading go play

garrys mod is the best sandbox game that i have ever played the game is filled with gamemodes maps weapons and gadgets all made by the community installing new content is as easier than ever before with the steam workshop find a mod you want and press a button to download no hassle you can do whatever you want in garrys mod want to build a car powered by thrusters that can fly go ahead want to roleplay in a city run by players sure you can do that too dont like to do any of those things well you can create your own gamemode and map as you see fit my personal favourite gamemode is trouble in terrorist town ttt where players are chosen randomly to be an innocent detective or a traitor the detectives and innocents must find out who the traitors are before they kill everyone with the help of their gadgets this gamemode is a blast with friends and a great example of the shenanigans that occur in garrys mod garrys mod is filled with practically unlimited possibilities this game offers so much content that it is a steal for the price if you dont already own this amazing game i cant recommend it enough a must have for any steam library

we give you the tools and leave you to play im not even sure where to begin with this game its 2014 the youtube is full of your silly or memorable gmod moments and sfmcrafted movies it has become a phenomenon on the internet and not to mention how much of a reliable platform it is for talented programmers and scripters to try out experimentations its a ridiculouslyenriched game with endless possibilities newcomers can either create their own insane world or hop on one of the many gamemodes they find on the internet and enjoy their time its addictive userfriendly simple for the beginners and just what the game nerds need to make a difference although the gaming community is marred by immaturity gmods workshop showcases the presence of an everactive usercontribution factor while sandbox gaming has emerged as being highly popular in the last two decades few games falling under the physics sandbox category can match the openness of gmod

overall this game garrys mod is fun and exiting for all ages one of the best game modes in my opinon is trouble in terriost town also known as ttt there are so many game modes on garrys mod and theyre all uniqe in their own way for me the least fun is sandbox but i reccomend ttt

this is one of a kind game its so unique  unlike other games  which speaking of they have like a point and its gets kinda boring after a while of playing those games but garrys mod is just a whole different story so lets begin with the things you can do with this game tons of mods such as ttt  its so fun unqiue idea  and its really amazing made out of a really simple idea which you can still play for hours and you wont get bored prop hunt  its like hide and seek but for adults  its amazing  it might get boring but youll laugh your  off while playing this smexy mod stop it slender  not so much of a famous mod but its scary  the best of it while playing with friends which also shows that garrys mod can be used in such different genres of mods and games murder  another idea like ttt  but this one i didnt like much but its still fantastic normal sandbox  this one is the original gmod  do what ever the hell you want for the sake of lulz sled build  its also great and quite unique  making your own ideas for a sled become true  all you need is just to think xd roleplay  i dont like much but its great  this mod is used in other games but the best in gmod jailbreak  not so many servers or players playing this but its unique and its also in another games  but its no the best gameplay in gmod so  this game garrys is the best you can buy for 10$ i totally recommend it  its so fun d

garrys mod is one of those games you look at and think wow this is really stupid but then you buy it and you exchange it for your soul this game is addicting mainly the multiplayer portions where you have quite a few minigames each youll invest about a week of gametime into or more or less depending on your taste in games even if you dislike all of the games somehow you can create your own mod or map using the sandbox on either single player or multiplayer this game gives you everything you might want to do in general terms and the only negativity you may recieve may come from unfortunate minor glitches or perhaps being in a messy server otherwise buckle up and have fun

garrys mod is one of the best sandboxcommunity driven games on pc and possible in gaming if you are going to buy this you should buy css with it since many game modes use those textures in it sandbox mode is nice you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes i would recommend ttt as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in gmod gamemodesactaully it is the engine but eh there are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garrys mod and you will get you 10525 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers a great game with a good community if you know where to look

gmod isnt like most games theres no goal to achieve or a quest to follow it consist of complete fun if you and your good friends get together on a server then you could spend hours playing nonstop and have fun the whole time it is completly modfriendly and you can do just about anything youd expect a game like this to cost atleast $20 but its $10 dollars and thats assuming it isnt on sale which is usually $249
recommended
so eh yeah this game is good theres some mods if you whant to call them that that i can recommend city rp is good allthough the pd are op jerkoffs and you wont trust anyone zombie survival is good allthought beeing the first zombie or beeing the first to die is pretty boring 1942 rp is good ppl will lt you do your think unless you walks in to a kos restricted area dark rp havet figured out why i cant make casino machines even though im a casino owner eehlets see oh yes the vietnam war pretty nice same damn map all the time as far as i know zworld afterlife is good reminds most of dayz where you have to salvage and and craft your stuff be wary of players im forgeting something snaps fingers x3 stopitslender is good dont play it very much ey i run head first with a assault rifle in city rp running from the cops so dont call me a coward jailbreak is fun to some extense but the kid warrans are make or break i hope you like this recommendation and gives all mentions above a try hey i had to put up with  music from next door while doing this so i deserve some credits hint the list above is not ranked after my favorite list

probably the best sandbox physics game ive played and it has an extremely active community so you can expect constant and fun mods to play around with my favorite mods as of current has to be the trouble in terrorist town mod and the firearms source 20 mod i also enjoy prophunt and messing around with npcs the only downfall to the game is that not only do the mods take up a lot of valuable harddrive space but playing singleplayer gets lonely very fast i would recommend this to all my friends its a really nice game 810
recommended
honestly its about time i make a review for this this is a sandbox game like no other you can create pretty much anything you could possibly imagine pose ragdolls and well theres just so much there are thousands upon thousands of addons available on the workshop to customize your experience in the game from ragdolls to models to weapons to multiplayer mods and even more addons that may not be in the workshop most of the time ive invested into this game was from making screenshots which i enjoy doing and continue to do others may do the same or build contraptions play multiplayer or just plain messing around get this game download whatever you desire and let your imagination roam free highly highly recommended

garrys mod where to start oh yeah its amazing playing privatly with friends is as good as playing with randoms in public only $10s if you dont want errors and missing textures counterstrike source will be a good investment takes them all away 4 an extra $15 more it has the word mod in it and surely does it have a lot of them so many fun mods from twerking to spiderman guns a must buy and if you must wait for its sale $250 they must be out of their minds final verdict do i recommend this game yes anyone who isnt sure if you should spare their time on this it is very addictive and is the best mod 4 halflife 2 ive invested a 260 hours on it and you should too

i dont think a person could write a novel of a review and get this game across to a person so i will just say this my son spawned in a bathtub and it hit us this bathtub needed wheels and maybe a thruster pack so we each built one of these racetubs and did a drag race on a drag track we had made filled with people we spawned in the limits of this game are only that limits you put on it
recommended
hmm garrys mod to start off is a unique game like a game that doesnt need even a bit of mods like why do u need mods if the whole game is like a huge mod xd it is alot of fun just to play sandbox alone spawning tons of zombies then droping a 10x10 concrete block on them  and especially playing something like prop hunt with friends via skype the laughs and giggles xd  priceless the only bad thing is the downloading every server requires some specific file to be downloaded  but if u chose like 23 servers for your favourite game moods  u can play them later without downloading all the stuff again  910 from me d
recommended
i love it i will admit i joined just for ttt or trouble in little terroist town but after i explored the bottomless of other features i just feel in love with it

garrys mod is an awesome game it have many gamemodes to play i had garrys mod for almost a year now and it is still fun to play with friends and other online people 
recommended

recommended
i fail to see the logic in why you have to read this review to know how limitless this game is if a game doesnt have limits then therefore it would be impossible for it not to appeal to anyone im not some extremist with over 1000 hours but i know a great game when i see one is this even a game its like an empire i swear i dont even know how to explain it its just so massive and endless its also really silly sometimes and its always super fun im obsessed with the concept even if my playtime seems to disagree just trust me im fairly certain that it would be impossible to regret buying this game

this so called garrys mod was immensively got popular so fast that everyone well also kids wanted to play it but i felt something different after when i got gmod 13 in a tf2 competition get the most damage than any player while fighting the boss that doesnt die heres my opinions so far positive opinions screenshots what are you waiting for go grab some  in workshop read guides about making good screenshots in singleplayer and loss your motivation xd well i was making screenshots about a year or some months when i got gmod and so far 13 of my planned screenshots have lost motivation or i just got bored theres more than just making screenies and  videos remember kitty0706 and dasboschitt they make gmod videos a long time now and im still impressed of their videos oh and ummm making videos in gmod may take less time than making a long  video in sfm if you want to make videos grab any video maker you want create scenes put special effects like the michael bay explosions all over da videoooo but dont make them out of place gamemodes yep if gmod has only sandbox then it would be pointless but since the users just want to mess up lua to make one good gamemode it will take motivation and time to do those  but not all gamemodes are good some were just awfully made bad if you choose wisely which gamemode you want to play then its your own choice do it murder my favorite gamemode focuses on finding out who is the murderer and filled with paranoia and tense feeling that you would be suprisedstabbed by the murderer unlike ttt where you shoot randomly you have a 13 chance of having a gun or being the murderer and the murderer is fun and requires stealth to be alive lure the others then stab em with the knife if you have the gun as bystander shoot its legs shoot its face shoot its arm he will die instantly negative opinions darkrp and ttt the most absolute iest gamemodes ever made while they got popular so ing fast that kids and minges will tend to ruin the fun out of it hell imagine 12 gangsters raiding the pd without a mob boss theyre like playing cod source heh now for ttt while better than darkrp itself and the good concept some players will just rdm to know whos the traitor then if one innocent kills the traitor another innocent kills the guy who killed the traitor wasent that obvious minges yep minges are a common species of the gmod world mostly kids and angry idiots who want to play gmod his own way instead of playing the game that the server wants mainly in online sandbox ttt and darkrp also they have the fact that they will not stop until they say you stop because theyre butthurt and they dont even know how to play useless  in workshop nearly 90% of the stuff is almost useless and stolen from the original creators while 10% if it is good stuff the 90% of it was useless dupes saves and stolen addons if you want to get the good stuff then dont get the useless stuff these are my opinions about gmod but i will still recommend this because i love making screenies and hanging out with other players but my rating wouldnt make you happy here it is pros you can do what you want in sandbox good for making videos that you want less time 23 gamemodes are almost good cons workshop is now invaded by useless and stolen stuff kids and minges tend to ruin the fun darkrp killed the game requires a another source game for extra content overall score 78100
recommended
what cant be said about this amazing game with its cult status as one of the best sandbox evah its the perfect tool for creating what ever your sick little twisted minds can think of from gmod animations like i do to epic servers like eg 1942 rp prop hunt gmod tower it is one of my fav games i will ever play its amazing addons make it one hell of a game and the replay value is through teh roof 3 buy it but it buy it buy it

garrys mod review  raymond k turcotte ahh garrys mod theres so many different possibilities of fun its endless unfortuatly there is no real story line to it good thing its a sandbox game right in this game you have freedom somehting you dont have in an ordinary game i think thats what makes this game so popular even when you get fed up with the usuall item in the game you could always download add ons to make the game feel like new again i recommend this game
recommended
this game is perfect thats all i have to say
recommended
this is a really good game it started out as a mod for half life 2 but now is a stand alone game funny fun creative and multiplayer get it now

great sandbox game with many gamemodes the only problem is the performance got a slow pc enjoy having low framerates on popular servers also i still miss garrys mod 12 garry needs to work on garrys mod instead of rust if he doesnt make the game even more worse

this is a great sandbox game however it is much more than just a sandbox there are thousands of multiplayer servers spanning different game modes including darkrp zombie surival and parkour dont forget ttt the singleplayer sandbox servers are a great way to let out your creativity besides source film marker of course allowing you to make artwork or videos  movies if you wish all the usergenerated content in the workshop is mostly good another good thing about the ugc is that you can download it into your game via subscribing them if you are considering on buying it i strongly suggest that you do tip as with most other nonfree to play games i suggest that you buy this game during the summer steam sale or steam holiday sale more recently ive found this game to be great for making posters as well but most people would just sfm for that however graphics modifications created by users can increase the quality of garrys mod screenshots and even help you create sfmesque art 1010 highly recommended for when youve some cash
recommended
this game is great although i dont know why noone noticed half life 2 counter strike source and day of defeat source all stole from this game as if they ripped the files straight out of garrys mod valve needs to open their eyes and sue them for this

garrys mod is purely driven by the community the fun i personally found came from the variety of gamemodes and servers that the community offered me ive wasted hour upon hour playing trouble in terrorist town and deathrun along you can be sure to find something you like yourself aside from the community gamemodes it does offer sandbox mode which allows you to use a massive array of interesting tools including ones you can easily download from the workshop to make everything from the most complex of machines to a bath with wheels

i believe this game is the pinnacle of video gaming if you want to watch porn but you want to do it through a crappy movie theateresque setting just join cinema if you want to become a nazi and do nazi like things such as hunt down the enimies of the fhrer then join a nazi role play server if you want to make a house out of pallets and then blow it up with a condom that shoots missiles you entirely can through mods in all 10 out of 10 would bang 9 out of 12 birds agree it is a great game

after more than 3600 hours and over 3 years of lua experience i decided to update this review garrys mod is sandbox game you shouldnt expect anything very big so lets start from workshop on gmod workshop you could find a huge amount of pointless poorly made dupessavesweapons that are just same and same categorya good example could be m9k or fnaf yes you dont get to see anything special very often but if you get to see addon that someone put effort in and didnt used a template author must be experienced most of servers are just s having only coderhire and random workshop addons but if you get to see a server with most of stuff selfmade and without 12years old admins you shouldnt miss it community is filled with 12years oldsespecially on sales thought theyre uncommon on notsopopular servers but if you get to see a good community that doesnt just bans you for smallest mistakes you still shouldnt miss iteven in garrys mod you could meet your worst nightmare 12years old server owner but unlike most of sandbox games garrys mod could be edited to any other game genre a good example could be prophunt where props have to hide from hunters by changing their model to any physics prop they could find also gmod could be a good alternative to sfm since in gmod sandbox you could pose ragdollscharacter bodies to any pose and with specific tools you could really make something really interesting and the final rating is 9510  garry you should listen to your community and stop making money off rustwhich is another story oh before i forget you also need counterstrike source to play most of gamemodesjust to dont see at bunch of blackandpurple checkers or error signs
recommended
many of you may play this game just for the joy of creation or for shootingstabbing npcs all day it doesnt matter if youre reading this buy it now

garrys mod is a spectacular and original game it is probably the most addicting game that i have played so far however like all games there are some downfalls this review will review the ups and downs of garrys mod gameplay 810 the gameplay is probably 100s of hours of fun there are a ton of gamemodes some popular others not so much enough to keep you occupied the objects in the game are however ripped straight from css hl2 tf2 and other games but there are people who make new content in the workshop so you can never get bored from the items in your toybox also i never had to argue with the controls either they are very smooth and fluid graphics 68 the graphics on this game are somewhat outdated however i believe that graphics do not in any way affect the quality of the game these outdated graphics actually somewhat adds to the games personality it adds to the games character the graphics themselves may not be attractive but it does add to the game in ways overall 810 this game is a mustbuy every time
recommended

finally a game that its main purpose is to mod the ever living hell out of it this is the original mod it til it crashes game spawned 500 explosive barrels put it in one room shot them game crashed 1010

recommended
there are so many game types people have created in garrys mod that its impossible to not find something you like there are 3 game modes i currently play and those are trouble in terrorist town prop hunt and murder keep in mind there are tons more but those are the ones i have tried so when someone first got me this game i thought it was a boring sandbox game until this same friend of mine told me that the sandbox is just one little feature there are mods within the mod let me explain trouble in terrorist town ttt because it is an incredibly popular mode in ttt youve got three types of people you can be per round randomly chosen innocent traitor or detective as an innocent you walk around the map with chosen gun that you can pick up from the ground when you spawn there are all kinds of weapons your goal is to not die and find the traitors you cannot kill people randomly without proof that they have done something wrong you can shoot them if they start shooting at you for example or you catch them in the act of shooting someone else its a very social game so you would announce to the lobby to kill this person on sight as they are shooting at me also known as a kos on their player name they are also a traitor if you see them using an item or weapon that regular innocents do not have access to like knives c4 silenced awp silenced pistol and automatic among other things if you kill a traitor you would know if you identified the body of the person you shot which you should always do as an innocent if you came across a dead body you can then say you are proven see the rest of the lobby doesnt know you are innocent you are just as suspiscious as anyone else so on to traitors long story short kill everyone except fellow traitors you can buy special weapons and items like radar to help you using in game credits achieved from killing innocents dont get caught or else the whole lobby is out to get you and that makes winning quite hard on your part sniping helps disguises help and planting c4 explosives when noone is around gives you an advantage being a traitor involves being sly dont be too quiet in game people may think youre a traitor try to change the story a silver tongue will help you ok detectives you are an innocent with more poweryou can get dna off dead bodies to find traitors you can buy health stations radar ammo silenced awp and the like your job is to track the traitors down and thats about it different servers have different things for their ttt but thats just one of the amazing things about this game

recommended
if freedom is your thing this is probably your best bet if newbie friendly is your thing run garrys mod is possibly 1 in endless content if you know what youre doing however its very buggy and this game will crash on you more often than you can say banana and this game is very user content heavy and a mod of halflife 2 in which it needs a 17 player base but 34ths the players you will meet will be little children screaming into the mics and trying to wreck everything you do basically buy it just dont expect anything to work and dont expect to have a good time but you never know you might find a place to be in this game
recommended
with over 200 hours on gmod i think its time i write a review for it this game is absolutely amazing i definitely recommend this for anyone who just wants to have a bit of fun instead of being alll mlg all the time also the best wtf moment simulator out there due to the sheer amount of hilarious things that can happen 1010

garrys mod is a physics sandbox unlike regular games there arent any predefined aims or goals we give you the tools and leave you to play you spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions  whether thats a car a rocket a catapult or something that doesnt have a name yet  thats up to you
recommended
pc master race
recommended
if youre under 13 years old i recommend this game for you
recommended
this game is pretty bad i had to put that i recommend this crap even tho i dont because of the devknights already posted a review and it got downvoted to hell in a second more than 50 dislikes in a day this is why i give this shit a bad review  shit developers took like 2 years to fix a exploit to download serversided files such as servercfg aka get rcon in a second shit workshop addons backdoored so shitty minges can give themselves admin shitty addons overall errors everywhere loading screen to join a server and not see basically everything as an error you gotta enable downloads so get used to download useless shit for each server with an average of 1gb3gb for each server and i hope you like loud shitty dubstep music because since admins have the choice to change the default loading screen to an html file they include a shitty flash mp3 player with of course no pausevolume controls  httpprntscrcom5qgd1u admins autistic children that paid 1 dollar to get admin will annoykickban you for ever shit fanbase autistic children autistic ddosers autistic bad trollers shit framerate seriously if you had like 300 fps on half life 2 you would have like 90 in gmod on a far simpler map aka flatgrass which is just fucking flat ground with a texture yes i played this crap over 1000 hours so what i need feedback to make a review if you wanna buy this game ill give you a hint  dont you are probably gonna rage more than have actual fun
recommended
it is life itself contained into a small core of a game that began as just a simple mod for hl2 and it transformed into the essence and core of life itself
recommended
garrys mod a sandbox game that you can build everything you want for example you can build a trap or a building or a melon launcher or even more you can spawn npcs and create wars or build with your friends or strangers in multiplayer one of the best games i ever played
recommended
drama machine 35 if you have ponyphobia you should play this game
recommended
probably the most fun game i ever played its limitless you can do whatever you want in it and it has many different gamemodes like trouble in terrorist town prop hunt murder melonbomber elevator source zombie survival and many more which are just awesome d you can create things make them explode make and kill zombies kill people and so many other things its a sandbox game that is one of the best of all
recommended
1010 would bang
recommended
this game was pretty much the basis of me becoming more interested in games the same goes for alot of other gamers aswell the wide variety of game modes and addons bring more hours of fun to the game the funnest game modes for me were ttt basewars and minigames which is where i spent the majority of my garrys mod time there are also servers that you can relax on such as the cinema servers and watch what you and those around you are interested in if you have yet to playbuy this game i would really recommend you get this as i would describe it as a necessity for any pc gamer 9510
recommended
games pretty fun if you learn how to script or you nlearn how to make vehicle suspension you know im not lying i have 14000 hours
recommended
i spent a small amount of time playing this game it was good
recommended
best game i played in my live is intertaining and fun when your playing with other people and even when you are offline if intertaining you will never get bored d
recommended
the gift that keeps on giving met so many people on here and have so much fun definately worth it
recommended
the one sandbox game to rule them all
recommended
a truly wonderful game which has almost unlimited possibilities sure there are the fpsstyle modes like ttt but if you just want to play at a much slower pace there are modes such as cinema and sledbuild also if you want to dedicate a lot of time into it you can pose character models from say tf2 and create a stopmotion video garrys mod satisfies a large variety of gamers with its different modes and that makes it something special
recommended
one of the most fun games ive ever played thanks to its high flexibility and modibility^^ first game i thought was worth getting a server
recommended
fun player base and endless possibilities on and off a server
recommended
so i was looking at my list of games most played and it turns out garrys mod is snuggled up there in 2nd place nestled between team conga simulator 2 and civilization vee my old review was so cringe inducing that your face had a high probability of warping inside of itself to avoid reading the  linen words christ why was it so cringy what went through my mind that ultimately led to me vomitting on my keyboard and hitting enter man thats crazy i dont even remember cleaning vomit off of my keyboard maybe that never even happened could i be making all this up was there ever even a keyboard how do we know keyboards even exist what am i typing on a keyboard oh okay i guess they do exist then itd be pretty crazy if they didnt though itd be as crazy as a mouse not existing imagine a world without mice shows like tom and jerry would just be called tom and himself or maybe just tom or it could be called a descent into madness the tomcat tale oh i get it thats why his name is tom because of the word tomcat but then why is jerrys name jerry because it rhymes with berry and its small like a berry or maybe he was named after jerry seinfeld the resemblance is uncanny oh garrys mod yeah its alright
recommended
for those who animate can only do it so with a hint of rubberfruit otherwise no one aint gonna want to watch it
recommended
i dun ner if ewe liek catz butt i liek catz and i sed butt haha butt anehoo u shuld get tiz gaem becuz of the catz and it also haz gunz so it iz liek a call of duty remake and stuff and evere 1 nose call of duty is the best series ever so buy this game
recommended
when i first got this game i thought it was just a game where you build then i realized that its more than just building its also doing a run for the end like deathrun so i realized it was alot better you should buy this game d
recommended
garrys mod is an amazing game where the possibilities are endless the wide variety of gamemodes and fantastic addons make the game even better with an awesome community creating brandnew content 247 i would recommend garrys mod to anyone just looking for a fun new game theres something out there for everyone
recommended
so if you dont know what garrys mod is well its basically a physicssandbox game featuring many different mods and addons across a handful of interesting game modes imagine a world where creation is limited by nothing else but your imagination then sprinkle some annoying little kids and nolife tryhards onto that and walla you have garrys mod a hectic game with an incredibly diverse community the game itself is fantastic that is when its not crashing creating errors or just flat out not cooperating with the steam workshop but when it is working you will never regret spending 10 bucks on this masterpiece if you like building this game is for you if you like first person shooters this game is for you if you like driving this game is for you if you like rpgs the weapon and the game genre this game is for you if you like call of duty go f yourself in conclusion download this game right now
recommended

ive been playing this thing for 9 years now i found amazing friends amazing creations but the important thing is i had great fun last 9 year  5 year pirate was amazing because of this game i hope garrys mod never dies you want to test something play singleplayer you want to laugh like an maniac with your friends hosting server is too easy there is alot of coop and multiplayer mods such as murderer trouble in terrorist townsandbox etc pc gamers say mod it till it breaks well this is why gmod exists in the first place so grab a friend join a server and start rolling amazing10 thank you garry
recommended
one of the funniest time consuming and creative games ive ever played on 
recommended
look at my hours played do i like it
recommended
you can either use this for good or for evil you could build awesome mansions play prop hunt or roleplay or you could make ragdolls do weird poses rdm and prop kill either way is still fun 99966642091110
recommended
this is so cool and ridiculous you can do anything i personally like sending corpses into the air using balloons yep you can do anything
recommended
id recommend this game to all of america north and south id also recommend this game to vin diesle doritos sanic and last but not least michelle obama my love
recommended
i dont think ive ever played a game longer than garrys mod ever since gmod 9 i have been building various interests of the mind and playing so many different gamemodes that this game should be considered multiple games in one although the community isnt as strong today as it was there is no better place to make a server with friends and build random creations to the hearts content or until one of your friends blows your  up i should also mention the better part of the online community now is made up of rpers or people playing trouble in terrorist town
recommended
amazing game always lots of fun
recommended
the only game where there can be a minecraft pig playing tf2 on a portal map with sunglasses
recommended
1010 would play again
recommended
if you have steam garrys mod is a necessity simple as that
recommended
you can play as a watermelon 1010
recommended
this game gives you a choice you can download most of the games needed for it or use addons very fun for multiplayer too just stay of of darkrp thats a hazard
recommended
its an awesome game i recommend buying it with cs source or if you dont have much money to buy both gmod and cs just buy gmod and download cs textures for free so some gamemodes like trouble in terrorist town would work perfectly
recommended
dont get a life buy this
recommended
really great game for everyone
recommended
this game is funny as hell get it
recommended
great game   you can play with your friends  is very funny  they are the mod murder or deathrun or trouble in terrorist town  bunny hop  jailbreak  melonbomber ect  go buy it and go play with your friends 
recommended
i have wasted so much of my life on the great game so should you this game has helped me meet most of my friends i play with to this day i would invest in this game is you were smart
recommended
one of the best games i have ever been brought into its got everything in it anything you love its there so many games to play only bad part is that you need counter strike source to not have errors in most gamemodes this game is definately worth the $25 you spend on it get it try it if you dont like a gamemode go play a different i found some i play for hours upon hours none get boring buy this game
recommended
is good should get plus cssource
recommended
this game is awesome just get this and counter strike source and you set to an amazing addiction i just love this game so much d
recommended
garrys mod is wonderfully made and is a staple for any steam owner the many gamemodes allow you to figure out what you enjoy doing dont like ttt try dark rp dont like dark rp try elevator source theres so many its literally impossible to get bored with this game not to mention many many laughs had in multiplayer i would reccomend the multiplayer more than the singleplayer just because its that much more fun with other people when you start out though just mess around in single player to figure out the controls and such if you get bored with the regular content there are thousands upon thousands of mods to download this is a great game and is getting better all the time
recommended
yees pure and simple best sandbox game ever
recommended

this game or rather this software is a pure gem this sort of gaming creation framework lets your imagination run wild and for people whose primary skills arent designconception many i mean really many excellents crafts made by community build original audacious and generally addictively fun multiplayer gamemodes there are probably more than a 100 mods all are not equal but youre sure to find at least half a dozen mods that will entertain you for dozen hours among my personal favourites prop hunt 1 team incarnate dailylife objects other team has to find and destroy them trouble in terrorist town x terrorists >1 traitor many possibilities melon bomber exhilarating bomberman clone bomber barrel 1 explosive barrel hidden among many infinite spawn has to kill all humans in imparted time killed humains become barrels too deathrun try to run to exit while avoiding traps stranded like rust or dayz stalker one powerful alien against marines team etc some gamemodes even propose some serious aka timeinvesting roleplay all of this juicy thrilling exciting and foremost unique experience for a mere few bucks and its linuxcompatible to boot really what are you waiting for join us in the fun already

while its platform is slow and a bit buggy the shear amount of creativity and freedom garrys mod allows makes possibilities for fun endless one of the best games around in my book 910
recommended
i have over 600 hours and most of my friends play it nuff said
recommended
yes garrys mod got everything for everyone even if you dont like a game mode theres like 1000 other ones so you will almost always find something you like i like trouble in terrorist town the most and it seems like its the most popular gamemode
recommended
im almost certain i wasted a quarter of my life playing this game
recommended
awesome game full of online content never gets boring if you know where to look 
recommended
what i really like about garrys mod is the endless possiablitys of how to kill all npcs may it be with a tank or a bomb either way the this game is full of possiablitys
recommended
garrysmod has been with me since the beginning of 2014 and it has been a great game to play you can go on servers and socialize with others and get to make good friends i had made already 6 new friends this year alone 2014 just playing garrysmod you can also add addons to make the game even more fun for you which you can use in singplayer but also servers might have the addons you have so you can play with others using those fun addons also you can make pacs which mean player appearance customizer using this tool you can make a great appearance for yourself which can wow others also there are gamemodes you can use such as murder which are fun because if it was just only sandbox which is like a gamemode in which you make things and just hangout it would be boring but with these other gamemodes such as murder it makes the game very fun even though there are some downfalls such as people being rude and things just try to ignore it and have fun doing what you want to do
recommended
in this awesome game you can actroleplaybuild its awesome you should buy it
recommended
garrys mod is a very good game with tons of mini games inside when online it is impossible to get bored because there is always a gamemode to play i highley recommend playing it the downside to it is that u have to buy css aswell to get most of the textures and have tf2 downloaded but apart from that and some bugs with addons it is a really good game and you should play it 
recommended
best sandbox game that i have seenplayed  i love when the games can link up fot exaple if you have css you can play ttt if you are going to buy this i recomend you buy css too because of the gamemodes and textures  why to buy creativity mini games fun with friends if you dont have any you can make them in the game  1010 loving it
recommended
this game is amazing you can do anything you can download mods you can get hats you can blow up wallace breen over and over again need i say more this game is so expansive there is always so much to do sure it can lag and crash and you need quite a few things to get it perfect but in the end it is amazing i play it on a subpar pc with craploads of addons to make the game run smoothly and it works overall if you have a brain cell or two you would get this game also have you seen the workshop for this game freaking huge so much cool stuff so yea get this game idiot get it and be amazed

recommended
what do you hate about this game
recommended
garrys mod one of the most fun games i have ever played playing alone garrys mod is a good game as you can meet many people across a variety of different servers and gametypes that want to just mess around and have fun however garrys mod is designed to be played with friends and when you have a group of friends together on a garrys mod server it makes for some memorable moments that will stick with you for quite some time i mean creating a hoboville in a role playing server and starting a revolution as a gang of hobos who have ascended to a full crime syndicate who take over the city and rule under a stinky bugbait fist  is pretty memorable role playing servers are not the only servers though no there are hundreds of gamemodes to choose from on the easy to use server browser and interface in general so you just need to play a little of each see what you like and get some friends on garrys mod gametypes such as prophunt and murder are very popular on youtube at the moment so there is likely to be an influx in players buying garrys mod in sales  where it can drop down to as cheap as 149 $244  overall garrys mod is the ultimate screw around game and if you dont pick it up in a sale you should be sentenced to death by snu snu
recommended
so many different things you could do almost has something for everyone can get a bit boring if you dont like the multiplayer but you always find yourself coming back 6510

garrys mod is possibly the best source engine based sandbox game in history this game has a wonderful community as long as you filter through the crappy ones you can never be bored in this game i am serious their is a vast amount of game modes and still more to come very clean and clear graphics hundreds of maps and game modes my ratings single player  810 multiplayer  610
recommended
garrys mod what can i say a mindless enjoyable game where you are basically god at first it bugged me that i only had 2 maps but then i subscribed to more and i have 4 now i really like that you can be killed by the larger ragdolls realism and when they land from high above there is a seismic wave and everything i dont like that sometimes you spawn in places you werent meant to spawn in after you die because you cant move out of them i also dont like that you get stuck in the ragdolls but it is still a mindless free play that if you learn to like it is awesome like me 3 i definently would say that if youre interested play this game you can do almost anything literally thumbs up for this game
recommended

this game is an open sandbox so you make the game how you want it to be i thought i would share a few points  you dont need a awesome pc to run it  the ragdoll feature is amazing if you dont put them in place propley they might just fly out of the map  the gravity gun from halflife is upgraded to the pypics gun which is also awesome  cars to rideable dogs there are laods of vericals ready to be downloaded with one click  you can also downlode maps gamemodes weapons balls and other things real people have made half way across the world  there is so much fun to have in this game it great there is also a muiltiplayer feature
recommended
highly addictive and fun game with a plethora of gaming modes by buying it you get at least 300 hours of pure awesomeness be it just wandering around killing everyone on sight driving cool vehicles or building up an empire you will absolutely love this game

recommended
this game was pretty much the basis of me becoming more interested in games the same goes for alot of other gamers aswell the wide variety of game modes and addons bring more hours of fun to the game the funnest game modes for me were stranded deathrun and dark rp which is where i spent the majority of my garrys mod time there are also servers that you can relax on such as the cinema servers and watch what you and those around you are interested in if you have yet to playbuy this game i would really recommend you get this as i would describe it as a necessity for any pc gamer
recommended
whilst ive never really seen the appeal of the creator aspects of this game ive had lots of fun playing and trying out the things that other people have created from things like trouble in terrorist town murder and prophunt and to something more crazy like the elevator mod this game is great if you play with friends and whilst it differs from person to person what they enjoy you can find lots of different gamemodes always coming out and it will make sure youll never get bored
recommended
totally a defining game for pc gamers
recommended
just buy it
recommended
this is one of my favorite games on steam hands down
recommended
possibly the best game on steam
recommended
this game is just amazing its an sandbox game which is creative like minecraft but its like fpsshooter game you can build stuff play with friends play horror mode and play some other fun gamemodes here is some popular gamemodes trouble in terrorist town ttt facts traitor role in this gamemode there is 14 traitors depending on how many players there are on the server and how much the server is limited probably most normaly its 3 traitors they need to work and kill the innocents before the time runs out they cant just make a massacare they need to teamwork and silently kill the innocents traitors can buy only traitor items which are useful when it comes to killing surviving and more traitors must kill the person silently otherwise if one innocent see that an traitor killed an innocent the innocent will start to attack the traitor innocent role as an innocent you dont know which to kill and which to not kill and that means you cant trust anyone untill he is proven by killing an traitor but you cant just randomkill people because then you will get banned mostly because you need evidence proof that he is the traitor but you need to make sure you dont kill an innocent person when you think its him the main role for innocents is to survive the round and not make any mistakes detective role when you are detective you are a detective you can buy only detective items like the traitors but detective ones the detective ones gives you an ability to detect stuff and you can buy an health station to regen your innocent comrades but there will be traitors too that is using it you have an special item called dna scanner that is an item that you scan for dna if you see an dead body use the dna scanner to find an figure out who killed him you will see that the dna leads to a person if not the dna got expired or the victim got sniped and didnt leave any dna from the killer so the main role of this is just to figure out who the traitor is but beware the traitors are taking you down first so you need to make sure you dont trust any traitors this game is so worth it my favourite gamemode is the trouble in terrorist town ttt the game is really cheap you should check it out give it an try you will 100% like it
recommended
you will straight away blown away by how much content has been packed into this game and how brilliant the community is it was a genius idea to make a sandbox using the source engine and just the fact that you can have the heavy and gman highfive eachother is awesome some people may not like the bugs but luckily theyre more funny than gamebreaking plus this game never runs out of things to do since it supports modding and online multiplayer 910

garrys mod is great in every way i feakin love this game i simply cant get off it its sooo addicting i mean theres a lot of things you can do in this game like building a car or making pictures and garrys mod videos i would recommend this game you should get it its fun
recommended
garrys mod is a great game with many fun things to do youll probably start out by playing the singleplayer sandbox mode and gradually move onto other gamemodes such as trouble in terrorist town which in my opinion is one of the best when buying garrys mod consider getting the bundle that contains counterstrike source as its used for many textures and models in gamemodes other than sandbox my personal rating is 1010
recommended
i have no idea how to play this is too way hard than sfm
recommended
played this for about 2000 hours what do you think i will say one of the best gamemods out there so many gamemodes too its super awesome and fun sandbox to rp name it and gmod garrys mod got it i would rate this 55 garries

in all honesty the factor that you even have to read the reviews to decide whether or not to purchase this game is suprising to me this is one of if not the most amazing game i have ever played it is quite difficult to explain what this game is but the best i could say is it is a game that works as a basis for games to be created and played on so right now you may be thinking your not a fan of these creator non story line based games but gmod is so much more than that its a community of people who absolutley love to play and create things together it is a community of individuals who enjoy coming together to create something that i have never seen done in a game before and so much more i cant explain every game mode in gmod but let me just throw a few out there one being a little game called trouble in terrorist town probably the most fascinating and enjoyable fps game i have ever played then there is the likes of prop hunt a truely wonderful little game mode that is really one of the first hide n seek type games i have ever seen work well but these are just 2 of the big game modes in garrys mod there are so many other game modes that may not have the same recognititon as the ones i have discussed but have the same wonderful communities this truely is a game where you come together with others in order to just have a good time and enjoy simply playing the game i have never had a game where i have made so many friendships with individuals who simply enjoy the same random little game mode i do to ignore gmod and to blow it off as just another creationgod game is criminal to say the least so if by now you havent already pick up the damn game do it and join in on a one of a kind gaming experience

this game honestly cant truthly be rated as a whole as there are so many gamemodes always out there that it would take so long to try out each one and and gather an opinion on it i do however enjoy this game as there are always new things to try different servers with different things so not even the gamemodes servers themselves the same as it is always changing and when you play the game you can never know what to expect i highly recommend this game the community can be awesome on this game it always depends on the server i hope you all have as much fun as i am

garrys mod is an amazing game no matter how long you play you can always find something new on the workshop to mess around with many mods to try out and game modes furthermore you can use the props and tools to make basically anything there isnt many games where you can place down a portal in front of you and behind you and throw a brick in to the portal the brick then hits you causing you to ragdoll and fly throw the portals continuously 1010 would throw brick in to the portal again

garrys mod is a game where if you took 10 people and asked them about their experience on it you would get 10 different answers the community addons workshop and gamemode you choose to play will determine your experience not to mention the ability to create your own gamemodes addons and community it allows control to finally rest with the player as long as they are willing to learn lua scripting and other forms of basic programming rarely does a game teach me new skills while also imporving old ones and giving me the freedom to do whatever i feel despite the trolls i wouldnt trade being able to run my own server and custom gamemode for anything the schemas for roleplay such as clockwork and nutscript as well are impressive and a well run rp server is the last forefront of serious roleplay on the internet thank you garry for setting the sky as the limit and to valve for allowing us to have all the source engine as our playground

imagine a sandbox but instead of sand you got dolls and guns actually a lot more than those 2 in a better perspective its still a sandbox game without sand and what to put it in the sandbox is in your command the power of lua simply drives this game forward with a lot of gamemodes more than just putting doll in a doll house or rather you becoming a doll having a gun shooting another doll that is your friend orsomeone else in a public game have a crazy random idea about something put it in this game wanted to have a game that does not limit what you can do this is the game want to create 3d animation without a complex expensive software this is the program want to get money by writing a couple lines of code that turns out to be a epic game inside a game this is how you get them garrys mod let you create your own sandbox with 0% mess and its cooler inside the house

this game is awesome but not that kind of awesome i mean as in maybe too much garrys mod is a sandbox game that requires requires your imagination and boy when it says the game will never end they mean it theres so much to do as in almost no limit to know what i mean just get the game though in the past and still sometimes today its created to make entertaining videos it has evolved to become an allout fun game just like minecraft started out as an experiment into well you know i highly recommmend this game to sandbox lovers and shooter lovers alike but just as a tiny negative i have and well seeing as how i love actual goals in games that makes it a game doesnt it i would like garrys mod to have some sort of goal or optional ending to it and seeing how this is technically the trillionth time anyone has asked for a story mode in this game thats pretty much not a big deal anyways i love this game and i highly reccommend it 9510

this game is an open sandbox so you make the game how you want it to be i thought i would share a few points  you dont need a awesome pc to run it  the ragdoll feature is amazing if you dont put them in place propley they might just fly out of the map  the gravity gun from halflife is upgraded to the pypics gun which is also awesome  cars to rideable dogs there are laods of vericals ready to be downloaded with one click  you can also downlode maps gamemodes weapons balls and other things real people have made half way across the world  there is so much fun to have in this game it great there is also a muiltiplayer feature

personal rating 910 what is there to say about garrys mod its a creativity tool for starters it has a wide community ranging from terrorists to homeless people and all in all i have great fun messing around and throwing couches at people the amount of servers and variety here is truly amazing for example one minute you could be roleplaying as a chef in germany switch to another server and boom youre a terrorist the workshop is magnificent too i mean the amount of stuff on there is amazing the only problem i have is i cant play single player seen as though when gmod switched to gmod 13 it changed files so that means you would have to disable then enable all of your addons bit of a problem for me seeing as though i have 25 pages of addons and the amount you get when connecting to servers is huge one last note buy the counter strikegmod pack maybe 90% of maps and props used on servers have counter strike on it the other 10% is half life 2 episode 1 and episode 2 so be careful

garrysmod has been with me since the beginning of 2014 and it has been a great game to play you can go on servers and socialize with others and get to make good friends i had made already 6 new friends this year alone 2014 just playing garrysmod you can also add addons to make the game even more fun for you which you can use in singplayer but also servers might have the addons you have so you can play with others using those fun addons also you can make pacs which mean player appearance customizer using this tool you can make a great appearance for yourself which can wow others also there are gamemodes you can use such as murder which are fun because if it was just only sandbox which is like a gamemode in which you make things and just hangout it would be boring but with these other gamemodes such as murder it makes the game very fun even though there are some downfalls such as people being rude and things just try to ignore it and have fun doing what you want to do

this game is amazing it almost never gets old theres something for everyone like killing hordes of zombies do it like building giant contraptions do it like creating items or weapons for games do it like taking character from different games and putting them together into one scene do it like ultrarealistic graphics to take sweet pictures with do it there is so much you can do with this game that it would be impossible to list them all with just the vanilla game things can get old but thats no reason to go and hate it mods are very easy to find and even easier now with the newly implemented garrys mod workshop on steam which is the only place you can get the game you dont even need to own halflife 2 to play it its built in so its basically an entirely different game all on its own the is singleplayer for when you dont want to run the risk of idiots coming on your server and screwing everything up and theres also multiplayer for when you want to show off your work or play with friends this game is worth much more than it costs get it you will not regret it even if you are into cod plus it doesnt require a very powerful machine to run i believe it can run on windows 2000

is garrys mod right for you the sandbox built on half life 2s game engine  has been rebuilt from scratch the game turns half life 2 and team fortress 2 into a virtual construction kit originally based on the valves source engine garrys mod has its own compatible rendering engine  ridding the module of many bugs and enabling it to be used without half life 2 sandbox games give users control over virtual worlds in minecrafts case builders have blocks composed of different elements that enable them to craft landscapes and create buildings in garrys mod the elements are determined by the entities and maps extracted from hl2 and tf2 play begins in single player mode with the selection of a map from either of those games hints are enabled automatically and a bubble will pop up urging you to press and hold q on your keyboard this opens a dialogue full of game elements from noneplayer characters npcs to weapons and furniture the main attraction of garrys mod is the realistic simulation of physics in a virtual world when you place items in the maps you have two special weapons to manipulate the world the physics gun enables you to pick up and move items its a multipurpose tool that when used with npcs allows you to position their limbs and bodies and then freeze them into place the second special weapon is the tool gun  which is actually a number of different weapons all rolled into one you can select what the tool gun does by selecting q and choosing a function this turns garrys mod from a dolls playhouse into a full construction set with settings that enable you to create motors winches elastic ropes and more the tool gun can also be used to finely tune the positioning of npcs with face eye and finger posers how you actually use garrys mod is up to you some build impossible structures others create new games from the building blocks provided a key emerging use is virtual photography  screenshots capturing action that would be impossible to snap during the cut and thrust of a normal game like the valve games that garrys mod was built on it can be expanded the steam workshop features additional tools and game modes models and maps that you can download and use with garrys mod theres a multiplayer mode too  just like half life 2 the number of different game types in this mode is a testament to the inventiveness of the community there are roleplaying servers zombie survival games capture the flag collaborative building servers racing games the list goes on and on

mehbest marketed thing on steam gotta hand it to the developers though making millions off the steam workshop and valve for their marketing prowess with this game if you dont feel like reading a bunch of bs about how to use this mod then dont bother buying it youre just  away money on something you dont understand and didnt look into before you bought it dont buy it just becaue everyone else owns it they only own it because valve has marketed the ever loving s out of it and everyone just bought it at some point because you cant go anywhere without seeing it on sale dont forget to buy the other 15 gmaes you need to play most of the crap on here to sling racist terms around with 12 year olds and throw turds around 
recommended
for many people this game is like few games gamemodes created by community packed into one game for me only true potential of this game is sandbox but not the vanilla one because theres nothing to do without any modifications at first you should take a look at wiremod most basic and commonly known addon
recommended
i havent played it that much but i had fun while doing it
recommended
its ok
recommended
well made very creative
recommended
the best game ever if you stumble onto the browntown ttt servers
recommended
great game giving lots of opportunities to do whatever you want 
recommended
a must have on steam endless ways to have fun to those who dont own it think of this as 1000 mini games in one game all of the gamemodes make you feel like your steam library is full to the rim with games there is so many things to do and try give this game a shot you wont regret it 5 out of 5 acorns
recommended
my favourite game without a single doubt in my mind this game follows my sense of logic
recommended
this game i gotta say the best sandbox game there ever is this sandbox game allows you to make any creation or any form of art like posing ragdolls and taking a screen shots of them this game is very creative i highly recommend this game if you want to create
recommended
a good game for creative people with lots of variety in gamemodes for the less creative people
recommended
when i first bought the game i didnt realize how good it was and left it to be just another unused game on my library im starting to play it a lot you dont belong on steam if you dont have this game
recommended
just play

as someone who has played over 3000 hours of gmod and having bought it back in the gmod 12 version i can talk about both versions prior the game did have some gamebreaking bugs sometimes suffered from other issues such as framerate or stack overflow however the update to gmod 13 did fix most of these however i do at times suffer from random crashing despite this i tend to enjoy it as a sandbox game with the ability to smack around ragdolls for hours at a time does provide some release from the world as much as i would like to say that the update to gmod 13 fixed all the problems it didnt however it did do a good job at fixing most of them thus i would recommend this game just if not for future premis
recommended
fun and entertaining easy to troll and grief if youre bored its worth to get
recommended
every time i play gmod and get off i have the urge to prop kill in real life gmod unleashes the troll in you in other words you should buy it

too much of this game keeps you addicted addicted so much that it is possible for you to become socially inadequate a few million years and miss the rise and fall of the apes too little of this game will leave you socially adequate but have nothing to talk about during the times you talk to your friends i prefer to stay inbetween those two

garrys mod is a social experiment of what would happen if you give children infinite power and let them run the world and everything went horribly wrong no seriously buy the game and head to a dark rp server its complete chaos filled with  jokes and tears in all seriousness though parents if you wanna see how bad of a parent you are buy this game for you sondaughter and while they play it listen in to what theyre doing odds are youll get an accurate repersentation of what kind of person they are going to become get other parents involved too compare who is the better parent and see who wins because odds are if this sounds like a good idea you probably a  parent so why not turn it into a competion with the other  parents in your neighborhood
recommended
warning  this review is heavily lua modding based once you think youve done everything in the game  played all the gamemodes and tried all the best mods then i definitely recommend learning to mod the game trust me if you think youve done everything this opens so many new doors the ability to make whatever the hell you want then once you get good enough you get a great sense of achievement as well as basic knowledge within general programming i recommend the game itself without the whole modding part anyway i just personally think it expands the game vastly making it for myself more enjoyable even if youre not into programming this will sure as hell get you into it once you learn the basics if youre interested follow eitherboth of these links getting started lua tutorials better for newer programmers who are new to the concept of documentation and want to know all the basic things garrys mod maurits  lua tutorials [mauritstv] more advanced lua tutorials contains all the premade functions and hooks within the game and how to apply them in a very basic fashion but is good if you understand general programming and how to read documentation official garrys mod lua modding tutorials [wikigarrysmodcom] may i just finally add im not overly great at the whole modding concept but i enjoy it and thats all that counts and the reason ill continue to improve myself within it any questions about this  add me here on steam and ill be happy to give you a hand if youre looking to get started but as i said i dont want to promise anything good from myself but ill look to help
recommended
i really like it because you can buildfightetc many other things i cant describe about this game are all good nothing bad

i have spent so much time in this game there is an enormous amount of possibilitys gmod is packed to the brim with a number of servers and game modes to keep you occupied for hours on end feel free to visit flaming crystal which is the server i usually play on it is a deathrun server deathrun is a mode in which you have to get to the end of a course whilst doging the traps set off by a death the server has jukebox so you can choose music to put on and plenty of skins and trails i have happily spent over a hundred hours in gmod and i will carry on to play for a long time

recommended
the best game ive ever played been addicted to it for 3 or 4 years now inspired me to start programming definatelly worth a shot but keep in mind that you might not ge the point the first time you play it you have to try multiplayer and try servers running different gamemodes to actually see how cool this game is are you a shooter fan good you can make a great shootout with guns you download you can also play shooter gamemodes like green shift like programming great you can make addons and gamemodes for this game like building theres the sandbox gamemode for you like solving a mystery hop on a ttt server and help the detective find out who the traitor is or is it you theres something for everyone you just have to spend some time looking around
recommended
a wonderful game lots of different gamemodes all of them fun
recommended
if you think this game is all about trolling and making some strange contraption youre wrong this game has so much to it that the fun you can get out of this is endless when you first jump into the game youll see sandbox as a gamemode sandbox is the base gamemode for the this game but little do you know my friend there are actually other gamemodes that make this a very outstanding game theres trouble in terrorist town ttt where the innocent terrorists must band together to discover who the traitor is and take him out whereas the traitor must silently eliminate each innocent without hopefully being known as the traitor theres also prop hunt where there are two sides to the game the hunters who must find and kill all props and the props who must hide from the hunters until the timer runs out if nothing ive said so far has convinced you to buy this yet you can pose ragdolls in sex positions to fill your dirty fantasies you perverted sonava

well to start off its a funny game with lots of creativity but i dont find the online experience as good as say battlefield left 4 dead and minecraft i think the game is meant more for people who want to make small video games and movies i do like however how they add ttt trouble in terrorist town to the game allready so you dont have to download it  but whoever thought of the idea to make this game i want to give them one big brofist d

you might not want to read this so ive covered it with spoiler  koldraxon lord of the notsoreal kaleon legion 1 despite some rather [minor inconvenient] downsides everyone else says them but those arent an issue this is a game with games in it with games in those games with games in those games using models such as the ceph from crysis skeleton king from dota lich king from warcraft and thousands of other notsowell or well known characters units structures vehicles mechs [endofworld systems] and other intruging things 2 this game shall never cease to exist as long as it has a community developing new insane things although im still waiting for halo 4 promethean models admist many missing mechs and other units i quite enjoy making vehicles giant machines using other peoples work credited for indirect assistance scenes and comics if i have the time or models 3 i find only ii drawbacks its not an mmo if it was wed all be happily makingdestroyingterraforminginvadingwithalienthingssuchascephconqueringbuilding empires[insert your daily routine here]socializing[][404][error]likelyhood that some servers have admins who may be new zombies halo reach announceri havent met these badmins yet 4 i still have to find a server sandbox with personal prop protection toggleable as a tool with all the models and mods i would need to help make rather glorious scenes other than that i can make kaleon everywhere with this until metheans pop up then ill keep kaleonifying when the prometheans pop in ill make some vehicles for them and label them all promethean order of requiem forces since 60% of prometheans are mia the rest are either kia or serving covenant remnant

recommended
its a great and fun game
recommended
a great game with a huge amount of potential due to there being lots of gamemodes out there this is mainly focused on the darkrp ttt and hide & seek gamemodes i find all three interesting and just plainly fun in all ive probaly used half of my gametime on ttt then a good third on darkrp and the rest on h&s you should realy check them out as theyre awesome darkrp if youre into roleplaying and acting so per say h&s stands clearly enough ttt can be fun at times but also a complete mind buster if youre new to it even experience players find it hard to keep track of everything in total id say this game is worth exactly its price other than a few bugs that never gets fixed its a safe bet on lots of fun hours

garrys mod is one of the best sandboxcommunity driven games on pc and possible in gaming if you are going to buy this you should buy css with it since many game modes use those textures in it sandbox mode is nice you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes i would recommend ttt as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in gmod gamemodesactaully it is the engine but eh there are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garrys mod and you will get you 10525 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers a great game with a good community if you know where to look

garrys mod is a social experiment of what would happen if you give children infinite power and let them run the world and everything went horribly wrong no seriously buy the game and head to a dark rp server its complete chaos filled with  jokes and tears in all seriousness though parents if you wanna see how bad of a parent you are buy this game for you sondaughter and while they play it listen in to what theyre doing odds are youll get an accurate repersentation of what kind of person they are going to become get other parents involved too compare who is the better parent and see who wins because odds are if this sounds like a good idea you probably a  parent so why not turn it into a competion with the other  parents in your neighborhood

warning  this review is heavily lua modding based once you think youve done everything in the game  played all the gamemodes and tried all the best mods then i definitely recommend learning to mod the game trust me if you think youve done everything this opens so many new doors the ability to make whatever the hell you want then once you get good enough you get a great sense of achievement as well as basic knowledge within general programming i recommend the game itself without the whole modding part anyway i just personally think it expands the game vastly making it for myself more enjoyable even if youre not into programming this will sure as hell get you into it once you learn the basics if youre interested follow eitherboth of these links getting started lua tutorials better for newer programmers who are new to the concept of documentation and want to know all the basic things garrys mod maurits  lua tutorials [mauritstv] more advanced lua tutorials contains all the premade functions and hooks within the game and how to apply them in a very basic fashion but is good if you understand general programming and how to read documentation official garrys mod lua modding tutorials [wikigarrysmodcom] may i just finally add im not overly great at the whole modding concept but i enjoy it and thats all that counts and the reason ill continue to improve myself within it any questions about this  add me here on steam and ill be happy to give you a hand if youre looking to get started but as i said i dont want to promise anything good from myself but ill look to help

i really like it because you can buildfightetc many other things i cant describe about this game are all good nothing bad

garys mod is one of the most wellknown games throughout the whole steam community this is due to its limitless oppertunities garrys mod provides players with numerous items and tools to use to create virtually anything the player wants this is also supported by player made items and structures that are available for ingame use this adds even more depth to the game with the singleplayer and multiplayer the multiplayer has hundreds of different and unique game types ranging from parquor with a twist deathrun to fighting pirates on the seven seas pirate ship wars although this game was made inlate 2006 garys mod seems to have not aged but become wiser and more advanced however this does mean that the game has quite a few glitches but that doesnt matter as most of them make the game funnier and a better experience pros  hours upon hours of gameplay  infinite options of what to createdo  vast amount of game types and maps  amazing community  playermade content  great value for money  easy controls  next to everything is customisable cons  a few minor glitches overall garrys mod has earnt its place as one of the top steam games of all time this means that i will give garrys mod a very well earned 1010

as someone who has played over 3000 hours of gmod and having bought it back in the gmod 12 version i can talk about both versions prior the game did have some gamebreaking bugs sometimes suffered from other issues such as framerate or stack overflow however the update to gmod 13 did fix most of these however i do at times suffer from random crashing despite this i tend to enjoy it as a sandbox game with the ability to smack around ragdolls for hours at a time does provide some release from the world as much as i would like to say that the update to gmod 13 fixed all the problems it didnt however it did do a good job at fixing most of them thus i would recommend this game just if not for future premis
recommended
fun and entertaining easy to troll and grief if youre bored its worth to get

this game is a must for creative builders the possibilities are endless though it takes quite some time to get adjusted to the tools mods and commands it is more of a coop game than single player though you can play offline on singleplayer the coop experience is great you make friends face trolls enjoy the game mods and have fun

i started to play garrys mod thinking i would have fun with creative new game types i was wrong if you love children and people with autism well then this is the community for you every server and i mean every server gets so  off and talks like their mom smoked crack while she was carrying them in her stomach for the 9 months of pregnacy or you get kids that were literally just born 6 weeks ago if you are going to get this and play it make sure you get 20 of your friends to remind kids to go back to playing call of duty and skylanders oh and the ones with autism can i guess just kill themselves they have seen to much thanks to them having access to the internet

garrys mod is a physics sandbox unlike regular games there arent any predefined aims or goals we give you the tools and leave you to play you spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions  whether thats a car a rocket a catapult or something that doesnt have a name
recommended
this game most popular game in steam every1 has to own it ask me best game when ever your bored or just want to enjoy some gameplay diffrent game modes popular trouble terrorist town prop hunt sandbox etc

probably the most fun i have ever had on a game you never run out of things to do with all the mods also as a server owner i can say that you can do anything with this game much fun meow

this game is basicly 50 different games in one a few of the games i will go over sandboxwell no need to explain that darkrproleplay in a city earning money prophuntno need to explain zombie survivalbarracade in yourself or attack survivors deathruntry to make it too the end yup
recommended
this game is a wonderfull game and i really enjoy it
recommended
garrys mod is less of a game and more of an interactible physics engine with extensible scripting because of this the vanilla game is only as fun as your imagination can carry you build a house build a car throw dynamite everywhere put ragdolls into sexual positions once youve matured enough to stop putting ragdolls in sexual positions youll find the amazing number of custom gamemodes available coded by the players for the players first theres trouble in terrorist town in this gamemode some of the players are assigned as traitors and have to kill everyone its a great game especially with cooperative players but some random kid can get bored of his ragdolls come one and randomly start shooting everyone this is called rdm or random deathmatch your enjoyment of ttt is largely dependant on the server then theres rp there are many versions of roleplay available but they all have the same idea you live in a town there are law enforcers robbers and more and thats really it its a bit like second life in a way but with guns and rdm if you can get into a good community it can be extremely fun although that depends on your preference if you just want to build stuff you can join a build server here people build things just like in vanilla singleplayer let your imagination run wild ask for help with some things and make something cool these servers are unfortunately juicy targets for rdm mcsexyragdoll and his pals so watch out youve already noticed this but the only thing that lets gmod down is its communtiy its attracted a horde of underage immature squeakers who just want to troll and be le funni good servers keep them away but bad ones dont another thing you might want to stay away from is the workshop all the good things are drowned in a sea of sexual ragdolls epic cars and other useless crap the only good thing the gmod workshop has going for it is the lack of add this valve because its epic and this is bob copy paste him everywhere so he can take down google  another thing to keep in mind is that youll need halflife 2 and counterstrike  source to get the best experience many custom gamemodes use css stuff and they wont work without it also tf2 might be required in some servers all in all gmod is a great game thats plagued with trolls get some friends together and have fun or find a good server just watch out for the kiddies trying to be cool and youll have a nice time tldr  get this and css and play ttt with your friends
recommended
probably the most fun you will have in a video game its hilarious its creative there is content from other games such as valve if you are looking for entertainment beyond your wildest dreams  call of duty this is where its at

welp 1122 hours played now i can properly review this looking at the date this has been redone by 19012014 and not 5th august 2011 now that i have got that out the way this is garrys mod the great sandbox game im sorry but this is not a sandbox game this is a special game in the way of hey hey dude lets go jam a million addons onto this game and make it crash when we spawn in something11 that is sadly what i do now but this game is great seriously look at the pictures jesus it already looks good and then you buy it lets hope that you own every source game ever well any by valve or a mod thats gone mainstream zombie panic etc because trut me all the mapmakers love their assets not included within the files i cant go into the mechainics either because this game is what you want it to be well to be honest their are a few things physgun the thing you use for moving props and ragdolls and it wouldnt be garrys mod without the thing toolgun you get to do stuff youve possibly seen it in the screen shots with the derpy faces entire hl2 arsenal umm do i need to even speak about the stuff also if you havent played hl2 yet then uh dont kill yourself and buy it and now for uh lingo buster 9001 sandbox its a sandbox do whatever you want in it crap in it for all i care its also the default gamemode for the posing n stuff addon a fancy way of saying mod but it isnt exactly a mod for example a addons adds something new but dosent change a few lines of code models youd know what models are if you looks at the banner screensshots etc and this also segways into ragdolls and props ragdolls are basically things that move when you move them around and you also pose them to do uh things that are innocent and the complete opisiughrrr gross while props on the otehr hand are things you cant pose but can move around and stick to each other and do some pretty cool stuff with scary gman virus run run so fast turn off your computer never go onto a server that says gmod tower server 2 on sandbox on the map flatgrass or atleast anything with a  name for example duuuuhh i like buhts and furries ftw this game gets a 10 because this game is anything you want it to be like i said a million times and you can cause the game to crash its all up to you in modgameish of the year 200493819823612783512734512412572648 no but seriously how many version of garrys mod are there

recommended
get this you will not regret it
recommended
i love garrys mod there is so much to do in it whether you are building some contraption or playing a gamemode with your friend or a mix of both in some situations it is probably one of the best games i have ever played you can lay round with what you start with when you first install the game trying to build something with the tools youre given or you can go the workshop and download a ton of props sweps gamemodes tools scars and more the controls are simple and easy to learn and the stuff you can do when you overcome the basics is amazing although you may come across some missing textures or errors you can buy csgo which is only like $10 or something to fix it i love gmod in all its glory and splendor 1010 would play again for the rest of eternity
recommended
garrys mod is basically loads of games in one game from build servers to death match servers and everything inbetween
recommended
really good if you are looking for a sandbox game major addon support easy to make addons for if you are into that
recommended
its from the best games ever xd
recommended
the best gamer ever 3
recommended
imagine the best thing in the universe and then forget it because youre looking at it right here
recommended
what keeps me playing gmod its the finest game where you can break any squeakers dignity
recommended
i really like this game recommend it to everyone really expands your creativity and there are lots of gamemodes in gmod so its basically like you have 20 games and not just one d
recommended
simply awesome best sandbox game everu need 2 play thistrust me
recommended
this game is absolutely incredible i was so fascinated by it that not only have i not been able to stop playing it but i now run two garrys mod servers that are incorporated into a server network and i am staff on many others
recommended
garrys mod is minecraft on steroids the users can build literally anything and put it into this game shall they have the skill you can download things from the steam workshop in seconds and the things you can download are either clever and creative funny and weird random and silly or stupid and pointless the tools are hilarious from face poser to inflator the gamemodes such as ttt and darkrp i could have a review for each and every one on their own and probably take more than one read more are so great that i would pay more than i would have to play for all the valve games for each one in its own game it comes with great amounts of ragdolls props npcs and more the example as i call them face and finger poses are great the only thing i can think of that would be wrong with the game is the frame rate on crappy computers such as my own 1010
recommended
i love this game have over 400 hours on it highly recommended
recommended
garrys mod or more comonly refured to as gmod is a game that is solely for the imagination it uses the source engine and thanks to this we can enjoy many games inside the world of gmod if you enjoy having brain children this is your kind of game with its open sandbox modes on many free map packs that you can download or even create using the steam woorkshop the maps box is the limits well some times
recommended
this is by far one of the best sandbox games i have ever played although it crashes occasionaly and the multiplayer takes forever to load but other than that great game keep up the good work facepunch
recommended
amazing gmae do whatever you want
recommended
great game i really suggest you get it because of the ammount of things you can do in it whatever you think ofthere is most likely an addon for it on the workshop it is the freedom and unlimited nature of the game that i love i am sure you will love it too
recommended
this game is amazing its fun for just making screenshots sandbox or laying the variety of gamemodes i havent known one person in this game without atleast having 5 mods the mods are a huge part in this there are mods for about anything you can think of more gamemodes more items exclusive dlc and many many more i am hopefully going to put some more hard worked hours and money into this these games  counter strike  source halflife 2 dod source day of defeat any of these games are needed for better experience buy all of those games it adds more gamemodes and more items to mess with gmod tower is my favorite out of all the gamemodes simply if you are in a down mood or simply just in a silly mood this game has so many things to experience this game it takes skill to master put a good 200 hours or so into it and you will know your way around things do not buy this game for the full $10 this game goes on sale alot and for a long time $250 is the normal price to see it or 1 key in any game that has anything to do with trading or keys or uncrating for items even if someone has a copy of this game they are usually selling it for a key because of it being on sale so much the highest you will see this game is 4 keys intf2 or more if someone sells at this price tell them to lower it it would just be something good if you plan taking my suggestions or anyone elses get ready to put countless hours and your hard earned money to donating to your favorite servers to keep them running sandbox its uses are endless i give this game a 1010 with pineapple seal of approval depending on how you see it
recommended
total randomness get it now seriously as in now
recommended
>1010 would recommend
recommended
a great game with a huge amount of potential due to there being lots of gamemodes out there this is mainly focused on the darkrp ttt and hide & seek gamemodes i find all three interesting and just plainly fun in all ive probaly used half of my gametime on ttt then a good third on darkrp and the rest on h&s you should realy check them out as theyre awesome darkrp if youre into roleplaying and acting so per say h&s stands clearly enough ttt can be fun at times but also a complete mind buster if youre new to it even experience players find it hard to keep track of everything in total id say this game is worth exactly its price other than a few bugs that never gets fixed its a safe bet on lots of fun hours
recommended
this is garrys mod hence the name a game where everythings controlled by you the player theres countless ways to enjoy this game be it just building things shooting stuff or just messing around you are the one who decides the way the game is played to play this game you must own one or any of the source games since it uses them to get the textures models and whatnot theress also the steam workshop recently added for this game which replaces the toybox and it lets you easily download and install addons such as more models weapons maps gamemodes etc so overall if you like to mess around with friends enjoy various game types or just want to create things then this game is well worth your time and you will most definitely like it

recommended
who is garry and why are we playing his mod that question wont be answered in this review instead im trying to take the  out of it by saying that this game features a terrible community which is totally the games fault you can create your own scenarios using this but no one cares anyway because people instead play the mods in garrys mod there are a lot of mods in garrys mod however only a handful get played you have roleplay servers where you dont roleplay but kill as many people as possible until an admin bans you try to beat your personal best we also have ttt which is deathmatch with a cop and robbers theme very original this game attracts wonderful people that do not sniff used pampers 68100

recommended
garrys mod is a game for 2 types of people the first type is people who like creating things you can create nearly anything in the source engine with the right addons and if you arent very good there are youtube videos on it all i got into this game after the main yogscast channel showed off the addon pack for making space ships i spent hours in this and using the base creation tools before i found out how awesome the multiplayer gamemodes are i am not sure how many are made by facepunch studios but it is through their work that so many are able to easily experience projects made by single people or budding indie devs of the future the other types of people are those who spend all of their time on trouble in terrorist town or murder or prophunt or any of the main game modes heck you and your friends can walk into a virtual cinema and watch all of seanannerss and the yogscasts videos to learn about them this game has everything apart from what you can imagine all you have to do is make it

pretty random and wierd gamei find myself struggling to know what the hell i am doing in many of the game modes basicallyits one of those we give the players everythingand let society begin in here kind of games yetthats the only complaint ive got about this game the community for some reasoni alwaysalways run into s in any of the game modesrude peopleelitist idiotswhining esdesperate guyszealot bronies fursit seems like all of the scum on steam got together in this game dont get me wrongthere is lots of goodpolite players in herebut the restugh i always said if you got more than a thousand hours in garrys modyou are probably mentally disturbedor suffering some kind of problem with your life and for  sakei have yet to prove that wrong community asidethis game is pretty awesome to give a casual play now and thenor for those long gaming nights where you just hang around servers expecting something to happenor just having a blast with some of the players that are still up at that time
recommended
such a varied experience across servers and myriad gamemodes garrys mod is literally the most you can get out of a game period spend the money but make sure you have css youll not regret it

recommended
so yes garrys mod i know it is already publically known nearly worldwide its a good game think its for most people thats all have a nice life
recommended
to be honest one of the funniest games on steam its funny great game and such a good deal the game does not have any objectives really the game consists of making maps and objects at your disposal this game gives you the props from source games to then make you own wacky inventions and so on the game is full of servers that you can play for example there is a cinema server where you can watch youtube videos on the big screen with 30 other people another is death race this is a game mode is where you must reach the end without dying pretty self explanatory really if you have done your research you can probably tell that allot of videos are made using garrys mode well you right allot of funny videos have been uploaded and made using the garrys mod record system that makes it easy to understand recommend 1010
recommended
its so good that i pooped my pants
recommended
lonely game > thats what i think about this game > is it really game of course not its a multipurpose game where you can do everything build drive vehicles play multiplayer with other players tttcwdarkrp sandbox prophunt  theres really lot of servers where you can see lot of fun also you can make and share your stuff via workshop rip toybox same as download them and enjoy them like new nonplayer characters weapons vehicles and other stuff here this game is not fun with singleplayer you can spent here over 1 hour and then you get bored but if you have friends who can play with you its really fun also this game is development tool whinch you create custom entitieswepons vehicles and lot of stuff where you using luajit scripting language to play with game engine you can make here machinima as well after sfm release rip gmod theres a lots of tool and stuff here thats why i calling this game multipurpose
recommended

recommended
let me just start by saying gaben port this to the souce two engine but anyways i really think this game is worth all the money only $10 this game will be worth your $10 it has endless amount of fun with millions of workshop items and game modes so you never stop having fun
recommended
a sandbox game created by gary newman with valves source engine its one of the first games to recieve sandbox support and one of the most played games on steam in garrys mod you have plenty of things to tinker with for instance you can change the color of the skybox or sun or you can spawn props to create your dream house car plane boat and if sandbox bores you well try out another gamemode made by other people darkrp and flood are two great alternatives to sandbox if you wanna truly test your imagination this game is a must have rate 1010

1010 my wife and child have not received child support payments from me in months and the dog has died in an act of love for sandbox games i have recently burned my phd and danced in the ashes while saying a prayer in latin to the developers currently their are 8 missing person reports out for me and i have been evicted from my house but it no longer matters to me so long as i get my fix recently i have had to sell my body for food before i did this i of course ate the dog because i have dignity i would recommend this game to everyone
recommended
a great game overall theres literrally nothing you cannot do except fix the errors and missing textures legally without spending 20$ for css i made the mistake of not buying it with the game thinking it wouldnt matter if there were a few missing textures i was so wrong ttt maps are mostly missing textures any map with cs_ before it is full of errors and missing textures but if you get css with it it looks great and sandbox almost always is fun overall i recommend it if you can pay the 30$ for both games oh and 95100

so many unique servers and gamemodes you never run out of things to do

this game is areally fun sandbox gameno flaws that i have found while the game might be fun there are also hackers out there but that doesnt matter there are also many game modes such as tttmurdersandboxzombie survivalgmod towergmod stranded and so much more i reccomend cheking the game out i think it is worth the price for what you get in the game there are also so many tools and weapons and adddons entities dupes and saves but what makes the game so fun is the mods in itits also a great multiplayer coop game also some games you may need to run most of the textures counter strike sourceteam fortress 2 day of defet source there are also many other textures out there to but the main ones are css and tf2 so get those games to and dont forget tf2 is a free game but counter strike is liek 10$ but the textures from that game are used alot so get css if youre looking to plat ttt or other games modes that have missing textures css will usaly fix them but there is also gmod tower that used the gmod tower addon i hope you found this review helpfull so i reccomend cheking the game out alos check out some of my other reviews if you need help about the game

if you like to use your brain a bit and create odd machines out of random scrap or if you just want to make some silly screenshots using props and characters from other valve titles then this is the game for you at its core gmod is a sandbox style game where you are given various props characters and construction materials and you are given the tools to place and fuse them together in a variety of ways with those tools you can make odd contraptions and vehicles or you can just place objects and characters to make silly scenes for screenshots or videos want to slap some car tires on a bath tub and have a race with your buddy no problem want to construct a massive robot out of refrigerators and washing machines possible if difficult it is all up to you really however gmod can be as complicated as you want it to be with extensions like wiremod and other mods you can really get indepth with the engineeringcoding and design things like automatic machine gun turrets some of the builtin construction materials also lend themselves to building rather complex machines and structures gmod also has rather good integration of the steam workshop and you can use it to share your own creations or to check out other players stuff gmod is most assuredly a game for the creative mind to express itself in a variety of ways
recommended
garrys mod is a sandbox game where there is no objectives we just leave you the tools to play your purpose is to make something that already exists or something that doesnt its up to you

garrys mod where do i begin i remember when i first layed my eyes on gmod i didnt know what something feeling sourcey was i got steam just for garrys mod at first pretty sure next came day of defeat but we will save that for another review thing garrys mod was awesome even with out addons and such i had a blast later on my friend showed me all about magical garrysmodorg took me a while to get used to downloading addons but i got the hang of it mostly garrys mod was just getting more fun as i played i would always jump on a map and create a little singleplayer mission with npcs or such anyway i remember joining my first garrys mod server it was a dark rp i played for a while before joining any type of server me and my friend has no idea what were joining once we got in it was awesome had a crap load of fun playing for hours then me and my friend would just play every weekend after weekend garrys mod is endless while you may say you can do anything and yes you can but if that something you want to do isnt already created its up to you to code it i really do recommend garrys mod its a must have so much you can do on it and for newer people to the interwebs it is now easier to use with the newest update moving it too garrys mod 13

i was 12 years old i watched countless videos on this game i was practicly sweating over it i played half life 2 i played counter strike as well and now its time to play some gmod it took hours of my life to download the game i was kinda frusterated but then i played this game was beatuful i almost cried with a physics gun in hand i could do anything the game was just perfect nothing could make this game any better i was wrong i eventualy found out about online multiplayer where you can build together with your freinds i did it was so fun i once again alomost cried it was so much more fun with a second person im not lonley anymore i have freinds i meet new freinds every day everything was just swell then it crashed i was confused and mad and sad i couldnt play anymore there was something wrong with my gmod game i could never fix it i could never play again 1010

i am a big fan of hl2 and all its predecessors hl3 confirmed jk and this in addition to my collection is just wonderful i can now toy around with all the characters and do whatever i want play gamemodes online and all you can also get killed by melons 1010

it is an all around awesome and fun game with many modes one of which modes is sandbox which is my favorite another mode is ttt aka trouble in terrorist town i wont go in depth on what the game modes are about but i will list a few more one of the other modes is murder and another is darkrp sandbox is a game mode where you can do whaat ever you want and on sandbox if you have the correct addons you want you have endless or infinte possibilities the only way to not have endless possibilites is lack of imagination so it is really fun and that will conclude this review

an incredible game garrys mod isnt just a sandbox its a firstperson shooter a zombie survival an obsticle coarse a warzone if you can think of it than its there personally i dont like sandboxes but this games is everything you could possibly imagine you can kill your friends make new friends and kill those friends too youre only limited by your own imagination the possibilities are endless
recommended
probably the best source engine sandbox you can find offers lots of ways to experiment with the engines physics allows people to learn and understand how the engine works and its pretty much the only game where people can create anything imaginable with the appropriated addons such as wiremod or sprops or acf a lot of building related tool addons people are able to learn to build replicas of existing vehicles to simulate realistic physics to simulate aerodynamics create their own games i myself have a hologramdesigned chess in gmod or as seen on many youtube videos create animation videos with ragdolls i only have to warn about the majority of the sandbox community dont expect most of the people being mature calm and firm they are far from that the rather small buildingcodingcommunity however is the exact opposite of what people nowadays see running around on gmod servers gmod basically is the place where you can create bikes cars planes boats jets helicopters quadrohexaoctacopters pixelartworks by aligning tons of cubes spend your time on lua because gmods workshop offers three major lua sandboxes expression 2 in wiremod expression advanced 2 on github starfall on github if anyone wishes to see some impressions people are free to visit my friends jackpody rucamad damianu on youtube visit the wiremod forum or look for servers where builders can be found on

recommended
its filled with people who think theyre geniuses children who think theyre original a majority of the people think theyre comedy gold a whole lot more strive to kill anything above them and even more of them just want to enjoy the game but cant because of the previously mentioned people the problem with gmod is that theres no unifying base behind it so the community is left to create their own game the result is modern day gmod at the end of its life about to completely fizz out on life support by the veterans who are determined to see it through to the end id still reccomend this game to anyone who wants to build stuff of  around with coding and modeling just dont get into really involved stuff like hl2rp itll cause you more drama then one person should ever have to endure
recommended
this game is pretty awesome 
recommended
this is worth all of what you have in your wallet you will never regret this
recommended
gmod is the best sandbox game or mod ever theres so much to do when im board i just play gmod to past the time so many people play this its not that kind of mod that have like 20 people online at the same time i defenly recomend this game or mod what ever you want to call it if you dont have this game i fell bad for you

garrys mod has one of the most if not the most wellupdated communities of any game the game was made in 2006 and the different weapons gamemodes and maps are still being created every day not to mention all of the servers dedicated to any gamemode you like a good game for a new pc gamer or an old one and you can get killed by watermelons 1010

one of the best game that you can fined on steam full of servers it was release in 2006 and still contain thousands of servers everyday everything1010 highly recommanded note if you fail in school and you are very sadgo buy it
recommended
its a really good game it has gamemodes like ttt darkrp murder hide n seek sandbox the community is bad tho and it needs a ton off addons i have 346 addons [dont need to dowload into alot off servers]
recommended
i like this game 
recommended
this game is great
recommended
playing this game vanilla can get a bit boring but what makes it as popular as it is the wide range of addons from steam workshop
recommended
although it is a mod garrys mod feels like a stand alone game as it just uses basic resources of css hl2 and tf2 with a sandbox single player and an exciting multiplayer you will never get bored of playing this it is a stable game but feels as if it is always in beta as lag and long loading times will occur with any pc system you use but you can get used to that some times crashes but all in all still a great game make sure you purchase css with it and if you dont you can download the textures it uses anyway for free 8810 needs to be a bit more stable would recommend
recommended
this is garrys mod or gmod it is an amazing source sandbox game with tons of different mods and addons that make it more exciting alos sandbox isnt the only gamemode there is a wide variey of gamemodes ranging from ttt troouble in terrorist town to hunger games id reccomend getting tf2 and cssource before buying this game as it bring in a lot of new resources to gmod overall this is game i fantastic

i have played garrys mod for a very long time warning right now if you are going to get the game you will need counter strike soruce unless you want to play only singleplayer you can still play multiplayer without css but you will have no textures and you cant even see where you are this game combinds a lot of the soruce made games like half life series along with counterstrike soruce with some portal this can be fun for doing endless asortment of things on sandbox like screwing around with the charecters the physics like changing the gravity to installing addons or gamemodes that have a huge effect on the game this reminds me of minecraft in a way because minecraft once you get board of it you can just mod it to turn it more interesting game still has not gotten old to me and i personaly think it is the best game i have ever played so far i highly recomend this game the only downside i can think of is when you are going on servers with a lot of addons like darkrp sometimes how they interact with your clientgame can make it glitchy and cause problems this is easy to fix usauly just some lua errors deffinitly have to buy this game if you are considering it i have somewhere around 558 hours on the game
recommended
in my opinion garrys mod is a very amusing game that is definetly worth the price  it allows creativity and the fun of just playing around with games that are mixed together like my little pony with call of duty black ops the choices of gamemodes are amazing like dark roleplay or stop it slender its workshop shows that the community and creativity of the members is amazing and that people will never stop supporting and creating mods for the game my verdict on this game is that it is amazing and it is worth playinggrey zarcovski 11182014

gmod is a creative game with different kinds of modes and dlc modes the modes that you start with are sandboxand trouble in terrist town sandbox is what the name impliys it`s a sandbox but it has very famillyer games by valve liketeam fortress 2half lifeand portal and you can choose stuff from the dupes minu wich has community builds and some of them can be awsome and others watso ya ttt is a game mode were sombody is the traitors and their job is to kill the enimeys with out being noticed and when they kill everybody then they win the freandlies job is to kill the traitors and nobody knows who is the trader and who is a freandlie so this makes for a iteresting gamemode my over all rank for this game is 7 physis guns10 i hoped that you enjoyed my review of garrys mod

indescribably the most stupid funny hilarious random most entertaining game ive ever played i payed 10 dollars not knowing what it was truley about but it was all worth it garrys mod incase you dont know is supposed to be sandbox where you create your own thing but in this case its props from the series half life or you can go online you can play sandbox there too with people and play other games that will keep you playing youll have to see but it is for sure the best game ive ever gotten 1010 if you get 10 dollars dont hesitate buy it 
recommended
its a great way to get into sandbox games if youre getting bored of minecraft or gta 5 ive clocked over 30 hours on this game since its impossible for me to get bored the community keeps the game fresh by adding more and more excellent content and wips to the workshop every single day there are some violent aspects of it however but that doesnt mean one has to participate in them if youre honestly that sensitive to violence in gaming play minecraft instead getting bored ingame get more content to use
recommended
i have no clue as to whats going on but i love it anyways

best building game ever highly recommend it

garrys mod possibly one of the best games i ever played most words had to start with a capital letter because its true garrys mod is known for many things such as animation gamemodes addons shrek tf2 the first game to feature a gamemode where you are a terrorist looking for traitors stabing roleplay first source game not produced by valve murder blowing up melons first person shooter clockwork rp super scary rp prophunt guns trampolines turtles garry d dupes dynomite wiremod sanic batman having a simular name to a generic model organism database or gmod being riped off on many devices menecroft vanoss venturian tale homestuck homostuck pwniez not to offend the pony community nor the homestuck comunity tornados doctor who a person with mr burns with a mustace as a profile picture who developed insurgency i think tumblr youtube facepunch studios the lord and savior garry and more  but originally started as a sandbox game via a modding website witch would soon be brought to steam and be sold for currency witch then made millions witch then was added trampoline witch then made it to the steam workshop along with garrys mod vr 13 or gmod 13 witch then made more money witch then created our lord and savior garry over 90005 stars it was ok a very over yet under excaderate indivitual

this is a very unique and creative game which is full of possibilities and allows players to do what they want rather than being forced to follow objectives the game supplies you with lots of building resources to well build stuff it also supplies constraints to help you with building i have enjoyed many hours using this game as you can see i would score this game a 1010

how do you review this this is garry`s mod and the game can be whatever you like as the game`s titel states the game is about modding and chainging whatever you fell like this game has no rules and no boundires you can do whatever you like let`s talk a bit more specific you can put down any item person or ragdoll from games like half life team fortress 2 counter strike and more from there you can make these item`s do whatever you want to put them togehter animate them make new mecanics and so on whatever you choose to do you can always film it or make an item and put it out so the public can use it there has also been build mods to garrys`s mod there have been quit pupular such as trouble in teorist town and prop hunt but many more mods and idears are out there and maybe you can even make your own this game is a game you want to play if you have friends that you want to be a bit random with or if you are creativ so you can make great items this game is a fenominom and everybody has either heard of it or have the game how can i not give this game a thumps up it has everything 7 out of 10

overall 67% gameplay & controls 45 s graphics & visuals 35 s music & audio 35 s part of garrys mods lasting popularity stems from just how many things you can do with it the number of game modes available is absolutely astounding even more so when you realize that all of them were created by members of the community its an incredibly vibrant game and if time has proven anything its that its players are capable of just about anything gameplay & controls your experience will change from server to server depending on game mode but among the most popular modes are murder prop hunt and trouble in terrorist town  or ttt as it is affectionately referred to by its many fans the first plays out more or less like a virtual game of clue while the second is a bout of hide and seek where those who are hiding can transform themselves into a copy of one of various items hidden around the map ttt meanwhile is similar to murder except everyone has weapons to defend themselves and players cooperate to attempt to inform each other who the traitor is in their midst other game modes can range from a fullon clone of dayz to human battleship a testament to players ingenuity the only thing stopping me from giving the gameplay of garrys mod a five is the same aspect which can make playing it so much fun the community while many members are quite engaging and friendly there are always some others out there determined to ruin the experience of everyone else they play with whether through hacking their client or harassing other players this small minority can easily wreck whatever game mode you happen to be playing and good luck trying to get an admin on to do anything about it graphics & visuals garrys mod runs on valves decaying source engine and while powerful its age is becoming increasingly apparent the visuals dont necessarily detract from the experience to be had and some players have made an effort to introduce custom player models and textures some of which look quite nice again however the engine itself is dated so please be aware of that before you play something else of note is that this game cant really be run unless you have a valvemade source engine game installed in your library this is because as the name suggests garrys mod is in fact one giant mod that pulls all of its textures and resources from other games there are illegal ways around this but the truth is that unless you get the necessary files on your system one way or another youre going to be missing the majority of the games textures which is valves way of saying pony up the extra cash unless you enjoy everything in alternating shades of black and pink music & audio most of the tracks and sounds in the game are supplied by source though other songs are supplemented through garrys mods everexpanding workshop most of these end up collectively as taunts in game modes such as prop hunt and they honestly make up the greatest part of the experience however sounds such as those are often limited to certain game modes with others being almost silent except for the sounds of your fellow players mics which is rather unfortunate given all of the sound effects that have been added to the game over the years final thoughts honestly its a good game especially when youre playing with friends it can really be a lot of fun and its always something to do if you dont have anything else to do the sheer amount of game modes is perhaps the greatest selling point though considering the fact that you have to own a source game in order to properly play i really dont think its worth $999 itll often go on sale around the holidays for a fraction of that price so if you happen to see it drop below $500 i would definitely pick it up if you get the chance just beware of the trolls hiding in the communitys crevices

garrys mod is truly a game that shows what a group of people with creativity can make the makers did a magnificent job of making a sandbox game that combines the creativity of making large magnificent things and making it so it can be distributed to other creative players looking for inspiration from its wide variety of gamemodes to its amazing mod community it just gos to show that people can truly do anything and everything and put it in one game
recommended
>package up a server >find a few friends >input a few mods >maybe watch a few videos with the cinema gamemode >blow crap up with crap >construct stuff with crap >roleplay with crap thats gmod in a nutshell
recommended
pretty cool the worst part of this game is describing it to nongamers or people who simply missed it console peasants
recommended
still cant find garry but still would play again
recommended
garrys mod is extremely fun and i would recomend it to anyone the variety of gamemodes are interesting and make it difficult to ever get bored with the game the formatting and the ease in finding servers are other positive attributes but my very favorite aspects to gmod are the community and communication with other players whenever i play i look forward most to talking to friends and having a great time
recommended
ruined my life 1010
recommended
such a good game if you have ever felt the need for escapism then its here in garrys mod with such a proud and dedicated mod community its hard to find something bad in this game because you can do a lot in garrys mod also with online functions the game really shines in its multiplayer modes such as trouble in terroist town and prop hunt playing these with your friends is a blast and really enjoyable when you are trying to find something new to do so yeah this game is definitely worth its price although i reccomend the counter strike source pack as that allows you to use its features a lot better
recommended
awesome game  its like all games in one  you can create everything you want but first you need to learn how to do it first it was little bit hard but then
recommended
this game is funny and hapyy

the meme that keeps on giving
recommended
there is no way that you can truly dislike garrys mod since the game is mostly based off of the steam workshop it can be whatever you make of it the possibilities are endless in gmod so i highly suggest this game like every game though the somewhat childish community is the only negative

garrys mod  the allinone sandbox game whether its movies screenshots or just mucking about in general garrys mod should keep you and others entertained for a long time also its $10 instead of pirating it like i know a bunch of other people have just dont buy that pizza you wanted today and you should have enough for it
recommended
one of the most creative games ive ever played and also one of the most hilarious the modding community is amazing and the amount of gamemodes you can play online like murdertttdark rpprop hunt are great alos the amount of maps you can get is endless although i must warn people that hosting a private server for you and your friends is complicated and you might need help for it final verdict 1010 primarily for the amount of time you can have fun with it
recommended
who needs life when you have this
recommended
amazing game anytime youre bored gmod will fix you up
recommended
u kno dis is a good game when theres an achievement you get for receiving programming errors
recommended
great game that brings your creativity out into the open a sandbox game developed for teen and mature players however there seem to be a lot of kids in this game and some people may find this annoying if youre into sandbox games roleplaying etc then youll like this game this game has many gamemodes that keep growing everyday you can write your own gamemodes if you wanted to but that would take quite a while there are many fun gamemodes out there like darkrp ttt and jailbreak get this game and you wont regret buying it its quite a cheap price too with the current summer sale going on you might want to get css along with this because there is a lot of content that uses css hl2ep1 hl2ep2 are also great games that go along with this

recommended
countless type of games modes a great community and you can even create all sorts of things its hard to let go of garrys mod and theres always something new to discover with friend or on you own youll still enjoy this game because youll always ended up meeting fun peoples and have a blast the only letdown even thougt its justified in a way is that to get the full experience you absolutely need other games sources like counterstrike and halflife which are sold seperately and even though its not that often i stumbled upon different kind of bugs like game crashing lags buggedmisplaced interface they make the game inconvenient here and there but not enought to ruin the experience

not many games allow you to be this creative with a large list of game types to choose from and hundreds of community made mods the possibilities are almost endless practise building in singleplayer or with friends on a sandbox server take on the role of a civil protection officer in darkrp keeping the streets safe or not so safe have a little who done it with the murder or ttt game types still need something new to do no worries there download a custom map or addons from the steam workshop and enjoy them alone or with friends its hard to get bored of this creative game which is why is has led to being one of the most popular series on my channel httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvazrxgafiklu so pick it up its a must have in any gamers steam library

garrys mod is a sandbox game where a player can basically to anything they want thats right anything a player can spawn npcs build creations design weapons create enviroments or just do what you want this game is prepared for a majority of what the community of this game has in store for it so it can take a lot of big things however it is prone to crashing exiting the game without you doing it unexpectedly but one the bright side this game allows players to have fun doing whatever the heck they want to do one can position ragdolls in funny positions will comedic faces or one can go up against a zombie horde and try to survive with a certain loadout of guns the possibilities are about endless now if one gets bored of doing anything they want or is just not into positioning ragdolls there is another way to having fun with this game there are gamemodes out there in garrys mod that people can play with other people in a fun and sometimes intense server one gamemode is called trouble in terrorist town ttt in this game mode there are a cartain amount of innocent terrorists in a certain map now in this band of innocents are traitors the traitors mission eliminate all the innocents the innocents mission eliminate the terrorists seems simple right well not really no one knows who the traitors migh be it could be anyone it could even be the player itself no one knows at firstuntil the chaos begins you see the traitors have some weapons that the innocents dont have at first such as a knife silent pistol traitor sniper c4 or a jihad suicide bomb the traitors will stop at nothing to kill the innocents and win the round one might be walking with its friend looking for the traitors when bam youre killed by your friend who just happens to be the traitor no two rounds of ttt are never the same with different people being traitors and different ways of ending up dead ttt is just one of the many different gamemodes of garrys mod there are so many gamemodes out there that this review would be too long for people to read i havent experienced even near close to the full amount of randomness that garrys mod has to offer which is why i fully recommend this game
recommended
this game is pretty fun v

recommended
a great game with a lot of game modes ranging from sandbox trouble in terrorist town ttt prop hunt and many more  sandbox is mainly where one uses creativity to build and goof around for entertainment ttt is where one uses deception and detective skills to win the game then theres prop hunt where the hunters must find and eliminate the props who are hiding taking hide and seek to the next level and so much more game modes to explore this game is better off with a friend or two to witness all your funny moments this game will certainly make you spend hours of gameplay and not get bored of it

come on how can you not like this game if you somehow never heard of it then hopefully this will persuade you to consider getting it in short you can do practically anything roleplay building murduring your friends with guns also say you dont want to go to a prebuilt world you want to make things your way you can go to multiple different sandboxes to do lots of things drive cars kill npcs from multiple games such as halflife and team fortress 2 or build your own city and dont forget the workshop where you can get even more weapons props npcs such as hitler and master cheif vehicles or basically anything you can think of i highly recommend this game for if you are ever bored or just looking to have fun doing anything you want this game is for you

for those of you who are looking for an excuse to buy this game look no more garrys mod or gmod as the cool kids call it is a game where you can do anything no im not exaggerating you can literally do anything anywhere do you want to fight an endless hoard of zombies inside of the krusty krab do you want to destroy an evil race of teletubbies overtaking mcdonalds do just want to simply build a flying couch to get to the cheese planet well you can do all this and more with a few downloads from the extensive garrys mod steam workshop just simply browse over the mod you want inside of the workshop and click subscribe and whamoh you got your self a satisfying new addition to your game easy right yeah yeah i know warning garrys mods mods get super addicting at one point i found myself with a grand total of over 500 mods and i still wanted more the only flaw with this game however is that some of the workshop mods require you to download other games before they can be usable such as counter strike source and the halflife 2 episodes so it is extreamly recommended that you buy the counter strike sourcegmod bundle because most of the fun workshop mods require counter strike source so now that you read this review go buy the game its really cheap for how much fun memories comes out of this game so come on download it now now noooowww do eeit noiwww still not satisfied yet eh just search up seananners gmod or venturian gmod on youtube for some great garrys mod lets plays if your reading this part that means your stupid and your still hesitating to buy the game trust me you want this sexy game

its gmod stop being a little  and get it already im just kidding but in all seriousness you cant go wrong with this game there is anything and everything to do on it and its absolutely fun to join rp roleplaying servers only 4000 people think this game is bad and they dont even have valid reasons just take this for example what other game can make you overwhelmed with joy by surviving the zombie apocalypse and making forts throughout the map with your friends and raiding other people for their money and supplies under $10 answer only gmod and keep in mind that was only one gamemode out of the thousands you could do so grab your parents wallet grab the credit card spend $10 and blame me for making you buy it with all my decent reasons hope you guys enjoy and see you on gmod
recommended
great game where everybody will find something for himself variety of gamemods maps and whatever customisable things great game to play with friend or just to find a new ones  the one bad thing about it is that you need cssource to play the game without errors in textures

garrys mod orginated as a popular among fans sandbox game for the alraedy popular halflife 2 when it was released as a standalone game it was amazing its a amazing sandbox game made in the source engine the limits to what you can make or do is the invisible wall infront of you you can create giant walking dong monsters epic rollercoasters amazing artwork you can play fanmade gamemodes like prophunt and hide from those combine soldiers as a traffic cone in a grocery store you can have fullscale battles with nonplayable characters and much more it is truly a great game and a must for those creative sandbox lovers out there it also has usercreated addons which are modifcations to the game which make the experience x1000 better with hoverboards lightsabers nyan cat guns chair launchers and lemon grenades but their is also the ugly in the form of the flood of downloads when playing multiplayer kid admins everywhere crappy darkrp servers and effortless dupes also ever since fnaf struck their has been so many ing fnaf addons and dupes you could shove them all in a alternate universe and still have some to spare overall its a great game with an ok community i rate 89100 rip kitty0706 artworks

well what can i say about this game its extremely cheap at just over five pounds and is often reduced down to 2 pounds in steam sales but even the default price is reasonable when you compare it to the price of most modern console games also is a game that doesnt require a super beefy pc with an expensive graphics card or cpu to run at a decent framerate i played most of my hours on it on my 6 year old toshiba laptop thats not even meant for gaming and only recently upgraded to a gaming pc to play other games it enables you to use maps textures weapons characters and pretty much anything from other games compatible with it such as left 4 dead 2 counter strikesource and other very popular games such as a free to play game called team fortress 2 tf2 with this feature built into the game it enables you to explore maps create spawn npc`s non playable characters vehicles and pretty much anything else your head can think of i have played gmod for nearly 200 hours and i can definitely say that i would recommend this game to a friend as well as tf2 and as a matter of fact i ended up buying this game because one of my friends suggested it to me to play

this game is fantastic but kills brain cells just beware of the bugs that this game has such as console bug everytime you open console it may or may not crash yay memory bug if a major game function is stuck on a loop itll take a lot of ram no joke in order to fix this you must restart the game or let it crash next up and finally this is the last of the major bugs the physics bug source engine never expect a game like this to be created so youll find lots of rather funny bugs and lots that are simply useless and need to be fixed oh well nothing will change the fact that source engine was horribly written and given any chance and programmer including me could fix it its not fubar just really  but all in all the game is fun halarious crazy and time consuming id recommend it to anyone just beware of the bugs ive mentioned they are real and common yes you will be  if youre hauling money in dark rp and then you get this awesome idea to make binds for  and so on so bam you go to open console and crash just dont break anyhting youll get use to it sooner or later one more thing this game does have great memory if you load into a server more than once each time youll load faster the first time you may have to download stuff the next youll have it you may go from hours on the first load to minutes on the next to seconds after the 30th load in its always nice to know gmod has some level of niceness whatever just get the damn game and enjoy it youll love it just keep your addons on the low and it breaks often
recommended
addictive gamemodes and great gameplay only issue is texture problems if you do not own other games
recommended
roleplayed as hitler and paid hobos to have a massive orgy then gassed them all 1010 would play again more than worth the $10
recommended
its a game for those who are creative and well if youre not creative you can play gamemodes like ttt prophunt darkrp murder
recommended
how not to crash after spawning wait another 1 hour to make sure garrys mod has loaded everything once you spot a lua error you must freeze in place and make a few steps away from your pc after spawning an object via the spawn menu you must wait 10 minutes if the game freezes you must go to the church pray for the jewish give all your money to an elder and dance on top of a garbage truck all within 10 minutes after installing an addon you must restart steam five times if you need to reload a weapon dont just drop it on the floor and spawn another one doesnt matter that you had 33123213 more clips if the game despite your best efforts crashes you must take your pc and sink it in holy water 5 times then go to the cemetary burrow it put a black rose a white rose cabbage a mushroom and the beard of a goat in the same order leave it there 10 days and then go buy a new pc 1110 would go through all that again

modding has never been so pain free and enjoyable gmod provides regular players with the bare bone essentails to create brilliant feats of engineering and allows advance players to create player models maps and more and implement them into the game with ease running on the source engine this game can easily handle many assets at one time including whatever specialties added like trails thrusters ect and of course still has the brilliance of the physics engine that can lead to some very funny and unpredicable events gmod alone contains two gamemodes the standard sandbox and the trouble in terrorist town gamemode ttt and once you get tired of those you can easily find a million fan created game modes that are full of enjoyable people to play with giving this game a extreme amount of replay value for the small price they ask for outside of fan modding gmod is fully able to literaly rip out the files from other source engine games that are on your hardrive and allows you to work with them instantly without and pain in the  proting files but i really do recemend that you play mainly with mates or with a community you can visit regularly as a lot of the fun can come from this gmod is a very massive and growing game with a very tiny pricetag worth the purchase without a doubt

garrys mod is a sandbox an amazing sandbox that is you can spawn stuff and construct things both simple and complex you can spawn characters and shoot them in the face you can construct a large flying table spawn characters and smash them in the face using your large flying table or you could also play one of the many communitymade mods ranging from zombie killing to roleplay its hard not to enjoy this game

the important question in any investment is it it worth my time and hard earned money to answer this question yes garrys mod is unique in the sense that all servers on there are not valves servers theyre completely community based that means if you dispise one community of a certain gamemode you just hop on a new server gamemodes all community created and there is a ton of them dont like one thing try another dont like that go into singleplayer getting lonely go onto multiplayer or create a server still hate this game well  you it has a source engine which means console and commands well what does that mean that means that you can change any setting on the game of course there are boundaries on servers but on singleplayer open the console and type sv_cheats 1 and you have access to any command in game and there are tons want to change the sensitivity of a zoom on a sniper rifle you can and in decimals want to change your fps or set its max for complete control of lag type fps_max number normal is 300 even with these changes and on highest graphics you will run the game with little to no lag of course there are acceptions spawning in items i undoubtfully love this game it has a quality no other game can compare and it may say sandbox but really its everything expcept maybe mobas heh someone make a server for that want to be a dog wearing a baby with rockets for eyeballs you absolutely can want to be a watermelon well you can want to be sonic you can even if you get bored of vanilla you can go onto the workshop and subscribe to stuff to put into your singleplayer you can be any custom thing you can imagine you can even create playermodels of course you need an external program but you can still dont think this game is good enough for you well sir i bid you farewell as you do not have reason not to youre not good enough for this game the end

garrys mod is a fun game but there is some problems with the game first off all when your trying to download addons its just slow and glitchy then when you try to play the game after downloading the addon it like lags or glitches out completly and yes crashes 2nd of all why do we need to get addons cant it be like when we first got it and its just in the q menu its so much easier 3rd is that the admens in role play and stuff dont even do their job or get mad when someone actually puts them in jail because they broke a rule in role play and i was watching this youtube video where there was a admin recording himself and he was just lazy other wize this game is pretty good i guess so i guess 6310 what should i reveiw next maybe the sims
recommended
why dont you already own this game edit 5415 i made this review a long time ago in 2013 if i believe a lot of people are giving this game bad reviews due to all the little kids and five nights at freddys mods yes i do think that its bad in those parts but this game shouldnt be not recommended due to the public server population singleplayer is fun but i think the game really shines when you play it with a close friend or two either youre laughing so hard you cant breathe or ragekilling your buddy for ing up your build pretty fun if you ask me

garrys mod is a sandbox game based on half life 2s source engine the games content is mostly player made including the gamemodes you can play the models weapons textures and other scriptbased entities written in lua examples for popular gamemodes 1 sandbox creatvity is the only limit here build giant houses warmashines spaceships or even complexer stuff out of models and constraints and for the advanced builder out of simulated chips that allow you to create little programms for example a flying spaceship a minigame 2 trouble in terorist town the players are devided in two groups the innocent and the traitors the traitors have to silently murder the innocents while the innocents have to follow clues they find on victims found by a detective with special tools like a dna scanner which is a player aswell its like playing werewulf or cobs and robbers just online and with more action 3 prophunt the players are in two groups the props and the hunters the props can turn into any prop they find and must hide in maps like cs_office or custom maps while the hunter searches for the prop and has to kill it to win 4 darkrp its a roleplay gamemode for multiple players where you can be a cop citizen or even a major start a gundealer carreer if you like

greatest sandbox game known to man its a must buy i got this game when i was in third grade and currently im in ninth my friends showed it to me and i never quite understood it but the community is great its a community driven game without the community youre left with a blank slate the game modes are abundant with players ranging in all ages and locations so many game modes to choose from that every experience is different

lots of fun to be had in garrys mod play sandbox and do random stuff like build things kill people play with mods and other peoples creations or play other gamemodes you can get through the game or steamworkshop like trouble in terrorist town melon bomber prop hunt and loads more you will need to get the right textures for a lot of this stuff though by buying and installing various valve games overall pretty fun aint nobody got time for that a gun

ttt great modfun to play but only if you join a decent server or play with some friends prop hunt used to spend most of my free time playing thisbecause i found a great community techsource and it was so fun playing with them darkrp so many ing kidsstill a great mod though sandbox im so bad at thislike i cant build  other modsyou have to try them yourselfbut first fin some friends or a good community my point isthis is a great game or a modwhatever but its all about the communityif you just join some  random servers youll probably end up deleting the game after a few hours but if you join the right servers youll end up playing the game on a daily basis d

garrys mod is one of those rare games that you can play again and again and never really bore of you can find other games and invest hundreds of hours into them but at the end of the month you find yourself wishing you could just play some more garrys mod i dont have over 450 hours into it for nothing and compared to some of the people ive met and talked to over the internet thats not even that much to invest into a single game its setup into different gamemodes theres classic sandbox where you can build and screw around on any amount of maps with npcs and other mechanics theres trouble in terrorist town ttt where a few people are randomly selected as traitors and try to kill the other players on the server while innocents and detectives are trying to figure out who the traitors are i owned a server for ttt and i have to admit most of my hours are into asmuch a few things to note first off its not the most welloptimized game out there i have quite an expensive computer but it still takes forever to load into the game and will crash periodically for no reason i used to play on a darkrp server another gamemode called serious roleplaying hell or srh for short and while that thing had a hell of a lot of serious items for roleplaying i am so sorry the game lagged the devil out of itself while a lot of games would be able to handle something like that without toomuchtrouble another thing to keep in mind is that it has workshop support maps npcs models ragdolls machines weapons and loads of other misc content fills garrys mod and has been on the second page of workshop contributators for a while if not the first one overall between the content the price especially 2 years later when the price has dropped $10 all the dfferent gamemodes besides sandbox ttt and darkrp there is also prophunt murder a dayz spinoff and countless others its a great game thats totally worth it cheers

garrys mod is a hands down great game in many unusual ways it consists of many models and characters from your beloved games for you to test with its amazing how steam games you buy and download will be stored in the game files for you to play around with it includes workshop which gives you the ability to download mods tweaks and just anything that can possibly amuse the human brain making servers are great and easy to host when hosting a server all your mods will be plugged into the server so you and your friends can have a great modded server to play on there are also many other game modes such as gmod zombiesdarkrpsandbox and many others too theres awesome ideas so why not bring it to the virtual camera thats right you can record from only a click of your mouse in game so you can bring all your wild fantasys to life its runs very well on all personal computers laptops and desktops my team tested a 2001 windows xp model and it runs at 30 fps on medium settings which is great for all you gamers out there who want to play a great game for a small amount of coin and not to mention it has a great community that welcomes all ages to play there are no limits to what you can do i highly recommend this game to all users with only a small price to pay of $1000

this game is the best game because it is whatever you want it to be you can drive a car with a thruster off a ramp and see how much air you get or make two ragdolls kiss or design a giant stompy robot or even just shoot at things its because of this flexibility that garrys mod continues to entertain me while other games on my account are left gathering dust in the perspective of price to time played this game has been a better value than anything else on steam

what is garrys mod garrys mod is a hard thing to describe you could say its another communitymade mod to source that was approved by valve or you could say its a pure incarnation of the internet and all its current shenanigans whichever works start up the game and youll immediately notice a lot and i mean a lot  of pink and black squares this is the placeholder texture for all missing textures you dont have to fix this either buy the game counterstrike source or download its textures which are completely free and legal to obtain just make sure you get them from a trusted website on to the actual review garrys mod is anything you can build and everything you can imagine it is the ultimate sandbox experience you can create contraptions and test them out in singleplayer or have the most fun you can have online tf2 reference p and play around with your buddies dont have buddies garrys mod has those too there are loads of gamemodes to choose from ttt prophunt and darkrp being the most popular you can even make them yourself want to make a my little pony roleplay gamemode do it  want to create your own community addicted to cars do it want to invite some friends to a server and eat some virtual cake do it you really cant cram what garrys mod is into one review but to basically sum it up you can eat balls to gain health 1010

yeah its ok

i never thought i would like to play this as a primary game but after playing a little bit i realised it is far more than just a building game that people make ragdolls go crazy or twist their faces around i host a trouble in terrorist town server on garrys mod and i love it the game starts up and it randomly selects 25% of the players to become traitors and their mission is to kill the innocent players it keeps you on edge and forces you to logically deduce who the traitors are and who you need to kill in order to survive there are also role playing gamemodes that you can drive a car around and live a crazy life garrys mod has the potential to play anything bhop ttt rolplaying prophunt jailbreak basically anything that people can think up it is an extremely moddable game

fairys mod the unrelenting force of bugs this game has alot of bugs and lags on online servers which i hate i will put good points and bad about this good classic graphics alot of addons and things to do interesting items nice movement [easy] okay controls nice ragdolls nice mods [prop hunt cinema] bad glitchy laggy glitchy multiplayer buggy multiplayer servers take forever to load when first time joining the game if you have 30 addonsmods it will take you 1h to install all them so you can use them only 2 default maps no legs [lol] buggy ragdolls [sometimes] some controls not working sometimes items menu not showing up as you can see there is much more bad things about this game but still i recommend this since i have 40 hours on this have fun  rate 1010 edit now i got 130 hours on this it is amazing im experiencing less lags and bugs so just get this game no regrets at all d my rate right now 1210

mehbest marketed thing on steam gotta hand it to the developers though making millions off the steam workshop and valve for their marketing prowess with this game if you dont feel like reading a bunch of bs about how to use this mod then dont bother buying it youre just  away money on something you dont understand and didnt look into before you bought it dont buy it just becaue everyone else owns it they only own it because valve has marketed the ever loving s out of it and everyone just bought it at some point because you cant go anywhere without seeing it on sale dont forget to buy the other 15 gmaes you need to play most of the crap on here to sling racist terms around with 12 year olds and throw turds around

its pretty cool with friends and for trolling little baby people who have no self estem and need their mothers to wipe their tushies you can do stuff and hear annoying teenage admins kick ban and gag people for having fun because their parents dont love them and the get bullied at school this the one slice of their peace they can have so they are complete jerks to everyone who wants to share it with them 9510 its ok

multiple ways of playing this game you can build a huge tower with watermelons play ttt with some friends play prop hunt one of the best gamemodes for fun in my opinion and other multiple gamemodes garrys mod or gmod for short opens up a new perspective for gamers who just want to have fun creating crazy new things from catapaults or nyan cat launchers however you always get that pesky little bugger who always tries to wreck the fun

this is one of my favourite games out there ive always like garrys mod because facepunch studios made the game in such a way so it would be very easy for people to mod and create addons for the community are constantly creating addons for this game so its hard to become bored ive always said that garrys mod is really good because its the kind of game that you could recreate any other game in with some time and effort i would reccomend that people buy this because of the low price and the hours of fun that can be had

if you are looking for a game to play with friends garrys mod has tons of fun game options for you to play with your best friends cx although i also do recommend getting counter strike source css for the textures or else some textures will be pink and black and some items will be giant error signs otherwise great game 3

this game is my favorite steam game so far its a halflife 2 mod you can play sandbox mode trouble in terrorist town prop hunt murder deathrun dayz and much much much more all modes available in singleplayer but only sandbox mode makes sense to play on single playerit does have blood but not too much in sandbox mode you can spawn nearly anything soda machines cars people weapons cans boxes and much much much much much more you can even download even more stuff to mess around with worth twice its cost
recommended
source engine breaker simulator if you ever wanted to pose gman and alyx having sexual intercourses in hl2 you can do it in gmod  thats how the game even started to be developed as in the first place  the modding is quite extensive you can create new maps gamemodes entities weapons from scratch to create anything you want soccer deathmatch roleplay and whatever or if you dont care about creating you can just go on the sandbox gamemode and build stuff like you want and if youre lazy enough you can download trough the  albeit a bit broken  workshop the sore spot of gmod is that two gamemodes are really popular  darkrp and ttt  and theyre overshadowing everything else and people only care about those two and nothing else this creates a closed loop where nothing new can go in due to the community  and server browser too  if you dont care about the stuff above and just want to play with your friends to screw with ragdolls from other games and do whatever you want in sandbox this is the game for you just be wary of the community

hi i gonna review the so called garrys mod ah i remember when i bought this about 15 year ago i bought this game for 10 euro no regrets its like a new game everytime you download a new addon as a pc veteran i think its a really well made game with a few glitches not many this game is one of those must play before i die game this game was a mod in the beginning a mod for half life 2 this is one of the best games i everplayed and you wont regret buying this the sandbox mode is what i play the most i love to play alone and make up scenes where im a soldier and im in a war between the rebels and the combines buy this instead of that what is it called goat simulator or the stopid bad rats 1010 spy reviews

recommended
this game requires thinking logic physics etc if you want some supercool machine however if you want to just mess around like spawn something and attatch a bunch of rockets and zoom around the map you can also have fun with that too as for multiplayer i have played on quite a few of them many of them have mods from freeze tag to team deathmatch to zombie survival or just plain custom maps with a few extra tools anyway you look at it garrys mod will be there to entertain you for hours at a time
recommended
a great game to play with your friends you can do pretty much anything in there which makes it even more fun that being said there are loads of different mods to choose from so everyone is able to find something to play here you dont really see how time passes while playing this game so thats another plus when trying to kill time on your own

my squadron of marines and i sat content and lazily around a roaring fireplace enjoying a bedtime story master chief was reading us a story called go the  to sleep all was well until suicide bombers found and killed us in the name of allah

one of the most strangely addicting games ive ever played ive had it for 1 or 2 weeks now and with the help of friends i was able to learn the ropes relatively quickly ive had it for a short amount of time and have already logged 172 hours on garrysmod its so fun its rediculous when i first saw this i thought it was so sketchy and didnt even look fun but i broke down out of boredom and bought it this $14 now $10 was probably one of the best $14 or $60 ive ever spent on a game
recommended
garrys mod is worth its cost for weeks even months of gaming joy
recommended
outstanding fun virtually endless playability

im happy knowing my hypothesis of steam users being functionally autistic is accurate positive highlights of my great time spent on garrys mod getting two children banned from a darkrp server killing everyone innocent and traitor in ttt without evidence and stating over the mic i had dna killing off a hl2rp community that circlejerks over eachother with their dark and edgy charactersusernames dealing with admins with superiority complexes hearing the cries and lamentations of children as i rdm them senselessly building outer toll gayt heaven in conjunction with a fellow friend meeting new friends and restablishing old friendships with those who know how to have fun roleplaying as a white supremacist roleplaying as an abusive cop becoming a space marine and having everyone laugh at your toned upper body becoming a whale hunter learning how to be a better father cons admins community screaming children darkrp trouble in terrorist town halflife 2 rp waiting two months to join a server bronies furries stoners youtube celebrities turning this game into more of a daycare friends becoming addicted to garrys mod 510 its okay the community and lack of new gamemodes really make this unreplayable after a while
recommended
what can i say about garrys mod well its the kind of game that you find yourself putting in countless hours of your life into this game is very fun but if you wish to play multiplayer like ttt or prophunt you also need other games like counter strike source portal  and half life to get all of the textures to play so if your wondering about buying it you should i give this game a 1010 by far
recommended
this game is just simply amazing creative and fun best game to play with your mates
recommended
taught me haw 2 physx dan outta dan

do you like garrys mod then you should buy this do you not like garrys mod then you should buy this

a funny game a cool multiplayer sistemkilled by a wall 10010
recommended
after playing over 100 hours of the game i can 100% say i still dont know how to use gmod 10 definitely would play again
recommended
by far the greatest purchase you can make for your computer i have spent many hours playing this game and there is so much to do you can create fancy artwork by posing ragdolls and props like me or you can become good at building things with lua and wiremod you can also play all these cool rpg servers and games like trouble in terrorist town stranded and deathrun great game counterstrike  garrys mod bundle source is on sale until december 3rd i would highly reccomend buying it
recommended
1 darkrp  2 sandbox 3 trouble in terrorist town 4 zombie survival 5 militaryrp 6 amazingness if you want a cheap sandbox that you can do anything with i recommend you get this game it is simply amazing now back to darkrp
recommended
im no critic when i say get the game alright after a total of nine hours playing the game numerous mod testing and observations i`ve come to conclude that this game is meant for any type of gamer lots of ideal game modes game maps mods for extra weapons and the above i really like how skins just make a whole diffrent experience while gaming in a new world as one of your favorite characters by valve and etc lots of sick block busting weapons call out to you when subscribing to mods at the workshop i highly recomend to check out what i am subscribed to thanks to a little someone and to try out the parkour mods adds realism to the already fictionized game world this universal game gets you addicted after you finnally load that level whether or not your online with peeps or just experimenting on your own blank canvas i highly recomend a decent computer video card nvidia if i spelt it right or anything that can run fallout 3  elder scrolls iv  oblivion bethesda  and at least good internet to get a good ping most of my friends play team fortress 2 and my ping level to mvm servers or regular comunity servers is at your standard 69 70 not all bad especially for gmod but besides some lag spikes and frozen computer screens you need to close down immediately with the task mannager the game is not that all a pain i really like weapons and the maps umm not really much to say now but to thank again those who also recomended gmod to me thankyou im just passing down the torch to one of the best fps of all time side notes  i may add more to this if i find more stuff out but so far besides how my pc handles it its fine its worth the $999 but sometimes they hype down to $499 or one time $199 on the market but really all togethger just get the game

ah garrys mod the game with most under 14s since call of duty garrys mods possiblities are pretty much endless as their are tons of mods out their and more coming everyday this allows for good filmaking or just plain diccking around the multiplayer is something to be wary of as there is pretty much a pre pubesent child in every server going around killing people or deleting everything your trying to create some servers try to restrict this by allowing no killing or deleting but this can also lead to other types of trolling like someone puting a fence over a door so no one can escape its pretty much a lose lose situation just be prepared to deal with these problems or make your own server with a passcode so you save yourself the brain tumors that are the trolls another problem you might face is the downloads on custom servers that will take 10 minutes and might not even work mind you this is only one mode of the multiplayer as the name gives away garrys mod is pretty much a modders wet dream their are mods galore some of note are ttttrouble in terrorist town best played with friends murder and prop hunt these are game mods that add a whole new gameplay experience but you can also get mods for guns cars peoplepretty much anything you can think of its in the workshop the singleplayer for garrys mod is pretty much for testing out your mods or just having fun with them by yourself it allows you to set up scences or build awesome contraptions without any interference from the high balls all in all garrys mod is a good experience with some friends in the multiplayer and is a good tool or filmaking and fun the communtiy more or less is pretty cool where you can find some pretty humorous blokes aye i give garrys mod a 910 just bring ear protection

garrys mod is an essential for the creative or destructive mind to enjoy in its vanilla state gmod provides many opportunities and tools to express your desire to create toilet submarines or explode about 50 npcs with the rpg gmod is a hugely flexible and sometimes unstable sandbox when you mess around with the possibilities including adding things like wiremod to unlock the possibilities or confusion  gmod however is not standalone and requires a source engine game to power the experience which shouldnt really be difficult to achieve especially with tf2 being f2p the game is also not only a sole experience but an amazing multiplayer world where anything can happen which isnt always a good thing the multiplayer world is a interesting one and some addons would be needed to avoid people messing up what you make maps gamemodes and infinitely more pieces of content can be added at your leisure but performance will take a hit in most cases as a flexible sandbox you would probably expect to be able to do almost anything and gmod pretty much does just that for a measly few pounds or dollars you can unlock a unique world that has almost no bounds to your creativity which is what a sandbox is all about highly recommended rated 9710

one of the best sandboxes ive ever played if you have never seen garrys mod youre in for a ride tons upon tons of usercreated content guarenteed for hours and hours of gameplay note hl2 and css are vital for playing this game without the two this game turns into an errorbox simulator

this game allows alot of freedom contingent upon the gamemode this is a very good game enviornment for those with a creative personality and a knack for self taught talents iv played this for awhile now and im avid at constructing badass contraptions this can also be handy for finding model paths for those who use source sdk
recommended
the best sandbox type game ive ever played i wouldnt reccomend it if you only plan to do single player cause it gets a bit boring but the multiplayer modes and even just a flat world with some friends are some of the best times ive ever had with video games
recommended
this is one of the most random games i have ever played it is very very fun and you can get many many addons fun to play with and yeah just if you want ithave a great time

garrys mod is whats wrong with america by giving nearly unlimited power into the hands of shrek filled twelve year old nerd lords you create games such as murder in prop town and trouble hunt this game is satans spawn and goes against the good christian morals as a member of the 1% this game goes against reality if you die in the game you can respond in real life i can loot your body and  on your grave  without getting banned horrible game 10donkey better luck next time lucifer

if you want a sandbox this is it if you want a train simulator this is it if you want a flight simulator this is it if you want any game this is it it gives you the resources to do everything you just have to use them its a great game for every thing for 999 this is a great all around game
recommended
i recommend this to anyone who likes to play lots of different games because garrys mod has so many different gamemodes to choose from if you get bored of one to can just go play a different gamemode
recommended
in most of gaming i would say garrys mod would be a pretty unique type of game in its own way without any singeplayer campaigns or running off an fps shooter this game has made some top notch stuff in its latest years players have built giant robots and towers while others create action scenes like out of movies garrys mod doesnt have a campaign but makes up for it with limitless opportunities of playing in the multiplayer world with its many unique gamemodes made by perticular developers or a group of coders this game is certainly one of a kind this game isnt meant for people are who love campaigns and are not as laid back but if you are this would be the game for you  goddessreviews

very fun game great way to connect with friends and meet new people

epic game great community who loves to make the game different in so many ways no matter what you like rp fps simulation or anything else than there will most likely be something for you in this game 1010
recommended
limited only by your imagination garrys mod gives you a lego bin full of video game peices from as many video games as there are out there with these peices and a large colletion of fun and interesting tools gmod lets you run wild from the start blow things up make a giant robot out of road cones and washing machines make a helicopter out of a lenght of rebar and toliet if you can think it up and make a plan for it you can very likely make it in gmod and if the virtually limitless potential of single player wasnt enough of an insentive there is a truely massive online storeworkshop that allows you to increase you parts props models npc characters and everything for one low price of memory everything is free  save for the game  and on top of that there are many many many multiplayer servers where you can mess around with others and have funs of goofy crazy fun just remember with multiplayer people can and will be moderatly insanecrazy afterall there is no social ettiqute so you never know how one server will be when you first get in but dont worry if one server is full of rude people or children screaming at one another there will allways be another hundered to check out
recommended
i reccomend this sexy game
recommended
by far the most epic game that i have ever touched you can pretty much do everything from rp to escaping pedo bear to kill terriorsts this gamemod is so great just make sure you buy counter strike source to have the textures down so many things that you can do with this game even if you are playing by yourself i would say this is the best pc game and i switch from ps4 to pc for like 7 months straight cuz i was addicted to this game
recommended
another steam necessity anyone can find enjoyment in this game from simply using it as a way to practise fighting enemies or for creating complex and exciting contraptions with the large and expanding toolset provided by garry and the countless modders taking advantage of the handy lua system that has been implemented into the game with countless gamemodes maps and things to do this wont get boring quickly the recent changes have made installing mods much simpler and possible within the game so big thanks to garry for continuing to maintain this excellent game
recommended
this is overall a decent game  you can literally do anything you want and there is no story you can put in any props ragdolls and npcs you can create your own levels funny animations mess around make race tracks among thousands of other options it also take elements from every source engine game halflife 2 team fortress 2 portal and counterstrike to name a few and implements them into the game you can totally mess up halflife and portal this way which is extremely fun the graphics are the same as just about every other source engine game which are awesome also if all of this wasnt fun enough then there is also a toy box basically the toy box allows you to download user made creations while you play the game these can be new maps weapons and entities overall its fun to play 
recommended
you have so much freedom in what you can do in this game its basically a sandbox with no limits either you can sit back and create a little animation using ragdolls or play on some of the various gamemodes downloadable i highly recommend trying this out
recommended
always fun to play around with

it was a cold saturday night my friends and i were very bored so we decided to go onto a darkrp server in garrys mod i scrolled through the jobs theif cop pet etc nothing was interesting until i saw it cult member i knew what had to be done i chose that job and bought a building and created my church my friends soon followed this was known as the cult of revomods my friends and i went out and started asking people to come with us then we saw him he was in a female vessel but we knew i knew it was him the champion of revomods we captured him and locked him in the back room of the church we took people who attended our sermons and locked them in there with him he devored the corrupt souls of the world however he soon became corrupt we sent him back to the heavens to live with revomods only he came back stronger and with a cleansed soul we kidnapped and locked more and more mortals in the name of revomods our church grew larger and larger people did not like how large we were becoming so they constantly raided and killed us then revomods came down from the heavens to help us he dropped a 15 second bomb in the church i locked the door people screamed saying let me out let me out one guy was carrying the bomb in his hands there were no survivors revomods granted my friends and i another vessel to do his bidding we moved the church and thats when we fell the champion was no where to be found however there were several murders around the city commited by him the mayor was one then came the raiders yet again everyone dying screaming for help and crying for it all to end so it did the church of revomods was disbanded and never seen again i checked the server lists for the server however it was not there i dont know what happened to it but it was a crazy night praise revomods praise darkrp revomods was the owner of the server

ever experienced a game with over 100 different mods with hundreds and even thousands of people playing garrys mod also commonly referred to as gmod has many different modifications with one of the largest growing steam community workshops out there full of fantastic creations made by the community for the community now you may think that this is just another game like minecraft but i can guarentee this isnt it doesnt have the best community out there but somewhere in the crowd there are always people willing to help out and have fun the game itself is a 1st person styled game which can only really be described as interesting this game is built up from the community and not so much from the developers so you can obviously tell it has a large input from what people want instead of what the developers want instead with hundreds of different modifications out there full of people playing youll never get bored of what may be instore the next time you start up this game and if this simple review isnt good enough for you maybe the different picture everytime you start up garrys mod gmod may interest you
recommended
garrys mod is a good game even if youre not good at the construction i personally enjoy exploring the servers created by others and seeing what they have innovated you may want to consider buying the counter strike source package because even though both are great games in my opinion there is no doubt that css will provide a full online gaming experience
recommended
if your the sort of guy who likes inflating zombies and making them float aimlessly around a room or building a diving board only to then blow it to hell without jumping it then this is the ideal game for you
recommended
this it the best thing ever

amazing game best i have ever played
recommended
this game as limitless possibilites and a crazy amount of gamemodes garrys mod is a game you are almost obligated to have if you want to consider yourself a real pc gamer although it does rely on lots of non open source textures like that of coutnerstrike source half life 2 and other valve games of that natures there are still a few gamesmodes which you can play without them i generally spend my time around serious clockwork rp servers and think that is the highlight of the garrys mod experience both in gameplay quality and community quality
recommended
its a fun game to be creative and imaginite as much as you like play with friends and more this sandbox pc game isnt just a ordinary game it has 2 sides to it 1sandbox 2rp in rp your in a diffrent world where you basiclly have as much fun as you want in your own life you could be a medic criminal a cop its all your choice bit also remember rules apply such as rdm sandbox is just imaginite building make helicopters make jets and cars make your own addon and just have the fun of whatever you build personaly i love this game you get addicted to it pretty easy but thats just my opinion anyways cya

look at my hours that should describe it enough right not only has roleplaying in this game for several years given me thousand of hours of enjoyment but it also helped my writing skills and made me the linguist i am today not interested in roleplay how about base building base wars zombie survival of various flavors pirate ship wars running through a maze of traps with dozens of other players while three players are determined to set traps to kill you all space build there are dozens more gamemodes and new ones come out every couple of days

awesome half life was awesome this is what all sandbox games should be like
recommended
the best and most realistic 3d sandbox i know so far source engine provides quite realistic physics not enough for a simulator though which when combined with the tools in gmod and many addons available for it give you a huge ammount of possibilities from making a car boat plane or a spaceship with oxygen energy and fuel limitations to a working cannon radar hologran or even a primitive computer you can program microchips by a simplified clike language or wire several sensors buttons and gates together and you can enhance your contraptions with these things to make your very own sentry turret autonomous drones alarm system etc perfect for understanding how computerstuff or programming works however the physics usually spaz and lag on complex contraptions no matter how strong your computer is keep in mind that this is a hl2 mod and in hl2 you pretty much cant find even 2 boxes welded together and to make a huge spaceship you can probably say good bye to destroyability walking around onflight or realistic weightmanagement maps are also quite limited in this its enough for police chases or heli fights but definitely not good for jets or for simulating a b737 flight you wouldnt even takeoff probably and the complexity and diversity of this game also means that there are some bugs and performance issues however the community is big enough to help you with pretty much everything on steam or facepunch forums gmod is not only about building and doing aimless things it gets way more funny when you invite friends and do some deathmatches derby races or just mess around together a perfect friday afternoon timewaster but what i wanted to say is that it has many gamemodes such as ttt gabens most favorite game roleplay zombie survival where you can even nail props together to barricade yourself prop hunt zmod stalker sledbuild slender and many other things which you can freely get from the workshop when you get bored by one and want to play something else so if you love playing around with physics building cars submarines trains planes or other vehicles programming complex things which doesnt waste several kilometers of free space like in minecraft doing funny poses and taking screenshots or making ingame movies arresting some bad guys playing a survival shooting zombiesterrorists or just to crap your pants with friends on horror maps then gmod is a game for you if you have enough time to learn all this of course
recommended
everyone should own this you would be a r3tard not to it isnt just some silly sandbox game where you put models into silly poses it includes full differnet gamemodes that make it worth it but make sure you own counter strikesource as it uses a lot of the models etc content from that game for many of the custom maps and games modes avaible
recommended
you can turn into doge with an addon that you can eat pills in 1010

garrys mod is one of the best sandboxcommunity driven games on pc and possible in gaming if you are going to buy this you should buy css with it since many game modes use those textures in it sandbox mode is nice you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes i would recommend ttt as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in gmod gamemodesactaully it is the engine but eh there are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garrys mod and you will get you 10525 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers a great game with a good community if you know where to look

ah garrys mod what else can be said about this beauty of a game that hasnt already been said before whoever had the idea to take half life team fortress 2 and every other valve sourcebased game and packing it into a cheap little package is one brilliant guy this game offers an endless amount of playtime given the vast amount of gamemodes hell you could get hundreds of hours out of a single mode dont feel like building crazy stuff in sandbox then hop on over to trouble in terrorist town had enough of murdering your fellow terrorists prop hunts always a blast to play the community is where this game shines creating some truly amazing addons to the game if you dont have this game already get it i guarentee you wont be disappointed

garrys mod is often regarded as the most historically relevant electronic weapon in the history of the world garrys mod runs on a nextnextgen super engine often refered to as the source engine and was outlawed until the second canadian civil war in which it was used by the canadian freedom fighters against the canadian fascist legion in retaliation to their halflife 2 source weapon garrys mod not only uses all assets from halflife 2 but combines those of other source weapons used by seperate unrelated organizations including counterstrike source used by terrorists in the middle east and team fortress 2 popular among mercenaries intertnationally using each weapon to their advantage the canadian fascist legion was inevitably defeated and the canadian freedom fighters next attempted to dispose of garrys mod soon however they found that garrys mod had not only acheived sentience but was spreading through the internet at an alarming rate what surprised the freedom fighters even more than this was that garrys mod wasnt destructive at all on the contrary it soon turned itself into a stable and usable program similar in style to that of a video game the video game company valve took notice and soon released garrys mod on its online gaming platform steam after the extreme success of garrys mod valve made stable versions of all source weapons and released them as video games on steam quinn matthew  major modern wars and advances 20202056 the history of the world new york muenster publishing 2056 337 print

garrys mod is one of if not the best game ive ever played it has one of the best communities ive ever seen in a game and pretty much whereever you go youll find friendly people the amount of variety and things you can do with this game is unlimited as the gamemodes in multiplayer range from roleplay to deathmatch to hunting to survival to whatever even if you just enjoy a game for its single player being a sandbox game you can do literally whatever you want and if you take a few minutes to browse the workshop for addons then youre guaranteed to have a 200% better time tldr you can launch exploding babies from a rocket launcher 1110
recommended
garrys mod has to be the best game ever at just $1000 you have a variety of gamemodes consisting of trouble in terrorist town darkrp jailbreak deathrun dayz prophunt murder minigames and many more there are many unique players that play this game as well as many chances to become a moderatoradmin on your favorite server if you live up to the expectations create a base and go out to mug people and steal or build a gun shop with guards defending it sell drugs and illegal guns or be a swat and bust into the criminals house to put him behind bars i currently have spent well over two years on this amazing game i recommend it to anyone and everyone give me a friend request and well play together
recommended
well once you get into the game the first words you will say is what in the living hell did i just buy if so that means it is working if not it is still working but your mind is not working correctly so i would get your brain looked at
recommended
i dont really know where to begin with gmod at its core its nothing more than a sandbox to play in no goals or points or leveling up just a gravity gun and an arsenal of crazy crap to spawn in the interface feels a bit clunky to me it took a while to learn even the most basic menu navigation keys but once you get the hang of how to work your way around youll realize that the user generated content for this game is astronomical both in quality and quantity i absolutely love trouble in terrorist town and prop hunters id reccoment picking up garrys mod just for those two game modes d

so addicting fgts

does a giant truck that shoots lasers and flies make much sense to you if the answer is no then you have not played garrys mod if the answer is yes but you have not played garrys mod you should se a pyschologist anyway this game is a sandbox modification of half life 2 designed towell you design it you define what is logical practical or physically possible with props from most source games used to define your world this game is limitless if you love designing user friendly programming or just beating everything senseless with a ragdoll this game is for you
recommended
if u haz rain u would play this game fro the jailbreak
recommended
garrys mod is the brainchild of garry newman who wanted to create a physicsbased sandbox based on the source engine which also allows other players to create mods for the game too so the game has a truly massive amount of variety in singleplayer you can build your own npc arena populate it with conflicting characters and watch them kill each other on zombie survival be a human fighting for your life while a zombie horde slowly infects the rest of your band of survivors on trouble in terrorist town take control of a traitor terrorist and collaborate with other traitors to wipe out all the innocent terrorists either through the use of a suicide bomb or sniping each innocent off one by one and in the excellent dark rp a multiplater roleplaying mod built for the game you start of as a citizen but if you wish you can choose a different job such as a police officer and take on crime headon or a mob boss with a gang the size of everyone in the server called the tunnel snakes who own the cops through successful blackmail and bribery or a sadistic gun dealer whos only pleasure is to kill everyone he sees or a hobo and beg for money or a hitman charging $100 per kill or just be a citizen and build this game is fantastic

recommended
insanely amazing game there are tons of game modes with more coming out to the day its graphics arent state of the art but they are enjoyable still garrys mod will fulfill the derp in your life i recomend prop hunt trouble in terrorist town death run gmod tower murder and sandbox if you get the hang of it sandbox will be very dificuly at first but once you understand and maybe look at a tutorial it is addicting 10 out of 10 easy
recommended
this game is just great you can basically do whatever you want to its also good for making animations with it has lots of fun gamemodes a great community and support for most games definitely worth my money

garrys mod a game created for thy gods a simple mortal may look upon garrys mod and say to theeself yo this gaim sux however with only a simple glance at the surface of this gaming miracle it is logical for one to assume that the game is lacking content or any point at all i crusty bumnuts beg to differ all my life i have been searching for purpose for a destination to bring myself to i have questioned reality and mortality i hath searched far and wide beyond the limits of human imagination it was when i had stumbled upon a beauty of virtual glory know to mankind as garrys mod that i had finally found my lifes purpose my eyes hath been opened i saw heaven i saw hell i saw life i saw death i saw myself in the stars and in the earth among my people among the gods life was revealed unto me and i saw for the first time in eternity i saw what words could not be gathered to represent i saw the line between reality and another world i saw garry and garry saw me together garry and i forever forever in the land where grass is flat and the sun was high and the props flew throughout the land and the sky fell into the earth and the earth flew into the world the world of life and the world of death and into myself and into garry and i smiled

recommended
genre sandbox reccommendation anybody that likes even a little humor should play this game playtime more than 20 hours 300 hours if you have friends to play with rating 910 review if youre one of those people who are more like casual gamers and love messing around and creating random things this game is for you lots of derping and no goals and there are even many custom fanmade gamemodes available if you get bored the game obviously allows for massive mod support allowing you to use almost anything from whatever popular show game etc in the game as long as it is in the workshop and is uptodate with the latest version of the game you can for example fly planes and helicopters drive need for speed cars interact with scripted reworked npcs like a pikachu and so on one thing to note about this game though the community sucks  interacting with it can give many headaches most of the gmod players are kids so be prepared to mute players if the server lets you which is another small let down
recommended
garrys mob is just per fun with so many addons you can get the game is endless fun garrys mod should be on everyones wishlist

in my opinion this is the best sandbox game ever made easily beating others like minecraft and blockland why is it so good you can do anything you want anything want to ride a bathtub on wheels you can do that because in garrys mod there is no limit to what you can do if you want something to happen make it happen theres just some assembly required and thats your job

its a combination of half life counterstrike team fortress call of duty pokemon my little pony and even food yes food how could you not get this game
recommended
this is a great sandbox game with so much to do great selection on items in its workshop really fun game to play with friends
recommended
this is a great mod to burn time on it is full of different types of games  like trouble in terrorist town or zombie survival not to mention countless ways to experiment with items and gravguns however the only downside is if you buy it without counter strike source be prepared for half a dozen error objects
recommended
its buggy its awkward but really its anyones game the appeal of garrys mod is that it really stretches the limits of the source engine that can lead to moments of creative inspiration failure to achieve it which leads to an even better idea the fun of the game is really up to you whether its admiring custom aesthetics created by hundreds of talented or hardworking people animating stopmotion style with what you have or just bending the world to your will with an assortment of things to spawn including halflife 2 characters available by default a very interesting and sometimes under appreciated addition to the sandbox genre
recommended
if you have a slight feeling of hesitation to buy this game ignore it completely
recommended
i usually get on gmod expecting to play some darkrp for about an hour or so then its about 7 hours later and i still find myself playing it if you have cs source and half life buy it
recommended
how the  do you play this game

can do fun fun fun fun 910 would be better with more dongs
recommended

recommended
there are so many things you can do in this game it is one of my favorite pc games at the moment and i would suggest it to everyone that likes to mess around with some friends and have a good time in my opinion 1010
recommended
ive played this game for a while now started back in 2011 this game has provided me with hundreds of hours of content ive been everywhere in this game from ttt servers darkrp deathrun hl2rp and mostly every other major gamemode though after 800 hours ive drifted towards half life 2 roleplay and hardcore roleplay servers in general since i have more fun there and i seem to have a knack for narrative based gameplay so yeah if you like to customize push the source engine to the limit and play custom gamemodes that are challenging and time absorbing i believe gmod short for garrys mod is worth your hard earned $10base game  $25counter strike source  gmod  $99valve complete pack its one of those games that you will keep coming back to over the years to play and check for new content 1010 im serious
recommended

garrys mod is great as a multiplayer experience its fun to mess around with friends build contraptions and battle each other exploring and manipulating content from your favourite supported games is great too there are also lots of gamemodes that you can play which arguably turn garrys mod into a number of smaller games in their own right ie murder which is basically like a violent firstperson cluedo to say that garrys mod is a onesizefitsall roleplay shooter building game etc etc is pushing it a bit you can do all of those things but often in a watered down way to get the most out of the game drop any expectations and go with the flow embrace the wacky physics open freedom and virtually endless usercreated content its the best and at times iest game you never knew you needed its the quintessential steam sandbox game
recommended
buy this game or you will not enjoy your life p

garrys mod gmod is quite a fun little indie sim that requires you to do nothing and allows you to do anything a love this game to bits and the community is pretty nice also my only complaint this game is pretty much useless without a source game like halflife 2 ep 1 and 2 or counterstrikesource but other than that i would recommend this game to anyone who is bored of the mindnumbing money grabbing games and just wants to have fun

this game is way too addicting dont play this if you have a job or if you are doing exams seriously time for wiki spam garrys mod often abbreviated as gmod is a sandbox physics game using a modified source engine created by garry newman garrys mod has been available on valves content delivery service steam since november 29 2006[1] in the past purchase of garrys mod required the user to own at least one game on steam based on the source engine such as halflife 2 counterstrike source portal or team fortress 2[1] however as of may 2014 the game can be purchased by itself on steam it is also commonly used for the creation and publishing of videos[3][4] on youtube mainly from team fortress 2 halflife 2 portal left 4 dead and left 4 dead 2 garrys mod was originally a modification for valves halflife 2 but was later made into a standalone steam game that was officially released on november 29 2006 dubbed garrys mod 10 the current version garrys mod 140404 was released on april 4 2014 in february 2014 it was revealed on twitter by newman that the game had just broke us$ 30 million[5] as of november 2013 the game has sold 35 million copies although garrys mod is usually considered to be a full game it has no game objective and players can use the games set of tools for any purpose whatsoever although sometimes when playing on a multiplayer server it may have roleplay or other types of game modes garrys mod allows players to manipulate items furniture and props  various objects that players can place ingame props can be selected from any installed source engine game or from a community created collection the game features two guns  physics gun and tool gun for manipulating objects the physics gun allows objects to be picked up adjusted and frozen in place the tool gun is a multipurpose tool for performing various tasks such as combining props attaching them via ropes and creating controllable winches and wheels the tool gun is also used to control addons created by the community another popular garrys mod concept is ragdoll posing the player can instantiate a ragdoll model from a source game and pose it using a variety of tools[7] this is a popular tool for making fanmade videos and machinimas garrys mod takes advantage of the source engines modified version of the havok physics engine[8] which allows players to build contraptions that follow the laws of physics in winter 20092010 a contest was held for garrys mod by the games developers to create the best new game mode using a programming framework called fretta[10] fretta italian for hurry allows developers to quickly and easily create new game modes for garrys mod with commonly required functionality already implemented so the developers can focus on unique aspects of their game modes fretta was inspired by a similar fan created framework rambo_6s simple gamemode base however for inclusion in garrys mod newman decided to rewrite it with input and contributions from the original author and other developers[11] the winners of the contest range from a recreation of the mafia party game to an aerial combat game mode[12] the contest winners have been included in garrys mod with their own steam achievements[13] three of the winning games have been shipped trouble in terrorist town dogfight arcade and prop hunt on september 7 2010 newman added a feature called the toybox to garrys mod[15] it utilizes the amazon s3 service to download third party content such as weapons props maps game modes or models directly to the users machine while in game in an interview with gmod news garry newman said that one of gmods biggest draws is the amount of third party content i want to make it easier for people to utilize that i really want to move away from having to download files from websites and drag them to folders thats old school so thats what im heading towards maps models saved games etc all saved on the cloud and accessible with a click everything should be accessible from ingame if it isnt ive failed

this game is just too much fun so far ive played over 1750 hours of this awesome game you can do so much stuff on it with all of the different gamemodes that have been made and are still being made constantly this is a must have 1010
recommended
if you are looking for a fun and entertaining game to do just about anythingactually literally anything if the game cant do it there is probably a mod that can garrys mod is a sandbox game where you can build battle swim i think anyway its amazingly fun no matter how boring iv made it sound its kinda like minecraft but better graphics and no giant spidersunless you get the mod if another game gets boring just load gmod the endless possiblities make it impossible to get tired of there are also ragdolls and the other games you have props and ragdolls from that game gert added to garrys mod so yes i definetly recommend garrys mod its worth the $1000
recommended
where to start with this game well lets just say the graphics arnt great and its not really classed as an amazing game however it is extremly fun if you know how to play it with hundreds of diffrent game modes to choose from the fun never ends downloading all the stuff can be anoying but that is just so servers can increase the fun level i am saying the word fun far to much but genrally that is a one word description of the game many people believe it is only played by six year olds despite the fact that it has a whole range of age groups on yes it may have a few young gamers playing but what game doesnt this game is probably the ebst sandbox out there and the other gamemodes are great to anyway i would recomend anyone buying this game as it is really cheap easy to run and extremly fun
recommended
1010 1010 1010 such goodness many funs

this has been an amazing game for me for a very long time if you have steam you need this game i have never had more fun on any other games and as you can see i have other 2000 hours on this game yet im still not even close to getting bored of it i got this game in 2011 and i still havent even done half of the things avaible to do i have had so many fun moments with my friends on this game i also gained a lot of friends from playing this game im pretty sure i got around 145 friends from just garrys mod if you get this game you will never get bored of it more and more servers gamemodes addons and updates just keep coming to add to the endless amounts of fun you can have on this game i have done so many different things on this game and almost all of i was having so much fun it may sound sad but to be honest the most fun i have ever had was on garrys mod it is an amzing game and i think everyone should get a chance to play it if you actually read this entire review thank you and please buy this game
recommended
good game for timepass this game is really good and is available at cheap price sandbox genre really good for creativity type and you need to know some basic science to apply for this game any source engine game needed to run this game played it 3 hours straight cannot get enough keep making some new things like cars house lifts raild road etc default maps are pretty good but you can download more manually created maps online its easy and simple gameplay is good but with lot of bugs and all runs pretty smooth on any low end pc also its fun to play with friends and graphics is not that good nor very bad its average like half life 2 over all recommended 8510
recommended
no words to say you can spent hours having fun with your friends
recommended
ah garrys mod so many possibilities yet so many disasters this game could either be one of the best youve ever bought or maybe one of the worst i say this because you really have to put the time into the game to understand the tools and such you will slowly learn how to build weld and create things or if you dont feel like doing that you could just go on and endless rampage slaughtering npcs all this is possible due to the workshop you could customize your garrys mod into a zombie apocolypse or a murder or anything you want you could literaly build anything you wanted if you just tried hard enough those who hate this game often have not spent enought time on it to enjoy the building or the multiplayer or to look through the workshop this game is unique this is garrys mod
recommended
a very nice game and i love it
recommended
awesome game awesome minigames buy it now for the water melons

you can do literally anything with the workshop and over 322000 mods only problem is that you need a few games to have everything work properly so the whole game is not exactly $10

this is a game where you build what you wantyou kill your friends in tttor just go out and mess around this is garrys mod
recommended
this is in the best sandbox games of all time list of mine it is a must buy for pc gamers and regular steam users you have to get css and gmod together for textures basically when you install it go to the workshop download 200 mods then spawn in random  and do fun physics stuff then play prop hunt and play trouble in terrorist town jailbreak is good too
recommended
awesome i absolutely love this game and would recommend this game to anyone even my worst enemy i have one problem which is the missing textures on some maps but im trying to save up for counter strike source best game ever
recommended
this is a fun game that anyone that likes gamemodes and multiplayer games will love
recommended
this is a good game lots of fun but very frusterating i mean very frusterating it is so annoying sometimes but when you get in a game its lots of fun d

recommended
this game ive played for years & i still do i paly mostly rp & sandbox but great time waster when youre feeling bored sometimes may be a bit buggy but at the end of the day its money well spent only issues ive always hated is the fact youve got to get certain games for the textures etc it should really be put in rather us wasting a bit more money on other games to get the textures but overall 910

great game different gamemodes to play with so you never get bored could also create your own creations with the tools provided this can be done in single player or multiplayer
recommended

its a really great game  i highly approve it for people who prefer sandbox games or games that you can altermodify sure i recommend this game because i have a bias but hey thats what that little buttons for i really enjoy this game because of the other modes and the multiplayer mode i also admire that you can download high quality mods and they still turn out that way it goes the same way if you have a lower quality model i really recommend this game for people starting out on steam or starting out with any genre of games as well have fun see you in game <3 animalgalaxy

one does not simply hate garrys mod
recommended
the game is fun but gets boring at times
recommended
its a game
recommended
verry fun game to play with friends for me its the best mod for halflife 2 1010
recommended
awesome game totally worth the money spent if not a little underpriced its sandbox mode is pretty cool because of all the gameplay possibilities even making movies wow also has tons of gamemodes on the workshop thus it never gets boring the only con is that some gamemodes and maps require having counterstrikes source installed or else your whole gameplay gets messed up with missing textures etc
recommended
im not going to say this is the best game ive ever played but this is one of the best games ive ever played aside from brutally amazing destruction and gore games which also have a plot and even sometimes multiplayer this game is amazingly fun alone if you like or with friends and strangers its major variety of game modes and its friendly interfaces and idea of building upon itself with other games is superiorly amazing i suggest you buy its not too expensive and pretty easy to use also i suggest buying the games it supports for its addons and their dlc this game gets a 1010 for me even with less graphics than expected its ability to change what it is in all cases makes up for anything even glitcheswhich can be funny as heck anyway except for when you get stuck kudos to the creators
recommended
if you like derping around this game is made for you
recommended
for a game with almost no goals the possiblities are only limited to your mind and garrys mods capacity to work i myself have spent far too much time laughing exploring and goofing around playing the game and the many gamemodes that go with it even if your not interested in the particular gamemodes sandbox mode still is a great feature to play around with great game funny people win win situation with css
recommended
awesome just pure awesome d
recommended
nice game  you can build hydra walking chair  scenes of tf2 csgo and add dopuruujem kupit 3
recommended
endless fun loads of different gamemodes in one game so when you get bored of oneyou can just go off to the next
recommended
this game is a highly addictive gaem to play around with wether just in the sandbox fooling around or trying to figure out who is the traitor among you this game will have you hooked like a fish although i must throw in a disclaimer as well if you dont have counter strike source in your list of purchased games then you will find yourself staring at a map convered in a checkered patter and objects showing up as an error sign not fun but i would still play this game true or not
recommended
really that one game where you can do everything also a wide variaty of maps makes it a great game and it keeps increasing everyday it can handle from half life 1 maps to the groundbreaking graphical quality of black mesa really a great game
recommended
i think this game is great it has all the fun ragdoll physics of the source engine and a bunch of wacky stuff you can do all source games add content to garrys mod and even if you dont have any source games you can download tons of content off of the workshop i love this game

garrys mod is a game which offers a wide variety of gameplay due to its ongoing growing list of addons and mods the game has to offer when you think you are bored of it just go and download a bunch of addons to try out or even join the online community in a wide expanse of gamemodes to try just make sure you have the counter strike source files from the following website httpkajar9wixcom2downloadschgd just place the map and content files in your addons folder and youll be good to go 1010

recommended
do you like mucking around do like being a dck to people do you like doing random sht with loads of fun and a ton of mods to download then this game is for you probably one of my favourite games ever
recommended
im no critic when i say get the game alright after a total of nine hours playing the game numerous mod testing and observations i`ve come to conclude that this game is meant for any type of gamer lots of ideal game modes game maps mods for extra weapons and the above i really like how skins just make a whole diffrent experience while gaming in a new world as one of your favorite characters by valve and etc lots of sick block busting weapons call out to you when subscribing to mods at the workshop i highly recomend to check out what i am subscribed to thanks to a little someone and to try out the parkour mods adds realism to the already fictionized game world this universal game gets you addicted after you finnally load that level whether or not your online with peeps or just experimenting on your own blank canvas i highly recomend a decent computer video card nvidia if i spelt it right or anything that can run fallout 3  elder scrolls iv  oblivion bethesda  and at least good internet to get a good ping most of my friends play team fortress 2 and my ping level to mvm servers or regular comunity servers is at your standard 69 70 not all bad especially for gmod but besides some lag spikes and frozen computer screens you need to close down immediately with the task mannager the game is not that all a pain i really like weapons and the maps umm not really much to say now but to thank again those who also recomended gmod to me thankyou im just passing down the torch to one of the best fps of all time side notes  i may add more to this if i find more stuff out but so far besides how my pc handles it its fine its worth the $999 but sometimes they hype down to $499 or one time $199 on the market but really all togethger just get the game

ah garrys mod the game with most under 14s since call of duty garrys mods possiblities are pretty much endless as their are tons of mods out their and more coming everyday this allows for good filmaking or just plain diccking around the multiplayer is something to be wary of as there is pretty much a pre pubesent child in every server going around killing people or deleting everything your trying to create some servers try to restrict this by allowing no killing or deleting but this can also lead to other types of trolling like someone puting a fence over a door so no one can escape its pretty much a lose lose situation just be prepared to deal with these problems or make your own server with a passcode so you save yourself the brain tumors that are the trolls another problem you might face is the downloads on custom servers that will take 10 minutes and might not even work mind you this is only one mode of the multiplayer as the name gives away garrys mod is pretty much a modders wet dream their are mods galore some of note are ttttrouble in terrorist town best played with friends murder and prop hunt these are game mods that add a whole new gameplay experience but you can also get mods for guns cars peoplepretty much anything you can think of its in the workshop the singleplayer for garrys mod is pretty much for testing out your mods or just having fun with them by yourself it allows you to set up scences or build awesome contraptions without any interference from the high balls all in all garrys mod is a good experience with some friends in the multiplayer and is a good tool or filmaking and fun the communtiy more or less is pretty cool where you can find some pretty humorous blokes aye i give garrys mod a 910 just bring ear protection
recommended
garrys mod is an essential for the creative or destructive mind to enjoy in its vanilla state gmod provides many opportunities and tools to express your desire to create toilet submarines or explode about 50 npcs with the rpg gmod is a hugely flexible and sometimes unstable sandbox when you mess around with the possibilities including adding things like wiremod to unlock the possibilities or confusion  gmod however is not standalone and requires a source engine game to power the experience which shouldnt really be difficult to achieve especially with tf2 being f2p the game is also not only a sole experience but an amazing multiplayer world where anything can happen which isnt always a good thing the multiplayer world is a interesting one and some addons would be needed to avoid people messing up what you make maps gamemodes and infinitely more pieces of content can be added at your leisure but performance will take a hit in most cases as a flexible sandbox you would probably expect to be able to do almost anything and gmod pretty much does just that for a measly few pounds or dollars you can unlock a unique world that has almost no bounds to your creativity which is what a sandbox is all about highly recommended rated 9710

this is one of my favourite games out there ive always like garrys mod because facepunch studios made the game in such a way so it would be very easy for people to mod and create addons for the community are constantly creating addons for this game so its hard to become bored ive always said that garrys mod is really good because its the kind of game that you could recreate any other game in with some time and effort i would reccomend that people buy this because of the low price and the hours of fun that can be had

i have to review something for the pillar of community badge so im doing this also garrys mod is good
recommended
as a player for around 23 hours of playing at the time of this post i would so far recommend this video game to those in possetion of at least a decent computer i suffer from a few crashes here and there although on the other hand i have a lot of enjoyment before they take place the gamemodes are interesting the gameplay varies from them there are tonnes of maps to play on and a whole community for you to share this fun with rated 45
recommended
very good game flexible fun and simple enough to settle down in a special community that you might stumble upon in the game it might seem bare at first but that is where the mod comes in it lets you swap and add in new things for you to toy with and the modding community seems to have no end in creating wonderful ideas to play around in
recommended
i bought this game to play prop hunt but i became addicted to trouble in terrorist town the communities are fantastic on the whole and they make you feel welcome all in all a great online multiplayer experience counter strike source is recommended too for extra textures and content i have yet to play with the actual sandbox properly but i will leave that to the pros i am having too much fun with whats already out there

recommended
its cool because you can do whatever you want but if you want a storyline this isnt for you on the other hand excuse i feel the urge to blow something up

garrys mod was actually one of the games that i find pretty interesting because there is a lot of stuff you can do with it such as playing servers of custom gamemodes like stalker trouble in terrorist town deathrun prophunt if you even want you can create your own server and gamemodes along with custom maps everything you want customized is available to you at its source to customize im sure you would definitely like this game a lot
recommended
this game is super fun silly and the most random  can happen at any given time i suggest u get this game now
recommended
this game is awesomeyou guys should buy this gamethere are a few of gamemodessuch as hunger gamesttttrouble in terrorist town
recommended
i admire gmod couse its one of the best sandbox games there is  in gmod you can do alot of fun things in multiplayer with your friends or just have rest from them by playing some fun offline maps or being creative and building whatever you like you can play alot of cool gamemode like 1942 roleplay dark roleplay sandbox ttt murderer hide&seak and more i have 0nly good experience from this game and i think everyone should have this one [and its super cheap] think of this you buy minecraft for 20$ and all you get is some multiplayer with no voice chat and simple building an surviving its fun but its not the cool exeperience you will get from gmod where you can voice chat  roleplay survive zombie apocalipses  murder some folks  have a pirate war  build a pirate ship  build  i could continue all day just writing down this list also there is a workshop feature to this game and it supports all valve games  you will need conterstrike source to get the full experience from the game but you can allways use workshop to fix this by downloading css content packs  in overall i think this game is amazing and everyone should have it and it would be the perfect present from some gamers

the game is great especially with friends it makes it all the better pros  many gamemodes to play online prophunt murder ttt and many more  great community workshop that has many mods from your favorite games  easy menu with a search bar for your props and such  very cheap for the price especially on sales 249  499  can build anything you want and adjust their physics  face posing and noclip cons  doesnt come with required textures from cs for some gamemodes like prophunt though you can find them online  sometimes crashes such as freezes or just closes the whole game out while loading in servers or changing maps you definitely get what you pay for and i have had a lot of fun with this game d

recommended
naked man took my child 1110
recommended
its one of the best games i have ever played even without addons but with them you can do anything
recommended
this is possibly one of the most creative yet destructive games i have ever played when it comes to multiplayer you and your friends can do anything from taking on a horde of combine soldiers to leisurely relaxing and building something of your imagination but this game does not only have sandbox mode it has plenty of others all of which are very exciting trouble in terrorist town is a game where you use your wits skills or your weapon to kill the traitor or the innocents prop hunt is personally my favorite in garrys mod you can disguise yourself as a prop in the map and the hunters will have to find you but be careful you only have 3025 seconds to hide there are plenty of other things to do in garrys mod but i am afraid if i list them all i can waste your time explaining it to you when you can be playing it consider getting garrys mod alucard hellsing approves of this game and message
recommended
really fun game modes such as ttt and prophunt
recommended
one of the best multiplayer games of all time although if you want play this game youre going to have to spend your life
recommended
so many possibilities but not enough time  i love it you can do anything duel with friends replay hl2 with custom weps or ttt prop hunt infinite fun
recommended
ive got it and um its pretty awsome but now it gets awsomer with the addons and the new garrys mod thumbs up

garrys mod published by quickscope studios is an rpg fps game you play as john hardwood a man travelled back in time by his physics teacher to face his greatest enemy faze clan you journey through endless maps ranging from an open jungle  to a snow mountain the story is set in a western theme with cowboys and indians chasing you through the landscape the qui2ckscope engine runs this game very nicely with clean hardcore 3d polygon models for a bit of eye candy while playing only makes the game that much better the real gameplay flys in when you reach the alpha stage  also known as the trickshot 420 stage the stage involves you trying to hit a 750 noscope double tap yy to semtex cancel 420 snoop lion blaze shot when there standing infront of you faze clan the ending was quite thought out and well done with you finally taking the last hit and teabagging the faze clan overall a must have for any hardcore noscopers out there  1010

very fun game for alone making stuff or letting bots fighting eachother but also very very fun with friends on server i recommend playing with 2 other friends a dark rp server and making your own base i had allot of fun but only if those 11 year old admins would be a little smarter it would be more fun
recommended
its a physics sandbox where you can build a car out of a vending machine and some trashcans if you have ten bucks to spare and already own a source game you owe it to yourself to try this out
recommended
make and do anything you wantno excuses for not liking this game
recommended
garrys mod whats not to like about it it is literally a game in which you play games and do whatever the hell you want i have nothing bad to say about this game at all im writing this review to tell you that if you dont have it get it and if you were to only get one game i would totally recommend garrys mod im not going to list the pros because it would take forever but for those of you who do have it i know you agree with me when i say this game is totally worth the ten dollars spent on the game i rate this game 1110

recommended
if you like the orange box you will love this game wait i said this game i meant those mods infact buying this game youll be able to play tons of games youll never be bored and you cant even try all the mods because therere too many the most important thing is that this is not only a game with gmod you can also make amazing videos using as characters your favourites from tf2 portal l4d and everything else just downloading them from the workshop
recommended
great game loads of fun with friends cant get enough
recommended
awesome game nice mods fun such wow
recommended
a fun game with alot of gamemodes
recommended
the only problem with this game is that the majority of servers rely heavily on css content so if you dont buy the css bundle you have to limit the amount of servers you can play on
recommended
love this game it has to be the best sandbox mod game on steam maybe the best game
recommended
garrys mod is one of the best gamesmods i have ever played i have met tons of friends on it i have made money from hosting my own servers on it and it is full of endless oppertunity buy it

this game is so fun with steam workshop and the insane mods this game will make you not put down your mouse and keyboard for a couple of hours would reccommend
recommended

think of minecraft now think of a more manlier version of it that version is this game
recommended
more addicting then
recommended
game is fun you get to do anything that you want to but paying more money to get rid of pink and black squares is not fun 810
recommended
its basically everything you could possibly want in a game for $10 just make sure you buy the css  garrys mod bundle to get them both at a discount since counterstrike source is required for most things also get halflife 2 and the episodes because those are required for a lot of stuff too anyways buy it as soon as you can or wait till it goes on sale for $4 during one of the steam sales but thats basically highway robbery either way well worth the money this game has nearly everything you could think of on its workshop not to mention various other sites where you can find even more addons my only complaint is that this game is somewhat poorly optimized for macs imagine waiting 1 hour to get into a normal server and then crashing upon loading in and my mac works fine with every other source game i own with super quick loading speeds and everything so its a problem on the games end fortunately there are some things you can do to make it run faster like verifying the integrity of the game cache and uninstalling and fully deleting old addons anyways 910
recommended
i loved this game eveer since the early versions were out now that you can add in creations and do a whole lot more stuff in gmod its one giant mess of awesome
recommended
this games awesome and hilarious xdd
recommended
garrys mod is so much fun i play it everyday lol it is my go to game
recommended
play this game once and your thirsty for more play this game twice and you want to try more play this game thrice and use the rest of your life playing this one game warning only for people who are sad enough not to go outside or people who want to try every single gamemode mod weapon npc player model script blah blah blah blah this game is more about finding your fun with friends or in a community of a gamemode or a server than spending most of your time playing alone and then there is the programming side map making server hosting and admining etc etc go play it go enjoy it find your fun
recommended
this game is like pancakes its delicous
recommended
shrek is love shrek is life
recommended
ever had a good imagination then this game is for you in this game you can do everything you want 3 go get this game now or else painis cupcake will come and eat you 
recommended
garrys mod is a great game about creativity and roleplay i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games
recommended
this game is so good and only at 10 to 20 punds you cant go wrong
recommended
honestly this game is a must have if you would call yourself a pc player over a console player it is just a game everyone has as it is well garrys mod it continues to always be updated with new gamemods and items and there is a ton of variety on the several hundreds of servers per gamemod i dont like saying something is a must buy because it just seems cheasy and fake but honestly i would find it surprising to find a single person who playes on this platform that dosent have garrys mod if you want any cons the only ones i could think of is the dumb way the originized server browsing where servers are constantly jumping around i suppose maybe the graphics is another con but honestly no one plays this for graphics they play this for the originality
recommended
garrys bod more like damn this game turns me on
recommended
fun but only in a pinch wouldnt reccommend playing it 8 hours a day every day like some people
recommended
beacuse it is awesome
recommended
very neat and great game for creative thinkers and people who are interesting in building and the fact that you get to put ragdolls in a position to make it look like there ing each other so all in all great game and 1010 ps it crashes a lot oon maclike i mean a lot
recommended
fun get creative kill headhugger and meat boys and get trouble in terroist town
recommended
garrys mod is peremptorily the biggest sandbox ever made you can either use it to create scenes with characters from different worlds like gordon freeman meeting pyro and also download many addons created by people around the world or play on many gamemodes one of the most popular are prop hunt hide n seek or trouble in terrorist town [] many gamemodes [] you can play games or play sandbox creating a scene [] billions of addons downloadable from ingame menu or just from steam workshop [] addons are like models you can use to scenes character modesl how you looks like weapons different maps and also gamemodes but its not everything there is maaaany many others things you can use just with few clicks just search and click subsrcibe or download [] this game is fully customizable you want to have that weapon  just download it you dont want to have dont download its easy  you add what you really want and need  [] compatibile with cs source hl2 and tf2 games [] you wont be creating great thing like on youtube gmods videos just from the beginning  you have to learn the settings etc this game isnt ideal but i think its great
recommended
this is pretty much fun i can build anything i can do the best server is prophunt i really enjoy this game
recommended
it is wonderfull 
recommended
this game is great you can set up your own little world where you can do whatever your heart desires make a companion that follows you create an army of crows that you can crush make a giant fortress that not even the hulk himself could smash or make a giant flying  that shoots 
recommended
pretty alright
recommended
this game shows the fact that creativity is must for all games these days the pure ability to let your mind run free in this game makes it a 1010 for me because it is so great except for trying out a plugin and i need half life 2 or csgo but it is still a great game
recommended
garrys mod is a game where you can do any thing up to youre imagination garrys mod is a sandbox game where you can spawn charecters from youre favourite valve games or diffrent games in general you can build stuff and do stuff if youre bored apart of the awesome singelplayer theres also an multiplayer mode thats even more awesome it adds awesome modes like trouble in terrorist town prop hunt slender murderer and tons more to name there are some minor things first of all this game has a steep learning curve you will have to learn the hard way and then of course the infamous texture problems which some times annoys the living hell out of me but overall the game is amazing and if you dont own it by now buy it immiadetly i give garrys mod a 910

garrys mod is a sandbox game you have a wide variety of props from various source games depending on which you own and multiple tools at your disposal with these you can build different contraptions make vehicles construct buildings etc as well as all the content included in the game you can find a ton of mods online via the games website or steam workshop you can also makescript your own but the fun doesnt stop there multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely you can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes from hide and seek to role playing there is a huge variety of unique modes to play a few i would recommend are trouble in terrorist town a group of innocent terrorists must work with the detectives to discover who the traitors are and kill them the traitors must take out the innocents preferably without alerting anyone else no one knows who is innocent and who is not making for a sometimes tense experience morbus a group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens or kill them all there are two types of aliens brood aliens and swarm aliens the brood aliens get upgrades and can transform into humans allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one the swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die assuming they were killed by another swarm alien or human these have a melee and ranged attack but no upgrades their role is to weaken the humans and try to kill them the humans have needs every now and then you will have to either sleep eat shower or pee you cannot move during this time so must be wary of those around you in case they are brood aliens overall one of the best game modes a ton of fun especially with friends darkrp darkrp is one of the more casual rp modes in gmod you spawn into the map as a citizen and can choose a job to play as from drug dealers to civil protection there is a wide variety of roles to pick you can go around earning money commit crimes buy and furnish your own house etc great if you find the more serious rp servers to be boring overall the game is absolutely brilliant one of the very few that i can keep going back to and not get bored i purchased the game around 23 days ago for 199euro and have since put almost 24 hours into it one of the best purchases i have ever made
recommended
this game is really fun and has lots of cool game modes worth paying
recommended
its a great game theres so much to do and youll never get bored its pretty cheap too so its amazing for its price theres hours of content in the workshop and already ingame content that can have you hooked for hours there are many game modes to try out and youll just fall in love with one of the game modes some of these game modes just never get boring kinda weird actuallybut awesome at the same time this game is waaayyy more fun playing with friends but its just as great messing around in sandbox by yourself if you like to experiment and mess around definitely try out sandbox first theres loads of workshop content and ingame content to mess around with as i said before even if you dont like that sort of stuff theres still some fun and exciting gamemodes to play such as ttt and prop hunt its a must buy and you dont have a reason not too its cheap fun and exciting i hope you guys come to your senses and buy this game since its probably one of the best games on steam 1010
recommended
this game is only good when your playing on the vgn servers xd
recommended
sooo much to do in this game
recommended
this game is a great physicssandbox game made by the mind of the intellectual garry newman heres some things that you should know to start off as a noob at this game it doesnt look like much its just a bunch of props on a menu but wait theres this thing called the steam workshop where you can download all kinds of awesome crap 100 or more mods  gmod  one of the best games of all time you can seriously have a lot of fun in this game you can mess around with ragdoll people and do whatever what comes in your mind to them there is also npcs theyre extremely fun to mess around with but dont mess with the wrong ones cough metro police cough if you find some gibs on the steam store get it it will add an extragory mess to your ragdolls and npcs which makes it 100x more fun three great maps for firsttimers are gm_apartmentcomplex freespace 13 and gm_tornadovillage in gm_apartmentcomplex you can just go running around in a realistic apartment either robbing people or causing a massive siege with npcs the only downside to it is that the map is relatively small and you cant really drive or fly that much in freespace 13 the name says it all in gm_tornadovillage it is just out of this world fun it has a large open map and not only can you commit drivebys and blast away destructible homes you can chase tornadoes while you are at it with the cars addon scars i guarantee you it will provide you hours of fun but you need a somewhat good computer to play it otherwise there will be lots of lag three great addons for first timers are m9k weapons sgmcarstdmcars and scars the m9k weapons are your basic weapons however if you get all the packs you can have the ultimate server battle or the ultimate standoff with the metro police with the sgmcarstdmcars you will be amazed at what these guys did the cars have the ultimate graphics and basically theyre from the same engine source however they are not good with the tornado maps because they have a lot of weight on them last but not least there is the scars they are cool reliable and fast they are perfect for any mediumsized to largesized map if it is roamable they are the perfect addon if you want to be a gmod tornado chaser unfortuantely they are a tad too light so it will be easy for a gmod tornado to pick up your car otherwise the scars are the way to go in conclusion this game has endless possibilities this game is perfect for anyone and in my opinion i think everyone should get it if you dont get it youre missing out big time so fork out only $9 and go and play one of the most critically acclaimed indie games of all time believe me youll be glued to this game every day 9810 97100
recommended
garys mod is such a great game that i cant even emphasize enough on how much i enjoy this game everytime there is something completely new and fun to do you can join multiplayer servers which is a blast or you could also host your own garysmod server for free like a do you can install hundreds of thousands of mods for this game no joke or you can make your own with a little time if i had to give this game a rating i would give it a solid 1010 for sure i think i found the love of my life
recommended
in this game you will have a lot of random moments  actualy this is the most random game ever  tons of gamemodes  getting cs s content pack or buying the game is recomanded  improves gameplay its a game that i have a lot of fun
recommended

recommended

recommended
just plain goofy fun with friends hate having so many missing textures though and having to own all the source engine games to fix it wish they would make a standalone of this would be great in my opinion
recommended
so awesome i love it
recommended
i bought it and i didnt even know about how fun the mulitplayer is amazing game and the servers are so much fun hard to get started in the sence of being able to make cool things so much fun and addicting i got it after i had so much fun in rust i havent played rust for 2 days after getting this game
recommended
this game is basically community drivin you can hours of fun in the sandbox mode or if build and glitching the game out isnt your type it find multiplayer game and see a variety of gamemodes appear before your eyes much more than cod ever had and most of them are a great blast with a laugh or two warning this game does need hl2 and counter strike source not global offensive and you may just want to download the texture files from the internet but these are very fun games and also worth the price of admission even if they are old
recommended
very fun game with many different maps and gamemodes its a cheap game too you can even earn gary mods trading cards
recommended
what is good with this game is that you never get bored of it it is always something to do you can play sandbox and build you own things or you can spawn things that other players have made you can do absolutely what you want it is also a big selection of game modes you can play like trouble in terrorist town prophunt stop it slender and many other game modes that players make something that is kind of bad with this game is that you need other valve games like counterstrike source if you shall play trouble in terrorist town and some other game modes and if you are inn sandbox you get a much larger variety of things you can spawn if you have other valve games and if you spawn things that other players have made it comes a big errors because they use objects from different valve games for me it was also hard to learn how to do things in this game first time i played it i didnt have a clue how to do things and just joined random servers but after a while i figured how to do things in this game now it is alot of guides to gmod you can read but it wasnt that when i started playing it so now it is easier i really recommend this game to everyone since it is so much different things you can do if you get it you will probaly play it alot like me and i recommend that you play with some friends its just so much fun with friends i will give it 910 because it is hard to figure everything out
recommended
very good game bit erish at times but still good it just shows behind every black man is a ragdoll trying to be set free <3
recommended
great game so much fun
recommended
very fun game you can honestly do anything
recommended
what else is there to say other than this is my number one personal favorite
recommended
i would highly reccomend this game if you seek for fun and have friends its not an ordinary shooting fps game like cs or smth so i dont reccomend this game for ragers and russians sorry no offense
recommended

how can you review garrys mod theres so much stuff for every kind of player it has so many gamemode and so many servers and is so much fun buy it if you dont have it already but who does not
recommended
gmod is one of those games thatll entertain the player for a long time with an infinite amount of things to do it never gets boring the community is what makes the game fun though fancreated mods and maps provide unlimited amounts of things to do plus the gamemodes inside of gmod such as ttt or prop hunt also provide some fun things to do overall i would rate this game 1010 because its one of the funnest games ive ever played with friends and it still keeps getting better because of the fans

recommended
acerius review  garrys mod what can i say garrys mod is probably my most favourite game of all time due to the extended variety of gamemodes included multiplayer is bundles of fun no matter what gamemode you play and its a haven for programmers home to a wide palette of different audiences such as roleplayers fps gamers and so forth garrys mod is most definitely a great community to be a part of the only issue with garrys mod is that its still rather buggy in some respects but nonetheless its exceptional recommended game gameplay 55 graphics 455 community 55 singularity 55 quality 355 overall score 2325
recommended
garrys mod is the best game i played so far  there is no goal on the game but you can make anything  you can have fun with friends on such many mods for example p love it so farrr 
recommended
buy it now 1010
recommended
have been playing this game since it was first released absolutely worth every cent
recommended
you can spawn watermelons 1010 samig 3
recommended
surprisingly great amazing game its a great sandbox game one of the best for sure easily ties with minecraft at the very least you would have to be stupid not to give it a try the mods are great and reliable workshop items as well anything can happen in this game literally
recommended
this is actually a pretty good game you can mess around with random objects on random game maps or even play some prop hunt or trouble in terrorist town  but to load the maps correctly youre gonna need some source engine games such as tf2 l4d2 hl2 css and portal most importantly css in order to play prop hunt or other mods or youll have errors around the whole map you can still play tho in sandbox mode messing around with items you can always load the map 810
recommended
what is a life
recommended
really fun reliable sandbox the different mods you can add on to this game makes the game loads more fun also gamemodes like trouble in terroist town prop hunt and many others makes the game what it is the freedom you have on this game also makes it surprising fun and lets you have a great time with friends i would suggest this game for anyone with and gaming ability definatly worth the price too enjoy  xx
recommended
i would highly recommend this game especially for only 599 you cant go wrong the best thing with garrys mod is that you can do so much you can do practically anything you want and the games modding community is awesome and there is hours upon hours of fun in this game just on its own with things like trouble in terrorist town but with mods there are even more hours of content one of my favourite games there are only a few downsides the game sometimes crashes but not too often and im using alot of mods so thats probably to be expected and although the graphics arent anything amazing its on the source engine so most pcs can get a decent fps on this game i would give this a 910
recommended
u can do whatever u want totally epic buy it
recommended
its almost 2014 if you dont have garrys mod yet you should just quit
recommended
simmply the best game to build and just have a good time
recommended
probably one of the best sandbox games out there garrys mod is unique like no other with tons of gamemodes addons and other content garrys mod is a name i will remember for a while just remember if something doesnt work blame gawwy
recommended
a must have for those who just need something they can make by themself so they can make an epic battle the way they want it or make a weird contraption make a picture of a rebel vs combine fight or make a picture that will make anyone go wtf lol the best part if you get bored with what gmod has to provide vist the workshop and get some new addons for endless entertainment because there is an addon for everything if you get bored making things by youself play with friends or enjoy one of the many multiplayer gamemodes gmod has to offer the possiblities are endless and thats why i give gmod a 1010 rating its worth it
recommended
ah the amazing land of gmod where the people do what they want to do the sky is the limits and nothing can stop you there are a bunch of interactive gamemodes where you can play with a bunch of other interactive people i play alot of this mostly because well its fun of course you can never run out of fun in this game this is such an amazing game
recommended
very funny and addictive game try it
recommended
so worth the $10 <3 prop hunt 
recommended
if anyone would buy me orange box thatd be great fun game
recommended
its sooo creative
recommended
one of the best sandbox games i have ever played this game was a success when it first came out and im not surprised at all the only problem is that it causes me alot of viruses on my laptop and crashes my system only one downside with this game everything else is just pitch perfect i realised a couple of days ago that it also teaches you programming when it comes to scripting one of the best indie games i have ever played thanks valve eddy nolan
recommended
it allows you to use your imagination and test your creativity by thinking things and then trying to figure out a way to make them happen a fun game that requires a bit of mind too  
recommended
this game is extremely entertaining its dumb if you like games with no objective a game that you can virtually create your own buildingsworld or just killing  its made for you youll end up being stuck in the workshop at one point looking at all of the badass mods that keep coming and updating clicking the green subscribe button over and over again it just doesnt stop overall if you love games just to do mindless stupid things then its a no brainer get it immediately rating 910 a must get for new steam users who want a simple game to  around in
recommended
you can build nukes and nuke other nukes
recommended
the game is awesomethere are too many things to doyou can make a big car or rocket shipor just spawn too many people and killing them with any weapons from mods or usseles weapons i love this game very much
recommended
great game so much fun to just mess around with there is so many possiblites
recommended
its game without limits that gives you the tools to do anything with a great modding community and a finite number of things to do i must definitely say this game is worth every penny
recommended
best game ever with a ton of content different gamemodesaddons playtime and addiction and all that for 10 just buy this
recommended
now this is the perfect game for dcking around with stuff if you like doing utter nonsense and wasting your life then this is the game for you
recommended
this game is nice to mess around with the addons and do what ever you want and i recommend you get this game cuz this game is fun so still give this game a 1010 there will be haters and likers
recommended
i am addicted to garrys mod ever since i downloaded it i have never stopped playing it i have made many new friends because of this brillaint game i adivice getting this with counter strike source for jailbreak which is the best gamemode

recommended
this game is by far one of my favorite games you can do so much in this and theres so many different gamemodes you can play and so many things in this game that will always make you want to play this and stay on it longer i recommend this game you wont regret it
recommended
halarious game fun and creative
recommended
the only game ive ever played that manages to be extremely deep while still having the option to inflate breasts to gargantuan sizes and shoot them with bazookas fantastic
recommended
all i can say is use the workshop addons make the game better and better
recommended
amazing all the modding support tools and anything else the community can think of anything you can think of you can build loads of gamemodes which range from prop hunt and ttt to the more relaxing atmosphere of space build haha its a pun and are all a blast to play this is definitely worth at least $10
recommended
has a doge ragdoll wofe10 must buy
recommended
i recommend this game becauseumtheres not really a way to put this game or the way i feel about it in words but it is what led me to discover halflive team fortress all of valve and steam and pc gaming in general if you like sandbox multiplayer many gamemodes a good laugh like every time you get on multiplayer then this is no doubt the game for you and you should just get it anyways because i said so so yeah thats it
recommended
every one neeeeeds this game it has too much stuff to do in it
recommended
i played a few jail break modes and instantly noticed a huge difference in customization vs jailbreak on css or csgo its ridiculous how much better it is not only that but there are tons of other custom game modes build a boatflood is a good one too other than the 2 servers that run it charging $10 for vip so you can use the rope tool and vote to extend the build phase etc im just now getting into it so i havent discovered everything it has to offer yet but i know its got much more that will continue to amaze me im glad i bought this
recommended

garrys mod or gmod i started playing garrys mod when my friends told me to try out it after few hours of playing im in love with this game you know the huge community building and crafting different type of game modes which allows player to use their imagination to contribute the world its a fun game to play i often play garrys mod now instead of other games if youre a gamer who dont know which game to go for i definitely suggest this game to you
recommended
once you find the right server this game is really amazing you need to keep an open mind about everyone who plays this game though i usually go for very talkative servers and a few misogynistic guys pop up but overall smaller servers seem to have the friendliest people
recommended
ohmygosh this game is freaking amazing its exactly what ive been looking for this sandbox game has sooooo much range and all kinds of different gamemodes definatly worth the price
recommended
their is absolutely no reason not to buy this game right now
recommended
a awesome game with alot of replayibility so buy it
recommended
given that ive wasted 325 hours of my life on it in the past 3 months i think it speaks for itself
recommended
it is awesome you should get it
recommended
ruined my life 1010
recommended
this is what sandbox really is you want to build something make it you want to kill something spawn it then kill it not that hard
recommended
short verison at the bottom i feel that this is among the greats here on steam it has one of the most active and varied communities of any game ive ever played and for the most part a good community at that if you dont like voice chat id recommend against playing on rp servers the game is great if you have no idea what to do due to its vast array of content both official and community made its also very easy to get into with clear labeling of all the tools you have at your disposal although it can get very complex and time consuming if you let it overall a amazing game for pretty much any type of gamer due to its shear amount of content which is unmatched in my opinion by any other game on steam furthermore its not incredibly expensive for the base game but buyer beware you will need all the source games in order to have the full experience although its very easy to have fun with none of them or very few such as cs source and tf2 these are all you really need if you want to play online to the full experience i personally would recommend this game to everyone i know that has any interest in a physics based sandbox with combat elements or just to mess around for the price its a great game to look into and it goes on sale often so even if you dont pick it up at full price consider getting it during a sale short review pros good physics engine near unlimited content workshop easy to get into great multiplayer lots of modes good price for the amount of content single player is just as good ability to have complete freedom over what you do great sandbox gameplay cons may have to buy additional games to have to complete experience mic spam poor combat model graphics are dated in some places resource intensive may need a good computer may need to download packs for servers manually greifing is common in some multiplayer game types little help from ingame tutorials lots of tutorials online
recommended
this game is very good  the game does not have lag the game modes are very good habit to pick up haha but i recomend this 1010 get it its cheap and fun if you do not get counter strike source dont worry they have a website you can download the missing texters just look up youtube videos ive bought the game and anyway is fine buy it
recommended
great game i love it
recommended
great game fun to play with friends
recommended
this game is amazing but the only problem is that it gave me down syndrome
recommended
this game has the easiest mod insallation the best maps the best npc and the best quality of any sandbox game to date i love this game every one should have it and will enjoy it

recommended
garrys mod is a sandbox game where there is no linear path really there isnt anything specific you have to do you can do whatever and the multiple game modes for multiplayer make it more then that you can do sandbox and just build random stuff or you can play ttt and compete to find who is going to murder everyone or you can play jailbreak which is basically alot like jailbreak servers on counter strike the possibilities are litterally endless and with steam workshop support you can not only add even more extra stuff to the game but you can even see what your friends have made too and this game never ends at this point with so many new gamemodes playermodels weapons character skins npcs and so much more i definitely say garrys mod is worth the 10 dollars you pay and is worth by cs source to use part of it which is about 25$ which i can safely say that this game is worth
recommended
garrys mod is a popular sandbox game that is played all around the world but my favourite gamemode is troulbe in terrorist town its a fun gamemode where its innocent vs traitor i highly recommend this game

this game is a lot of fun and promotes friendly activities
recommended
its gmod 
recommended
did not get it at first but now its epic
recommended
really nice sandbox with lots of replayability just make sure you have counterstrike source before getting this
recommended
warning possible effects of garrys mod are as follows addiction insane periods of playing time jumping to different gamemodes every 20 minutes and completely impossible to avoid unless you or your loved ones have a life i recommend you dont get this game if you dont have one buy it
recommended
do you like sandbox games of course you do do you like making gman do weird poses yes you do do like playing all kinds of different gamemodes including ttt and prop hunt hell ya do you like crashes and slow load times no ah well 3 out of 4 aint bad 8510

this game is pretty much like when you were in 3rd grade lunch and everyone is sitting there with their shtty food and you tear open your lunch bag to reveal a lunchable and all of a sudden the weight of the sun moon and earth all come crashing down on your tiny little 8 year old skull and you spontaniously combust

im happy knowing my hypothesis of steam users being functionally autistic is accurate positive highlights of my great time spent on garrys mod getting two children banned from a darkrp server killing everyone innocent and traitor in ttt without evidence and stating over the mic i had dna killing off a hl2rp community that circlejerks over eachother with their dark and edgy charactersusernames dealing with admins with superiority complexes hearing the cries and lamentations of children as i rdm them senselessly building outer toll gayt heaven in conjunction with a fellow friend meeting new friends and restablishing old friendships with those who know how to have fun roleplaying as a white supremacist roleplaying as an abusive cop becoming a space marine and having everyone laugh at your toned upper body becoming a whale hunter learning how to be a better father cons admins community screaming children darkrp trouble in terrorist town halflife 2 rp waiting two months to join a server bronies furries stoners youtube celebrities turning this game into more of a daycare friends becoming addicted to garrys mod 510 its okay the community and lack of new gamemodes really make this unreplayable after a while
recommended
what can i say about garrys mod well its the kind of game that you find yourself putting in countless hours of your life into this game is very fun but if you wish to play multiplayer like ttt or prophunt you also need other games like counter strike source portal  and half life to get all of the textures to play so if your wondering about buying it you should i give this game a 1010 by far
recommended
this game is just simply amazing creative and fun best game to play with your mates
recommended

recommended
garrys mod is a game to play when your feeling sad or down its really nice to play it when you have valve games installed its nice to pose things and make things like a flying car a giant roller coaster just about anything you can think you can take screenshots to show off your skills or put something on the workshop to share with other people its also fun to play the multiplayer when your tired of singleplayer in multiplayer you can play with friends play the gamemodes that people make or just mess around in the spawn menu you can also make really funny poses and spawn in really silly stuff installing addons in the workshop is really nice if your making very professinal scenes or poses garrys mod also has a really fun community with some very intresting achivements if you would like to earn them remember your imagination is the limit
recommended
while garrys mod is one of the most fun games ive ever played the gamemodes is where all the fun is from trouble in terrorist town to darkrp there are so many things to do even if you get bored with the base game in my opinion it gets a 1010

gmod is one of those games thatll entertain the player for a long time with an infinite amount of things to do it never gets boring the community is what makes the game fun though fancreated mods and maps provide unlimited amounts of things to do plus the gamemodes inside of gmod such as ttt or prop hunt also provide some fun things to do overall i would rate this game 1010 because its one of the funnest games ive ever played with friends and it still keeps getting better because of the fans

acerius review  garrys mod what can i say garrys mod is probably my most favourite game of all time due to the extended variety of gamemodes included multiplayer is bundles of fun no matter what gamemode you play and its a haven for programmers home to a wide palette of different audiences such as roleplayers fps gamers and so forth garrys mod is most definitely a great community to be a part of the only issue with garrys mod is that its still rather buggy in some respects but nonetheless its exceptional recommended game gameplay 55 graphics 455 community 55 singularity 55 quality 355 overall score 2325
recommended
everyone should get this game its my favorite game play with friends or solo download and upload addons from the workshop or the in game addon downloader either way garrys mod is amazing and to get all the textures get half life 2half life 2 ep 12 and counter strike source great game
recommended
they said you can be anything is this game so i decided to become a chair in prop hunt because chairs
recommended
ultimate mess around game play this game if your are feeling down or having a  day
recommended
great game unlimited stuff to do price is really affordable get it now
recommended
very fun in general its a great game overall
recommended
garrys mod is a amazing game and it is a very good game if you are creative kind of person
recommended
ignite a doll then drive it around
recommended
its fun and it never gets old with all the mods you never get bored
recommended
brilliant game
recommended
one time i entered a roleplay server and ran up to the mayor and thrusted a harpoon through his chest while reciting mobey  im banned from all servers under that host 1010
recommended
i would highly recommend this game especially for only 599 you cant go wrong the best thing with garrys mod is that you can do so much you can do practically anything you want and the games modding community is awesome and there is hours upon hours of fun in this game just on its own with things like trouble in terrorist town but with mods there are even more hours of content one of my favourite games there are only a few downsides the game sometimes crashes but not too often and im using alot of mods so thats probably to be expected and although the graphics arent anything amazing its on the source engine so most pcs can get a decent fps on this game i would give this a 910
recommended
u can do whatever u want totally epic buy it
recommended
its almost 2014 if you dont have garrys mod yet you should just quit
recommended
good game its like eating a cookie 3
recommended
the game is awesomethere are too many things to doyou can make a big car or rocket shipor just spawn too many people and killing them with any weapons from mods or usseles weapons i love this game very much
recommended
great game so much fun to just mess around with there is so many possiblites
recommended
its game without limits that gives you the tools to do anything with a great modding community and a finite number of things to do i must definitely say this game is worth every penny
recommended
this game doesnt need a review
recommended
theres one thing to say this game has everygame in the world
recommended
i love this game if you like building machines you should get it but get it with counter strike source with it because it takes almost all the errors out of the game
recommended
in a game where anyone can report you for killing em where all reports say your a hacker rdmer even if they were the traitor or just say youre a noob for killing em 1010 will be reported again for no reason no h8
recommended
really cool and creative game thanks for creating garrys mod
recommended
the most amazing game for just messing around and playing with friends and crashing serversoverall the best sandbox game you could ever wantthats not it theres also trouble in terrorist town now that is a good game to play with friendsif you want this game its worth it
recommended

recommended
this is a beast game
recommended
alot of fun especially if you play with friends or even in a random lobby
recommended
really nice game to mess around with
recommended
garrys mod is the best game i have ever played even the nonworkshop side is fun with friends and alone but the workshop makes it better the workshop provides thousands of addons to make each game session different and more interesting not to mention gamemode servers like dark rp prophunt ttt and gmt garrys mod tower if you do not know what that is google it now so after playing it for over 500 hours i can tell you it is worth it after all it is six pounds
recommended
having spent almost all of my time playing trouble in terrorist town all i can say is that gmod is worth getting simply for that gamemode it can be daunting and confusing at first but thats the beauty of it you will pick it up as you go along and you will experience different things depending on the server as for the rest of the game what i have experienced is a strong communtiy atmosphere across all the servers i visited and although there can be some terrible gamemodes i loved the variety of games pirate wars is perfectly simple and possible one of the best gamemodes out there
recommended
sometimes in life you just gotta go outside and spawn explosive barrels everywhere every steam user should have this game no questions asked 1010
recommended
gmod is a very fun never ending game and probably one of my favorites
recommended
a fun game that can turn into many and many hours of fun i would recommend this game go get this game and play it with some friends it is a ton of fun
recommended
awesome game with endless hours of fun great if you are into sandbox games
recommended
great game i reccomend it to all 29 hours might look pretty little to the people with thousands but that is due to me having steam for a short amount of time but if you do play get some friend and play some ttt or prop hunt hope you found my review helpful
recommended
its a very very very good game i recommend this game to you guys 
recommended
im addicted to it i need help
recommended
i am the lethargic gaming ttt server owner and i have to say i have put soo many hours into this game thus far and have had some of the best moments from gaming whilst playing definite recommendation there are tons of things to do in this game its always expanding with the new creations people make xevayne jon
recommended
the hard part isnt trying to find a good reason to buy this game its why wouldnt you buy this game you can play with ragdolls make movies short clips theres ttt prop hunt darkrp sandbox lua scripting expression 2 the possibilities are literally endless dont just take my word for it buy this game
recommended
if you dont have it get it now you will first start a new game and not understand a thing probably spawn some crap and fling it about they are two things you will do at this point you will quit or you will waste your life on it the people who did the latter of the options explored the many different gamemodes and servers on it that almost appear hidden to new players and found one they liked the people who play for ages probably found a online community based around one or more of the game modes the people who quit played single play sandbox or tried a single server if you explore it watch as your life disapears and this game takes up your life
recommended
garrys mod is by far one of the best games i have ever played if you want an open world sandbox game this is the game for you
recommended
great game
recommended
garrys mod is fantastically fun to play despite the graphics being quite dated in the current modern age of gaming with its various emphasis on stellar graphics realistic physics embodied by assassins creed seriess fluidity portal 2  the game is fun certain map modes such as darkrp and ttt make the game worth the price of admission for the game
recommended

 sorry for my english if you asking me what is the best game in the world i would like to say garrys mod  its a game of creativity and fun i feel like i pay only at 999$ but what ill get is more than the price  ill feel like i buy multiple game at one time but in truth i only buy one because of it has alot of gamemode such as 1sandbox 2prophunt 3troble in terrorist town 4zmod 5darkrp and alot more but this is what i found most enjoy and never get bored and i feel like im buying bioshock infinite  halo  call of duty  mass effect  etc because of steam workshop that can make your dream possible garrys mod also not only a sandbox but also action  horror  comedy  etc this game also supported steam workshop so you can grab anything you want from it for free  just you pay once and the game never ask you to pay more  as long as garry doenst make a wrong move to gameplay section for singleplayer if you are playing alone you might just getting bored easily if you dont have much of a steam workshop item and stuff to play around singleplayer make me feel like a littleplayground which is fun for me because of steam workshop item that raise garrys mod from 4gb to 13 gb now which most of a steam workshop stuff is pretty good and useful but when ill move to multiplayer trust me you will become an garrys mod addict because of a friendly community and varions of great moment  ill have alot of friends because of this game still alot of server are up and kicking gamemode that i would like to recommand darkrp if you like a lifelike roleplaying  this is for you and me too i believe this game will last forever as long as humanity still exist  as long as the garrys mod community still live if you still consider if you gonna buy it stop thinking and buy it i beg you this game is a must have for all steam user oh ill nearly forgot it has achievment too and steam trading card is there any game that better than this  free stuff  good community  great moment  cheap price  etc and when you buy it do me a favor go play it and make a good community or make a name for yourself on youtube whatever just buy it bro   __ ` \   \ \ _ \ brofist  if ill only have a whole day writing this

they told me i could be anything so i became a couch rocket scentist and a flying bag of doritos 1010 would waste hundreds more hours on
recommended
although personally i dislike the sandbox mode of this game it really shines in its multiplayer game modes trouble in terrorist town murder & prop hunt are just one of a few many minigames that have been created by the community for the community although for these game modes you need the css textures you can download them for free from the tools tab in steam itself its definitely worth the $5 that it is currently and once you discover what garrys mod can do youll never be able to stop
recommended
a perfect game for anyone it is so good that anyone can download modsaddons and build amazing wiremod stuff and learn programing xd
recommended

recommended
one of my most favorite sandbox games out there with litterally hundreds of gamemodes its very difficult to get bored of this game and was 200% worth the price i paid so if your thinking about getting this then do it because you will enjoy most of the gamemodes no matter how pointless some of them are cough elevator source cough 3
recommended
love this game hours of fun to be had and so much variety definitely recommend it
recommended
i love this game d why o because you can have fun with everything that is in the game and that isnt  just build yourself you can build or make everything that you can only imagine and for those people who dont care aboutthese things can go to another one of many other gamemodes  basically this game is not only 1 game it is many games packed in 1 amazing whatever i dont know what to call it just think there stand anything that is amazing   if you dont already have this game  buy it naow d
recommended
a funny friendly in some places game with the most famous part of the game sandbox making your own scenarios with the models from cs tf2 and half life 2 or choose which ones you like from the workshop not to forget all the brilliant gamemodes like trouble in terroist town gmod tower and many many more gmod is that game you will always come back too even with some annoyances and bugs it gets a 910 from me a best buy dont sue me for any fun steam players good one garry

ing garry piece of  ruined after every update ing hl2exe has stopped responding pile of  gotta download so many maps  he removed dynamite spam piece of wank  game 1010
recommended
genre sandbox reccommendation anybody that likes even a little humor should play this game playtime more than 20 hours 300 hours if you have friends to play with rating 910 review if youre one of those people who are more like casual gamers and love messing around and creating random things this game is for you lots of derping and no goals and there are even many custom fanmade gamemodes available if you get bored the game obviously allows for massive mod support allowing you to use almost anything from whatever popular show game etc in the game as long as it is in the workshop and is uptodate with the latest version of the game you can for example fly planes and helicopters drive need for speed cars interact with scripted reworked npcs like a pikachu and so on one thing to note about this game though the community sucks  interacting with it can give many headaches most of the gmod players are kids so be prepared to mute players if the server lets you which is another small let down
recommended
you can do absolutely anything to your hearts desire ^^

one of the best sandbox games i have ever played this game was a success when it first came out and im not surprised at all the only problem is that it causes me alot of viruses on my laptop and crashes my system only one downside with this game everything else is just pitch perfect i realised a couple of days ago that it also teaches you programming when it comes to scripting one of the best indie games i have ever played thanks valve eddy nolan
recommended
it allows you to use your imagination and test your creativity by thinking things and then trying to figure out a way to make them happen a fun game that requires a bit of mind too

recommended
well its about time i sat down and wrote a review garrys mod is a game that is all about playing online and all the creative user made game modes or you can download the mods you want set up a single player game and make your own story such as place about 100 zombies in a building rush in with an assault rifle and try not to die there is no story mode in garrys mod so if thats what your looking for in a game this is not for you also garrys mod is not perfect it often crashes and has alot of bugs it has moments where your sitting there laughing and dying and others where your ripping your hair out trying to get somthing to work the other bad part about this game is that alot of those fun game modes need other games to work most common is counter strike and half life but others include buying games like day of defeat and left 4 dead i have played almost 1300 hours of this game and love it i give this game a solid 810 its not perfect but it is amazingly fun
recommended
ing swagged out coding lua for it is fun
recommended
yeah garrys mod is so cool it give you so many mods to download and play on for me they gave me stargate mod so now i can play with the the stargate stuff build a base and stop othr people coming to base

where to begin have you ever heard of the movie ratatoutouille well watch it that movie is like a cake that inside is a bomb just so badly wants to explode and give everybody the surprise of dying on a birthday this game literally rips the words out of my mouth though defining words would not give you anything since a word is acually a form of human communication well whatever in the movie there is a rat that rat is totally not named rat a tat tat tat touille this game however is the greatest thing that mankind has ever seen except for blind people that is disney acually filed a copyright complaint against this game for being their exact words  this game is too awesome and that it should be removed or our maids who clean our hotel rooms and get secretly paid below minimum wage wil cry not just any cry no these laughters and happinesss are acually part of a secret organization called in my butt they specialize in gm vehicles that is so off topic any way this game is so bad hta ti think that need to be water with my pee  it was very hard to get all that information out of the guy i hope that next time i go to tinker winker dinker finker thisinker is getting oldinker if you find any kind of carnival go there i am there and i will sell you this game for 1000$ that is a 990$ rip off i was once at a store and my sister was bitten by a mouse this game is got the top notch characters when there are acually no characters
recommended
oh the endless joy that you can have with this gamewhat cant you do in this game
recommended
awesome game u must have it
recommended
i love this game theres so much to do so much possibilities ive always loved this game because it have no real objective singleplayer is really fun you can spawn ragdolls and pose them to make a scene or tie them to horriblymade cars and make the car fly off a ramp you can download new maps to explore and customize or make a house for no reason you dont have to be good at making properworking things to have fun in this game for goodness sake you dont even have to be creative if you can move your mouse and click then you can play this game you can do whatever you want you can make a monster out of chairs you can make rainbow melons you can milk carton fireworks if youd like it gets even better with the addons button just go to the menu click on the addons button and you have another whole world of inventions ideas creations and craziness do you want a tool that will turn things and yourself into a melon then get the addon for that its called the melonificator do you want a working piano that you use to play song with your keyboard then get the addon for that playable piano do you want ragdoll pokemon then get the addon for that pokemon ragdolls pack theres so much more addons which means theres so much more possibilities now with all of that its definitely worth $999 american dollars but theres more mulitiplayer multiplayer opens up the world of other peoples ideas and creations do you want to watch youtube videos in a movie with other people saying if they like it or not then go on cinema mode do you want to pretend to live another life get a job live in a house and interact with other people who are pretending to be neighbors then go on roleplaying mode theres lots of types of roleplaying modes be careful on which one you choose theres sandbox mode ttt mode trouble in terrorist town and lots more i cant even name them all now i know this has been a long review but if you think this is all you can do if garrys mod then you are dead wrong i havent named much of anything compared to all the possibilities in this game but there are a few errors 1 if youre new to the game which you probably are then the instructions and tips are very confusing to follow i had a tough time getting used to this game 2 very hard to create things like houses or put up doors and most of the time the game with glitch and youll likely have a hard time achieving what you want to do 3 the controls were confusing for me thats all i need to say  there are a little bit more problems but then theres the main question youre likely asking ok so is this game worth $999 again american dollars well in my honest opinion yes if you dont buy this game you have no idea what youre missing on i give this game 9510 stars
recommended
good game cheap hours of fun although you need counter strike source to play a lot of this game its still worth it id personally rate this 8510
recommended
its a must have its one of the best clusters ever made with all those gamemodes inside you will never be bored again
recommended
i love this game
recommended
i recommend this game purely because of prophunt i mean hiding as a soda can having armies of people chasing you with machine guns unable to hit you is a blast or getting trapped as a stove and no one noticing you sitting there next to two other stoves while taunting them as they enter the room and surving the round hilarious or running around as a coffee cup following a hunter around just waiting for them to look behind them and spot you is pure adrenaline pumping fun
recommended
its an amazing gamenotool for all your wildest dreams because the real world sucks you cant pitch your ideainvention to companies because of the risk of negative profit in garrys modyour idea is welcomed in with opened armscakeballoons and music some come live in gmoddington like the other 1 million people who all told us that they wouldnt leave for the world

huge fun enabled through a huge part of the source mod  many friends  teamspeakskype  awesome gamingexperience if you dont have a lowendpc or bad internet  causing laggsor even weird friends telling you the whole time you sound like a pimppander  many different modes you can spend a lot of time on  much time required to download ressources  you can use it in many different ways for example to make a little movieadvertisement through funny imagescuts you can create but for this reason id recommend source filmmaker this one requires some time to learn how to use it but it s way better to create a movie thorugh the sourcemod  very good pricepreformance ratio reduced  instabuy  if you dont want to get vision problems eye cancer through missing textures you practically have to install many sourcegames like cssource tf2 or half life

this game isjust fabulous you cab do what ever you want and this is not very expensive game d
recommended
i originally bought this for fappping purposes but soon discovered how fun it was to troll in terrorist town just wait for the weapons to go live and shoot everybody regardless if you re a traitor or an innocent try baiting other innocents into killing you or vice versa get them to kill another innocent if your a traitor i also recomend joining the serious ttt servers and pretend you are a traitor even if you arent by stealth killing people that way theres no way to track who did it good fun for that i also recommend downloading nude models and posing them in lewd ways so thats even better
recommended
the best game for randomly doing things that other games wouldnt allow you to do also that community has made enough gamemodes for this game to fill up the sun assuming that gamemodes actualy have physical substance but this review has gotten off track buy this game if you want to randomly shoot stuff play ttt or build gigantic monuments to your utmost awesomeness bacicly buy this game
recommended
great game

garrys mod is a brilliant sandbox which you can make thousands and thousands of things garrys mod also has hundreds of gamemodes like ttt trouble in terrorist town or prop hunt even melon bomber garrys mod has an amazing community that is really friendly and helpfull note you do come across a few horrible people but thats just the way the internet is garrys mod uses the workshop to its maximum potential with free dupes things people have made that you can spawn if they chose to publish it mods mods are modifactions that make the game better or add things like maps models npcs vehicles and player models garrys mod got me into making things for the community such as this review or my guide on how to change it to night or the hover car i made anyway the point i am trying to make is that this is a great game thank you for your time and i hope i see you in game

garrys mod is one of those games perfect for a specific audience although garrys mod is also a extremely modable game allowing the game to expand to people with different interests garrys mod simply started off as a sandbox for people who love goofing around like most sandbox games but like most good games to date the modding community took over creating quite the load of mods ranging from simple and fun addons to entire gamemodes which completely changed the game for example on garrys mod you can do the usual sandbox and just play around or you can explore the vast majority of gamemodes that range from roleplaying servers to terrorists killing eachother without the modifications of the modding community to date this game wouldnt be impressive at all but with the power of modding community this game is extremely fun and time consuming it never gets boring due to the extensive gamemodes each one reviving the game and only giving you more to do this game is one of my favorite games on steam 1010

recommended
this is possibly one of the most creative yet destructive games i have ever played when it comes to multiplayer you and your friends can do anything from taking on a horde of combine soldiers to leisurely relaxing and building something of your imagination but this game does not only have sandbox mode it has plenty of others all of which are very exciting trouble in terrorist town is a game where you use your wits skills or your weapon to kill the traitor or the innocents prop hunt is personally my favorite in garrys mod you can disguise yourself as a prop in the map and the hunters will have to find you but be careful you only have 3025 seconds to hide there are plenty of other things to do in garrys mod but i am afraid if i list them all i can waste your time explaining it to you when you can be playing it consider getting garrys mod alucard hellsing approves of this game and message
recommended
really fun game modes such as ttt and prophunt
recommended
warning possible effects of garrys mod are as follows addiction insane periods of playing time jumping to different gamemodes every 20 minutes and completely impossible to avoid unless you or your loved ones have a life i recommend you dont get this game if you dont have one buy it
recommended
if you have steam you must have this game endless possibilites

recommended
fun and entertaining each game mode may be difficult to understand at first but after a while you get the hang of it the only downside to it is that it is difficult to play if you do not have the textures for the maps if you do not have the files for them other than that it is a great game to buy and play with friends
recommended
first of all if your reading this you must love gmod 2nd this game is frecking 10 dollars oh my god what a great deal for a full ing game i mean seriosoulsy youd be stupid to not to buy it but 1 thing the community is complete  i mean people always say rdm and 7 years olds say you hacker ok but some servers are great like simple ttt and whynotzoiur not a complete  also all the bad comments are becasue little people think there so better than you when they have a frecking  little laptop

look at my hours that should describe it enough right not only has roleplaying in this game for several years given me thousand of hours of enjoyment but it also helped my writing skills and made me the linguist i am today not interested in roleplay how about base building base wars zombie survival of various flavors pirate ship wars running through a maze of traps with dozens of other players while three players are determined to set traps to kill you all space build there are dozens more gamemodes and new ones come out every couple of days

garrys mod is one of the best sandboxcommunity driven games on pc and possible in gaming if you are going to buy this you should buy css with it since many game modes use those textures in it sandbox mode is nice you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes i would recommend ttt as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in gmod gamemodesactaully it is the engine but eh there are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garrys mod and you will get you 10525 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers a great game with a good community if you know where to look

garrys nod is not a game it is a tool used for making your own creations and games garrys mod runs on the source engine which means you will need to have source games to play it mainly half life 2 and counterstrike source even though this seems like alot of money just to play one game it is worth every penny

garrys mod is a modification for the 2004 game halflife 2 it adds features which enable the player to have a sandbox experience sandbox being building stuff like houses or robots there is also a multiplayer mode where people can show off creations or battle it out with halflife 2 weapons then there is also content that can be used from other games css is almost required for a good gmod experience the community then expand the game to add more gamemodes and other addons like new weapons or nonplayable characters graphics cant really be judged its graphics are basically of 2004 standard and since hl2 had good graphics for its time gmod gets good graphics too if it was made in 2004 graphics  98  10 there is no story music artwork or any of that you cant say anything about this game now for my experience i wasted 400 hours that id never get back 10% of it went to sandbox trying to make animations and screwing around with npcs and console commands 5% went to gamemodes like prop hunt or trouble in terrorist town 1% of it went to playtesting my wip gamemode now the last 84% i spent on darkrp i dont like darkrp butbut but but but i cant stop ill tell you why going gun dealer just to purchase guns so i can raid the pd as hobo hearing the cries of children as i rdm them arresting admins while being in a sit its all too fun stealing cars then using them in street races street racing as a taxi driver kidnapping a police officer killing that police officer scamming people in exchange for death prop climbing into bases destroying their money printers its all too fun also you can have fun with the other 16% i spent its probably more worth your time overall garrys mod gets a 95  10 it is fun and wastes all your time it has a wide variety of gamemodes and new content always coming out it doesnt get a full 10 because the amount of annoying children on this game is over 9000

awesome game infinite possibilitys you can build tanks drones spaceshipsor whatever and even code them workshops fine too not to forget gamemodesfor the bad builders and updaates  d i can only recommend this game for people who like shootersrpsandbox games
recommended
no game can exactly compare to gmod it is incredible you can do so much and it is so fun whether you are sandboxing or playing trouble in terrorist town you will have lots of fun this game has many pros for starters the incredible physics engine of source combined with a sandbox game makes for some fun times this game can be used for making animations by spawning in ragdolls and positioning them where you want and finally snapping a picture you also get a lot for your $10 worth not only do you get sandbox which is fun in itself but you also have other games by the modding community build for garrys mod these are games such as stop it slender trouble in terrorist town murder prop hunt and many more however this game isnt perfect this game has a few minor cons that are worth talking about firstly if this is your first steam purchase or your first source game purchase you may run into a few problems see you need to buy a source engine game while that wasnt an issue for me i personally got steam for portal once now i use it much more others may find themselves not being able to play gmod secondly many of the games require counterstrike source this was a problem for me because i didnt want to pay $20 for css i was able to get the textures off the internet legally and mod my game so this was fixed however many users may not want to do this finally when you first play this game you may have no idea what it is exactly and just play sandbox which can get very boring theres no guide or help to tell you theres anything else to do to summerise gmod is a great game that will keep getting better as it is updated and as the community of modders and other workshop creators alike grows however because of some minor issues this game deserves an 83 out of 10 i recommend this game and you should definately buy it
recommended
did not get it at first but now its epic
recommended
really nice sandbox with lots of replayability just make sure you have counterstrike source before getting this
recommended
i highly recommend you buy this game it only costs $1000 this can be used well if you want to mess around build contraptions or film machinima or rp you can do pretty much anything in garrys mod
recommended
this game is amazing its what you get when you inject minecraft with steroids the description doesnt tell about the hundreds of gamemodes other gamers have created and the more source games you have installed the more props and textures you have too epic 1010
recommended
this is literally one of the best games ever made there is so much to do in this game firstly there is the community created content which is amazing secondly there is the content supplied by the creator which lets you do so much and thirdly there are a ton of gamemodes to play with your friends this is well worth your $10 and eveyone should get it must have
recommended

awesome youre given the ablility to spawn couches barrels zombies whatever some guns and a gun that allows you to sticks things together and such youre given tools to do something and left to do it theres no way to win except in your own mind when you build a giant base or car addons make the world open up more allowing you to pose better build epic machinery play something different kill those zombies in a creative way multiplayer only adds to the havoc allowing you to collabarate on bases and killing machines save your stuff to view later multiple gamemodes make the game even more exciting only one downside except on some good servers the community is comprised of spammers trollers spawn campers and overall idiots of course when that happens you dupe in your autokill machine and give them a taste summary gmod is love gmod is life gmod is awesome now to find a goat sim gamemode >d later reco

garrys mod is a very creative and fun game i find it different from any game really garrys mod vanilla lets you build contraptions and structures out of props from valve liscensed games and for people who think that isnt enough there are about 50 gamemodes to choose from and who knows how many addons and duplications there are to download from the steam workshop garrys mod in my opinion is very good game only contridicted by the occasional squeaker noobs that mic spam

this game is just awesome

i guess ive played this long enough to give it a review the game is pretty amazing it uses the source engine so you dont need a beefy computer to play it the game modes are just amazing im guessing most of you came here because of youtubers seananners venturian dasbo ect so here are a list of a bunch of gamemodes that im sure you have seen on youtube ttt trouble in terrorist town sandbox hide & seek prop hunt there are lots more gamemodes then this but those are the ones im sure you will play first remember to pick up counter strikesource if you are going to play any of the gamemodes because most servers require css the modding community will rarely ever take a break so if your looking for a cool addon youve found the right place most source games will work on gmod including halflife 2 halflife 2 episode 1 & episode 2 left for dead ect pros and cons lots of players and servers tons of mod support friendly for the most part community all kinds of gamemodes super computer not needed to run garrys mod  lots of fun to play with friends lots and lots of kids  lots of time will be sucked out of you the odd person that is a total arsepick to everyone aka the spammer or the rdmer well that is my review remeber to buy css before playing gmod if you are planning to play multiplayer 8510

garrys mod is one of the best sandboxcommunity driven games on pc and possible in gaming if you are going to buy this you should buy css with it since many game modes use those textures in it sandbox mode is nice you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes i would recommend ttt as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in gmod gamemodesactaully it is the engine but eh there are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garrys mod and you will get you 10525 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers a great game with a good community if you know where to look

garrys mod is an interesting tool that uses many different mechanics and is unlike any other sandbox game i played before but if you play with friend the fun continues with many different gmes modes such as sandbox trouble in terrorist town zombie survival and more the game has another interesting factor such as downloading various games on steam and using them on gmod like team fortress 2 counter strike and lots of other games as well

ive played this game for about 1500 hours now it never gets boring the fact that you can do literaly everything that you could possibly imagine blew my mind back when i started playing it and it still does today there are so many mods and creations it would take you years to look through all of them and the diffrent gamemode are also really fun to check out this game will make you say  dang and i payed 50 bucks for for flippin call of duty  ill give it 1010 stars because there is literaly nothing like it out there and the only end of the game is the end of your own imaginationand knowledge about the source hammer tool
recommended
all i can say is buy the game actually thats not all i can say that would be too much to list here but i can assure you that at least 85% of the things i could say are positive maybe 87% 90% maybe i wont go higher than that though but i digress one negative thing is theres too many glitches although most are caused by the community which is generally great though definitely worth the money but it might still be best to wait until it goes on sale it goes on sale so frequently that that shouldnt take too long but i digress again i think im gonna make i digress my motto dammit i digress again  just put it on your wishlist already
recommended
i have really enjoyed playing this game  hence the amount of time i have played on it it is a great game with many different gamemodesmods to play on eg murder prophunt darkrp and the list goes on and on i would highly recommend this game its not too expensive and is definitely worth it this game is very silly and fun at the same time xd

after playing for over 1200 hours youll learn a few things for multiplayer multiplayer can be a wonderful experiance that will forever change you create friendships and learn new ways to express yourself via creation 1 never use the kleiner skin 2 no how matter much you hate the map itll will always be there on a server 3 dont expect sympathy if your new but if you are be friendly dont act like you just learned how to use a computer last week 4 somebody will always be better at building than you but dont stop yourself from characteristic things that really say you you made this this is what i am 5 somebody will always be more notable than you for better or worse 6 youll always meet that one guy who is a master at almost everything but akward to be around chances are they are an admin 7 servers with custom ranks are guranteed to be a little sketchy 8 more often than not somebody will scream out darkrp rules on your sandbox server 9 ever hear the phrase rdm where it doesnt belong note note 8 10 all admins have different personalities and odds are you cant please all of them stick to rules 3 and 4 11 admins may have a domino effect so try to please atleast one as a friend 12 quality over quantity who says 13 dont be a child you are guranteed to get muted or hated unless your playing on respective child friendly servers this means anyone under 12 14 you could have 400 addons but each server you join is going to have atleast 10 things for you to get this could go on forever rules and situations in which theyd apply but id reccomened gmod for anyone looking for an experiance unlike any other
recommended
if you want to have fun with your friends this game is ideal for you a supreme sandbox game that i undoubtedly reccomend

garrys mod is a very fun game theres no story behind it and for a game like this it works there are some minor glitches that break immersion at times 710
recommended
with the variety of games and playerbase thanks to the community surrounding it garrys mod is one of the most fun sandboxes i have ever played there are still a few issues with the game itself but once you work around them given that they havent been fixed the entirety of the game is a ball of enjoyment that one would happily waste hours of their lives on would recommend to any casual gamer whos looking for a laugh

this review is very short garrys mod is not a game it is a physics toy and sandbox style tool in gmod you can reluctantly do whatever you want to you can build things such as cars buildings bunkers airships boats or whatever you can think up use weapons from other valve games as well as addon weapons created by other people play with physics kill npcs with literally anything drive a world of vehicles paint destroy stuff spawn props spawn ragdolls to pose and beat up make a machinima for use on youtube or other video websites listen to music and much much more there are addons to download like maps and player models the maps can vary from counter strike to team fortress portal to garrys mod and day of defeat to left 4 dead a very addicting toy from team garry

recommended
despite its release date this is still one of the best games out there where only your imagination is the limit to what you can do the base game is sandbox with halflife 2 weapons and it supports models from most source engine games such as counterstrike source team fortress 2 and left for dead 2 new features aswell as modifying exisiting ones can be done through modding and the language used in the mods is lua which is very easy to pick up on and learn
recommended
this game has provided me with hours upon hours of enjoyment highly recommend this game

what is it is probably the most frequently asked question about gmod this ever changing game has left many with that question unanswered today we seek to have that question answered today we will leave that question unanswered welcome to garrys mod i suppose i should start with the gameplay that is just the unique thing about gmod though it has no one set gamemode the whole point of gmod is to test create and try out the many different gamemodes you can download from the steam workshop they are fun and there is a great variety to chose from the game also comes with two preloaded gamemodes trouble in terrorist town and sandbox sandbox is basic builddo whatever you want gamemode while trouble in terrorist town is a murdererdetective style gamemode both are fun and intuitive the sandbox gamemode gives you more freedom but has a bit of a larger learning curve the trouble in terrorist town gamemode is a bit more for those who are accustomed to games like unreal tournament or counterstrike i personally prefer playing on the sandbox gamemode as it allows you to build anything you want via the tools provided within the source engine you might still be wondering what exactly do you do in garrys mod well to answer your question just about anything you want that is what makes garrys mod so amazingthe freedom limited by unlimited boundaries now as for the graphics they are good the source engine does an excellent job of creating a beautiful fluid and realistic world for being an engine almost 10 years old it still does not falter in its quality the sound is anything but a disappointment it is loud powerful and moving because this is primarily a sandbox game it gives the user freedom to add on their own sounds or sound effects from the workshop i cannot tell you how many times i have been playing on some kind of a horror map and the key element was the loud and pulsing sound a screech coming from behind sounds like a real screech from behind ok now for lasting appeal ummmmhmmmm about as unlimited and ongoing as you want it to be simple as that all in all this is a great game for minecraft lovers 14 and up  and source engine developers alike why wellcause its gmod of course and what is that exactly well lets not go down that road overall rating 810 presentation 910 multiplayer 610 gameplay 7510 graphics 710 sound 810 lasting appeal 1010 overall rating 810
recommended

cons darkrp is normally filled with minges and kids who dont even know what the hell to do ttt is filled with rdmers and kids who think its some kind of form of counterstrike sandbox is no just dont go to sandbox pros if your lucky enough and you find a server with a good community the game becomes instantly needs some kind of ing oscar or emmie

a true garrys mod player does posing animations building playing dark rp and zombie survival a true gmod player plays on an online sandbox and keeps to himself but respects others a true gmod player uploads good dupes and saves a good gmod player makes workshop content if youve ever been called a mingebagminge or have called a minge a clone or only played past gmod 12 spawn dupes on servers or makes  sexual themed dupes or plays ttt or prophunt youre likey to be a massive thundercunt who should gtfo and go find a completely new game i do reccomend this game because the amount of good players there are out there seemingly just make the experience a whole lot better dont worry about the  mingebags

garrys mod is a silly fun sandbox game that allows you to make or play with lots of things i enjoy this game a lot especially in multiplayer anyone who like minecraft or roblox will love this game shooters will enjoy too
recommended
first you must ask your self am i ready you might be but then it happens the minges the badmins the annoying children that flocked there because of youtubers but i am making this sound like a horrible game it is not it is such a creative game but the people who play are mixed do you like to rp build kill well this is a game for you now if you came like this oh boy i saw seananners play this i think its called prop hunt and ttt seems like so much fun then dont play because the people will tear you to the ground let me explain rp its fun with friends can be even more fun with good people but minges are everywhere so prepare for them the worst thing your going to encounter in this game is admins these beast are 1216 year olds who are power hungry or are always angry if your lucky you will find the good admins ttt can be fun if you like mystery this is a game for you murder is like this so it wont get a seperate thing minges get dealt with quick but admins will perma ban you on a instant for one mistake if you are lucky you will get a good server hard to come by prophunt this is the most known one i believe havent played much but havent seen much badmins fairly simple be a prop hide and get hunted hide and seek is alot like this so it wont get a thing that sums it up pretty much dont suspect to have fun all the time the game can be really fun good luck and prepare for fun and hardship sincerelykungpow chicken
recommended
pros do what you want alot of varied gamemodes aswell as sandbox great game to play with friends cheap cons loading screens basically perfect game 1010

garrys mod is a modification for the 2004 game halflife 2 it adds features which enable the player to have a sandbox experience sandbox being building stuff like houses or robots there is also a multiplayer mode where people can show off creations or battle it out with halflife 2 weapons then there is also content that can be used from other games css is almost required for a good gmod experience the community then expand the game to add more gamemodes and other addons like new weapons or nonplayable characters graphics cant really be judged its graphics are basically of 2004 standard and since hl2 had good graphics for its time gmod gets good graphics too if it was made in 2004 graphics  98  10 there is no story music artwork or any of that you cant say anything about this game now for my experience i wasted 400 hours that id never get back 10% of it went to sandbox trying to make animations and screwing around with npcs and console commands 5% went to gamemodes like prop hunt or trouble in terrorist town 1% of it went to playtesting my wip gamemode now the last 84% i spent on darkrp i dont like darkrp butbut but but but i cant stop ill tell you why going gun dealer just to purchase guns so i can raid the pd as hobo hearing the cries of children as i rdm them arresting admins while being in a sit its all too fun stealing cars then using them in street races street racing as a taxi driver kidnapping a police officer killing that police officer scamming people in exchange for death prop climbing into bases destroying their money printers its all too fun also you can have fun with the other 16% i spent its probably more worth your time overall garrys mod gets a 95  10 it is fun and wastes all your time it has a wide variety of gamemodes and new content always coming out it doesnt get a full 10 because the amount of annoying children on this game is over 9000

i am the mayor of a small town i must be honest life here is rather odd the hobos are planning an uprising for no apparent reason and one of them seems to be a taliban supporter crime rate is skyhigh here i keep getting kidnapped for that 15 i have stached away in my bank account and the terrorist group ponysquirtsjpg want me to remove the law that legalizes money printers and drugs also theres this restaurant which also sells drugs in which sometimes people randomly light up on fire and then speak complete and utter gibberish such as waaiiit weiaiatt mus tll u bout mikerosuhpht xl we are also at war with the sewer demons intent of enslaving us surface dwellers by slashing us with damascus swords luckily were able to combat them with our elite swat unit led by an 8 year old who is currently running around the fountain telling everyone to raise your dongers   i decided to abdicate from mayorhood and look for other oppertunities i found myself as a security guard in the theatre for my friend who had joined me on the server i return from having a  to find out hes turned the theatre into a strip club and the cinema shows graphic sexual anime scenes after i saw the video mememe up on there my life changed forever you know those videos which are so weird and scary that you just cant explain yeah this was one of those its even worse than hentai thats all i can say really also hobos have taken over the bank and have turned it into the first church of shrek so i quit my job as a security guard and became a police officer my friend i mentioned earlier became a hobo and renamed his job to yoshis pet the new mayor who was swag by the way granted him permission to be in the pd and even store a printer in there unfortunately it seems the rest of the police force are illiterate they keep arresting him for being in the pd even though the mayor keeps telling them hes allowed inside then on a fateful night i realise there are 5 armed men raiding the pd i decide to take action and arrest every single one of them \^_^ unfortunately this is when things take a turn for the worst all 5 of them start yelling rda random arrest in the chat and the admin comes along and looks into it he was obviously gullible enough to believe those boring sods because the next thing i know ive been banned for a week for mass rda oh yeah the sandbox and trouble in terrorist modes are cool too 911 all the admins are horny preteens or younger

garrys mod on sand box is amsing beacuase of the malleus gamming sever if it wasent for netblitzer to make that sever i wouldent be on garrys mod or writting this review and that is wie i thank netblitzer
recommended
yolo this comes in mind when you think about everything you can make garrys mod is the ultimate sandbox game it does crash many times because of addons or you need some source game other then css you will usually need all source game to be sure to have every single addon to work you can do wahtever you want workshop allow you to add more content to this game which add more stuff to maximise your experience of building roleplaying ragdoll posing  making scenes with ragolls  you can choose to play with the game itself the basic choice or add more complex addons like wiremod which will introduce a kind of logic to garrysmod and this will allow you to make ingame computers automated contraptions and even more like holographics fancy stuff  910 because of the stability

i think my hours played speaks for itself on this one but in case youre still not sure about whether or not to get garrys mod let me help you out there are a seemingly infinite amount of ways to enjoy this game so much content for such an incredibly low price my personal favorite game modes are prop hunt and murder not only is it fun to play but its made for some excellent youtube content the best prop hunt and murder server ive been on is lobster build i would definitely recommend checking out their servers when you get this game wwwlobsterbuildcom

garrys mod is a sandbox game you have a wide variety of props from various source games depending on which you own and multiple tools at your disposal with these you can build different contraptions make vehicles construct buildings etc as well as all the content included in the game you can find a ton of mods online via the games website or steam workshop you can also makescript your own but the fun doesnt stop there multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely you can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes from hide and seek to role playing there is a huge variety of unique modes to play a few i would recommend are trouble in terrorist town a group of innocent terrorists must work with the detectives to discover who the traitors are and kill them the traitors must take out the innocents preferably without alerting anyone else no one knows who is innocent and who is not making for a sometimes tense experience morbus a group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens or kill them all there are two types of aliens brood aliens and swarm aliens the brood aliens get upgrades and can transform into humans allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one the swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die assuming they were killed by another swarm alien or human these have a melee and ranged attack but no upgrades their role is to weaken the humans and try to kill them the humans have needs every now and then you will have to either sleep eat shower or pee you cannot move during this time so must be wary of those around you in case they are brood aliens overall one of the best game modes a ton of fun especially with friends darkrp darkrp is one of the more casual rp modes in gmod you spawn into the map as a citizen and can choose a job to play as from drug dealers to civil protection there is a wide variety of roles to pick you can go around earning money commit crimes buy and furnish your own house etc great if you find the more serious rp servers to be boring if you plan to buy the game be sure you own counterstrike source too a lot of maps use textures from css and if you do not own it you will see purple and black squares everywhere overall the game is absolutely brilliant one of the very few that i can keep going back to and not get bored one of the best purchases i have ever made
recommended
this game is filled with opetuneties and you will liturely never get bored of playing buy this game
recommended
dont even take time to look at the reviews they will all say the same thing get this game if your still doubting me and want to read the reviews fine by me but youll just be wasting your time get this ing game do it think about doing it if you get it on sale its even better because the greatest wackiest best physicssandboxcrazyimulator2014 is cheaper get this game in all seriousness please get this game youll be glad you did

alot of people attack gmod because they go into it with the attitude of ill join a multiplayer server and ask for advice on how to play and then they cry like a little  because either its too confusing or people online are mean well good for them garrys mod is an absolutly amazing sandbox game once you understand it and alot of people dont if you dont have a friend to guide you like i did then watch a youtube tutorial or something for 6 its fantastic what youre provided with and the amount of stuff you can do plus its got something for everyone that arent the morons i mentioned previously you can build whacky contraptions in sanbox play an intense game of trouble in terrorist town roleplay in well roleplay the gamemodes vary from being chased by slender in a fast epic search to find the eight pages all the way to relaxing with your freinds and watching youtube videos in the gmod cinema like i said the game description is a lie theres so much more to do than just sandbox it just takes some getting used to it really is one of the most addictive games out there its such a shame that it was dragged down when little kids started to play if youre a child playing this game for the love of all that is sane in the world  off and go back to call of duty where you belong

despite its release date this is still one of the best games out there where only your imagination is the limit to what you can do the base game is sandbox with halflife 2 weapons and it supports models from most source engine games such as counterstrike source team fortress 2 and left for dead 2 new features aswell as modifying exisiting ones can be done through modding and the language used in the mods is lua which is very easy to pick up on and learn

this game has provided me with hours upon hours of enjoyment highly recommend this game

what is it is probably the most frequently asked question about gmod this ever changing game has left many with that question unanswered today we seek to have that question answered today we will leave that question unanswered welcome to garrys mod i suppose i should start with the gameplay that is just the unique thing about gmod though it has no one set gamemode the whole point of gmod is to test create and try out the many different gamemodes you can download from the steam workshop they are fun and there is a great variety to chose from the game also comes with two preloaded gamemodes trouble in terrorist town and sandbox sandbox is basic builddo whatever you want gamemode while trouble in terrorist town is a murdererdetective style gamemode both are fun and intuitive the sandbox gamemode gives you more freedom but has a bit of a larger learning curve the trouble in terrorist town gamemode is a bit more for those who are accustomed to games like unreal tournament or counterstrike i personally prefer playing on the sandbox gamemode as it allows you to build anything you want via the tools provided within the source engine you might still be wondering what exactly do you do in garrys mod well to answer your question just about anything you want that is what makes garrys mod so amazingthe freedom limited by unlimited boundaries now as for the graphics they are good the source engine does an excellent job of creating a beautiful fluid and realistic world for being an engine almost 10 years old it still does not falter in its quality the sound is anything but a disappointment it is loud powerful and moving because this is primarily a sandbox game it gives the user freedom to add on their own sounds or sound effects from the workshop i cannot tell you how many times i have been playing on some kind of a horror map and the key element was the loud and pulsing sound a screech coming from behind sounds like a real screech from behind ok now for lasting appeal ummmmhmmmm about as unlimited and ongoing as you want it to be simple as that all in all this is a great game for minecraft lovers 14 and up  and source engine developers alike why wellcause its gmod of course and what is that exactly well lets not go down that road overall rating 810 presentation 910 multiplayer 610 gameplay 7510 graphics 710 sound 810 lasting appeal 1010 overall rating 810

i like this game because it gives you the spare time to have fun with your friends play and meet new people on steam and it also is game to basically roleplay or do anything really
recommended
meh its decent personally i only play it for the fun gamemodes but no one makes any good ones anymore the only ones that are good are dark rp for trolling zombie survival gets old fast and a couple other ones people just play gmod for ttt and roleplay but none of those get updated anymore and since the developers are making rust then gmod is just forgotten now which makes me sad as this has so much potential good news is most of the 10 year old s of the gmod community are now gone thanks to rust d also the developers are greedy s

a good indie game for all who is creative includes tens of selections of minigames for garrys mod for example roleplay jailbreak prophunt stop it slender and obviously alot more in my own opinion this game is great for artisticcreative types of people over the age of 13 most people on garrys mod seem to be squeekers as elders seem to say this game is very educational you can learn basic science and alot of techniqual difficulties able to easily solve the main feature of garrys mod is sandbox the gamemode where you can do anything you can also create a server to allow your friends to play with if youre going to buy this game i seriously suggest buying counter strike source too and halflife take my advice on this game like seriously i downloaded this game in 2008 and have been playing it every day since it never gets boring there is allways someone or something to keep you occupied you can take my advice because ive been playing this game for years you can easily tell look at my game time over 2300 hours thats a long time i hope this helped

i havent played much but from what ive heard on my mums pregnancy chat rooms kids zone irc this game is amazing comments such as i built a house what does q do and stretching often enhances birthing speed are just some of the literally seven comments ive heard of it as an experiment i put my three year old brother on the game and within 12 seconds he was in control of the entire mafia and running an illegal drug operation out of a shabby 4wallsandafadingwall house but then the admin came on and said he cant shoot people walking past for being over 15 nonetheless the superadmin came on and banned that admin before celebrating his 13th birthday with his mum if i had to say one thing about the game it would be something really good but im not sure what because my 16th birthday is tomorrow and im not really thinking edit this game is so  now that im 16 i play csgo i have 23 knives you cant get knives in gmod this game is  and gay and you cant shoot everyone edit i play this game with my friends sometimes but i usually just lobby with them for a csgo match i dont have much time anymore because i work after leaving school but this game is okay if you didnt have to put up with the 12 year olds

the community makes this game if it wasnt for the community it would be a poorly coded piece of  uninspired mod made by a guy who doesnt want to hire people to help him and wants it to remain his singular masterpiece of a creation which he breaks every update wait its that too okay yeah i sort of hate this game but i have 1600 hours in it and that is only due to the community the community made ttt darknorp and all the other gamemodes that make gmod stick out garry didnt garry doesnt do  garry breaks  every update that ends up killing off good gamemodes i dont like garry okay

garrys mod well theres a lot i can say about this game it started as a simple modification and its now one of the most popular games on steam how you ask because its open source [enwikipediaorg] sure the game has its cons like times where framerate gets bad but theres a lot of fun to be had like constructing things with friends or roleplaying on darkrp my pros >expansive list of gamemodes >completely userpopulated >never the same experience >coop playability >overall a fun experience my cons >large amount of griefers >underage mic spam >immaturity >framerate loss at times >at least 1 source game required tf2 counts but i strongly suggest css >crashes relating to addons despite the cons this game is worth checking out i hope you enjoy playing this and have fun source 16934 hours

yet another briliant game from valve if you are thinking about getting this game get it it is the most addictive game in the history of games to be warned 1 as i am in australia i can not connect to well to american servers but there are still 100s of communitys out there who play the most common gamemodes 2 do not judge the game via the single player multiplayer is the way to go with 100s of game modes and 10s of thousands of players every second all the popular gamemodes as of 310114 gamemode number 1 ttt also know as trouble in terrorist town is a game were you can be picked to play as 1 of 3 classes if you will they are innocent were you are to kill all the traitors before they kill you note do not kill anyone for looking sus tratior you are there to kill anyone with any means possible but do not get caught doing so this will result in people killing you detective you are basicly an innocent but with a twist if you find a dead body you can id it finding the dna of a tratior you are a huge influance on the game therfore you are a target to the tratiors trying staying in a large group my favgamemode number 2 darkrp darkrp is a game all about roleplaying you can become anything from a cop to a hardcore murderer do make sure you read the rules on this gamemode as there are a lot of way to be banned or kicked on this gamemode gamemode number 3 prop hunt prop hunt is a game were there are two teams these teams are the prop you can turn into anything you can see make sure you blend into the enviroment or you will be found and killed by the hunters this class is the class that goes around looking for the props by searching the enviroment for differences and then if they feel the need that can shot it but if they get it wrong depending on how many props they hit they loss 5 95 health so be warned so this is garrys mod i would recomend this to anyone even my grammar i give it a 1010 and i see my self playing this sucker for a long time to come  sorry for grammar and spelling mistakes i wrote this up in 2 minutes

a real bunch of laughs for everyone who plays it garrys mod is a true piece of art whether you are new to this genre or a seasoned professional i reccomend this game to everyone you can create wonderful contraptions glorious views or if this does not appeal to you just plain and simple beating the crap out of random objects and npcs there are thousands of modifications to the vanilla game like extra maps vehicles and weapons so many weapons so in conclusion wonderful game the only real downside is that it tends to crash a lot if you have a lot of addons despite the downsides i rate this game an 8510

garrys mod is a great game for both casual and hardcore gamers with plenty of game modes and its wellknown sandbox feature it is pretty hard to become fed up of this stupendous game although this game is currently priced at a very respectable 599 it is much more expensive overall for instance missing textures is a big f nuisance in this game pardon my french to make things easy this game requires you to have certain games installed in order to not see bright purple and black checkered squares everywhere or the well know error instead of your desired object in game so to overcome this you may need to buy some of if not all of valves games yes from css to hl2 as the game does indeed run on the source engine negatives aside this game is extremely fun especially with friends inviting a group of friends and then just spawn killing them with duplicated dynamite or crushing them with the random prop is freaking hilarious and oddly amusing and of course the odd immature player that spawns in barney and the metrocops in the relentless anal sex posturing with alyx vance aside from that gmod consists of 8 game modes and dozens of others that are made by the almost infinite online community trouble in terrorist town ttt and cityrp being my favourites of most of the game modes building may look pretty daunting at times and trust me it is but with practice it becomes a subconscious feat but not to worry making a pretty basic and cool looking build that can easily impress or annoy your many friends can only take a few hover balls with the stay upright feature on and a muscle rope that can move in all directions and shabam you got a pretty easy build right in front of your eyes and for all the lazy buggers out there garry kindly added the dupes button which allows you to spawn and use other people amazing creations that can kill and impress the people around you overall this game is a must buy and i recommend it highly to anyone who just wants to have a good time with friends or the vast community opiziite  97

now garrys mod really gets me questioning my sexualality i always thought i was a hetro sexual type of transvestite even though i always had a crush on edward cullen but who doesnt but when i first spawned gman and gordan freeman together it made be so aroused that i started to make a famous series of gay porn called gmans gspot which can be found on {link removed} bestgorecom this really has ruined all my relationships in my life which is why i have to give this game a 05 out of 10
recommended
i found garrys mod from seananners when he played ttt after playing the game myself i soon fell in love with it i currently have 1000 hours and i have met about all my friends on this game as so as other amazing people this game has amazing gamemodes like ttt deathrun jailbreak gmtower minigames and so much more this game gives a unique experience you will ever have it is not like minecraft or any regular fps shooter but it mixes just about everything you will ever play in this i recommend this game a lot and you will not regret spending under $15 dollars for this game
recommended
short version  fun and great to play with friends
recommended
garrys mod gives you a ridiculous amount of freedom with tons of ridiculous tools which translates into a lot of ridiculous fun the huge amount of workshop content and the ability to do just about whatever you want with it gives this game truly endless potential and diversity at its core its a sandbox but if youre the type that needs an objective to have a good time there are plenty of gamemodes that can completely change the way you play for $10 or the price of one of the packages that includes it garrys mod really is a musthave for anyone that enjoys stupid fun from time to time
recommended
realy nice game   
recommended
great game with alot of gamemodes for alot of playtime huge community d
recommended
one of the funniest games ever and possibly one of the best games ever playing sandbox with addons with friends is very fun

garrys mod is a sandbox game you have a wide variety of props from various source games depending on which you own and multiple tools at your disposal with these you can build different contraptions make vehicles construct buildings etc as well as all the content included in the game you can find a ton of mods online via the games website or steam workshop you can also makescript your own but the fun doesnt stop there multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely you can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes from hide and seek to role playing there is a huge variety of unique modes to play a few i would recommend are trouble in terrorist town a group of innocent terrorists must work with the detectives to discover who the traitors are and kill them the traitors must take out the innocents preferably without alerting anyone else no one knows who is innocent and who is not making for a sometimes tense experience morbus a group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens or kill them all there are two types of aliens brood aliens and swarm aliens the brood aliens get upgrades and can transform into humans allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one the swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die assuming they were killed by another swarm alien or human these have a melee and ranged attack but no upgrades their role is to weaken the humans and try to kill them the humans have needs every now and then you will have to either sleep eat shower or pee you cannot move during this time so must be wary of those around you in case they are brood aliens overall one of the best game modes a ton of fun especially with friends darkrp darkrp is one of the more casual rp modes in gmod you spawn into the map as a citizen and can choose a job to play as from drug dealers to civil protection there is a wide variety of roles to pick you can go around earning money commit crimes buy and furnish your own house etc great if you find the more serious rp servers to be boring if you plan to buy the game be sure you own counterstrike source too a lot of maps use textures from css and if you do not own it you will see purple and black squares everywhere overall the game is absolutely brilliant one of the very few that i can keep going back to and not get bored one of the best purchases i have ever made
recommended
this game is filled with opetuneties and you will liturely never get bored of playing buy this game
recommended

recommended
possibly the greatest sandbox mod to ever exist combining source games with this mod is revolutionary no mod has ever been this creative if this game didnt have the steam workshop then this game would never be as good as it is now and the fact that they made this back in 2006 is incredible if any other company tried to make a replica of garrys mod in 2014 i reckon it would be awful 1010

should you buy gmod well i will tell you how i became robin to give you a rough idea of what gmod is like i hadnt been on garrys mod in a while and needed to uninstall some games so i tried it out i instantly went online and looked for a new server to join and came across a server known as derprp under the darkrp section of multiplayer as soon as i got onto the server i was confronted by a rocket launcher wielding hitler and batman i attemtped to pee on hitler and he responded by pulling a shotgun and demanding i get in his sex dungeon they locked me in the room for 10 minutes and give me a baby doll covered in blood to play with before executing me when i respawned i came out into the street to see a large group of people get blown up by batman and my goal became clear to me i must team up with them and build a bank where we steal peoples printers unfortunatly by the time we had finished the bank i had to go so they requested that i left gmod running when i arrived home i found that batman and hitler and stolen all my printers destroyed my base and murdered me before leaving the bank alarm on for all my neighbours to hear coming out of my full volume speakers seconds after i respawned i was then mugged by an angry group of hobos who eventually pushed me infront of a train but when it looked like i was going to die again hitler and batman showed up wielding swords the hobos scattered and made dolphin noises as they ran away getting chased by a  off hitler batman placed a couch that he had in his pocket on the track and escaped with only a split second to spare as me and batman emerged from the underground train station i looked up into the sky and thought to myself damn this is bad  before hitler reappeared and blew us both up garrys mod isnt only a great game its a great game to make friends to this date me and hitler and batman still go round invading french servers which dont have any admins and murdering innocent civilains but thats what makes gmod so fun you can do litterlay anything i would reccomend garrys mod to everyone that has a sense of humour andor a soul gmod is love gmod if life

garrys mod is with out a doubt the best game on steam i own you can spend countless hours playing and still find new and intersting things to do almost anything can be created wether you build it in sandbox or develope it in lua the possibilites are endless garrys mod ships with two default gamemodes sandbox and trouble in terrorist town sandbox is simply what you make of it the main point to sandbox is to create new contraptions and play around with them sandbox has no real goal to it unless you make one yourself and the other gamemode trouble in terrorist town actually has a point to it in touble in terrorist town you spawn [randomly] as a traitor innocent or detective the traitors goal is to try and eliminate the innocent and detectives while the innocent and detectives goal is to find out who the traitors are and try to eliminate them instead garrys mod also supports customgamemodes every other gamemode besides sandbox and trouble in terrorist town have been made by the community gamemode creation takes time patience and knowledge there are many different gamemodes that have been created ranging from sandbox and trouble in terrorist town spinoffs to roleplay deathmatch survival and more finding a new gamemode to play is as easy as opening the ingame server browser and joining a server every server in garrys mod is run by the community there are no servers hosted by the games creators servers run any gamemode they choose and how the choose servers are able to add addons created by the community to make the experience more enjoyable for everyone addons are another thing that garrys mod shines at addons are made by the community like most everything and usually help to heighten your overall fun while playing thousands and thousands of addons of every sort have been made through garrys mods existence there are addons ranging from roller coaster creators new and different weapons and tools new maps and almost anything you can think of overall i belive that garrys mod can be an enjoyable game for anyone what you get out of playing garrys mod is what you make it since garrys mod has no predefine goals you can really do just about anything and then some garrys mod is worth the amazingly cheap price tag
recommended
not only does this game host a sandbox for tons of possibilities it holds playermade gamemodes to play for thousands of hours as you can see by my number of hours played once i heard of garrys mod i got it for ttt but then i found other gamemodes like darkrp spacebuild 3 pirate ship wars and sledbuild these things made me a busy man for a very long time and that time is still going on right now
recommended
got the game played with friends and an hour later we created a bathtub propelled by 27 thrusters attached to the back and 4 usable chairs inside and the day after i joined the same server my friends where on and i got hit by another flying bathtub followed by a giant snack machine with an explosive barrel welded onto it ten out of 10
recommended
you can throw bathtubs at people 1010

an amazing and creative game i would definitely recommend this game

this game is way too addicting dont play this if you have a job or if you are doing exams seriously time for wiki spam garrys mod often abbreviated as gmod is a sandbox physics game using a modified source engine created by garry newman garrys mod has been available on valves content delivery service steam since november 29 2006[1] in the past purchase of garrys mod required the user to own at least one game on steam based on the source engine such as halflife 2 counterstrike source portal or team fortress 2[1] however as of may 2014 the game can be purchased by itself on steam it is also commonly used for the creation and publishing of videos[3][4] on youtube mainly from team fortress 2 halflife 2 portal left 4 dead and left 4 dead 2 garrys mod was originally a modification for valves halflife 2 but was later made into a standalone steam game that was officially released on november 29 2006 dubbed garrys mod 10 the current version garrys mod 140404 was released on april 4 2014 in february 2014 it was revealed on twitter by newman that the game had just broke us$ 30 million[5] as of november 2013 the game has sold 35 million copies although garrys mod is usually considered to be a full game it has no game objective and players can use the games set of tools for any purpose whatsoever although sometimes when playing on a multiplayer server it may have roleplay or other types of game modes garrys mod allows players to manipulate items furniture and props  various objects that players can place ingame props can be selected from any installed source engine game or from a community created collection the game features two guns  physics gun and tool gun for manipulating objects the physics gun allows objects to be picked up adjusted and frozen in place the tool gun is a multipurpose tool for performing various tasks such as combining props attaching them via ropes and creating controllable winches and wheels the tool gun is also used to control addons created by the community another popular garrys mod concept is ragdoll posing the player can instantiate a ragdoll model from a source game and pose it using a variety of tools[7] this is a popular tool for making fanmade videos and machinimas garrys mod takes advantage of the source engines modified version of the havok physics engine[8] which allows players to build contraptions that follow the laws of physics in winter 20092010 a contest was held for garrys mod by the games developers to create the best new game mode using a programming framework called fretta[10] fretta italian for hurry allows developers to quickly and easily create new game modes for garrys mod with commonly required functionality already implemented so the developers can focus on unique aspects of their game modes fretta was inspired by a similar fan created framework rambo_6s simple gamemode base however for inclusion in garrys mod newman decided to rewrite it with input and contributions from the original author and other developers[11] the winners of the contest range from a recreation of the mafia party game to an aerial combat game mode[12] the contest winners have been included in garrys mod with their own steam achievements[13] three of the winning games have been shipped trouble in terrorist town dogfight arcade and prop hunt on september 7 2010 newman added a feature called the toybox to garrys mod[15] it utilizes the amazon s3 service to download third party content such as weapons props maps game modes or models directly to the users machine while in game in an interview with gmod news garry newman said that one of gmods biggest draws is the amount of third party content i want to make it easier for people to utilize that i really want to move away from having to download files from websites and drag them to folders thats old school so thats what im heading towards maps models saved games etc all saved on the cloud and accessible with a click everything should be accessible from ingame if it isnt ive failed

garrys mod is great as a multiplayer experience its fun to mess around with friends build contraptions and battle each other exploring and manipulating content from your favourite supported games is great too there are also lots of gamemodes that you can play which arguably turn garrys mod into a number of smaller games in their own right ie murder which is basically like a violent firstperson cluedo to say that garrys mod is a onesizefitsall roleplay shooter building game etc etc is pushing it a bit you can do all of those things but often in a watered down way to get the most out of the game drop any expectations and go with the flow embrace the wacky physics open freedom and virtually endless usercreated content its the best and at times iest game you never knew you needed its the quintessential steam sandbox game

garrys mod is one of those games that everyone has and everyone should have you really can do whatever you want with it and is amazing with friends
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played very versatile you can do basically anything you set your mind to wanna make a vehicle you can do that wanna pose characters you can do that wanna slaughter combines got it wanna slap gman got that too
recommended
garrys mod is an extremely fun game because it functions mostly on workshop addons you can turn it into amost anything you want however because anything besides the normal sandbox vertion of the game need other textures from games that also run source you need to own about half the games valve makes so if you wish to play garrys mod it would be best to own most of the games in the valve complete pack normally this is around $100 but goes on sale for $25 every few months so i would suggest waiting until the valve complete pack goes on sale and buying it along with garrys mod all of the games that i have played in the valve complete pack are extrememly fun anyway so youll want to own them just to play anyway

one of my favourite games on steam its only 599 and with literally hundreds of thousands of addons and custom gamemodes its definitely worth the price for the amount of fun you can have on it you may want to get a group of friends together to play it at first as some of the tools can be hard to use but after an hour or two you can make anything you want with a few youtube guides maybe
recommended
this is by far my favorite steam sandbox game with the server aspect it allows you to play with all of your friends and have tons of fun with strangers personally my favorite gamemode in it is jailbreak but thats my opinion theres also ttt which is loads of fun deathrun and much much more i highly suggest this game to everyone who wants to have fun

this game is really fun you can do really much with this game you can make stuff thats either wierd and fun or you can make big constructions etc but this is just a little part of it when you buy the game you have different gamemodes like trouble in trerrorist town prop hunt sandbox stop it slender gmod zombie survival something like that and more and you can play alone if you feel like not playing online but to get most of the textures you need counter strike source the half life series tf 2 and im not sure but i alsow think you need some textures from left 4 dead 2 but again i might be mistaking but if you dont want to spend more money you can find some of the textures in the workshop

recommended
for having 650 hours on this game i can fairly say my opinion without any biass its a great game as long as you know who youre playing with and the server owner that you play on really thats it pros amazing amount of selection for the cost so many servers to try youre bound to like one cons you must have css to play correctly without errors unless you download homebrew textures or resources which i would not trust really thats the only one
recommended
few minutes play the game few hours finding the mod  1010 would not miss all the fun

garrys mod a very large game by facepunch studios it gives you the power to do so much and yet it always ends the same way with blood splattered on the walls to describe garrys mod is hard but possible and in sections is the best way to do it garrys mod is all about creation it was originally designed as a sandbox game where you can spawn hundreds of props in weld them together and make incredible things but that was a long time ago and garrys mod isnt just a game for welding things now you can use winches rope hover balls emitters and a very large assortment of weapons the game requires a few other games to be installed to see everything though source mod games the minimum amount of games youll need to see the most are the games team fortress 2 counterstrike source and half life source the game can still be played without them but is better with them you can spawn in props and characters from those games too if you like the medic from tf2 why not rebuild the meet the medic video clip over the years of people playing around with garrys mod extra game modes were born spacebuild original mod removed trouble in terrorist town murder prop hunt darkrp sled build bomber man and many more these game modes change the way garrys mod played from once a game about welding to watermelons together and then blowing them up to thing like finding a traitor and killing him running from a knife wielding murderer hiding as a pot plant in the snow and dropping explosive watermelons hoping to win the game apart from the sandbox hundreds of servers and many game modes garrys mod also has steam workshop support so you can share your creations download others and play with them or even change the way the game plays like getting a tool that lets you change the weight of an object a tool that makes props larger or smaller a gun that shoots nyan cats and nuclear bombs you can strap to awesome looking cars that have thrusters stuck to its rear and have a big ramp in front of it hoping to make a big bang so to speak if youre the type of person who likes building things this is for you if youre the type of person who likes killing people this is for you if youre the type of person who likes running into a war zone with balloons stuck to your ears then this is for you this game is incredible and fits almost everyones needs horror sandbox building strategy comedy and more if i were to follow my normal rules for reviewing games and rating them out of 10 id be lowering the rating millions of times over to make it low enough to fit it is extremely fun and the rating 1010 is an understatement
recommended
do you like to create do you like to destroy do you like stuff well then garrys mod is for you you can build just about any thing if you can imagine it you can build it tons of maps for all different gamesmodes you can even get some addons some of the addons could be newcustom weapons newcustom maps newcustom snpcs newcustom ragdolls morebetter tools to help you build and much much more

this is the most over 9000 game i have played since i was born ps children under 12 are in every server
recommended
one of the best sandbox games out there if you own alot of valve games and are into building crazy contraptions or just messing arround with npcs then this game is for you
recommended
its a really nice and large game you have much gamemodes and much fun worth the 250 euro in sales
recommended
in my opinion this is a great game and is great to socailise cheers yall
recommended
very fun game i hesitate to call garrys mod a game as its more of a virtual toy with no limits you can build neat contraptions role play or play various game modes worth every last penny only gripe is that for certain game modes other source engine games are required such as counter strike source for most roleplay servers hours of fun are to be had from dicking around in the half life 2 campaign fighting your friends in deathmatch building cars catapults and many other constructs in sandbox or anything inbetween garrys mod can do that
recommended
wooo seen this on youtube so many times glad i bought it this was inspired from vanossgamings hes the reason why im playing this
recommended
the most customizable game that i have seen it has everything and you can add more from half life 2 vechicles to this is sparta the biggest sandbox game so far with hundreds of gamemodes and thousands of addons that you can put five more hours of gameplay into per addon you will never be bored by this stunning combination of buildityourself singleplayer and fantastic fanmade multiplayer you will find yourself inserting months into this game and you will be hooked on it for years as new updates come out to make it even better in all honesty if you would love to put years of your time into a game this would be the one for you
recommended
great game fun to play when bored
recommended
its a good game

so i was demonstrating this game to my girlfriend when i decided to set a patrick star ragdoll on fire at first we laughed at the sight of a large pink starfish being roasted alive then we threw it off into the distance i carried on demonstrating the other various wonders of garrys mod and forgot about poor patrick star until ten minutes later when he suddenly cartwheeled across the screen and we both fell on the floor laughing hysterically for 5 minutes 42069 would set patrick on fire again

garrys mod  the game of all games i love this game i mean theres so much to do in fact nothing is impossible in garrys mod you need other source games for it to work properly though but then again who doesnt own a source game

recommended
i would recommend this game because it really brings creativity to mind and a lot of fun if you want to create something on your own you can do that private server easy need more friends easy join servers this games brings loads to the plate but one down side is that if you want most of the textures you need counter strike source which will expand the limit of your playing ablility

garrys mod is one of the best sandboxcommunity driven games on pc and possible in gaming if you are going to buy this you should buy css with it since many game modes use those textures in it sandbox mode is nice you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes i would recommend ttt as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in gmod gamemodesactaully it is the engine but eh there are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garrys mod and you will get you 10525 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers a great game with a good community if you know where to look

very good and funny game d and i very recommend it  and when playing with friends is it better d
recommended
okay so my last review was short so heres a longer more detailed version when it comes to sandboxes nothing beats garrys mod content garrys mod has a huge variety of content even without the workshop items the amount of stuff you can make depends on how much you have youre armed with the usual set of halflife 2 weaponsalong with a few legit gmod stuff the physgun the camera and a tool gun it already comes with one of the halflife 2 episodes and thats a bonus not happy with the usual source ragdolls you can get some nonsource ragdolls via the workshop cause theres even more stuff at the workshop sonic minecraft and mario stuff you can also change your player model using the context menu gameplay as i said before youre equipped with hl2 weapons exceptions are physgun camera and toolgun you can do anything you want whether its catapulting a ragdoll from left 4 dead 2 or facing a wave of combine soldiers from halflife 2 you can also spawn props and such and make a neat movie just be aware of what youre doing your imagination is the limit concerns & problems hold on a sec dont buy it yet as there is some problems with thisthis may be an excellent game but there is some concerns one being that there is way too many dupes i mean look up terraria in the workshop and as you can see there is alot of demon eyes eye of cthulhus and twins and  and nothing of a real addon cant they do us a favor create a minecraftish sprite of terraria items at the very least but if youre making a movie then this problem is easily solvable with a little sony vegas another concern is that not everything you might like is on the workshop ie i looked up roblox on the workshop and like terraria pure dupes the only real addon is a somewhat glitchy npc and when i type in something thatll get it to walk right it really slows my pc down another example would be that the super monkey ball ragdolls do not support the bone merger tool theyre a little small i that i might understand but it would be nice if they too could be in the hatwearing buisness the most serious thing you might wanna know too is that this game relies heavily on source games you wont have louis having his pills on gmod without left 4 dead 2 nor have gordon freeman without one of the halflife 2 games a screenshot example of what happens when you dont have counter strike source can be seen here httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid268005543 so before getting the game make sure you have the nessecary amount of games that use the source engine here is the priority of what games you might need in my point of view 1 as many halflife games as possible 2 counter strike probably any but peferrably source 3 left 4 dead 2 4 portal 5 team fortress 2 and etc the reason i put tf2 on 5 is because that its free so there is little need to have that asap but then again if youre planning to use tf2 ragdolls most of the time then that makes sense just remember that this my opinion so your priorities may vary final thoughts garrys mod offers alot of content for you to play around with but if you dont have many source games then it could be a problem but if you dont plan on using so many things then again if youre a guy looking to mess around with stuff or feeling creative then this is your opportunity the cost is well worth it especially since that im writing this during the steam summer sale 2014 but really the amount you should shell out varies on how many source games you have how often are you gonna play with it and how good is your imagination and creativity for example if you only have tf2 but dont plan on playing gmod often due to your lack of imagination and creativity then dont buy it without a really cheap price but if you have css hl2 and l4d2 and really wanna see what you can do and do plan on playing it for a huge time pattern then yes it is worth full price so the verdict is in garrys mod not sucks  810 happy ragdolls here
recommended
my sreen is soo short its not wider like it used to be help
recommended
best game ever amazing for creative minds to make something new 3
recommended
best game ever 1010 i had so much fun but if u wanna play private with someone i recommend hamchi
recommended
this game is an excellent animation tool if you have the right addons the community has plenty of gamemodes to offer and you can make tons of stuff highly recommended
recommended
all you do in this game is use a physics gun that allows you to move entities with a laser beam it is unrealistic because of this the game is futuristic but all of the game modes are based in the past like 1942rp if they do not have physics guns now then why would they be there in the past hitler was a smart man but cmon lets be real here hitler would have not killed himself if he knew about a physics gun he would probably have just grabbed some space nukes from the gbomb addon and then smashed it into the ground onto uk and russia then he would have just said lol ur bad kid git guud and then crysterbate due to his victory in the end i would give this game a solid 210 because i am on the road2silver2
recommended
became morgan freeman pulled out portal gun placed 2 portals and did the infinite loop pulled out nyan cat gun shot a creeper threw a train into a lake shot nyan cats at the train train blew up 1010 only possible in garrys mod

recommended
highly recommended so much to do in this game d only issue i have with it is loading times but otherwise i love it also you need to have some other valve games installed & downloaded such as counterstrike source so you dont end up with missing textures in gmod
recommended
recommended to have atleast 20 gb for this game cause its eating memory like a ing monster
recommended
you cant really say anything about this game because the game is the top of all games

recommended
the game where you get shot in the head by a melon with a nuclear warhead launcher then  by batman 5010 would buy again
recommended
this game does not have a goal unless you want it to it really doesnt matter what you do unless you have run out of creativity completly  garrys mod allows you to build shoot drive and simulate essentially anything you want community addons make infinite variabilities and there are several servers with different modes highly recommended
recommended
the diversity of game modes in garrys mod is so large that i will die before i get to play each one
recommended
i can easily say this is the best game ive ever played you can do anything 1010 you can easily rack up 1000 hours on this game

best game ever garrys mod is amazing garry is a genius garrys mod is literally the first game that i never even a little bit regretted buying this game is amazing if you like minecraft youll get into garrys mod and be like what do you even do and then youll build a vehicle out of bathtub and then make a turret and then get a bunch of mods and then roleplay and then get 500 hours on the game like me you can trust me on this garrys mod expertise i think thats how you spell it anyways best $1000 ive ever spent i actually got it at a sale for $500 roleplaying in this game is amazing get some silly playermodels from the workshop and then be like im spiderman and then youll want to restart the server because you want a spiderman gun mod best sandbox game in the world garrys mod makes me notice how cool source engine is especially ragdolls once you get the game as i said it is a must get youll start being like i got an idea lets get frozen elsa and anna ragdolls from the workshop theres a million frozen mods so this is the easiest example and then fight with them and make epic scenes like elsa dramatically jumping from an explosion or make annas head big and then turn into a spaceship a lot of sandbox games are like read this in a stupid voice oh in minecraft the possibilities are endless my reaction really in an e 10 game all you can do in minecraft is see pictures and play adventure maps that have epic builds and then get all inspired and then youll be like im going to make the best minecraft mansion ever and then you build crap and then you cry but in garrys mod garrys mod garrys mod garrys mod you can freakin shoot people roleplay make machinimas you can in minecraft too but theyre crap unless you animate it you can even as i said before make a vehicle out of a bathtub true story i did it once garrys mod is amazing minecraft is crap oh i just got an idea the new name is minecrap yeah thats clever and what the hell minecraft is a freaking like $3500 i can name like more than 50 games kind of over exadurating more of like 20 that are better than minecrap and the first is garrys mod i bet theres someone reading this being like minecrafts cool well i ask you this minecrap fan have you ever built anything in minecrap that isnt comeplete rubbish sorry this is a garrys mod review not a minecrap one well but there you have it like 2 reasons i think why i hate minecrap and one is a big reason and if you dont know that by now your probably a minecrap fan because you skipped the part about minecrap

all i can say is buy the game actually thats not all i can say that would be too much to list here but i can assure you that at least 85% of the things i could say are positive maybe 87% 90% maybe i wont go higher than that though but i digress one negative thing is theres too many glitches although most are caused by the community which is generally great though definitely worth the money but it might still be best to wait until it goes on sale it goes on sale so frequently that that shouldnt take too long but i digress again i think im gonna make i digress my motto dammit i digress again  just put it on your wishlist already
recommended
i like going on darkrp servers and propkilling for no good reason and going on random servers and being called a squeaker and getting kicked and going on the cbz server with my freinds 1110 would do it all again

i have almost 500 hours of gametime when im wrighting this review at first i had the css missing texturesdownload css but after that the fun began i have been playing deathrun for over 200 hours i would pay 10$ for even that gamemode only and tons of other game  it just buy this game its 10 f bucks
recommended
got forced by my friend to download 20 gbs of mods 6910 would download 20 gigs again
recommended
very entertaining it is really fun on its own if you get bored you can always check the workshop to see if there are any addons that will interest you the game can be serious and used for roleplays and also just for messing around and blowing things up overall i think the game has no flaws and has brought fun to nearly 200 hours of my life

funawesomegreat three of millions of great words to use to describe this game

recommended

recommended
ive played this for a while and this is one of those sandbox games that you can just build whatever and make it destroy everything if you dont want to build random stuff you could play trouble in terrorist town or prop hunt or watch youtube in a cinema server or play sledbuild or never ends
recommended
where should i start off well the bad things about garrys mod are the dreaded pink and black missing textures to fix this either buy the counter strike go game or get the textures online and copypaste files thats pretty much all i can say for the cons of gmod there are so many good things about garrys mod i cant explain them all in one review so here are some of them there are many gamemodes to play such as sandbox [build whatever you want or kill people] zombie rp [roleplay with zombies] dark rp [roleplaying for your satisfaction] prop hunt [as a prop hide somewhere where you wont be seen as a hunter hunt down the hidden props but watch your health] and so much more if you dont like the normal half life 2 guns or style of it just go check out the wonderful addons for gmod there is so many addons such as tdm cars [realistic cars] the slow motion mod [when activated makes everything go in slooooooww moooottiiiiooooon] world war 2 soldiers [wwii soldiers textures npcs and skins] and so much more so there is only one question is it worth my money and the answer is yes definetely get it
recommended
its a nice game can play with your friends have other character from game cartoon ragdoll
recommended
awesome building game nice graphics and verry cool that you can put other weapons npcs maps and other stuff in youre game
recommended
this game is brilliant you can move around which is a plus you can shoot things with other things which is like woah you can even like move things with a thing it blew my mind it was crazy 13106
recommended
where do i even start on this masterpiece i know the fact there is so much to do and so much fun to be had the charm about garrys mod is that you can really do almost anything that comes up on the workshop to subscribe to like a flying bathtub with machine guns the other thing i like about garrys mod is that there are so many servers of different kinds to have fun on with friends like trouble in terroist town ttt or deathrun or one of my favouites gmod tower on gmod tower you can play minigames get money from that to buy playermodels or hats and even pets to fly around with you speaking about flying around did i mention you can use a jetpack to get to places faster and if you want to take a break from minigames how about you go to your suite you go and check in and buy stuff to decorate it to your hearts desire or whatever the market has also you can donate to the lovely people who made it happen i am one myself so my overall rating of garrys mod is a 910 even better with friends i 100% recommend this game i hope you get it too and have fun
recommended

i would recomend this game to anyone who cares and people who enjoy faceposing
recommended
wasted so much time on this i dont regret it
recommended
fun and creative game with it being on sale so often there is no reason not to have it
recommended
this is a fantastic sandbox game with several of its amazing features from ragdoll posing to making a combine survival however the only flaw i genuinely see is that when i have several addons they seem to conflict with my source game material with a few glitches here and there its entirely plausible its just my game however this game will still provide a large amount of enjoyment
recommended
review garrys mod is a physics sandbox unlike regular games there arent any predefined aims or goals the games makers give you the tools and leave you to play you spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions you can basically turn garrys mod into another game one example is when i joined a intense call of duty server the ttt trouble in terrorist town servers are amazingly addictive my most favorite part of garrys mod i really like how you can basically do anything in garrys mod i really like playing on ttt trouble in terrorist town because they are really fun what i dont like about garrys mod there isnt really anything i hate about this game one thing they could improve are the graphics rating 95 amazing
recommended
game is awesome for animations and fun multiplayer i enjoyed this game and i do recommend this game

this is the best game that you ever encounter and you will be forced to soak hours and hours into it becuse its so much to do and alot of things to try
recommended
ive played 426 hours of this and i dont even remember a seconds 1711 dont buy
recommended
well time to try out this new review system garrys mod is pretty much the ultimate sandbox game it is supported by the majority of the steam community which people who have been here a while will know is the best community and has hundreds of hours worth of gameplay added by players every day the array of gametypes also made by the community can give you gameplay ranging from watching youtube with your friends to a multiplayer version of popular unity game slender though as the title of the game suggests this started off as a mod for the source engine and though it no longer requires all the original halflife 2 content many gametypes will use content from source games team fortress 2 counterstrike source and halflife 2 episodes 1 and 2 though the fact that you may need to buy more than one title to fully enjoy this one may shy you away from playing you must keep in mind that these are valve games and so will most likely deliver many hours of quality gameplay especially counterstrike the diversity of the gameplay from construction to recreation to destruction provides at least one thing everyone will enjoy and if you see a gap something you find the game missing learn lua and get to the steam workshop
recommended
best game in the world
recommended
no way to explain it it is just it
recommended
now you can live your dark fantasies of playing god with the bone modifier warningwe are not responsible for your creation going rogue
recommended
awesome i realy recomend this game to anyone who likes either minecraft or fps this is a game for everyone
recommended
the ultimate sandbox nuff said
recommended
the game basically no limitations so that we can open the playand many of the mod also brought more joyand your little friends to play a game
recommended
really fun game
recommended
wanna die by toilets  buy this game 10000010
recommended
good game i like the fact that there are no definate goals to reach which gives the game a rather rugged and free feel to it along with this the fact that the game can be modded to great extent makes it a great choice
recommended
bought it just for ttt no ragrets no egrets either
recommended
as someone who has played a ton of this game i thought id write a simple review on it first things first if you have fun friends this game will never ever get boring that being said play this with friends there is an endless amount of content on the workshop which makes this game entertaining not even counting the immense amount of multiplayer game modes even without friends multiplayer can be somewhat entertaining next id like to point out that if you get this game you are going to definitely need counter strike source the next priorities would be half life episode 1 and episode 2 thought those 2 are not required the last thing id like to touch is addons they can be fun but they can ruin your experience if you have a terrible computer and get 300 addons you will have low hard drive space and probably 10minutes loading your game every time that being said dont just download everything you want think will you actually use it a lot all in all you will not get bored of garrys mod there is simply to much to do
recommended
balls to the walls ing years of fun
recommended
this game is amazing for everyone the is due to the fact that you can get almost any gamemode you want on gmod the amount of devs out there makes this game amazing as well new workshop content everyday and new gamemodes everyday the community is just generally amazing on this game the game has many bugs but these bugs affect some people not all they are normally visual bugs or crashes these can usually be sorted though and if there is a game changinglimiting bug facepunch fix it quick enough for you to get playing or you can probably find one of the many possible solutions online the graphics on this game are decent and for obvious reasons halflife fans will love them they are modern graphics but not as uptodate as a game like gta v but this is to be expected from a now older game in conclusion this game is decent for the price the major downfall is the probability of a bug limiting your experience but this is not very likely i would recommend getting this game if you are looking for halflife online with other ways of playing
recommended
i guess its a good game i spent a few hours playing it
recommended
so yeah this game is amazing for just about anything you want to do with a huge community although alot of the population are people lacking a few chromosomes you find some realy nice and cool people to play with and i personally love building in this game as of this review i have put 4k hrs into it and there are people who have put in much more than that most of these people have just the right amount of chromosomes
recommended
really really good game i seriously recommend it but be forewarned it requires a lot of learning
recommended
this game goes on sale for $250 every month and a half or so just buy it do yourself a favor
recommended
80% of my hours is loading screens 1010
recommended
very good game a game that will never get old since theres always new shit to download and fuck around with easiest to grief though all people have to do to piss you off is throw your stuff around delete your stuff etc still 1010 game takes about 2 years to launch tho
recommended
you will not regret your decision of the purchase 1010 3
recommended
very fun game to play with friends and even random strangers

recommended
what happens when you mix tons of games in one and give it drugs yeap garrys mod
recommended
i like it so much but ive got a problemwith my noobyness i dont know how to save a game 
recommended
garrys mod is one of my personal favorite sandboxs and so far i love it you can make films play game modes for example prop hunt and death run mess around with any models and best of all screenshots only down side is that you need content like team fortress 2 or left 4 dead 2 or portal or half life 2 and counter strike source or every valve game so if you have $1000 dont spend it on jimmy johns spend it on this game instead and pay for lunch later or just sell your copy of teenage mutant ninja turtles out of the shadows lolz overall score 1010 exelent
recommended
i love this game i honestly have no life look at how many hours i have of itit has not even been a year
recommended
holy  ive been playing gmod since the god damn beginning of time a piece of software that isnt even defined as just a game its an infinite amount of experiences that change every time i start it up with a stupid amount of content flowing into it all the time i doubt you will ever have the time to even get through all of it 1010  would make gman dance again
recommended
i can go to hyrule castle and kill stormtroopers by flying the tardis into them goty

recommended
havent played much so i dont really have much to say about the game looks promising
recommended
garrys mode is iy fun and funny game
recommended

recommended
garrys mod is that kind of game that can make you laugh out loud at the wonderfully insane things people have made and what you yourself can create many gamemodes to choose from albeit most requiring halflife and counterstrike for models and things to work right and lots of fun to be had i highly recommend it
recommended
this game really fun  you guys should try it >_<

this has to be the greatest game of all time i love this game there are so many things to do just by yourself messing around or playing online on a server wether it be prop hunt trouble in terrorist town murder or any of the extensive gamemodes online play has to offer endless hours tick by and all you are doing is having fun wether it be painting some guy pink or attaching boosters to a car and send it flying into the sky even if you get bored of gmod and decide to download tf2 you can mess around with all of the stuff in that video game right in gmod though it kinda sucks you have to buy and mount counter strike source to see the textures of most of the online maps
recommended
with over an astonishing 2500 hours on this game i have to say i simply have to reccomend this and i cant see why anyone would not reccomend this ive seen this game grow up from garrys mod 9 to garrys mod 13 that is like about 7 or 8 years now ive had the game from alpha to beta to the finished yet slightly flawed product ok all that may not be true however you will love this game get it noawww noawwwwwwwwwwwww

this game cannot be reviewed yet it can as i am doing so this game is the best this game is the worst it is the simplest of games it is the most confusing of games it is the most fun game it is the most boring game what im trying to say is that you decide whether or not you like this game its all a matter of personal opinion whats that you say you want to know what i think of it personally well i find it a fun game in which you can express youself through multiple ways whether its backstabbing as a t in ttt or starting a rebellion in jailbreak important buy this game with counter strike source because you need textures from counter strike source to play ttt and jailbreak and pretty much every other fun game
recommended
one does not simply describe garrys mod
recommended
play it the best game in ra world you play content from other games and make stuff
recommended
i dont know what to say about this game so here is a recipe for pancakes ingredients 4tbsp plain flour about 100g 1 large free range egg  pint semiskimmed milk  water about 300ml   milk  water pinch of salt butter for frying how to make pancakes sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix in a jug add 13 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 12 a pint 200ml milk 100ml water  this makes a lovely light batter add the milk and the water mix bit by bit beating constantly to avoid lumps tipif you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth pop a large frying pan over a medium heat add a large knob of butter roughly 50g and melt pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering  cook for about 1 min each side its ready when its easy to flip over serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings we love cheese and marmite for an extra british twist delicious

recommended
explaining garrys mod is not so easy but i try it it was originally a mod for half life 2 where you can choose maps play on it and your only tool was the the tool gun to create ropes so basically you can do everything you want sandbox deathmatch zombie survival minigames surf or whatever just look for the right server or download the addons and start your own server your friends also have to download the same addons you can build crazy stuff try funny things and can learn allot about how the source engine works basically  sourceengine in a nutshell
recommended
do i really need to say anything
recommended
garrys mod is a truly incredible game ive spent hours just messing around in sandbox playing trouble in terrorist town prop hunt murder and more its really astounding what i can do in this game and what i can furthermore do due to the amazing community in the steam workshop

i really love this game its pretty much a sandbox you can do anything you please theres pvp pve mixtures of both puzzle type gamemodes roleplaying game modes and overall many fun things to do alot of replay value the problem with the game however is the amount of admin abuse no matter what mode you goto there will be some dipsht throwing you around with their magical admin gun you can follow all their rules rules that they themselves hypocritically break some of the time these admins are a relief from the childish griefers most the time the admins make problems out of nothing i notice that most abuse from admins comes from darkrp and other rp modes what can you do about the admins ban them lol kick them nope nothing you can do against them all you can do is move onto another server i notice theres some cool admins who try to teach you the rules but theres always that one d0uchebag who has to perma ban you for doing something they dont like even if its not against the rules and of course all my favorites server with good fair admins die out the community is full of morons imbeciles squekers and those scrubs who have to rdm on every server but other than the community this game is a gem very cheap too if you catch it on sale it will be as low as $250 the one thing to note however is that you need a hf2 game i use nmrih but i believe tf2 works too anyways tf2 is probably better because some servers uses modelstextures from it and many servers require css i dont own css but i found a texture pack from youtube and that makes 0 errors visible i got it from here if youre interested httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9ur32zo4im in a nutshell  community 310 story  na gameplay  1010 replay value  910 fun  810 overall  910

this is a really fun game and should be worth more money there are so meny really fun game modes to have hours of fun my personal opinion of the best game mode is dark rp because of how much things you can do in it like buy a car have a job buy a house buy money printers buy drugs lol jk ok i hope i made you buy this awsome game pece out
recommended
joined cinema server got kicked out right away joined second time got kicked again but different server tried third time got kicked joined sandbox wasnt kicked so i can rate it 1110 why not 12 because cinema is bad they kick u
recommended
quirky fun with your friends and a great sandbox worth the money even if it isnt on sale
recommended
really fun game especially multiplayer prop hunt
recommended
its ok if you can find good servers with good management which i kind of did i think
recommended
this is the sexiest game you will ever play in your life
recommended
this game oh this game you will have a giant imagination when you play this there is so many game modes but most require a download and textures from source games but they will be worth it to see how awesome and creative this game is

recommended
amazing sandbox game and some multiplayer servers are really fun i recomend it
recommended
the game where you get shot in the head by a melon with a nuclear warhead launcher then  by batman 5010 would buy again
recommended
this game does not have a goal unless you want it to it really doesnt matter what you do unless you have run out of creativity completly  garrys mod allows you to build shoot drive and simulate essentially anything you want community addons make infinite variabilities and there are several servers with different modes highly recommended
recommended
recommended to have atleast 20 gb for this game cause its eating memory like a ing monster
recommended
you cant really say anything about this game because the game is the top of all games
recommended

my gmod story it started out when i joined a small freebuild server no new things just old nice addonsnothing special i built myself a small cottage which looked more like a hobos den i went to my neighbors house he was making a fancy old graveyard with a small pumpkin guy behind it i asked hey what are you making today he responded with a short grunt over the mic i asked again please do tell another grunt i soon gave up i noticed a small gaurd holding a rifle i asked my neighbor who is that another grunt i was tired of it so i went back to my house to improve chapter 2 wow i wonder how i did it i had a fullnicecottage a admin walked up and asked where ya get them skills mate i responded with wasnt hard i just studied his graveyard the admin walked over to the graveyard well well nice job mind ya shinin light on yur builds this time he responded no sir he showed him how to build a fancy house i then settled into my cottage and fell asleep chapter 3 i woke up the next game the fog was turned up so i checked my settings no fog though i went to the admin to ask what is with this fog he simply said i dont know we found a small crowd near a kiosk a melon kiosk i looked around my neighbor was their with the gaurd buying some melons crraaacck a 9mm goes off i ran to my house oh dear i heard more and then a loud slump as the kiosk fell a admin started banging begging to be let in i heard more crossbows and 9mms go off it was all we could get our hands on i grabbed my 9mm and slowly opened the door the adminand a player rushed in blockading the door and windows he yelled upstairs guys uistars or theu ger us his message was full of grammar mistakesbecause of his worry we blockaded the steps creeeaak a door opens a loud smash and then a groan a players head shoots upstairs oh no says the admin he continues to barricade the stairwell while me and the player are in my rather cramped attic craaash my lamp falls i hear the admin yelp in pain then a large amount of banging it stops and i hear a bloodcurdling scream the head shoots up into the attic i hear the creature break a windowthen into the attic me and the player here run another bang as i hide behind furniture the player hides behind a broken wood fence i see a apelike shape with a bloody mouth and a stained fur coat i then see the player across from me freeze and fall to the ground he is paralyzedand i cant help him the monster jumps downboy oh boy i got a good view on em he graps the player rips off his head and pulls out his spine the creature then proceeds to knaw on the spinethen throws the head off into the fog i then also see him creep up behind another player moving inside who is armed with a 9mm and a lantern i run out the windowand also catch a glimpse of his mighty pounce i hear another scream as he rips out his spine to chew on then i run to the broken melon stand only to see the last of the players leaving the server threw the underground subwaya ingame addon that allows travel threw servers i missed it i see the last station close its just me now chapter 4 finale  i then realise i could have left but when i try toi cant the creature is near a sudden thump as a evac server pops up[fastdl]evaccrashcourse[evacforcrashes] i quickly hop onto never join that server again

what is gmod gmod is a game where anything is possibleyou can build whatever you please you can either have a server where players can do what they feel free to or if your into rp darkrp is a great thing you make the rules and jobs might be hard but this game lets anything happen
recommended
this game is great not only is it a sand box that had infinitly many possibalities it also had many gamemodes that are just as fun or even more enjoyable some of these include troubble in terrorist town prop hunt gmod murder the list goes on
recommended
its fun
recommended
got mugged by a 5 year old child then told to watch gay russian porn on garrys mod cinema then screamed at by a twelve year old on deathrun and bhop still havent played the game that much 985 approved by 12 year olds
recommended
you can get different player characters different weapons and trouble in terrorist town
recommended
i have always liked simulation games but garrys mod has always succeeded the limit of fun and enjoyment because the only limit is your imagination and you can do whatever you want whenever you want and as much as you want for me its one of my favourite games to mess around and have fun with my friends or make friends probably in different servers but most of all i gmod garrys mod always makes it fun for me and aswell my friends as you socially increase your limit of imagination by sharing which makes gmod one of the unique games of enjoyment with social sharing  i recommend this game for anyone who would like simulation games or just to mess around 
recommended
its k 3
recommended
still better than cod
recommended
its nice i give rep nice game but one problem is game crash pls do not game crash its than 10000 stars from me  its than okay nice game guys download it
recommended
very nice game
recommended
gmod is a very fun game with friends prop hunt trouble in terrorist town murder and a bunch of other gamemodes for you and your friends to play together or play on servers with random people and play with them download some maps for additional experiences to the game granted that you need other valve games on some maps and textures to fully experience this game i fully recommended getting this game tons of fun to play you wont regret getting this game
recommended
garrys mod is just such an amazing game its like minecraft except you can build contraptions there arent any aims or goals the game just gives you the tools and leaves you to play there are also weapons and you can also build stuff out of materials i recomend getting this game if you havent already and i will be playing this game for a long time to come
recommended
the game is very cool and everyone should try it and play it worth
recommended
this was my first time playing joined a roleplaying server i was a hobo gun dealer wouldnt give hobos guns i dropped a fridge on himagainst server rules the revolution agaisnt the goverment began i gathered up almost three quarters of the server to join the fight the good fight i printed illicit money against server rules for people to buy pistols and assault rifles with against server rules we made a banner some of us sworeagainst server rules we stormed up to the police station demanding all sorts of stuff gay rights free money roofs over our heads this was met with silence and we met their silence with gunfireagainst server rules scores of police officers were dead but we all had been sent to prison i pleaded to my captors begging them for rights for hobos about 34 of the server was in prison we hatched a plan a plan to kill the governor against server rules we killed him against server rules the server restarts i become the governor perhaps the power got to my head or the events i had witnessed were too much to bear i punched a guy against server rules the admin finds me and threatens to ban me i call his rules stupid i am banned so the moral of the story is when you roleplay on a garrys mod server feel free to start a revolt but dont punch a guy
recommended
great game have sunk may hours into and plan to continue to do so
recommended
its a fun sandbox game thats not that expensive i say a thumbs up
recommended
only game where you have about 10gb of addons in your addon folder
recommended
this game is the sandbox game to own it has an overwhelming number of gamemodes addons mods and just about anything you can think of you want to play a tdm gamemode fine thats here you want to build a walking mech with random people go for it you want to parkour around a goodsized city with a bunch of tag gamemodes yup got that too for $10 i cant really think of a reason not to buy it or if the price is too steep for you it frequently goes on sale for $249 which hopefully you can dish out by selling trading cards or scrap on tf2 1010 would <everything> again

recommended
funny game with funny people d
recommended
if youre a newbie steam user you probably want to take in consideration to buy something like counterstrikesource to get the most out of this game its like if you required other java games in order to play minecraft without errors insanely fun game without a doubt if you want to have the most fun though play with friends please
recommended
if you dont get this game then you will never live
recommended
really really good game i seriously recommend it but be forewarned it requires a lot of learning
recommended
80% of my hours is loading screens 1010
recommended
havent played much so i dont really have much to say about the game looks promising
recommended
garrys mod is that kind of game that can make you laugh out loud at the wonderfully insane things people have made and what you yourself can create many gamemodes to choose from albeit most requiring halflife and counterstrike for models and things to work right and lots of fun to be had i highly recommend it
recommended
you will not regret your decision of the purchase 1010 3
recommended
bought it just for ttt no ragrets no egrets either
recommended
as someone who has played a ton of this game i thought id write a simple review on it first things first if you have fun friends this game will never ever get boring that being said play this with friends there is an endless amount of content on the workshop which makes this game entertaining not even counting the immense amount of multiplayer game modes even without friends multiplayer can be somewhat entertaining next id like to point out that if you get this game you are going to definitely need counter strike source the next priorities would be half life episode 1 and episode 2 thought those 2 are not required the last thing id like to touch is addons they can be fun but they can ruin your experience if you have a terrible computer and get 300 addons you will have low hard drive space and probably 10minutes loading your game every time that being said dont just download everything you want think will you actually use it a lot all in all you will not get bored of garrys mod there is simply to much to do
recommended
balls to the walls ing years of fun
recommended
this game is amazing for everyone the is due to the fact that you can get almost any gamemode you want on gmod the amount of devs out there makes this game amazing as well new workshop content everyday and new gamemodes everyday the community is just generally amazing on this game the game has many bugs but these bugs affect some people not all they are normally visual bugs or crashes these can usually be sorted though and if there is a game changinglimiting bug facepunch fix it quick enough for you to get playing or you can probably find one of the many possible solutions online the graphics on this game are decent and for obvious reasons halflife fans will love them they are modern graphics but not as uptodate as a game like gta v but this is to be expected from a now older game in conclusion this game is decent for the price the major downfall is the probability of a bug limiting your experience but this is not very likely i would recommend getting this game if you are looking for halflife online with other ways of playing
recommended
prop hunt  hns  murder and ttt are fun to play with friends and solo d
recommended
its the most funny game and you can do almost everything in this game so i recomand this game
recommended
best physics game of all time 
recommended
i havent played this very much but it seems pretty ok so far
recommended
step into the random sandbox game called garrys mod i had low expectations for this game but certain gamemodes turned out to be tons of fun hide and seek playing objects find out who among your friends is a traitor or go out and be a police officer or medic during a rollplaying game the possiblities in this game realy are limitless 810
recommended
it is one of the best sandbox games ive ever seencompareing to minecraft i would pay twice as muhc for this
recommended
why play this game because you can ride a flying bath and fap at the same time 1010 would use anime player model again
recommended
this game is everything
recommended
owned 7 servers wish i had more time to play
recommended
dis reeely great game where you can do all kinds a stuff and build things and kill npcs and hang babies from trees without actually doing it try it out is fun as heck the community of gmod has always done a lot a bunch of tf2 addons start as parts for scenemaking in gmod and sfm for example this is really a great game i would definitely reccommend it to anyone with a creative spirit and a passion for building pvp or the various other gamemodes out there or even scenemaking and photography i really love this game if you check my profile youll see i have about 2500 hours and counting invested here in gmod its a great mod and doesnt require much space you should get it its awesome thanks so much garry you can take a while on fixes here and there but thats definitely outweighed by gmod as a thing top 3 favorite game of mine
recommended
yea it good
recommended
a very fun game with and without mods easily one of the better sandbox games out there theres a huge range of options for different people from building enthusiasts to machinima makers the experience gets better when mods are enabled which adds even more variety multiplayer is also great as you get to interact with fellow players and make friends the price of the game isnt bad either costing only $999 with prices as low as $249 during sales however there are some faults in the game mainly lua errors but theyre not too major the selection of maps in the vanilla game is very bland as well gripes aside i highly recommend garrys mod its worth every single cent
recommended
oh my ing god okay oh my ing god let me in drop the shit lowdown on this oh my ing  of a god this game oh my christing god this game is literally ing heroin you get absoinglutely addicted to this  like no ing other drug out there theres so much ing  you can do you can ing download mods that let you drive cars you can drive cars from hl2 you can shoot hl2 guns theres limitless possibilities holy   god damn i ing hold on okay  buy this if youre already addicted to heroin and cant make life any ier

recommended
i actually recommend this but this was the best days when there is no fnaf fanboys the game itself is awesome 1010 this is the first game that i actually liked to play on steam the best thing is you can create anything that you want the only limits is your imagination there is no goal in the game thats what i like about it you create the goal by yourself this game is like every game that existed got thrown in the blender and we get this masterpiece this game is actually pieceful if you dont kill everything like a fcking idiot there is so many gamemodes to choose from my personal favorite if rp it can get stupid with raids and mug drops but it is still my favorite this is the most fun game i ever played in my life if you want to find a game that you can do anything in i recommend this game
recommended
odd gaem but thats what makes it good

recommended
one of my favorite games still to this date met so many people in this game some good and some not so good its great fun if your bored or just looking to have some fun many game modes to choose from dark rp is one of my personal favorites alongside trouble in terriost town i personally think it is one of the best community driven games out there but make sure you buy css alongside garrys mod as a lot of the game modes use the textures from css
recommended
its k 3
recommended
i dont know how i even spent more than a minute on this god forsaken piece of  55

recommended
this is an overall good game but most things i screw with have missing textures due to things not downloading properly not sure if this is clientside serverside or gameside anyways garrys mod is definetely a game you would want to purchase firsthand if you are a new steam user since it is played by many people and is loads of fun you can download mods and mess with them or you can play on a server with multiple people while played one of the downloadable gamemodes available i like the idea that people in the steam community can finally put their creativity to the test and create something that would entertain thousands of people imagine the guy who created murder and how successful heshe feels that they made something worth mentioning to people they know
recommended

i have injoyed garrys mod but 1 thing i hate about it is the ahemerrors
recommended
a worth while game to get very fun and i recommend this game
recommended
garrys mod is a very famous game as well as humorous its not the best in graphics in todays games but in my opinion it doesnt matter this game is known for its glitchy multiplayer sandbox fun people can take this game and make other games out of it which makes garrys mod even more entertaining i think that garrys mod is one of the most funniest fun and creative multiplayer game ever although its not as fun to me when i play publicly instead of with friends privately
recommended
this is one of those games where if you like having fun this game is for you you can test a variety of weapons in maps which are all made by steam users and game makers and all of this you can do with your friends it is the ultimate game of freedom
recommended
garrys mod is a game that you can be very creative and also has a lot i mean a lot of mods on one website called garrys modorg you can also make your own multiplayer server a server i would recommend is deathlegends zombie survival server
recommended
garrys mod is a perfect example of a sandbox multiplayer with tons of gamemodes to choose from such as the famous trouble in terrorist town and prop hunt its a perfect game to play with your buddies you can buy garrys mod by itself but its a lot more fun and less glitchy with css it comes at an affordable price and i can spend hours upon hours playing garrys mod gamerscore24

recommended
garrys mod is a perfect relaxed game with lots of modes which makes the game awesome i like dark rp which is a role playing mode other modes include trouble in terrorist town murder and sandbox along with lots of others those are the modes i enjoy the most
recommended
i love playing this game it always gives me something to do and best of all i love messing around with mods i mean this game is good for everything to making really good screenshots to making a war between zombies and humans and you can play with your friends too and play on different multiplayer servers and when i said the best part is mods you can use lightsabers to nyan cat guns in the workshop and you can get different map mods and everything and practically without mods this game would not be the way it is today

this is a really addicting game once you get in to the game there is no returning

recommended
i like garrys mod as a game i can play with my friends sometimes and when none of my friends are there to play i can mess around with addons and wreck it by installing too many i think garrys mod is a great game for people from 12  30s because even though its just a game with literally no objective its that fun i myself as a 13 year old think its very funny and hilarious to mess around in but of course all games do get to a point where they just arent fun anymore just a warning for people who think this game is cool it will get boring in about 3 years tops keep playing this game every week once a week if you want to get fun out of it and make it last garrys mod is amazing overall its a game to keep and i hope garry newman can take a break from rust sometime and check back in on his genius mod that became an fantastic standalone game and the thing about wrecking the game with addons yeah um dont ever exceed 400 addons or you wont be very happy if that does happen go through all your addons in garrys mod and delete about 100 that should fix it ryan090400

hey there do you enjoy playing multi player with some very strange people want to lose some brain cells want to hear fat neckbears chat about atheism want to experience some of the worst life forms on steam then this game suits you play amazing games like 5 nights at freddys  a very badly done remake of said game but with socially awkward 15 year olds or chill out and listen to people become flustered over trouble in terrorist town better yet play on servers that are entirely playtowin thats right folks play to win one small donation of $20 will get you just about everything you need to wreak havoc on a server using overpowered weapons regular players on the server may seem like they dislike you but really they just envy you dont let them bully you off of your favorite darkrp server you paid good money to have overpowered weapons and jobs on that server so you let them dislike you and envy your money like the peasants they are whats that the server and community are gone after you donated money fret not my adventurous friend because there are millions of garrys mod server and communities that are basically the same thing

this is the longest review i have written but no other game deservers it garrys mod is probably the best game i have ever played it has so many possibilities and things to do and you could even spend hours in the single player sandbox due to the awesome modding community this game has not only does it have an epic mod community it also has a great multiplayer community aside from all the squeekers hackers and abusive mods there are just so many gamemodes and mods that you could spend hundreds to thousands of hours in it with thousands of mods and plenty new ones every day this game is hard to get bored of i have also made many friends on servers such as ttt murder and darkrp it is also very fun to play private servers with friends and doing your own thing all you need is hamachi which is free this game is only 10 dollars but also requires cs source so get the bundle you can do so many things in this such as roleplay a swat sniper become a watermelon have hovercar races and my favourite get tellitubbies to fight a trex just get the game if you dont have it already tldr greatest game i have played that you can spend countless hours in and wont get bored just get it

as a veteran of garrys mod on multiple other accounts i must say that this game is outstanding for its price content and the hours of entertainment you can get from it the neverending variety of gamemodes within garrys mod leaves you to never run out of ideas with many addons to offer from the workshop i like this game because it mostly relies on the users creativity imagination and constructive mind this game suits anyones needs whether you enjoy building fighting puzzles roleplaying adventures and many more the gamemodes within this game custom maps and more offer these genres of entertainment i advise everyone to buy it as there is no one that wouldnt be entertained by this game
recommended
good game with many different game modes spent too much of my time on this game and somehow i dont regret it i play the trouble in terrorist town game mode mainly but i also enjoy prophunt the communities on here are just amazing mostly and it is fun to meet new people on the games you enjoy this game is less serious and more fun so you can have fun and mess around with other people and have a laugh rather than just play a competitive game and act serious all the time i have played over 2000 hours on this game yet i still feel i can do so much more with this game and for its price you really cannot go wrong i would recommend this to anyone of any age

one of the best games on steam this is a gem even the most uncreative mind can comprehend whats that you want to strap rockets onto the back of a trex model and try and send him to the moon oh whats that you want to build a wooden maze with a maze generator then put enemies in it and watch from above as they run around trying to destroy each other then once your done you can burn it all down or push the undo and start over this is a unique experience that no other game can give you

best game ever made ill be happy if some companies employers play this game and forget their  buggy games sandbox ttt murder and other game modes in every genre you like but there are silly things like 11yearsold server admins those dont know anything about management they insult and then ban everyone who is better than them its bad and boring heres a suggestion if you want rating for this i would recommend 13 dont let the children be administrator d
recommended
look its garrys mod do i need to really give a reason why you should buy this well heres one my playtime that and the ability to make whatever youd like with some technical knowhow you can easily make a shotgun that spews cookies all over people while screaming have some nice crispy cookies things can get rather insane in garrys mod just with enough patience afterwards you and your friends are riding space bikes shooting nukes at each other in some ship at sea while running from a red matter good times

okso this is my first complete review of an game dont get fooled by my hours in the game because i want this game from the gmod 10 so here we go what is gmod are you asking gmod is the best sandbox game pretty graphichs even if there are some textures bugs and errors even missing textures a great comunity what a game would do without the comunity that gets more people into the game nothing well here is not the case because gmod got the best comuntiy on steam this comunity keeping up the fun rate till the next update with addons made with hard work multiplayer this game have multiplayer if you like to construct fine enter on one sandbox server you want to destroy sandbox with friends is the best oportunity to smash things you dont like to create or destruct no worries you can have fun murduring people in the murder you dont like that neither then go be a traitor in trouble in terrorist town be the slender in stop it slender or be santa in sledgebuild or even be in an elevator simulator with elevator the posibilities are countles so the fun hope my review helped you to understand what gmod is all about

half life 2 was one of my old favorites back in the day of the n64 but now that its gone portable and has been upgraded with minigames more characters and more its become my favorite platformer of all time its been perfect in every aspect of gaming and it therefore deserves a 10 story 810 gordon gets invited to the castle for cake by alyx in the intro scene and he brings along barry and dr kliener father grigori is there when they arrive and they walk inside after some time grigori notices they still havent come out he decides to go in and find out whats going on this means you start playing as grigori he finds out gordon barry and kliener have been imprisoned behind locked doors and you eventually free all of them after you free each one you can play as that person and take advantage of each of their special abilities to get all the power stars after that you must beat dr breen and restore peace to the land once again graphics 1010 the graphics have been upgraded since the days of the n64 the characters are less blocky now most notably dr breen he looks awesome now and the intro is too great to be expressed in words the file select screen has 5 things apparently floating on water 3 files options and return to mode select whenever you touch the screen the point you touched emits a ripple in the water if you drag your stylus or whatever across the screen ripples emit from every point touched i stare in amazement every time i do this especially considering this is on a portable control 910 the controls in this game are great you can do the whole mainstream game not including minigames with the buttons except for loading and saving your game the buttons are well laid out but the running is a little awkward you walk normally if you simply press a direction on the dpad but you have to hold a button down to run this isnt a big gripe until your thumb starts to get sore from the holding the button down ut thats the only complaint i have sound 910 no complaints here the sound are fitting the music is appropriate and the voices which are mostly grunts and yells and such are clear and loud some of the music is not particularly catchy but thats the only thing that kept sound from getting 1010 gameplay 1010 i would have given it higher if i could have if youve ever played the original half life 2 youd know how sweet it was now think of it with a crapload of minigames all of which are not only fun but challenging 30 more stars to collect bringing the total to 150 and the ability to play as 4 different characters each with special abilities that are put to use in the levels and the castle gaming perfection i think so replay value 1010 with 150 stars a bunch of minigames 4 playable characters and the addition of a wireless multiplayer mode youll be playing garrys mod for long after you beat it overall 1010 this game was a huge leap up from the original half life 2 which was already sweet to begin with if you have a ds buy this game now if you dont have a ds buy one if only just for this if you cant afford a ds andor this game well that just sucks for you play a friends if you have to then again you might get hooked so that may be a bad idea

garrys mod isnt just a game or a set of modding tools garrys mod is an experience whether your knowledgeable enough to make full use of the modding tools or you just want to join multiplayer and play some premade game modes garrys mod is definable worth your time be warned though that to a new comer single player and using the modding tools can be complicated but dont worry there are many custom game modes made by fans and modders alike hosted in multipayer so there is always something for everyone
recommended
garrys mod the good freedom to create anything you want houses cars boats planes helicopters or some other crazy contraption from scratch or from common objects like crates barrels household furniture etc lots of different gamemodes from sandbox to racing to city rp 100% moddable the bad some contraptions need fine tweaking physics can be a bit overactive summary for a game that will only run you 599 or about 12 us dollars in the majoritys case garrys mod is one of the most popular steam games and the best sandbox game ever to be created the game recently scored 14 million copies sold and trust me i wouldnt think any game thats so cheap moneywise would sell that many the main point of garrys mod is to build contraptions and make them work these can range from cars to boats to trains to helicopters and a countless amount of things you can do to build these you use props simple models that were taken from existing games speaking of existing games the other main idea is that you collect as many valve games as you can so that you can use its resources in the game to start you off you get quite a lot of stuff from half life 2 such as npcs weapons models from the game and ragdolls my personal favourite category is the hl2 vehicles section where you can spawn usually wrecked car bodies and try and bring them to life with the wheel tool and two thrusters on one side garrys mod also has its own range of premade models such as jet planes railways trains rollercoasters and even has its own mascot gman sometimes building can be easy other times it needs a little bit of perfecting for example to make sure a train doesnt go flying off a track you have to decrease the force of the thruster that makes it go forwards or backwards if youre making a helicopter you might have to resort to using hoverballs which can go ape if youre not careful you would think that building a car is as simple as placing four wheels on a box and making sure the wheels turn the right way when you press a key on your numpad wrong you have to add thrusters on both sides of the car if you want it to turn and not have too much force if you dont want it to drift but its fairly easy once you know how to do it besides sandbox there are also a plethora of other gamemodes one or two of them have you live in a city get a job eat food etc or it could be a simple deathmatch obviously i cant list every single gamemode that exists so lets skip to the next part of this review graphics the graphics are amazing the lighting is up to perfection and everything is just so detailed the water deserves a real praise it is absolutely beautiful the player models are also perfectly detailed and everything is just perfect in general well done garry well done online the game was completely made to be multiplayer but you can also go singleplayer if you want to the community obviously varies depending on what gamemode youre playing for example sandbox players can be helpful and can make pretty cool stuff darkrp players can be a little out of order otherwise theyre generally ok overall the online is aok audio the game has completely realistic audio all of the props have their own material so for example wooden crates obviously sound like wood when they collide with something or when they get hit glass props will shatter like glass metal clangs when it collides if you die you hear a heartmonitor sound that decreases to a long beep if you get killed by an explosive you hear a highpitched sound as if your hearing got damaged when youre underwater the sound is modified to fit exactly that even the voices of other players are changed npcs get voices too though all of the hl2 humans call you gordon since they think youre dr freeman i love how the zombies sound like especially the fast zombie and the manhacks the audio is again up to perfection controls the controls are really easy to handle you can walk run sprint crouch and jump you can also fly around using the v key this is called noclip and it makes you able to go through almost anything though strangely bullets can still hit you so watch out when you have a contraption going such as a helicopter or car you can control it like an rc toy with your numpad or you can hop in if you added a seat and can drive it the handling of your own contraption depends on what you added and how you modified it other than that everything is great repetition being a game that can be expanded by the many valve games out there it obviously takes every resource from any valve game you have in your steam library and allows you to use it to your taste if you have team fortress 2 you can pose a scout ragdoll in any way you want though some of garrys mod is original such as having its own models otherwise its a real resource user lasting value with all the gamemodes maps addons and various other stuff you can add to the game this game shall never end up being defined with the word old though sometimes you can end up not knowing what to build but thats a different story entirely its guaranteed that you can play this game forever summary garrys mod is the best sandbox ever created as i said earlier most of its features are tuned up to perfection and the game never gets old im still quite new to this game and already ive joined communities about certain servers on the game its definitely a great game in all its might recommending it if youre a pc gamer you have to at least try this game especially if youre on steam its one of the most popular steam games and i would completely recommend it to every gamer i meet i love this game so much i cant see who wouldnt

garrys mod is fun game to play with friends online you can play in local network area or join other server in multiplayer the game got alot of different modes sandbox prop hunt trouble in terrorist town etc sandbox is a mode you can release your imagination and create it and you can spawn npcs to practice kill prop hunt is a mode you hunt props the people will hide as props and you guys have to find them and kill them trouble in terrorist town is a mode of terrorists in 1 place you either be innocent and kill the traitor or be the traitor and kill all of the innocents this game is really cheap and fun to play with friends review from iamfabulous

garrys mod is fun in many ways whether you want to have fun with friends or just play solo many gamemodes would recommend to anyone willing to have a fun time but not wanting to get stuck playing for hours on end
recommended

recommended
must get addons must shoot npcs
recommended
its ok
recommended
dont play this unless you have at least an 8 mbs connection vanilla servers dont exsist anymore every server forces you to download countless  models and more often than not it makes you download them via the workshop which doesnt give you an accurate progress bar have fun starring at a progress bar which just keeps cycling over and over again and leaves you blind as to when the item will actually be done downloading for people who arent privlleged with a fast connection this game is merly a file downloading simulator and nothing more im off to find a game i can actually play now keep in mind it never used to be this bad at the moment however people are to fond of loading their servers with pointless crap and making you download it from the workshop whilst connecting i guess server owners have to have as much uneeded assets as possible in their servers or else their balls will fall off good game just not accessable

recommened game

it ruined my life 5 stars

garrys mod is probably the most stupid game i have on steam the entire thing was made by some dude but now there are multiple people i guess and it still sucks bad people wanted something like sfm where you can play with ragdolls and things like that so a  called garry newman made what we today know as garrys mod the game visually is just horrible it looks like the jolly green giant took a not so jolly sht everything is so messy and horribly done it hurts to look at anything in this game garry put things like team fortress 2 left 4 dead 2 and half life 2 in this game i have no idea how he made it so that they all look horrible now but somehow he succeeded in doing that the gameplay is just bad there are various gamemodes including prop hunt trouble in terrorist town and darkrp they all are bad and this was not surprising when i played this game hll i believe i have some actual time on this game and i still think it is horrendous okay but on a different side the fighting is amazing at being sht i mean the hitboxes are just bad you can go up to someone with one of the best guns and it will probably not even hit them now this is a much better game than garrys mod [iimgbombcom] see how the graphics and shooting looks so realistic if garrys mod was anything like this i would have liked it much more battlefield 4 is much more superior to this excuse of a game 010

trying to explain garrysmod is trying to explain charles darwns evolutionary theory to someone religious garrysmod is a game without limitations if you want to build a giant rocket which flys around making sex noises and dropping  bombs you can if you want to run around pretending to be in a triple a fps with better gameplay you can if you want to pretend to be in a slender game with friends you can you get the point the game itself is only limited by your own imagination and your willingness to learn theres communities for everything roleplay sandboxbuilding virtual lives etc even creators can get in the action with it being open source you can create your own gamemode entities weapons and maps check the garrysmod workshop for an endless supply of garrysmod content 1010 ps rustybullethole garrynewman1stepforward2stepsback

bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water usually by baking throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture there are many combinations and proportions of types of flour and other ingredients and also of different traditional recipes and modes of preparation of bread as a result there are wide varieties of types shapes sizes and textures of breads in various regions bread may be leavened by many different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes for example in sourdough recipes to highpressure artificial aeration methods during preparation or baking however some products are left unleavened either for preference or for traditional or religious reasons many noncereal ingredients may be included ranging from fruits and nuts to various fats commercial bread in particular commonly contains additives some of them nonnutritional to improve flavor texture color shelf life or ease of manufacturing depending on local custom and convenience bread may be served in various forms at any meal of the day it also is eaten as a snack or used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations such as fried items coated in crumbs to prevent sticking or the bland main component of a bread pudding or stuffings designed to fill cavities or retain juices that otherwise might drip away partly because of its importance as a basic foodstuff bread has a social and emotional significance beyond its importance in nutrition it plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture its prominence in daily life is reflected in language where it appears in proverbs colloquial expressions he stole the bread from my mouth in prayer give us this day our daily bread and even in the etymology of words such as companion and company literally those who eatshare bread with you contents [hide] 1 etymology 2 history 3 types 4 preparation 41

thing since sliced bread in cockney rhyming slang bread means money this usage is derived from the phrase bread and honey[5] history main article history of bread bread shop tacuinum sanitatis from northern italy beginning of the 15th century bread is one of the oldest prepared foods evidence from 30000 years ago in europe revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants[6] it is possible that during this time starch extract from the roots of plants such as cattails and ferns was spread on a flat rock placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread around 10000 bc with the dawn of the neolithic age and the spread of agriculture grains became the mainstay of making bread yeast spores are ubiquitous including the surface of cereal grains so any dough left to rest will become naturally leavened[7] there were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking pliny the elder reported that the gauls and iberians used the foam skimmed from beer to produce a lighter kind of bread than other peoples parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting or wheat bran steeped in wine as a source for yeast the most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough starter[8] in 1961 the chorleywood bread process was developed which used the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf the process whose highenergy mixing allows for the use of lower protein grain is now widely used around the world in large factories as a result bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer however there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value[9]

back when i started playing garrys mod it was something different people were friendly and were intelligent but as always a community comes and a community goes as you go along you settle here and there with various online communities and what not but lets go over what makes this game unique this game is hugely customizable with various gamemodes like darkrp ttt and murder players have more to do that ever before and millions of servers to choose from i currently administrate for a game community and that can get hectic it has its faults but its an all round great game with plenty of potential to evolve from just a basic sandbox game get this game if you enjoy tinkering with stuff if you just want to pick up and play something without many rules or fiddling this may not be the game for you

this game is full of suprises from its vast variety of fun messing around gamemodes like sandbox or cinema to the more serious and political darkrp and trouble in terroist town to the many addons being created in the workshop everyday what makes this game even better is that everything is created by others in the community  hence the name mod prophunt ttt darkrp murder deathrun are just some of the game modes i got addicted to if youre in the right servers the amount of fun you can have is insane then if you get a server running with some friends you could play some sandbox and download many of the thousands of mods available right at your reach i recommend the m9k weapon packs and nuke packs so much death >d the only major problem is textures counterstrike source and half life 2 are required for the game otherwise almost all props and textures will be either a huge error or a pink and black chequred material this can be easily fixed by downloading the textures themselves if you dont have the games but it can be quite a hassle there can also be textures from other games needed like hl ep1 or 2 or even some nonvalve games like mass effect 3 overall you can have a lot of fun with this game with or without friends online or offline well worth the small price if i was to rate this game id give it a 95 for its versitility and wide range of ways to play i definately recommend it for any hardcore or even casual gamer

garrys mod takes off where halflife 2 ended you play as the cool guy named garryman and you have to shoot at everything probably the best part about this game is the storyline garymans wife was stollen and he has to saver her i wont spoilps the rest of it though garryman is the best game since obama so if you have the 10$ you should probably not get it butts10

ive played over 800 hours of this game it is a very easy setup with clear ideas the game is very popular among a few youtubers venturiantale this game involves lots of different ideas one example being that users can make things called addons when you go to the garrys mod workshop you can see all the cool and popular builds the addons are downloaded within 30 seconds top then when you start up your game its already completely downloaded and ready for your liking also the multiplayer setup for users and their friends are very easy to make within 1 minute you can have 20 friends on one server it is truly amazing when you get used to the game you really understand life i can guarantee that you will have lots of fun thank you for reading have a good day dinoworld12

i have played jarrys mart for near 1144 hours so naturally i have earned the right to voice my opinions on not only the infastructure of this game but also hitler walmart takes a few unexpected turns in the form of plot twists it starts out as a carbon copy of hamlet and turns into something more similar to samurai harem by shakespeared you can expect a few laughs and a few tears from this beauty of a thing this game sucks hands down the worst game since hitsugi no chaika shadow of mordor if you want anything more than a few hours of walking around and pressing q you might as well get the more superior game minecraft ncaa 08 hello youtube this is my tutorial on how to delete winrar 34 xd follow these instructions 1 download comic sans 2 delete your 34 doctor who meme pictures 3 delete windows 33 done i hope this tutorial has helped you as much as it helped my great uncle george washington i think what hitler did was both wrong and right he showed us what a real demagogue could do god bless if youre into beastiality dont forget to drop by my personal blog and try out some of my industrial grade porn httpreallifeanimefileswordpresscom201406chaikapartyhard2gif  overall not that good 123 mediocre ign had a good run needs a sasquatch pls stop

the exact definition of jewishness is not universally agreed uponneither by religious scholars especially across different denominations nor in the context of politics as applied to those who wish to make aliyah nor even in the conventional everyday sense where jewishness may be loosely understood by the casual observer as encompassing both religious and secular jews or religious jews alone this makes it especially difficult to define who is an ashkenazi jew the people have been defined differently from religious cultural or ethnic perspectives since the overwhelming majority of ashkenazi jews no longer live in eastern europe the isolation that once favored a distinct religious tradition and culture has vanished the center of judaism today is once again in israel although a large community continues to live abroad particularly in the united states of america where ashkenazi jews live alongside other jewish groups furthermore the word ashkenazi is often used in nontraditional ways especially in israel by conservative and orthodox philosophies a person can be considered a jew only if his or her mother was jewish meaning more specifically either matrilineal descent from a female believed to be present at mt sinai when the ten commandments were given or else descent from a female who was converted to judaism before the birth of her children or if he or she has personally converted to judaism this means that a person can be ashkenazi but not considered a jew by some of those within the jewish communities making the term ashkenazi more applicable as a broad ethnicity which evolved from the practice of judaism in europe wikipedia introduction to ashkenazi jews

garrys mod is the ultimate sandbox game it plays with physics mainly in the ways of props npcs and models it uses the parts models and sounds of any source based game mainly half life 2 and counter strike source i have fallen in love with this game its use of the source engines mechanics is second to none there are addons for it these add things like maps weapons gamemodes vehicles and much more its multiplayer like the majoity of all souce engine games making it great for groups to play together things like trouble in terrorist town formally known as ttt are game modes ttt is a great gamemode made off the fundamentals of betrayal garrys mod is an incedible game overall i highly recommend it so come on grab some mates and have a good time sc00p 1010

i really like this game there are so much different things you and your friends can do you can choose to set up your own server or join servers that others have made everything from threwing stuffs into the air and take a seat in your homemade rocket awsome game but there is two things i complains about the first thing is that its impossible for me to save i search everywere for it and cant find a way to save i found a button it said game saved but it didnt saved anything but you can save items though the second thing is all of those greefing around the servers when you put some stuffs on the ground there are many who takes your stuffs ant throws tham away many servers have turned this off

garrys mod brings me back to the feel of half life 2 except with ridable heavies garrys mod is everything i love in a game freedom to do whatever you want modding capability and multiplayer its like having all the valve games in one to think that this was once a mod for half life 2 there is so much potential in this game and that is the reason i love it
recommended

recommended
garrys mod is the definition of build anything you like its amazing to see how one can toy around with the source engine while having a blast and garrys mod gives you the tools to use it even though its a sand box that you will enjoy for plenty of hours to come i found myself bored playing alone trying to build which made me realize that some people like myself may need someone to play with in order to enjoy it and sure enough garrys mod delivers with so many game mods i need a new hard drive to fillits a silly sand box that i can guarantee that any open minded person will enjoy well worth the price
recommended
garrys mod  sick game must play or you missing out soo bad

recommended
this game is worth the little money it costs when i first got the game i purely bought it for the creative aspect of the game i bought it with a few friends thinking that i would play a few hours of it and thought the few dollars i spent were well used however after a few weeks i got bored with creating and moved on to other games it was actually till another friend told me about this cool new alien game mode for garrys mod called morbus that i got back on from that point on i was hooked there are very few games that i have played as long as this one and i think it can be credited to the replayability and versatility of this game and the game modes its players create ttt murder morbus and many other game modes offer hours and hours of fun and since this game is normally always on sale on steam i would recommend it to anyone with a few dollars to spare
recommended
i absolutly love this game so far definatly worth the money
recommended
in all a great game at times it gets dull if so than swich to a different game or take a break so ya good game dragonborn
recommended

recommended
this is a fantastic extremely entertaining game which i love to play with friends the gameplay is fantastic and i love the workshop the only problem i have with it is that you have to buy counter strike source with it in order to experience the online sensation that this game provides so even though you have to pay a little bit extra in order to get the full experience it is all worth it i definetly reccomend this to everyone

very fun prop hunt is my fav would reccomend worth the buy
recommended
this is my personal favorite game ever this game is worth all of your time and money while on the outside it just looks like a halflife sandbox game it is so much more than that sure there is singleplayer and its fun but this game is all about the people setting up a server can be hard but joining a public one is fun and easy there are so many ways to play these are a few of my favorite ttt trouble in terrorist town is all about false trust and communication in a world of evil people prop hunt is just a crazy hide and seek murder is a easy way to play ttt cinema is a great way to pirate movies and sandbox just turns into making cannons and killing everyone howerer you play make sure you talk to people i have met so many awesome friends through this game we just hang out and have a good time that should be the motto of gmod just hang out and have fun
recommended
pretty much all i play

i recommend this  its fun funny and you can play with friends
recommended
fun game trolling friends making friend mad and other types of fun
recommended
ha fun game you can do almost anything in the game you can make a lot of stuffs like rocket and cars or you can just wandering around in the game need other games to work perfectly though like css there are a lot of gamemodes i might say that this is like an all in one game

recommended
this game is the best sim game ever
recommended
this is a great game to play with freinds
recommended
muahahahhaahha nearly 600 hours spent do i really have to say anything
recommended
its one of my favriote games of all time ranking at second the ammount of things that you can do in it is to large to even place a number on with addons made and poested daily by the community sure the controls are a little weird but theres nothing like a little practice
recommended
very fun game really worth the money but ber sure to get counter strike so you can have all of the textures so you can see everything
recommended
great game i mean whats better than a game where anything is possible
recommended
an amazing game with tons of gamemodes if you dont like bolting props together and making mad contraptions sandbox you can find a traitor trouble in terrorist town or ttt race other people gmod racer live in a virtual house bought with virtual money from a virtual job roleplay pretend youre a tv and hide prophunt and run through traps activated by another player all this and much more in a very flexible incredibly varied game or you could just play on one server and gamemode all the time ahem 420  black shadow
recommended
like building games get garrys mod like roleplaying games get garrys mod like zombie survival games get garrys mod like firstperson shooters get garrys mod like racing games get garrys mod like massive npc wars get garrys mod like murder mysteries get garrys mod like obstacle courses get garrys mod like hide and seek get garrys mod like hillarious physics get garrys mod like horror maps with friend get garryss mod like video games get garrys mod
recommended
this is an extremely fun game pros do anything you want physics from halflife 2 you can insert other steam games to use the props and everything in that game cons crashes randomly some people online are jerks have to download other games for textures like halflife 2 over all its 5050 but i still recommend it to anyone who likes causing destruction
recommended
i turned a watermelon into a 30 nukes 129387562375691238746928374610
recommended
this game is a lot of fun be sure to have friends if you get it though because this is terrifically boring if you play alone the idea behind this game is that you download addons to play different games everytime whether you are playing trouble in terrorist town prophunt or a murderthon in sandbox you are sure to have a blast this game reminds me a bit of minecraft because of its replayability and the fact that there are so many ways to play this 9510 the only thing keeping this game away from a 10 is the fact that i have encountered several problems browsing addons including a lack of an obvious search bar there is a way to search but it takes some experimentation and discovery to figure it out
recommended
garrys mod my goto game to waste time this game has a gamemode for anyone from formal rp to prophunt or ttt there are lots of things on this game to eat up your time and a really easy lan system that is very good for a lan party
recommended
if you like sand box style games mini games building random machines and controlable objects or just to fsu this is the game for you garrys mod is probably the ultimate game of making and breaking it gets better if you lan up with people or join variuse servers that would hold sand box mode or other game modes the only real downside is that sometimes you need certant mapcharacteritem textures to be able to see some game modes or to even play on them most are free but there are others that you need to buy another game entirely for the content that youre going to want to look through especially is anything in the garrys mod work shop hidden within the addons section from cars to boats to planes to weapons to maps to npcs youve got alot to choose from definately would recomend this game to anyone who loves to laugh
recommended
great game
recommended
this game is awsome as hell
recommended
this is the most modable game ever and its got 60 game servers in it each with its own game mode so i could play this for almost ever

very fun awesome workshop great multiplayer all round awesome game
recommended
i love it so much but i dont want to spend 20 dollars just to get the textures 
recommended
ive had so many fun hours with this game with ttt alone and my first 50 were from singleplayer ive met so many wonderful people and i wouldnt trade it for anything even a social life 1010
recommended
this is my absolute favorite game on steamother than this being a build anything type of game there are many different gamemodes to try the only annoying thing about this game is the fact that you need other games to see some textures but there are loopholes to that a cheap game that has great quality and many possibilities
recommended
great game for  and giggles and a great game to play when having lan parties this game well let you make just about anything you can think of buy it you know you want it 1010
recommended
love this game
recommended
in my opinion i see no reason to not like this game this game has pretty much every thing to do you could imagine you can make gueg working machines drive in vechles make scenes have big battles have small battles experiment with physics experiment with ragdolls play with friends in the many fun gamemodes and much much more this game has pretty much any gameplay you want and you have the power to change it at will this is a sandbox game so there is no story so dont expact that you can create one however check out youtube if you want to see what people do with this awesome game
recommended
elevator simulator is the single funnest game mode i have ever played 1010 would ride again

garrys mod is one of the best sandboxcommunity driven games on pc and possible in gaming if you are going to buy this you should buy css with it since many game modes use those textures in it sandbox mode is nice you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes i would recommend ttt as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in gmod gamemodesactaully it is the engine but eh there are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garrys mod and you will get you 10525 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers a great game with a good community if you know where to look

one of the greatest if not the best sandbox game that i ownexists the possiblities with the base game are virtually endless with the steam workshop they are literally infinite i reccomend that every steam user tries gmod at least once
recommended

recommended
the game itself is fun but when you get more gamemodes the possiblilites are limitless
recommended
this game is for when you wanna build and silly around using hl2 engine and all of the other hl2 enginehl1 engine games you have
recommended
best game ever period well this is an indepth review sooo first of all you can never be bored on this game and you will always be doing something crazy unless youre a serious person the more creative you are the better you can build many structures and even build robots with all the tools at your disposal there are ragdolls props vehicles and many maps to offer the game gets even better when you add the workshop the community makes content that you can download and there are ingame communitymade dupes that you can screw around with garrys mod also has spawned many ridiculous and fun gamemodes like gmod tower trouble in terrorist town ttt prop hunt murder stop it slender and many more overall this game is totally worth $999 that is how much i bought it for and it should be worth more because you can play games within a game in gmod that is crazy much like this game
recommended
i made a giant  in my first 4 minutes of playing and killed the entire server and got banned 1010
recommended
good game has alot of addons and gamemodes i only play this game mostly its cool try it
recommended
an exceptionally astounding source of entertainment for anyone sophisticated or immature no other games are executed as well as this in the sandboxstyle genre of gaming whether you are building complex contractions or laughing at the silliness of the game you can use your imagination and play a delightful game at the same time garrys mod is definately a video game worth investing in
recommended
this game is the type of game that help you with you creations that you always wanted to make
recommended
this game has all the stuff you need from ragdolls to equipments and the most funniest and coolest thing is that you can build mostly anything too but from my point of view on what i like about this game is launching ragdolls into the air and putting npcs  nonplayable characters holding guns making them look like a bodyguard so if you are a big fan of creation then this game is recommended for you good luck and have a blast
recommended
great sandbox game
recommended
just awesome
recommended

this game is kinda like minecraft except totally diffrent it has the same the possibilites  your creativite aspect that minecraft has except garrys mod goes the extra mile with much better graphics addons that go out off this world and so much crap no wonder garrys mod is rated the 1 physics sandbox ever and in my opinion the 1 sandbox game ever ps i wish for some one to make a miningcrafting addon minecraft is a great game i love it but garrys mod is a bit more my taste and would like to put a little bit of minecraft into this amazing sandbox no offense to mc pros and fanatics i just kinda like this more

recommended
garrys mod is a sandbox quite a good one at that the base game is playable and you can spend hours making awesome creations playing with friends is always fun due to the sandbox nature of the game in my opinion the game really shines in its server freedom gamemodes and lastly addons the hl2 weapons will bore you after a while and the steam workshop intergration will make it alot easier to get sweps models npcs useful tools useless garbage like sound guns who the christ actually likes them and things like that there are many gamemodes to choose from from standard sandbox to ttt a gamemode where people have to use their cunning to winsurviverdmect to even mods like zmod that are completely different to the normal garrys mod experience that pits players against themselves and zombies while they fight over loot and land servers can choose between any of these gamemodes and many many more and the best thing is that they can add to the gamemodes as much as they want and they can even earn a suprisingly large amount of money from it if the server is liked enough overall my hours should tell you that i really like this game do yourself a solid and buy this make sure to buyown counter strike source for the content as css is needed for many things anyway to wrap up garrys mod is a fantastic game
recommended
this game is like the most best sandbox game in the whole universe and f all those minecraft players
recommended

hi this is my review for garys mod and i think this is a great game and i do recommend this game there is no campaign or anything but there are gamemodes on multiplayer and on single player you can play sandbox you can play sandbox by yourself or with friends there are so many things and people are posting stuff in the workshop everyday so it is almost and infinite amount of things that you could do i do not think that this game will ever bore you because it always brings laughs and has almost endless things to do so i think it is worth the money that you pay

garrys mod the best of the best when it comes to sandbox building games garrys mod includes a variety of game modes from trouble in terrorist town which is like a find the murderer and dont die type of gam to role playing were you pick a job and live the life as if you were that one with the inclusion of the steam workshop it is even easier to get great addons for your sandbox world although it is a great game there are some things to consider before getting if oyu are on a slow computer it might lag and that will make it hard to play also servers take a while to load depending on the mode of choice and you need to get a few games like counterstrike team fortress 2 and left for dead 2 to get some textures unless you want to download them piece by piece but in all seriousness this game is amazing to have a good laugh with your friends and the gamming community is really friendly for the most part

okay there are many pros and cons to garrys mod with the cons in my opinion far outweighing the pros however this could be biased as my rig isnt exactly the best around but despite the huge amount of negativity that may or may not be present here m80s it really all comes down to what you enjoy the most out of a videogame and since this is a multiplayer sandboxtype game chances are youre probably going to like it one way or the other so lets get started shall we like i said garrys mod is a single playermultiplayer sandbox game that allows you to do just about anything provided you know how to code in luaalthough not really needed to enjoy the gameand have an outstanding amount of patience ill get into this eventually and features many gamemodes that are sure to provide you with hours of fun ttt im looking at you <3 along with gamemodes garrys mod has a huge modding community the steam community workshop provides some pretty in great addons for you to use in your creations or for your amusement in singleplayer of course this is where  gets real and damnright annoying alright if youve read this far youll know i mentioned something along the lines of lua that my friend is the games coding language just about every addon such as custom weapons vehicles and generally any script that is supposed to make anything happen really is coded using lua and boy is it tedious to get more than 60 addons working the thing that bugs me the most out of this is that most mod authors dont tell you what other addons their mods are compatible with which results in lua errors that will eventually lead to you losing your precious sanity seriously i lost count of the many times ive crashed because of too many addons or memory loss the memory loss is my fault really yay 32bit windows so getting over 60 addons is tedious right now on to the community huge modding community sure but the online community is ing terrible all im going to tell you is that you should make use of the mute button whenever possible i see too many players online pointlessly complaining about someones voice when they could just make use of the mute button i know that most of the time these guys know there is a way to mute people but some people genuinely dont and ive no clue as to why all in all its not that bad of a game if you can manage to ignore these problems that for some reason have not been looked into yet in garry man

this is one of my favorite games you can do anything that you think you can and cant do in normal videogames a fun sandbox mode wich is really fun you can download addons and gamemodes wich really makes the game but you can link source games to make thing from that its really just a fun game i could not find a bad review there are bugs and glitches but minor things
recommended
this game  anonymous
recommended
very fun you can do anything from making a scene to making a zombie invasion or a roket the posibilities are endless i definitally recommend this game its perfect for people who just want to do their own thing you can play single player or multiplayer wich is awesome i aspecially like the fact that you can make your own stuff and then put it on the workshop for other people to see and use going on servers though thats a pain you need to download the stuff thats in the server so it could take hours for you to go into a server but if you have the stuff then it doesnt take long depending on your connection many i reapeat many things can go wrong by that i mean glitches crashes and freezing depending on how good your computer is you can only do so much if for example you wanted a zombie infested map youd have to have a good gaming computer otherwize your computer will lag freeze or even crash im not saying this game isnt bad at all im just pointing out some stuff that could be worked on other then that this game is awesome i love it my sister loves it my dad loves it my friends love it its a very lovable game    ten out of ten id say

i think garrys mod is a great game its fun and everything but what should be said is that css counter strike source is what most of the maps are other wise you will see purple and black blocks everywhere because of this message not said to me earlier i had to pay 16 instead of 13 thats a big difference since i could have either saved the money or brought another game i think its a waste to be done like that so either garrys mod should put my message in caps and have a warning message before the purchase or to simply make garrys mod 13 and it should also come with css and not to let you buy garrys mod on its own
recommended
really good gamemodes like prophunt trouble in terrorist town et cetera worth the ten dollars
recommended
entertainment fulfilled
recommended
this game is a musthave for those who seek creativity and ideas
recommended
you shouldnt have to own counterstrike source to complete some of the missing content in this game well the missing content in certain servers that use css assets on their maps

have you ever wanted to build a gaint spaceship that when launching you realise doesnt work and actually kills anyone nearby in a burst of fire and death or create a giant mechanically working automobile to crush your foes or maybe even make a drivable bath tub all this and more are possible in gmod i have had the game for over a year now and i need to tell the people this game is brilliant one minute you can be flinging toasters at the combine the next making a detailed tf2 scene and this is all before you get addons the addon workshop has everything from hilarious weapons to hitler you can make quite literally anything you want who wouldnt want this game you can create a controlled zombie outbreak and then die by the power of a melon falling on you must buy for any gamer 1032224678543319472  10

garrys mod is a great game for sandboxing and stuff you can also play it with your friends if you have them

quite a fun creative game good if youre very imaginitive and want to create something new or if you want to have fun with friends and mess around on a server or if you want to basically create your own game with customizable maps enemies and weapons a great experience 910
recommended
great and well thought out game good job dude on this game
recommended
its a grat game to be sure but it does have its flaws eg it dosent tell you that you need to have the couterstrike source texture pack to play games without having a errors signs and purple and blcak squares showing up you can buy a bundle where you can get these both for a discount but it isnt clear that you need the textures until youre playing a game with giant error as a table plus it feels like you were scammed when you find out you can get them from free online but if you dont trust the web i recommend just buying counterstrike source which costs more than the actual game but it is a great game beside that with plenty of different game modes along with some role playing games the games are unique like prop hunt when you would turn into a object as a hider and hide while th hunters would try and find you and shoot you and your team down overall its agreat game but it does have a few tricks up its sleve
recommended
as an animator i highly recommend buying this game because it has everything that is required to exercise your imagination furthermore this game is basically 30 games because of the different game modes available within gmod you get more than what you pay for the addons available in this game is the heart and soul of gmod because it is what enables players to further expand their sense of adventure and curiosity be aware it is necessary to have counterstrike source to fully experience this game without any frustrations regarding world textures and models the fun factor of this game whether you are playing with friends or alone offline or online will always remain
recommended
best game ever it offers any person anything they want if theyre looking for action zombie survival if there looking for a crime simulation with most likely a pretty hilarious atmosphere trouble in terrorist town and the list goes on and on this highly expansive game really takes the sky and goes to the heavens it is a gift 1010

i would highly recommend this sandbox game because of how it lets you make your own fun experience in sandbox you could spawn a bunch of father grigoris and zombies to watch them fight in a classic survivor versus zombie match you could even spawn a hunter chopper and have an epic rocket launcher match on top of the roofs overall it is best for those who would want a game where you have control over pretty much everything garry is the best 3

recommended
ive had garrys mod since gm9 came out and ive had hours upon hours of fun with it it can be a springboard for creativity  a look at the facepunch games forums or any source movie created before the advent of valves sfm will make that clear but ive found that you must have a plan when you sit down to play plan to play multiplayer plan to build an airship plan to program a missile launcher in wiremod heck you can teach yourself about the applications of vector calculus using wiremod but if you stumble into the sandbox with no plan at all you will waste vast amounts of time before you do anything really satisfying explore the goofiness and the mods for a few hours but if youre like me a plan will help you get a lot more out of gmod in the end play something with a narrative if you want to goof off garrys mod is hard  and potentially rewarding  work

garrys mod is the  bro

endless possibilities filled with fun and creativity plus its cheap it is a must buy

the best sandbox you can buy pros first and foremost steam workshop the things people make for gmod are insane graphics its a source mod the graphics on source games tend to be decent multiplayer multiplayer gamemodes all playermade are one of the best parts of gmod its a sandbox spawn whatever you want pose anything however you want attach a rocket thruster to a bathtub and launch a citizen into space maps if you have a source game almost all source games can be basically attached to gmod so you can play the maps use the props spawn the characters etc infinite possibilities play spawn pose do anything cons now even a game as perfect as gmod must have downsides right children tend to be ridiculed a bit in multiplayer all the annoying kids give the decent ones a bad name i should know tt as with any game if you mod it too much it will crash it runs slightly worse than alot of source games but if you can run css you can probably run gmod final score 99100
recommended
the amount you can do on this game theres no point in not having it theres no excuse if ur using steam ur pc will run it theres bound to be a gamemode you will enjoy even if ur not into the normal sandbox you will never get bored with the amound of addon there is going up every minute and the amount of gamemodes just buy it

a game built around creativity and the wickedly popular source engine classics such as halflife 2 and counter strike source this game allows you to take the role of the maker while other games of this engine allow you to point and shoot you may point and build i have had my fun and moneys worth 100 fold at least for this game has brought me over a thousand hours of fun with friends that i can not comprehend otherwise i do recommend this game to any and all to those who wish to have fun with a great community of builders roleplayers and fps shooters explore the server browser with hundreds of player integrated gamemodes whether your style is fps which can be found in ttt or some serious and nonserious roleplay cwhl2rp darkrp whatever your taste and style garrys mod has something for you gameplay 1010 graphics 9910 community 872510 replayability 1010 unfortunately this game is on a downward turn as the masses and communities start to smallen so does the game itself as it fades into the mists of time let us remember what great times we have had that is all from me i hope this helps

garrys mod a game that cannot be given a serious review like my other reviews just look at the screenshots for the game a fun interesting and wacky game full of the most random things in a video game for instance you can make batman twerk not joking twerk garrys mod 10010 if you dont own this on steam then why do you have steam btw play with friends gets boring in singleplayer easily
recommended
despite its bugs with multiplayer and annoying community this is still a great sandbox game with endless creative possibility gmans face is hilarious to mess about with btw
recommended
great fun hilarious to play with friends if i had one

i recommend this game by alot i also recommend a gamemode that you should try out it is called darkrp standing for dark roleplay there are many servers out there with alot of different mod set and  who constantly kill you over and over again but soon you learn how to get them in trouble or banned i recommend it there is alot to do with this game and the gamemode

garrys mod is the most fun game i have ever played the unlimited potential for anything you can possibly imagine is amazing i highly reccomend this game but get counter strike source too for no missing textures

if youre looking for a game that allows you to ride a baby to space then look no further because garrs mod has it all from making a funny freeze frame with ragdolls to building a spy cam to sneak into peoples bases undetecded there is anostly nothing you cant do in gmod it puts the player into a varitey of maps with all the tools you need for chaos if you want to build a giant rocket and strap a dinosaur to it then go nuts if there is one thing i would have to say about this it would be the only limit is your imagination whatever you think of doing i can almost garuntee that you it can be done
recommended
nowwhere do i begin this game is more like a few hundered games in one there are so many game modes to play theres no way i can talk about them all so ill just talk about the two most popular gamemodes sandbox and ttt sandbox you can load up any map you want then spawn in and mess around with various props npcs vehicles and weapons with the addon system you can spawn in a crazy amount of stuff created by other players will you build a giant castle out of plastic blocks or will you spawn in an army of rebels to fight a combine horde your choice trouble in terrorist town essentially a murder mystery game youre the terrorists from counterstrike but someones a traitor among you but you dont know who its the innocents job to find out who the traitor is and kill him before he kills everyone else you could randomly kill people not a good idea or you could use evidence to find the traitors and exterminate them

1010 would play again killed a guy on accident as traitor in trouble in terrorist town with a explosive barrel to the face which someone shot xd

the gmod community is huge approaching the likes of l4d2 portal 2 or even getting to the stage of team fortress 2 at least if it werent ftp this means new servers new addons new workshop creations all new each day it is never the same game twice unless you choose it to be of course it is possible to mount games on gmod so long as they run on the source engine even so this means your content from the half life games source portal and l4d series team fortress 2 and many other games are all able to be mounted from the word go and arguably the best thing about gmod is the fact that you can do anything not like most realistic first person shooters which say hop on your bike you can go anywhere you like so long as its in this general direction no if you can think of it then it can be made and yes there are some pretty crazy things out there but that makes it all the more fun 1010
recommended
simply great kudos to garry newman for making this game you can build you can create cars the list is endless buy this game if you are looking for a simulation of anything you want d

having over 200 hours on gmod i think i can write a truthfull review this game is really fun you can do just about anything in single player based on the things you add to gmod from the workshop you can shoot your guns like the 9mm pistol a 6 shot revolver a triggered bomblaser mine bomb a gravity gun and then your tools you use to build the tool gun and the laser mover thingy but you can add more weapons like a ak47 c4 colt 44 and other great guns on multiplayer you can get mods  duh of corse p  like prop hunt prop hunt is a game where you can be whatever prop you want and you have to try to hide from the hunters the hunters try to find all the props before time runs out murder murder is a mod where you have bystanders and 1 bystander will have a secret weapon then there is a murder the murders role is to kill every one without getting shot by the bystander with his secret weapon hide & seek hide & seek is a mod where they are hiders and seekers the hiders hide from the seekers seeking p the seekers role is to find all the hiders before time runs out and other great mods but those are the ones i play often 4156124354524352455  ign now please thumbs this review up it took a long time to type d

these are my thoughts about this game [graphics] i could not complain their decent there are alot of options in the consle and video option on this game to change them so i would give graphics 9510 [gameplay] there is a ton of things to do and i mean an endless amount of posibilities of things you can do there are over 50 gamemodes and personaly i do sandbox single player because i just like to make screen shots and share them with my friends nn so i would give gameplay 1010 [posing ragdolls} most of the time i kind of have a hard time trying to pose the tf2 and css ragdolls because the body parts can be stiff sometimes and it messes everything up for me when making a screen shot so i would have to give posing 510 sorry  [humor] i wouldn most of the time i kind of have a hard time trying to pose the tf2 and css ragdolls because the body parts can be stiff sometimes and it messes everything up for me when making a screen shot so i would have to give posing 510 sorry  [humor] i wouldnt say there is much humor in this game but when there is a 10 minute gmod mini movie i laugh my  off with all the references and effects and ragdolls so i would give humor 8510 thats all i could come up with for now thank you for reading nn
recommended
i love this game very much its like a minecraft except its not as pixelated as it is the gamemode is a actually a lot similar to other games except you can add your own things and create however you want it to be set up by so far this game is the easiest game and has the most entertaining gamemodes ive ever played

garrys mod is a fun and creative game with loads of aspects of the game to explore as you can change the gametypes eg go on servers but server admins and mods get a little bit petty at times and also the game is a little bit buggy but a very solid game with decent graphics would definetely recommend the game for the money
recommended
really fun d
recommended
this game is amazing
recommended
garrys mod is not a game it is a physics toy and sandbox style tool that doesnt matter as garrys mod is pure fun no matter what you choose to do gmod has an infinite amount of replay value the amount of content is extremely high and many more things are being made as best mapsdeathrun prop hunt and terrosit town
recommended
this game is really good period

the game is fun cause you never know what to expect you can do anything you want
recommended
now i havent played a whole lot of this game but i can say this it is a fun way for you and your friends to get together and do just about anything hide and seek no longer awkward and in public especially with old men basic physics games not just for the bedroom anymore roleplaying see above you can even watch youtube with a bunch of strangers innovation i give this game a solid 1010

in garrys mod you start out with items and props from halflife and other valve games with the power of steam workshop you can pretty much find anything this can be a very very weird game depending how you play it i defienty recommend this game to anyone that wants to have a little fun or like me 2 days straight and more of fun this is a must play game @ a very cheap price must get

endless game for those of you who cant figure its a sandbox thats really powered by the community people upload their mods and addons and you can download them for free never gets old 1010 ps id personally reccommend to get the cssgmod bundle if youre going to try out prop hunt as most maps and textures can only be used if you own that
recommended
great game and better if you play with friends when i am bored i choose this game to make my day great game
recommended
definetely worth its money
recommended
such a great game with hours of fun so much do
recommended
well holy hell this heres one of the easiest games to win for chrissake all you have to do is spawn somewhere and youre winning already not to mention tthe first time you play it you get an achievement so thats freakin icing on the cake not only that theres all kinds of things you can do like create devices using props n stuff make comics with characters and stopmotion vids like the many gmod vids you can find on youtube it links up to the majority of games you already possess as well like if you have tf2 the tf2 characters props and weapons will be available for you to spawn definitely something worth looking at when you just want to mess around
recommended
i think gmod garrys mod is a really fun sandbox game that is fun for all ages of the steam community

garrys mod i was a little late on this game i heard about it from youtube the videos they can make with it is just quite funny anyways i only have about 20 hours of garrys mod when i write this review but let me tell you that is plenty of time to tell you how much fun this game is i put game in quotations because its not really a game its a sandbox that lets you create your game and much more i love screwing around on this and making my own levels to face baddies such as spawn on a tf2 map and then make it filled with combine to shoot you do need a game for this the one that is recommeded is team fortress 2 since its free to play and thats another unique aspect of this game it takes the games you have if they are able to and give you the maps and ragdolls and models to do as you wish garrys mod is basically ran with the same weapon system and health system as half life 2 as well as the same sounds i cant really explain this game to you well because words cannot be put on how awesome it is also this game has workshop and that means you can download models and other things thatll expand what garrys mod has to offer this game cant really die since people in the community are expanding it more and more i recommend you get this game worth every penny

the game is best recommended to those who enjoy the hl2 engine and thought to themselves what if i could do more with it the game has no limit and has kept me entertained with plenty of addons and dupes from the workshop such as a laser gun some meme models and lots upon lots of ragdolls this game can be yours for a decent price and whats more any other games that use the hl2 engine can be mounted and the resources from that game can be used as well some popular games can be mounted include all of the hl2 games duh portal portal 2 and left4dead i think thats right i dont own the game myself but still take my review as another reason to buy the game after all look how long ive been playing it fact there is achievements made just for wasting your time one week one month one year oh well

i have a very slow computer i mean minecraft is a pain trying to run so i was thinking the same about gmod but gmod is a breeze i spawned around 25 zombies and it was fine somebody spammed explosives took my computer down 1015 fps but it was fine you wont see that during normal gameplay you will just need counter strike source and you will 85% of the textures available to you recommend you get this during this holiday sale and you get the counter strike source w gmod pack so you can get both very cheap

this game is awesome 910

best game i have ever played by far well worth the money and great for single and multiplayer experiences
recommended
oh garrys mod you have entertained me for hours yet its really hard to make an review for this game as it is more of a engine for a lot of games within this game think of garrys mod as a really weird canvas which many have created awesome art on its just hard to describe if youre not satisfied easily then this game might be excelent for you why well as this game has way more to offer then just messing around it offers so much more then an average real game would these days for this exact reason i love this game it allows being fcked around in but aswell gives this incredeble freedom which others might not exploit but build on if youre not certain if you want it i strongly recommend checking if you have more source games in your steam libary such as counter strike source and half life 2 and episodes since garrys mod or gmod uses them as resources for texures and items you wouldnt want to miss out on since most servers use these textures aswell you basicly need them to get the full expierence out of this game yes i did it i called this garrys mod a game so id recoomend this game to everyone that just wants to have fun
recommended
you can get away with anything in this game 1110
recommended
this game its legendary it might not look as good you know a generic sandbox nothing special blah blah blah but once you actually invest time into it you start to enjoy it and get addicted if you play regularly    
recommended
great game even playing on single player and then even better on multiplayer
recommended
so let me get the basic part out first this game is an awesome opensource sandbox game it has many features you can do this game inspired me to start programming with games instead of just web i code a lot for this game but thats not it i love playing the games they have i love sandbox the most because of the creations you can make or destroy with your friends this has to be one of the most popular games on steam if you have money spend it on this game its worth it all my friends i mostly met on this game from servers well i guess that is all but this game is awesome for everyone
recommended
towering amazing xd
recommended
nothing you cant do
recommended
pretty fun buy it
recommended
this game is the ultimate sandbox
recommended
if you dont own this dont know what youve been doing this game has endless possibilities what to do ive spent around 5000 hours on this game playing different mods such as sandbox roleplaying rpgs ttt and tons of others met a lot of friends aswell from the gamemode communities
recommended
my butt feels nice an squitshy
recommended
this game is the type of game that just doesnt get old plenty of different gamemodes to choose from wanna just kill people do you want to play hide and seek maybe play build a sled and race or do you just want to watch youtube videos with friends look no further as gmod can become a whole different genre of game by switching servers
recommended
i like this game its a game within a game which has many more games for the 599 i spent and the 300 hours i have got out of it i would say its worth every penny
recommended
its fun but can get boring pretty fast if you play solo like me
recommended
1010 would bang
recommended
this game is awesome even if you play singleplayer or multiplayer by the way i got killed by refrigirator so 1010
recommended
some of you may be wondering what is garrys mod answer its garrys mod i think the bigger question here is why havent you got it yet
recommended
this is most likely one of the greatest sandbox games on the steam webstore with plenty of things to do from making a floating piece of wood with some decorations to a motorised bathtub to a fully functunal ship or just stack up wooden objects and set them on fire and if the vanilla version doesnt grab your tastes get some addons this game has an outstanding number of addons that can be downloaded with a click of a button some addons are made for great new building experiences take expression 2 and wiremod for example with the use of wiremod you can create working doors and other things not that good with wiremod so cant give detailed explanation and with expression 2 you can make holograms teleporters and big explosions although this is an amazing game and i highly recommend it to anyone whos looking for a unique sandbox experience there is probably only one thing that i dislike about it and its that if you dont have certain games like half life or counter strike some textures and models wont work this include black and pink checkerboxes and big flashing errors signs luckily i have found a way around this check out this website to get free models and textures from games such as portal half life and counter strike httpkajar9wixcom2  go to the garrycontent tab to gain access to the resources this is not piracy it is not letting you play seperate games for free it is simply giving you textures and models for gmod other than that issue i give it a rating of 910 definately got my moneys worth
recommended
gmod where to start amazing open world sandbox type game with limitless potental i like the workshop feature in the game so users and easly improve there game experiance and make the lifetime of this game even longer anyway who doesnt like straping a thruster to a couch and shooting it off into space this game is fun a must get

best game i have ever played xd 1010
recommended
garrys mod has got to be one of the best sandbox games of all time everything about it is so simple yet addictive whenever i get on garrys m od i always start to play ttt ttt is a very fun game mode the exhiliration of being a traitor is what makes the game mode stand out one negative is that players on specific servers can be sometimes unresonable stupid or flat out annoying for example some servers on murder another game mode really dont take the game seriously server lag is also another drawback to garrys mod i also consider the fact that you have to buy games to get textures for gmod pretty stupid because of the cost of the games and storage use comments aside i reccommmend garrys mod because of its replay value ttt prop hunt and deathrun if you can get over the negatives on gmod then you will definitly find your self playing milions of hours of ttt over and over again every day 810
recommended
i defininetly reccomend this game its fun cheap and lets you do whatever you want want to shoot hatsune miku in the boob you got it want to make a whole city with props and kill everyone in it bam garrys mod buy it
recommended
its aight
recommended

recommended
really good game hours of fun 1010 recommended
recommended
this is an amazing play this for a day and youll know what im talking about
recommended
there are no limits to this game if you can think it then you can probably make it being bored on this game is rare and there is always something to do and plenty of downloads on garrysmodorg to enhance your gameplay experience there is so much for such a low price
recommended
i have over 2070 hours on this game and ive just gotta say i dont regret any of it the hours ive spent on this game have been really worthwhile memories that i enjoy looking back to this game is comprised of physics and buidling really fun to do with other people and is also a gate way to meeting people online and playing multiple game modes consisting popularly of dark role play prop hunt one of my favourites murder and sledbuild the game is always cheap as well so go buy it and play it because this is a truly great and fun game although i only recommend really playing it multiplayer on servers because its very lonelyboring by yourself but you must make sure you have all the half life 2 games installed as well as maybe tf2 and left 4 dead since this game uses the models from those games for the basic building blocks you can also install addons to improve the quality of your building happy building people <3 if you are interested in lookin for some pictures just look at my screen shots for gmod i have a ton
recommended
wanna know if this game is good look at my hours played no way i sunk 3 thousand hours into a terrible game
recommended
best creation game i have ever played also played this game for 1838 hours and still counting so it poves how good it is and there is a hell of a lot of addons that you can get to p
recommended
i have had this game for nearly 2 years and i am still surprised at what you can do the addons are unlimited allowing you to take your imagination to the highest level at first i though it was a game where you could do a few things but when i found out about the addons the possibilities increased by ten folds if you like driving a car off a hill like in gta you can anything you think of is possible if you looked at how old this game is you will be surprised at how many people still want to buy this game and how many people still play it if you like to let your imagination run wild then this is a must for you even if you are someone who likes wierd games this is a game for you anytype of games you like its all jumbled into one in the best way possible so overall i suggest you buy the game now
recommended
garrys mod isnt like other games you can manipulate it however you wish making crazy contraptions galore its your world you can mess about with it build stuff and blow it up have brilliant battles with vehicles youve made shove thrusters on stuff blast things off the map and into space then do it over again i highly reccomend this game  its a musthave

garrys mod is the brainchild of garry newman who wanted to create a physicsbased sandbox based on the source engine which also allows other players to create mods for the game too so the game has a truly massive amount of variety in singleplayer you canbuild your own npc arena populate it with conflicting characters and watch them kill each other on zombie survival be a human fighting for your life while a zombie horde slowly infects the rest of your band of survivors on trouble in terrorist town take control of a traitor terrorist and collaborate with other traitors to wipe out all the innocent terrorists either through the use of a suicide bomb or sniping each innocent off one by one and in the excellent dark rp a multiplater roleplaying mod built for the game you start of as a citizen but if you wish you can choose a different job such as a police officer and take on crime headon or a mob boss with a gang the size of everyone in the server called the tunnel snakes who own the cops through successful blackmail and bribery or a sadistic gun dealer whos only pleasure is to kill everyone he sees or a hobo and beg for money or a hitman charging $100 per kill or in the fantastic prop hunt where you either start off as a hunter and fend your way to slaughter all props which hideor be a prop and hide hoping noone will find youpersonally this and trouble in terrorist town are my favoritesor just be a citizen and build the game is fantastic with the only flaws being the aged but highly forgiveable graphics and the occasional glitches and lua cache errors but i dont usually judge games based on minor technical problems i judge them on the experience ive had with the game and mine was fantastic9910 1 off because lua errorsotherwise great gamegreati recomend itseriously buy it now if you havnt

thrusters everywhere everyone is dead so much death i have daily flashbacks of the war because of this i likely have more hilarious physics related deaths than a dozen playthroughs of darksouls this game is worth everything i payed and more and unless youre about as creative as a rock youll definitely enjoy the sh t out of this game

recommended

recommended
good and fun to play k bye
recommended
sandbox as good as it can be at the right moment roleplay annoy people built sexual things with rocket boosters or even learn basic scripting on lua there is nothing new i can say about it you kind of must experience gmod
recommended
this game is good it makes your imagination come to life or if you dont like to do that you can play different types of gamemodes online so you can satisify yourself with the fun joy and laughter you wouldnt even stop mplaying this game because this game is the best but the downsides onto this game you need to buy certain games to obtain textures to play on online or offline so thats the bad side of this game
recommended
one does not simply play a game for 800 hours and call it bad
recommended
i had a nyan cat gun and my friend had a pedobear player model lots of fun
recommended
this is an awesome game u can make your own servers on it witch its really fun to play with people on your own terms olny problem is hackers and 10 year olds so i guess its good for the review
recommended
amazing game great modding support and overall the fanbase is great too get this game 1010
recommended
this game is all about garry and different ways you can mod him such as acquiring pretty dresses and wigs that you can place on garry to make him look as sexy as possible but dont go overboard because hell  ya i really regret buying that bikini for garry ill never walk the same way again
recommended
fun game with no objective 910
recommended
if you enjoy listening to kids screaming on the mic saying rdm than this is the game for you my verdict 1110 would buy again
recommended
love this game but you need the textures
recommended
this game is possibly one of the best sandbox games out there that has a fair price what makes this different from other titles is it has a growing community that not just plays the game but makes mods gamemodes and much more content garrys mod is great but the things it lacks is graphics and textures since garrys mod takes textures from other games you need to get that game so errors missing textures and script errors dont pop up but its a small price to pay just to get counterstrike source garrys mods community is filled with large maps and mods that are interesting this game is amazing so i give it a 97100
recommended
its realy fun and creative 1010
recommended
super fun gam its the epic one game
recommended
go ing crazy buy this game

recommended
it doesnt really lie about the level editor that is included with it but it doesnt work the files are there it just isnt set up or something the mappers i talk to use the sdk single player 2013 or what i use the halflife 2 editor to make maps for garrysmod
recommended

recommended
you can make a floating rocket  made out of barrels what more could you want

garrys mod oh garrys mod what can you say i still miss bridge building from 9 seriously what happened and what about watermelon racing that was great so any way its basically a sandbox game anything really goes but theres also gamemode maps and mods some are as fun as putting a fork in your eye others you will instantly love ttt rocks just beware this game attracts trolls like flies to crap
recommended
there are multiple games that can provide endless entertainment but garrys mod is probably the only one that can provide endless means to do so

recommended
this game is the best indie game i have ever tried you can do litrally anything you want its so fun browsing gamemodes like prophunt and ttt i recommand this game
recommended
simplest way to explain this every game that you could ever want shoved into one modable program that constantly gains new people new gamemodes and new mods nearly infinite possibilities with this game all of that amazingness 5$ want to play hide & seek no problem gamemode for that want to use teamwork to uproot the badguys that want you dead gamemode for that want to build things that use physics then proceed to use said thing to kill countless people gamemode for that want to become the mayor of a small town maybe be a hobo a police officer or even a black market dealer gamemode for that maybe you want to fight zombies or even be a zombie gamemode for that or maybe you have more refined tastes and wish to be in control of the gamemode or game you can start a server thats right nothing in this is hosted through steam no random crashes from their stupid servers or maybe you want to do something different something i didnt name i cant possibly know but what i do know is that if you do buy this game you will most definitely get every penniesworth of your money back in amazing memories and friends too just my time playing this game alone says enough over 125 hours in two weeks i give this game a 1010 a d d i c t i n g fing u n miracle e m o r a b l e

garrys mod alot of you have heard of it and some have not now if your new to steam or would like to get a game garrys mod is a great game to get and it has multiple reasons too here are some of the reasons garrys mod should be considered one of the greatest game on steam now in garrys mod its not your tippical if misspelled sorry l  famous sometimes irratating first person shooter that everyone seems to love its more like a mix between first person shooters building games and even action or adventure with certain maps really which i seem to enjoy more and more now moving onto one of the great things about it as said erliear \ you can download maps or weapons of your choosing like me and my brothers play this game and enjoy building things testing them out and crashing them and then fighting some but im loving it anyway garrys mod has a unlimited amount of things to so in it but in this area im going to talk about the bad things about it as much as the game is good it has alot of annoying or mean players or frustrating things like one for me is when you need to get something you dont want to get certain things to work like the errors they get me mad but im not going to rant much more on a more perfect game like garrys mod not i hope you read my next review about etiher unturned terraria payday the hiest team fortress 2 or hopfully primal carnage if i ever get it to work end

addicting as
recommended
its the best around never ever gonna let you down
recommended
if you like random shizz this game is for you
recommended
this games great but its annoying that you need loads of source games to support the graphics
recommended
this isnt a game this is a lot of games in one also you can be a bag of chips 1010
recommended
great game with no real limits
recommended
great game at first you have to figure out the controls but after play games such as cod zombies trouble in terrorists town and much much much more great graphics for a 5$ game
recommended
this game has everything
recommended
by far the most creative game d
recommended
i have read the negative reviews for this game and i have to say i can agree with some points but not all if you are going to get this it certainly is recommended that you have cssource for textures those who complain about 10 year olds in every server do what we do play with friends its not hard get hamachi and make your own server your rules your players no ing needed fact is solo its fun playing with friends in really any gamemode is fun its complicated building crap at first but its a fun trial and error sort of thing i love it like i said if you have problem with pretweens just do yourself a favor and make your own server privately with friends sidenote get the parkour mod it makes the game a lot more fun just saying 
recommended
this wouldnt be as fun without all the mods available and theres loads of them and even without the mods it still has a lot to offer
recommended
garrys mod well lets see to start off if you have steam and are running it on a fairly decent computer theres no reason you shouldnt have this game with the flood of repetitve garbage and filth thats been on the shelf recently and no real innovation in the video game industry its nice to see something like this when i first started playing gmod i didnt exactly see much out of it for me it was just a way to play something with a few friends from time to time nothing special but the more time you put into this game the better it becomes gmod is not as much a game but a community creating things and working together to have a good time the thing that makes gmod so great is the extreme diversity it holds it isnt bounded by a certain gamemode or a certain montra or anything gmod thrives on its community and it isnt lacking on that at all with a large and expanding community workshop and dozens of modes varying from darkrp where you can set up drug cartels and bust criminals to prop hunt where hide and seek is taken to another extreme involving the hiders playing as actual ingame props what other games have you played or that have come out recently that have any kind of game model like this none because it isnt exactly something that you can compete with gmod is its own genre in that respect making it something worth looking into constantly on sale and only $10 to begin with its a wasted opportunity not to have this and if you dont have it you should definitely look into it
recommended
dont have it for very long but it is by far the most fun entertaining and ridiculous game ive ever played 2110
recommended
the amount of hours played for me says it all
recommended
this is by far one of the most fun games i have ever played ive spend countless hours in dark rp and ttt the only con for me is the source engine which usually crashes when loading have fun
recommended
its awsome me and bro get a car and a ropen and a chair and we attach it to the chair and on to the car
recommended
not much you can say about gmod i like it its pretty cool everyone on steam has it and if you dont then youre probably new here look everyone has gmod dont be a lone rebel just buy it and  around on it when youre bored
recommended
aw man this is this greatest of the games that you can ever play although it has many bugs and problems it still is very fun
recommended
i love this game
recommended
garrys mod a great game for everyone to playhas good graphics lots of fun gamemodes my favorites are zs and sandbox and lots of things to doeven if its just shooting npcs randomlyits really fun to play with others tooi think all my friends and everyone who gos on steam netowrk should get this game
recommended
awesome chat
recommended
instant fun and hours of entertainment not a bad word to say about this game
recommended
out of all the games i ever played this has got to be the most enjoyable and creative i have so much fun playing this for hours on end because i can do whatever i want the workshop is filled with mods that you can download onto your game and use the mods are downloaded with a click of a buttion and to me the gameplay never gets old to sum it all upi rate this game 500 silly ragdolls out of 10
recommended
this is the best steam game for making videos or just messing around with friends i would say everyone should have this game in there library must buy
recommended
love the game
recommended
omg one of the best games i have ever played when you get bored just download some random crap d
recommended
very confusing at first but after a while and some youtube videos you get the basic hang of it for some reason i cant join servers though so thats a downside but still a fun and awesome game
recommended
garrys mod is a sandbox game with many variations that you can add later this game offers things such as trouble in terrorist town were you find yourself either being innocent a detective or a terrorist as a terrorist you have to find yourself sly ways to kill innocents without others knowing detectives find themselves using dna scanners to see if they can find anything on corpses to lead them to the killer innocents are the most common and have to try not to get killed but can also kill also prop hunt is another gamemode you can download either an object running around trying to find a hiding spot from the hunters trying to kill you aside from these two gamemodes there are many more although i have played this game a lot it could take you hours to dowload the game then get all the addons that servers requiere to play although onces getting into a lobby you like and talking to other players you can get addicted easily unfourtuanatly i have to give this a 7 out of 10 for all of the time it takes to play the game
recommended
really fun and entertaining
recommended
its gmod
recommended
if your looking for endless posibilities you cant look further than garrys mod this is the king of sandbox the physics are top notch the glitches not many are so hillarious my sides hurt after ive stopped playing and cannot possibly give this a higher recommendation it is an a amzing game and the community is actually pretty decent wow thats a first for multiplayer games so buy it now especially when it on special
recommended
this game is basicly hd minecraft
recommended
this game described in 1 word derp
recommended
lol boner manipulatoe box
recommended
this game is like masturbating with a metal spoon ill elaborateits cold annoying but in the end you always get that satifaction once i was playing this game with my sexually confused friend and i realised just how sht the servers are but after connecting it is fun to mess around amongst weird 7 year old children who need mental help anyway i recommend it for cronic masturbators and creepy 7 year olds alike
recommended
what can one say about this game the programming and creating aspect is like minecraft for serious gamers you can make anything you want if you know how to do it the multiplayer community is honestly not very mature but if you enjoy making jokes and being crazy over a microphone to possible terrorists and pedophiles then buy this game with friends it is incredibly addictive and fun and you can choose from so many different scenarios that it will never get old all in all it is worth buying and even if you dont get on public servers you should be able to log at least 10 hours
recommended
it is awesome there are so many game modes trouble in terroist townsandbox and more it has no rules no aims or any objectives there is also addons and mods from top _ to bottom including new veichlesweapons and more there are player models from characters in half life 2 and more addons for thoose sandbox is my favorite game mode
recommended
its fun to get kicked out of a server by a 4 year old
recommended
this game is about finding the right community once you do that its an amazing game if you cant find the right community its just okay
recommended
very fun sandbox you can do everything and more
recommended
very good sandbox game it really is the best
recommended
this is a good game its a litle bit of everything their is murdertttgmod towerand sandbox they are all fun the community is the best part of this game without workshop this game wouldnt be fun so you should buy it i hope you have fun 
recommended
gmod is the best game ever
recommended
garrys mod is a very fun and old physics playground i have played over 200 hours of this and have gotten tons of user made addons to my gmod toolbox to add to my gameplay experience and i love it garrys mod overall is a very fun physics sandbox that allows pretty much anything to happen excellent ai amazing physics and overall fun a few bugs and things sometimes the steam cloud crashes and you temporarily lose your addons also lan servers are very buggy and it is nearly impossible to host a lan game even with logmeinhamachi there is no censor at all there is global voice chat on servers so be warned and sometimes people upload innapropriate things to the addons and dupes tab a few things with physics are buggy but very few things conclusion overall garrys mod is very fun addicting entertaining great physics simulator and so on i would deffinetly recommend this game totally worth 10 usd although some things can be a bit buggy if you can get this i say buy it and it is a really big score if you happen to catch this while it is on sale
recommended
super fun but dont get alot of addons bucause it will crach
recommended
good for building great for server fun not so good for friendships 810
recommended
$ 3 and there are maps if you dont like building
recommended
this game is amazing funny and completly awesome when in sandbox
recommended
i cant stop playing this game its to addicting someone help me d
recommended
the only way you wont like garrys mod is if you put something in it that you dont like to begin with gmod is the best game because its every game ever whether you make maps or download others you can play full game modes of whatever your heart desires on any map imaginable nothing gets better literally than a fully open source game which i cringe at callng it one because its really just a base with endless amounts of opportunities no objectives unless you set one and no purposes unless you build one  open your mind and let it run wild 1010
recommended
this game doesnt need a full review in fact it is a must have for steam so get it
recommended
this game justthis game if you want to do anything in the source engine for the love of all that is good and holy buy this game its $10 normal price you can play ttt sandbox morbus rp and a whole load of other gamemodes all for free its seriously one of the best games ever
recommended
most awesome thing evar
recommended
the single greatest 10 you will ever spend on a video game it is a sandbox game meaning there is no objective there is no goal you cannot lose and you for sure cannot win ive had this game ever since i bought steam ive currently accumulated over 2700 hours on this game and you will find out why anything can be done in this game anything if you were ever to buy a game in your life you would buy this and then you would buy it for your friends like i did buy it 1010 100100 10001000 this is the greatest game ever programmed
recommended
its fun cause you get to kill people on yachts and speedboats you can fight off zombies you can build a house with anything you want you can have nyan cat gun d you can build a secret base and make your car how you like it you can go swimming and fight sharks you can go skydiving and die you can kill your friends d
recommended
the sandiestboxiest sandbox game ever made
recommended
this is a must have for anyone who owns steam this only adds to the experience 1010 plus the gamemodes are mostly great and will add hours of fun along side the sandbox mode would recomend
recommended
great game amazing fun with friends in sandbox and with all the different game mode it make a hard to beat game
recommended
gmod quits out to the steam page at last second of loading single player
recommended
this is the best game ever made dd
recommended
this game is amazing you can do anything in it
recommended
this is the best game in the world cant find anything better
recommended
this game the the game that everyone has if youre a gamer you have this game and if you dont have it itll appear you wont even remember you bought it
recommended
great game much fun
recommended
very cool game this is a sandbox game that is infinitly customizeable with great online unfortunatly if you dont own counter strike source this probably isnt worth getting because most addons and weapons for online requires it otherwise get this with css if you dont have it but if you already do get it by its self
recommended
very good love the workshop
recommended
remains one of the greatest games on steam
recommended
this game just goes on and on
recommended
you can not possibly call yourself a pc gamer if you do not have this game
recommended
garrys mod is an awesome sandbox game with lots to do in singleplayer should you get bored theres plenty to do online  a must have for pc gamers
recommended
this game is part of my life
recommended
you can kill people with melons
recommended
i have been playing garrys mod for a while know and i just want to say it is amazing if you like a game that has alot of gamemodes for one game this is the game it not just one game you can do alot of  with it it is more fun if you have friends to play it with because not all of the garrys mod people are nice but other than that this is a very good game i give it a 1010 should buy if you got the money
recommended
like skyrim but with absolutely everything you want ign 1110
recommended
its a fun game i like it wanna be freinds
recommended
hillarious fun with friends and alone lots of gamemodes to choose from 1010
recommended
1010 would bang limitless game i still have no ing clue what im doing buy it
recommended
im just here for the pillar of communitybadgethingy great game10
recommended
this game is fun to play alone and with friends this is the game i played the most and i havent regret anything there are alot of gamemodes you can choose from i would highly recommend this game 3 shoutout to my umbrella crew ametius
recommended
pretty good
recommended
i highly recomend this game for any style of gamer it has many difftrent game mode each so diffrent hundrends of servers to choce from on most game modes also uses the sorce engine so any sorce game you have will add its items to it so if you have lots of sorce games you get lots of more content 3
recommended
great game unlimited possibilities there are many many gamemodes most common are ttt darkrp prophunt murder sandbox and so on if i listed every gamemode this would go on a mile long this game offers unlimited customization with thousands of user created addons in the workshop great game to play with friends too
recommended
good game for having fun with ur friends and getting them  off in some mods 
recommended
as garrys mod is a noncampaign sandbox game the possibilities are endless there are so many game mode you can download and play with your friends only downside  i recommend getting counter strike source for the full game expierence
recommended
one of the best games to play with or without any friends there are almost an endless possibilities you can do as playing some of the more well known game modes such as prop hunt murder sandbox or ttt trouble in terrorist town also if you dont like the first server you visited there are hundreds more and even if you tried one it doesnt mean you tried them all i would suggest getting css counter strike source because there are a lot of servers that use maps that have css in them and it would be a lot easier to have the game for the textures but it is not required as in there are a few servers that are noncss where all their maps dont need css at all
recommended
very fun game when your bored this is the game to play
recommended
wanna make art history and much more get gmod wanna have 10 fps per second for spawning too many props get g actually thats bad but anyways get gmod wanna be a part of soil get gmod need to shoot some sht get gmod wanna play every game in existance get gmod wanna get 1000000 health from eating burgers get gmod fat guy wheezing in the background dont have enough melons get gmod its the most fun in the park  circus dude 1990something butterscotch pudding1get gmod wanna torture ragdolls with extreme faceposing get gmod ambiguous laughter wanna make a video that only over 9000 people have already get gmod wanna ok you know whats next so lets just say get frickin gmod

garrys mod is a extreamly addictive game it shows that any game can be popular even mods from a already existing game not only is garrys mod a great game in single player but is growing with popularity in multiplayer with a easy way to make survers to play with your friends it has also been liked by many youtubers showing off the newest and greatest mods of today those youtubers showing off those mods have inspired others to make there own creations overall i give it a 910 for its superb effort to keep it updated and smoothness
recommended
simply stuning especialy for those with minds of creativity
recommended
this game is really good just get it if you havent already you will love it d
recommended
this game will last for an eternity the amount of amazing addons people are creating will keep this game alive for years
recommended
it makes my  tingle with delight
recommended
positives 1 not very cpu intensive unless you make it which i have found relatively difficult to do 2 great pricing 3 great for playing with friends 4 you can imagine it you can build it 5 possibly others i forgot about negatives 1 can get boring in single player relatively quickly but if you have friends to play with that is an easy fix 2 when using the easyweld function of the weld tool sometimes the objects will launch across the map nothing major with that one though 3 a lack of an official ingame tutorial but it is somewhat easy enough to figure out by reading the hints 4 possibly others i forgot about overall graphics 8710 gameplay 9510 edit be sure to note that i did not review the community as this is meant to be a review of the game not the people who play it
recommended
such a fun game so many things to do in it
recommended
great game 1010 pros can be what ever you want it to be zombie survial got it roleplay got it flying dinos in cars got it with the workshop this game has so much potential cons does tend to crash overwolf for teamspeak cuases this for me so no point reduct other wise good game and if you dont like 5 yr olds screaming on mics go to mature servers and or stay away from the gamemodes big youtubers play
recommended
this game was confusing to me at first but after i figured it out it was the best game ive ever played seriously if you pass this up your not the brightest itll keep you hooked for hours and never gets repetive this game is a crime if you dont mod it half to death but with the right mods and some friends gathered round youll have endless hours of fun i recommend this game 1210 its cheap and fun buy it and give it a try and if its not your style just dont play it
recommended
1 game on steam
recommended
september 7 2014 on this day in history an army of zoidbergs armed only with crowbars attacked a legion of colombine soliders on a rooftop they were cut down in the name of batmans amusement 1010
recommended
i think this a great game because it has so much versitality and you do anything you wantwhy not buy a game that has got so many good reviewplus its only $10 to get thats pretty cheap to me
recommended
ive had a bunch of fun playing this game with some friends its not great alone but if youve got 23 friends to play with you its a ton of fun
recommended
this game is a really great game to play by yourself or even if you have any friends like you would but if you do then you can play with them in different gamemodes like prop hunt sandbox and even murder you can get addon which make you get more thing so you can make and blow up
recommended
this is the best sandbox game in the worldthere is many mode you wont get bored forever
recommended
this game is fun after a couple of games really fun if you have other friends who play it
recommended
play with friends is the best of the best 1110
recommended
i love this game
recommended
i spawned a fnaf foxy npc and it ran after me best game physics ever seriously if you have the money then scroll back up and buy it im serious
recommended
great for trolling your friends and having a good time thumbs up
recommended
awsome game totally worth the money and will run on most systems
recommended
an awesome game for people who like physicsbuildingor just screwing around with npcs faces you have freedomto do pretty much whatever and the workshop is amazing there are so many awesome maps player models models sweps npcs ragdolls etc overall 1010 for being an awesome casual game also if you want something more competitive there are gamemodes like trouble in terrorist town
recommended
honestly is there a way to describe this game i can only say this you can do whatever you want i think that is 100% enough to explain this game hop in a server and well do whatever 1010 recommended
recommended
this should be a greenlight and for you people out there if you have problems like textures or models enter in right click on that steam game go to properties launch options enter dxlevel 81 for team fortress 2 dxlevel 90 to see spawn menu q press e and move mouse to rotate objects or ragdolls without having to jump like a monskey everywhere and its usually used in movies of gmod press c top left corner to turn of the blue beams and halo if you are trying to make a movie its fun you can get along with people very easily and badges and trading card are allso easy so thats just stuff to refresh you memory and i highly recommend this game like when you cannot play a certain game because youre graphics card doesnt support it well you can just download all of that from steam workshop p3@c3 0ut
recommended
you can shoot things 1010
recommended
this is te lief 
recommended
fantastic game really fun
recommended
get garrys mod the first thing you do on steam is get gmod so many hours you can play i have stayed up for like 3 days playing this game on darkrp cwhl2rp ect their are 100  gamemodes and all of them are fun even plane old gmod is fun also if you have a crappy pc look at the reqier ments rip bf4 1 get it now  now
recommended
a good game with endless hours of fun filled with good people had more things in it then i thought it would
recommended
i made shrekspam 42010 amazing game gotm game of the millennium
recommended
if your looking for a game full of randomness and lots of other things this is the game for you sure for alot of content you need counter strike source but its still a wonderfull game
recommended
this game is everything and nothing create what you want or enjoy what you see
recommended
its garrys mod first you start off by finding inventive ways to kill npcs and eventually you end up with with a partturretpartcarpartwiremod death machine that you eventually crash the game with then theres multiplayer which you can do anything from what you do in single player to running around as a cup while laughing like a maniac just buy this game already you know you want to 
recommended
good game for building stuff and great for a party
recommended
old man in a canbanana planemagic train all sorts of creepy yet awesome thiiiiings the words for this game cant be easily expressed seeing as the community for it is so vast in numbers everyday new models and items are uploaded to the gmod workshop for people to upvote and experiment with whether it be an atomic bomb or a giant robot which shoots rockets i can assure you that it will amuse you the little things in life can sometimes be the most appriciated the multiplayer is even better than single player in my opinion ttt being the best prophunt being a close second what is ttt it is a game mode where you are a terrorist these guys are surprisingly innocent however you have to watch out for the traitors who could shoot you in the face at any given moment in time the detectives however are on the case with health dna tools that let them find the traitor and a variety of special weapons in some servers but beware the traitors may or may not have the dreaded prop cannon or melon gun which can kill you in one hit now dont get me wrong the traitors may seem overpowered with a lot of 1hit ko weapons but it is all in fun especially when a traitor somehow manages to completly fail and kill himself my word of advice for beginners to a gamemode such as this do not randomly kill all servers have mods or admins who will ban you if you get on and begin to rdm random death match innocents traitors and detectives this isnt fun for others and will likely end up with you never being able to play on that server again i could go on and on about what is so great about this game but i suggest that you just find out for yourself a word of forwarning however it would be best if you bought the gmod and counterstrike source pack if you want to play ttt there are patches to play as well but i find it an honest waste of time get in and play join the fun that is gmod in all its glory
recommended
good with friends or on lonely tuesday nights best with mods only people with imagination should buy this
recommended
a must have for all pc gamers
recommended
great game fun the addons make it extra fun such things like cars from gta v and guns from both cod ghosts and bf4
recommended
plz read my hours this game has every fawking thing you want roleplayyes detective games yes racing  hell yeah and plenty more and do i have to explain more
recommended
this game is awsome you can shot things kill things you can build a house or build a tank and you can build a toilett you can ing do everything ing buy it dc nfvddegfds
recommended
this is just one of those games you can play for hours on end and wont get bored there are soo many gametypes for this game for example some of the most popular at the moment are murder trouble in terrorist town jailbreak gmod tower sandbox hl2 and darkrp and many more  and there are always new gametypes being added if you buy this game i highly recommend buying and installing counterstrike source aswell because the majority of gametypes use the skins guns and objects from source do this to avoid annoying error signs you can also have alot of fun offline aswell you can almost build anything in this game from a speedy car to rocket ship the steam workshop support aswell is amazing for this game it is a breeze to download things from workshop for example you can download cars tools maps and even a fully functioning dinosaur as i once did i recommend this game to anyone looking to have good fun
recommended
garry mod is one of valves best games in my opinion although you need counterstrike for some textures its one of my favorite games i recommend it for all gamers
recommended
its the only game that you can do everything you want make a fort a tower and lots of stupidity that looks better on singleplayer
recommended
its an okay game i played it for a little bit and had some fun couldnt see playing it for very long though
recommended
one of my friends said this game was boring i have 1 less friend 1010 would destroy another friend with the power of the internet
recommended
its so much fun enteracting with the lively community which is 95% 12 yearold furries in rp servers all of which who have microphones and an affinity for fluttershy that theyre happy to tell you more about
recommended
pretty damn good sandbox game multiplayer gamemodes for just about everything from roleplay to dayz modding ability which is no doubt implyed by the name is amazing the only problem i have with it is my insane connecting time to just about any server then again that might just be that im on os x and with australian internet anyway get it or bob will kill you 
recommended
garrys mod is a gametool worth more than the money you payed for it you neet to have mods and know how to use it well to fully enjoy it
recommended
its garrys mod so its awsome the only problem is havin to buy other games to have textures so basically if u only buy gmod then the game will be all eroors and no fun but if u get cs and tf2 plus half life then the game will be amazin and u will play it for ages becus of all the dif game types u can play over all its worth it even tho u have to spend around 30 pound to have textures to play everything it doesnt matter the game is fun and time will just pass by with ease if u let it so id suggest buyin it

my review wow there are a lot of things to say here garrys mod can be good or bad depending on how you look at it there are serious roleplay servers for the coop fans there is hl2 campaign coop no kidding there are zany and wacky minigames to play with friends and for the creative types there is sandbox mode the main mode of the game you can shoot each other trap each other build with each other become a famous youtuber like every other person in the world build cars and crush your enemies skulls get a gore mod and slice your most unfavorite characters ever like ever and the list goes on final verdict this game is worth every poundbuckeurowhatever you could buy it with you should get it any chance you have
recommended

recommended
awsome game where you can download things like tanks choppers army people and a lto of other stuff d
recommended
you can be godzilla destroyed tokyo10 ign
recommended
garrys mod defines the word customization because of all the mods that shape it otherwise still a great sandbox with awesome games to go along with them this is truly a gem for those who want a good creative sandbox game with pretty much everything and anything able to be put in the game however after a while it does get boring and also with pretty small inventory space so if i were to rate it id say 910
recommended
hundreds of different gamemodes each for every different person if you like different kinds of roleplay gmods got it if you like team deathmatch games gmods got it if you like to spice up your life with some mystery ttt murder prop hunt yeah gmods got it do you want to build a rocket in a mans  and send him flying across the map with his  blaster rocket gmods got it do you want to pit dozens of ai against each other until the last man stands victor whom you then fight to the death against your creation gmods got it you like making cool cinematic photosmovies gmods got it with thousands of maps to spawn wheel after wheel of heavenly cheese across every inch until your insatiable lust for such fine cheese is won over yeah we really like cheese up in this mofo so ladies and gentlemen get gmod because it will be one of the best things you have ever done and get cssource because fck salt youll need it kids

its a sandbox editorso you can pretty much do anything you want with the source engine even go online and play many different game modes that the community has made like zombie survival racing even a quake 3 arena mod<<< now that mode took me back to the hardcore days theres even a cinema game mode or some sort where players can get together and watch a bunch of random youtube or other video sharing site at the same time and that was a very interesting experience in my point of view you can pretty much do anything with the source engine nowadays so yea buy this game and have fun theres really no rules here
recommended
great game and learning tool
recommended
this game is amazing the character interaction all the different game modes and so much more if you are thinking about getting this game get it its totally worth the 10 bucks
recommended
the sandbox for this game is simply amazing the number of things you can make and the creativity involved is simply astonishing the other gamemodes for this game can turn a sandbox game into a fun fps ttt murder jailbreak etc are some of them and the addons you can add make the games even more fun this may soon become my favorite game
recommended
one of the best games on steam worth it get it and have a lot of fun my felo gamers
recommended

garrys mod is the most addictive game i have ever played i admit the graphics arent next gen but the gameplay experience is incredible there are hundreds of different gamemodes out there ranging from a sandbox in which you can build just about anything to dark roleplay in which you can roleplay as one of many different things in a town or city that is full of people playing their roles but if you are not into building stuff or roleplaying then there are many other gamemodes such as ttt were players have to find a traitor and kill him by using a mixture of detective skills and shooting skills and the traitor has to kill everyone before they kill him jailbreak in which prisoners in a high security prison can either play nice and listen to the gaurds or try to kill them and escape the jail there are many more gamemodes murder prop hunt stop it slender etc to sum up basically whatever type of game you are into whether it be horror shooting roleplay anything this game is for you cmon lets not forget its not really expensive either now is it  highly recommend this game
recommended
this game has almost anything you want it also has alot of modes to play so you can play this game for hours without getting bored for even one second really good game that is worth buying

gmod is a game where you can do anything
recommended
pretty much reason why im using steam one of the best games i ever played even though its a mod the number of gamemodes and addons this has is just amazing musthave for any gamer that likes creativity and freedom
recommended
ok lets be truthful here this has to be one of the most fun games i have ever played in my life there are endless servers and game modes and it doesnt stop there you can mod and make your own gamemodeshost servers positives this game has so many gamemodes this game can bring your creativity out to a new limit if you like to buildrolepayplay mini games conversate this is a game for you there are gamemodes such as dark rp and ttt these two game modes are the 2 most well known they are so fun and dont ever get boring the game never stops with new stuff the community has so many things they add all the time and it will never have a limit negetives the community is one of the worst communities i have seen it has so many people but most of them consider them selfs to be trolls if you have a squeeky voice or do not like cussing and negetive attitude i would turn voice chat off and type witch would be hard and ruin the game there are some people on this game who are nice and dont care what age you are but most of the people on this game are stuck up  who make fun of everyone and try to annoy i will be honest there are lots of screeming 10 year olds who run around not knowing what there doing and ruining the game for everyone so the only thing bad about this game i would say is the community conclusion the game itself is great you will have lots of fun and never get bored i can promise you that so i would definitley recommend this game the only bad part like i said was the fact that the community tries to make you commit suicide 90% of the time but like i said again there are nice people and the game is very entertaining out of the 1000 hours of this game i have played it has been the most fun i have had on steam

this game is amazing well i could say games since its filled with diffrent kind of servers in which you can do different stuff like rp roleplaying ttt trouble in terrorist town and many others i would say get this game for an amazing fun for hours and hours on end the only bad thing about it is you should get css counter strike source since many server need it for textures modles and other stuff 9510 must get

recommended
i personally find this to be a great way to spend my time though it is has problems like every other sandbox bad dupe systems annoying server organization incredible lag at some points i find gmod always brings something new to the table as well as having a great community and many many game types it will definitely eat away at your time and cause a little frustration here and there but yeah 910 okay okay one more thing dont buy the damn game until steam has one of their giant sales on counterstrike source and half life 2 otherwise its a bit expensive or youll be missing a whole bunch of textures

recommended
huhcant believe i havent written a review on this game yet well here it goes garrys mod is a physics sandbox unlike regular games there arent any predefined aims or goals you are given the tools and leave you to play you spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions  whether thats a car a rocket a catapult or something that doesnt have a name yet  thats up to you if youre not too great at construction  dont worry you can place a variety of characters in silly positions there are also a large variety of game modes as well like trouble in terrorist town where there are innocent terrorists and traitor terrorists the traitor must kill all the innocents before the innocents find out who the traitor is stop slender where players are to roam around a map collecting eight pages but there is one player who takes control of slenderman his goal is to kill everyone looking for pages there are a whole variety of gamemodes but itll take me forever to go through them all garrys mod is a fun sandbox game which allows you to do and construct whatever you like heres a score for what i think 910 now excuse me i need to construct my top secret scientific titanium plated rocket ship ps this game includes thousands of mods for your enjoyment hence garrys mod

within this game you are a gamer playing as your favorite video game character within some abandoned video game sanctuary youve pretty much completed every objective of the main game and now you are bored you must find a way to occupyentertain yourself for the remainder of your precious free time here in the universe with this i find it to be no surprise that we humans have come to thrive with life in such desolate austere environments as we have within the confines of our reality here on earth we like the players within this indolent game we call life start from nothing and sprout out of the vain emptiness with life like wildflowers after rain and make amazing things with our tools as human beings it is with this simple sandbox game that we humans are able to truly contemplate the reality of our ingenious resourcefulness and the fullest extent of our creative capabilities as we like artists of blank canvasses create astonishing works out of nothing finding valuable amusement within the vain emptiness of the blank slate that is what life is to be and is what this game is to give the user
recommended
this game is so much fun with friends there is almost an unlimited amount of entertainment you can get from this game

given most of the time a players creativity the allowance to make your own gamemodes and mods to this game even maps npcs weapons and even those with special functions events and coding its entirely up to the players creativity to how much this game would yield its worth you create your own world in this game or you play others creations this is what some would call the greatest sandbox to have and in most cases theyre right cause i end up preferring this game more than another wellknown sandbox named minecraft ive still yet to get bored of garrys mod

garrys mod is one of the best games ive ever played in my life ive been playing this game since 2008 i think i cant really remember but i know i have played it a  ton and i recommend you to get it there are always new mods addons map etc made by the community the people who play this game put hard work into making this game even more enjoyable this is why it never gets boring the community keeps adding on to it to keep this game up and running also lets not forget those people who deal with keeps up with servers this is a community based game where you dont have to pay for stupid things like exspanion packs news maps people make it for free anyway enough about the people who add on to the game the community of players who play this game is the straight definition of the internet the people who play this game are random funny and will make you laugh your  off the people who have been playing a long time atleast players are always coming up with things to get others hyped up and having a good time on the game mod that they are playing on now those were the main things i love about garrys mod ps if you dont have a since of humor are uptight or anything like that dont play this game unless your staying in single player

anyone craving creativity well buy garrys mod its a fun and charming game and can do what no other game can do as of 2014 and plenty of other game modes to keep you busy for hours but if you truly want to like this game in sandbox set up a project if you dont you wil probably get bored in the first five minutes i hope this review helped

i dont know why this game exists but i love every second of it garrys mod was recommended to me by friends and despite being put off by its rather vague description of a sandbox game where you have to download more things in it and its somewhat wacky screenshots i caved in sold all of my team fortress 2 items and bought it and ive not regretted it once this game is difficult to grasp theres no denying that but when you join a public server and see a load of half life characters flying around the map with big blue laser guns attached onto team fortress 2 props and characters and then get a message that the server has crashed think to yourself how much fun people are having with this game it does exactly what it claims it gives you the tools and leaves you to play and anything can be done in this game you can have a battle with another player make a horseless headless horseman sit on a sofa and watch tv dangle dr isaac kleiner from a mann co crane or even slaughter teletubbies while escaping the clutches of freddy fazbear and friends on an imperial star destroyer there are no limitsuntil the game crashes which will happen so be mindful of what you spawn in this game takes patience lots of it so give it theres no telling what monstrocities or works of art you might end uo making just find a friend of someone willing to expain it to you or even make your own discoveries in this magical world of balloonicorns vortigaunts and metal gears 1010

garrys mod is a creative singleplayer and multiplayer sandbox game you can do a lot of things from making fantastic working machines to just having fun by posing ragdolls around what i really love about garrys mod is that you can download over 150000 mods weapons ragdolls skins maps the list goes on and on when you start garrys mod you can either do singleplayer where you can choose a map to be in and make stuff and do a ton of other things or you can do multiplayer where you can grab a few of your friends and play on a sandbox server and have fun together or you can find new friends and go play prop hunt or trouble in terrorist town or a lot of other game modes i would recommend this game to pretty much every creative person or even people who just want to blow stuff up there is so much to do on garrys mod that you wont run out of things to do theres constantly new addons to get well i hope this review helps you choose whether or not you want to get this game or not if you find this review helpful please leave a thumbs up
