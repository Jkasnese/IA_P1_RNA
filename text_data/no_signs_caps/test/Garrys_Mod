so lame you need to own another game for a game that cost money what i liked lots of different gamemodes you cant get anywhere else what you need to know dont know how to play any mode read you need to own counter strike source to get rid of texture errors its a game where you make your own fun but has gamemodes if you dont seems like alot of kids play this game no seriously its all kids god damn kids are so annoying my score c paid $3 completed in

the game is just an accidental gem yet the dev stand for paid workshop and he never really did anything for the game since forever the game havent been innovative in any way for along time not a surprise with rust too better fixing rust too before adding paid workshop to gmod
