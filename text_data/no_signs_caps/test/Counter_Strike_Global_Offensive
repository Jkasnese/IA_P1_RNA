if csgo was a girl id date her and  her a lot then after that get frusterated because of things she does that doesnt make sense but still be with her then wed have sex again when were in bed id be killin it ontop but when shes ontop i just absolutely hate it as she dominates me after that wed get into a fight about who was better that round and wed always end the fight at a negative note the next day id start talking to her again and the cycle goes on and on csgo is the equivalent to an abusive relationship 1010 would recommend just because being ontop feels pretty good in this game

i first came to cs from tf2 and a couple other single player games being recommended it by a few of my online friends i expected a badly made generic shooter filled with gimmicks to keep the player interested and a pay to win sort of system i recieved an absolutely amazing game with lots of depth and an insane amount of skill and strategy involved at first i found the amount of effort skill and stategy you have to put into player positioning and things of that nature was just astounding and unlike any other game i had seen before i took a massive liking to this type of game and started playing more and more at first you will have difficulty understanding these things but putting more time and effort into the game will show results quickly i just wanted to do a review of this game as i believe csgo is truly great and unlike any other game out there thanks for reading envy

i purchased this game on release day and played it for about three hours it was absolute crap and i uninstalled it fast forward almost one year and my friend recommended i try it again well ive got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from its release version the game is basically 16 with improved graphics and mechanics while it still needs work in many areas the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $1499 if youre a long time cs player like me beta 1 and dont have this game yet add me to your friends list and well reminisce about the old days and maybe ill throw a copy your way

counterstrike global offensive is probably the most balanced fps game in all existence i personally started playing counter strike when source had been out for 23 years or so ive always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat and the fact that the game is all skill there are no unlockables the only things you can earn by playing are stats and skins a pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer thats new to the series other than his skill great engine great servers balanced gameplay smooth gameplay excellently constructed maps stays true to the franchise cheap no unlockables except skins ingame purchases with real money counterstrike global offensive is the best competition style first person shooter valve has ever made so far theres nothing else to the game than multiplayer and the braindead bots this is a must have for all pc gamers if you dont already have the game pick it up now or get it on the christmas sale in a couple of weeks 9510

this modern version of one of the best competitive games of all times does a good job in introducing new players to this highly tactical and skillbased gaming experience if you are a veteran of the old days  csgo might disappoint you it sure looks nice but lacks the precision that made cs 16 so damn good its still a very good counterstrike thoughit may lack some of the community niceties beloved maps and little features of past games but global offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful polished and better looking counterstrike for whoever wants it even if the community doesnt meet the golden standard of 16 and source csgo will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weaponsbrilliant oldschool shooter has convinced us that counterstrike franchise is in no way to be retired or forgottenat the end what matters is not if csgo is innovative or more of the same than cs source what counts is if its fun and csgo couldnt be better in this regard

ill start off by saying that i havent played csgo all that much yet but here are some of my first impressions of the game the actual gameplay is flawless and it offers more than enough customization options to ensure your comfortability with the controls there is also a huge abundance of guns maps and unique game types to pick from im sure a lot of people are discouraged by the extremely high skill cap but i feel that the games increased difficulty relative to other firstperson shooters makes it much more rewarding it is way more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of it  i typically dont pay any attention to the chatvoice communication in multiplayer games such as this but i quietly observed it from time to time for the sake of this review i can tell you that just like in many other games the community can be pretty toxic towards new players and just in general ignore the rage and youll be fine p csgo has a workshop with loads of community made maps that introduce unique gamemodes and styles it goes without saying that this adds hours maybe even days to the replayability and allows you as the player to better customize the way you play and enjoy the game overall its an awesome game and i only wish i had picked it up sooner if you can handle the somewhat toxic community and the high skill cap counterstrike global offensive is the perfect firstperson shooter and i recommend it 
recommended
im probably going to get ripped by veterans due to my low playtime but i felt like csgo deserved a proper review lets hop right into it shall we originally designed as a halflife mod more than a decade ago counterstrike has endured because of its wellbalanced competitive gameplay that requires skill to succeed counterstrike global offensive is a revamped version of the classic firstperson shooter offering some tweaked modes on the same maps that helped define the series those unfamiliar with counterstrike will find the game more a cerebral experience instead of the run n gun arcadestyle action popularized by recent iterations of call of duty in global offensive there is no regenerating health no cinematic storyline no experience points to level up your soldier and no unlockable kits or perks the deterrent for dying is having to sit out and watch as the rest of the match unfolds while this may sound disappointing to those weaned on more contemporary shooters global offensive comparatively pareddown experience is no less thrilling the games focus on teamwork and tactics gives the game a distinctive feel as you choose between four online game types as part of a terrorist or counterterrorist faction classic casual and classic competitive are teambased modes played in multiple rounds the goal in each is to either eliminate the opposition or be the first team to complete a maprelated objective depending on the map and your faction youll either rescue or defend four hostages or either plant or defuse bombs at two specific sites while the goals in both classic casual and classic competitive are the same the differences between the two are primarily in terms of scope a classic competitive game consists of 30 rounds instead of 10 enables friendly fire and has you earning money for kills planting bombs and so forth thats used to purchase armor and defuse kits the casual variant gives you armor and defuse kits automatically the other two modes consist of arms race and demolition arms race which has been adopted by both call of duty black ops and battlefield 3s close quarters expansion consists of a single round where everyone begins with the same weapon each kill automatically changes your weapon until you receive the golden knife the first person that lands the killing blow with the knife wins the round this is the only mode where respawns are possible offering a nice change of pace from the standard modes demolition is a mashup of arms race and classic taking the fixed weapon progression from arms race and including two multiround matches that have you trying to plant or defuse a bomb in a bank safe house and other locales what makes counterstrike global offensive appealing is that it plays differently from its competition tired of jumping assassins in other games jumping here will penalize your accuracy sick of seeing more praying and spraying than in a baptism ceremony then youll appreciate that those who use short controlled bursts while aiming will be more successful if there is one knock on the game its that it offers the same maps as earlier versions of the series giving veterans a huge advantage over new players to offset this the developers included an option to play against bots offline so you can practice each mode and map this will give you a fighting chance against real players but expect to die early and often until you hone your skills and familiarize yourself with the map layouts or course the most important aspect of any multiplayer game is how much you want to play after a session ends this is where global offensive excels possessing the same addictive quality that helped make the previous games a longterm success story shooter fans looking to diversify their library or prove their mettle against a talented pool of players shouldnt hesitate to pull the trigger highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

hey i am going to make a review of the game counter strike global offensive my experice  i have played cs for 2k hours  watchedfollowed the scene for a long time and now some history as well i hope you learn something and maybe even buy csgo after youve read my review  counter strike is an fps game where the only thing that matters is skill aim  gamesense  communication its the opposite of a pay to win game it is true that u can spend how ever much money you want on skins but that will not make you as a player better in game mm  the matchmaking in csgo is good you will get matched up with close to equaly skilled player it is 64 tick servers something that alot of people complain about but most other fps shooters have 16 or 32 tick servers ex cod the biggest problem with mm imo is cheaters as you rank up you will face more and more cheaters valve is working on vac as it has been 4 ban waves a cheat is being detected by vac making everybody using the cheat vac banned very close together skins  skins dont add any value to your character and there is no way to make your character better in any way so it really doesnt matter if you buy them it is going to stick out a big more which makes it easier for enemies to spot but that probably wont make that much of a difference in game so know you think that everything is bad with skins no skins help fund major csgo tournaments 250000 dollar tournaments that are supported by valve they are also very fun to play around with trading and betting with you can make huge profits and huge losses but as i said you dont have to buy them the pro scene  the pro scene is very entertaining to watch and has imo the best layout there are 3 majors every yearmost likely going to be more as time progresses there are also the normal tournaments every once in a while 14 weeks apart usually the pro scene is growing very fast an we will see a 1 million dollar leugue hosted by esl and esea this year misc  there is more to cs than what meets the eye all the strats smokesflashesmolos etc but there is also the surfingbhoping etc side to the game there are servers where you can do lots of other game modes if you get bored playing the normal game which you probably wont as it is very addicting final thoughts  cs is a great game for a low price which will run on your pc its very addicting and fun there is also frequent sales in the steam store i hope you join the cs community gl and hf

its hard to argue that this game is probably the best cs release since 16 some will disagree might argue source is a better game and they will have their own valid points in my opinion this game is a true sequel it brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of cs the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play it mates the old with the new the expectations that a fps be somewhat realistic if not fun to play its a modern game it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later csgo is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series shooting movement sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again weapons now have a purpose  theres a reason to buy the 57 and p250 as well as the mp5 replacement mp7 team play is just as important as the economy once you lose it theres no coming back its a demanding skills based thats as satisfying as any cs title has been pros  updated maps visuals & sounds  emphasis on team play  valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers  extensive customisability & player drops  more realistic player and game behaviour  csgo workshop  pro players  active development and regular updates  listens to community  lowend modern pc requirements for top quality & top resolution cons  gungame isnt the same as css  because of different skills & tactics css players will feel like its a familiar but new game skills are transferrable one way not so much the other when you play css after csgo it will feel and sound like youre playing underwater  sound still seems like an afterthought  you will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something thats playable and looks good ratings graphics 8510 far improved on previous models but theres still room for improvement sound 810 feels like an afterthought if theres one complaint i have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isnt good enough gameplay 9510 excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayability overall 8510 its a great game and could easily be 95 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality its a modern twist on an old classic footnote i lost my way with cs after css and i turned to a variety of other games battlefield 1942214223 tom clancy rainbow 6 americas army 23pg before then i was an avid player of cs and i would play up to 100 hours per month when i played cs 10 years ago i always asked why cant this game be a little more realistic why cant they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air i cant really emphasise how happy i am that a lot of what shouldnt happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals sound and game play has been improved in the first month of playing i managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and ive started contributing back to the community with maps

maybe the only fps where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill no  perks or kill streaks no autoturrets no air strikes if you want to win in counterstrike you have to learn the maps play smart and have fast reflexes since you work for each and every kill its much more satisfying than other current gen shooters its a real shame that the console version isnt closer to the pc version though they could have given cod a run for their $

csgo is a game which was once designed around teambased attacks and defenses something which has since been replaced by weapon reskins and recoil patterns pros very easy to hop into a casual game and enjoy a quick game very easy to join a competitive game and work with a team of nearly equal skilllevels in a longer game with higher tensions new game modes to choose from wide variety of powerful weapons at your disposal betting scene numerous competitive leagues and teams for highly skilled players cons difficult to master weapons and recoil patterns luck plays a considerable role in fights learn a plethora of new insults from teammates conclusion for 15$ its worth every penny

this game is the successor to the original counterstrike aka cs 16 ignore counterstrike condition zero and counterstrike source both those games never blew up as competitively as cs 16 and csgo this game takes tons of practice and patience nobody can just start off doing well you might be decent if you can aim but there are so many factors that come into play determining your skill level compared to your opponents all of the above is true except for when i said nobody can start off doing well i am one of the rare exceptions where i just dominate everything i never lose and have yet to lose maybe someone can tell me how it feels to lose this game isnt fun as much for me anymore because i never lose

counter strike global offensive in itself is a good game we are getting frequent updates from the devs and the player count keeps increase rather than writing a lengthy summary of my opinions of the game i have decided to break it down into two groups of bullet points the good  high skill ceiling but easy to start fps  lots of fun to play with friends  make new friends  many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions  devs connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation needs improvment  visibility hdr  bloom are locked down unlike prior versions  upgraded anti cheat too many hackers in higher elo mm  movement and accuracy modifications  some guns need further tweaking deagle  p90  valve servers need lower var  higher tickrate  overall rating  85  10

counter strike global offensive is a beautiful addition to the counter strike series it being the forth one to be made i believe valve have done a wonderful job but this isnt why im giving this game 1010 its because you can also kill chickens for points in deathmatch 1010 d by far my favourite game in the series
recommended
when counter strike go came out it wasnt very good and the online servers was quite dead but after a year of updates the game have become really good i knew valve and the team behind cs wouldnt let the cs fans down counter strike go offers different gamemodes improved graphics and overall options a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons the competitive scene have grown and i think thats great unlike some other fps cs requires skill and training when the game came out you couldnt customize the weapons very much but now thats possible with thousands of badass looking skins and stuff csgo is really cheap compared to most competitors so im recommending it without doubt

this game has become a great fps in my library i played a cs mod many many years ago tactical ops assualt on terror and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time i finally bought global offensive and ive been impressed everything i was expecting and much more its a simple fps with different modes search and destroy hostange rescue tdm and more i will give you the warning its very difacult to be good at this game the level of compitition is great i honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun i typically play just competitive matches where its a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match it varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life sounds hard right exactly competitive is a blast i highly recomend this game if you like fps and like playing online use stradegy play with friends play with strangers and remember do not play this without headphones if in public place the bomb has been planted is not something you want heard outloud just saying my rating 9510 very awesome game

inspiring video of the rise of counterstrike global offensive httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvywv4oohifom at first i want to point out that ive owned counterstrikeglobal offensive since the very first day but i have not played the other games in the counterstrike franchise just css for less than a year and therefore i do not have much experience from cs 16 and css when i first played the beta i thought it was a joke well i knew that almost all games are bad in beta but this was complete crap it felt like playing some weird css mod the weapons were big and clumsy the recoil was terrible and everything was random anyway i bought the game on the release day played a few hours the game was still crap so i actually uninstalled it to play css the upcoming six months instead one day i got really mad at the css community because every pcw you played there would be either cheaters or players with a higher skill level searching for players in a lower skill level to have some fun after some raging i scrolled through my steam library looking for a game to play and there is was counterstrike global offensive i decided to give it a try and installed the game at first i was quite shocked everything was different the gui the maps the weapons  everything was alot better the game did actually have some feeling now and i enjoyed the game for the first time this was the game i would continue playing every single day for two years during these two years csgo and its community have been through alot there have been many bugs cheating problems scandals within the professional scene and dumb updates but we who still plays the game have made it through and will continue supporting this game and valve and we are looking forward to the day when csgo will be the number one game in the world and at last a tip to whoever reading this dont judge valves moves before you analyze the outcome as an example when valve released the arms deal update the update including skins cases and keys i still remember the reactions some were good and positive but some were angry and attacking many people stopped playing csgo entirely due to their thoughts that csgo had become a child game with skins and such well look where skins brought the game we do now have atleast 3 major tournaments a year more to come alot of new players and a developement team who puts even more effort in making the game as good as possible than ever before thanks for reading this review and im sorry if you think it was too long and that i didnt bring up any pros and cons about the game

basic gameplay you play as either a counterterrorist or a terrorist both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice you can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you on the terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm important boxes anyway once plant wait you patiently for it to explode as a counterterrorist you must eliminate all the terrorist forces or defuse the bomb thus protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction being a honourable opponent terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the cts the chance to slaughter the remaining ts and defuse the bomb ill list some positivenegative attributes of this game here positive attributes   matchmaking  teaches children the harsh reality of gambling although some never seem to learn even after $500 later  ranks  cool looking skins  fast growing population of players  fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often  chickens  high replay value  deathmatch game type i could go into more detail on negative parts of it but that would make this review too long and boring negative attributes  although i do love the single player campaign it could use some work i really wish it were longer and that final boss fight is pretty lame it only lasts around 27 seconds and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you and how his 7 year old could beat you blindfolded  the game mode infernal played on the map de_inferno some people like this game mode however i personally dislike it for those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it ill explain for you it seems like any normal de_ map however the real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego normally its hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map and has the ability to shiftmove around to different locations or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time  demolition also known as jokemode added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every april fools day however some hacker probably that 4_chan guy permanently unlocked it volvo have been working on a fix ever since demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents also no block is enabled and whoa so is team killing the volka strategy you could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins or you could play the game correctly like me here is my strategy   dont buy skins to start with seriously its a waste of money  play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get  wait for a steam sale and invest in as many copies of csgo you can  work your way up to about 5 copies or so but make sure you dont get too many otherwise you wont have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns [note it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops]  keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops  once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have remember to never gamble with opening cases ive made about $100 with this method i think its about time to quit my day job in a whole i do love this game and would recommend to anyone good half good half

csgo is arguably the best counterstrike in the series counterstrikes unique style in the first person shooter genre has made this series a trail blazer among many other shooters csgo carries this mantra and revitalizes the concept with content that is mainly user driven compared to the previous iteration some weapons have been replaced with similar counterparts while the maps have been upgraded and balanced more appropriately admittedly the game was riddled with issues during the early stages but it has matured drastically since its inception owing to valves diligence and community feedback csgos 250000 concurrent players and the ever expanding competitive scene stands testimony to this games successful approach at the heart of this game is the communitys boundless imagination full of custom maps skins stickers and soundtracks that add style to the gameplay additionally to show appreciation to the community valve packages community content into dlc and uses it to support the content creators and fund the competitive scene this game is a must have for the fps fans

really fantastic and balanced game and think about the competetive aspects you could compete  queing up vs fullpremade teams as solo getting kicked out of a ladder game just for fun for having a disconnect even if you have 100 stats if you arent familiar with russian greetings you should inform yourself before joining a game else you would be confused about  bliat vodka vodka your mother is a bieeeep  matchmaking is starting 4vs5 games enjoy your bot  people get random matchmaking bans because they can`t reconnect due to bugs you have to decide what player you are you have 2 options you can be the noob or the hacker as noob you basically have worse than 10 kd as hacker you are above 10kd pretty simple isnt it oh and if you meet people who are master guardian after 20 hours playtime dont be afraid its okay the boygirl is just playing on one of his 37 smurf accounts i can really recommend this game if you live in russia and your iq is below 70 or you love the sound of ongoing 13 yo german gangsterrapper screaming in your ears this game could be for you if you arent sure yet if you should buy this just check out some hacks in youtube which are available for csgo its awesome you see flying people who shoot with homing bullets through 10 walls while screaming in voicechat you are all noobs buhahahahahah and honestly who would want to miss something like that   if the current bugs are taken serious by valve the game might leave beta stage in like 34 years buy it right now

simply the cake of firstperson shooters in my head cs is the purest aimbased shooter the counterstrike series are an absolute classic dating back 12 years and the recipe hasnt changed very much why change what is not broken and valve realized that and made cs global offensive a modernized and communitydriven version of older holy grails like cs 16 and cssource i just had to buy this game for the sake of the good old lanparty days and the lasting effect cs 16 left on me  i am very pleased with what valve managed to do with this game i never knew it was possible but they managed to make the game compatible with all skill levels as opposed to something like lets say cs 16 in which get rekt is the only game mode new players can play what surprised me even more is the fact that they kept the classic feeling of older titles in this series all you have to do is go into the game options and change your crosshair to classic and youre set as i expected from valves legendarily wellmade engines the game is running as smooth as butter on ice the input scheme is astonishingly sharp and for good reason since every single pixel can make the difference here speaking about pixels the graphics are based on the halflife 2 engine and i must say theyre extremely fitting and the very very wellmade maps are the cherry on top nothing distracting here and definitely nothing ugly or out of place its a minimalist approach in my opinion and i absolutely love it no extra filler added in only whats needed as a result the game is optimized as hell for high frames per second flawless gem polish allaround cant really spot any imperfections csgo is really balanced around the players skill level the players aim and his team synergy match making is solid too there is really to complain about in this game if you are losing its because you suck and if you win its because you are a mean welloiled clicking machine i havent really delved too deep into the team aspect of this game but i am really looking forward to the new competitive matches i will get there eventually i just need to get even better than i am now and maybe make some time to play more awesome games like this competition is not absent from this game its overabundant for those who want to seek a challenge youll get it for sure the game modes are plenty as the maps they include the classic terrorists  counterterrorists paradigm and they revolve around the classic plant the bomb rescue the hostages and many more new ones that are just a truck full of fun more casual and more wellknown game modes like deathmatch and such are in the game if you want to shoot something fast i am really surprised by the numerous and awesome community this game constructed and its constantly growing too the players are really friendly and fun to play against from what ive seen good sportsmanship too all in all what it really comes down to is the fun aspect of this game and boy i must say after just a couple of matches i realized i was gonna skip the night just to play some good old cs the game is fun and addictive once you get into it rounds may be short but the replayability is ridiculously good and it scales well with the multiplayer aspect man those headshots are satisfying to land  some tips i gave to a friend and im sure these will be useful for newer players out there in cs basically you have to click on the enemies head before they do while your crosshair is minimized dont shoot unless you have a guaranteed headshot for starters i recommend switchingto one of the dynamic crosshairs in the option menui use classic dynamic now you have an idea where bullets are going try shooting bullets at a wall and see where they hit try full auto try burst try practice mode here without bots in 98% of the situations its good to burst or semi shoot never go full auto controlling recoil is essential you must wait a bit until your crosshair is small before shooting dont forget to use crouchwalk ctrlshift to minimize your crosshair for beginners try crouching when you see a guy and try clicking on his head also never shoot while moving your rekoil is huge and you dont have chances to hit dont forget to put your crosshair at head level always keep it up and close to corners when enemy comes by you only have to move an inch for a headshot play deathmatch at first to train what matters in order 1 aim all weapons are hitscan aim well and use low sensitivity  a huge mouse pad i go 28 cms per 360 degrees 2 reflexes you have to aim accurately and you also have to be fast in doing so no point being able to click on the enemies head if he clicks on yours first 3 map awareness and predictive thinking this is basically your game skill that youve gathered through experience knowing how to be effective on the map knowing where enemies are listening for enemies knowing to take cover knowing when to engage knowing to stay with teammates knowing where to throw grenades  overall this game is absolutely great cant really point anything wrong with it and im really looking forward to spend hundreds of hours on this one in the long run maybe ill uncover some things wrong with it after i play it more and ill surely update this guide buy it especially if its on sale you like fpss especially if youve played and loved the classic ones like cs 16 quake and such you have good aim you like a challenge and you have a competitive nature   910  a sacred beast of a game  counterstrike is a pretty simple game all you have to do is click on their heads  anonymous

counter source global office is a great video game to play on the internet personally i like to play multiplayer more than single player however multiplayer is more difficult because the enemies shoot back i think they should nerf the sniper because people can kill me in one shot even when i buy the helmet this game is very tough but fun i heard that the pros warm up before their matches by playing minecraft so thats what i do too

i must recommend this game it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on css from xfire and 500 hours on csgo i played nonstop competitive cssource in regional championships lans and online leagues and won 4 regional championships with some lan placings heres what i have to say about go csgo is awesome valve delivered here in the end when it was released yeah it wasnt anything special just a pretty cssource but now we have amazing gun skins stickers awesome knives intense major tournaments souvenir packages bracket prediction challenges seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops etc its awesome its a great game to be a part of matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal elo rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close it can never be perfect but back in source you had to wait in an irc channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server etc basically with cssource whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 2060 minutes to get a scrim now it takes about 5 so the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me game play wise each cs as i know them 16 source go has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games but recoil control is one of the biggest you often hear people scream deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch thats the only way to get better well quick point how can you dm to practice when you dont know what your practicing best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game kick the bots and shoot at walls seriously shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns thats the best way to understand how to control and use various guns you need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them about the community yes the flamers and trolls are alive and well but heres the thing ive been around cs a long time ive won 4 regional championships with cssource and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear heres why once you play enough games competitive or otherwise youll hear the same kind of person itll sound like this you guys suck why are you even playing this game or something similar if they are beating you it sounds like this youre such a hacker its so obvious when you beat them the fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally so i carry that over to cs flamers as well some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game and everyone else around them is inferior yet if you beat them you must be a hacker it just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game just dont let it get to you theres no point dont even engage and you wont have many problems its not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat spray at feet get headshot is a notorious saying from outsiders about cs games because cs can be amazingly random sometimes and the roundbyround economy buying guns and items every round and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve but if you understand the groupings i said how to above read guides about strategy like economy management game flow and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just cant stop playing this game counterstrike was the worlds original esport after the championship gaming series went down the cs16 and cssource attention did as well games like starcraft and dota took to the forefront of competitive esports soon after but with the cases skins and major tournaments valve and the cs community have turned csgo back into one of the worlds premiere esports and theres many many reasons why its succeeding as i say its a very exciting game to be a part of right now

counter strike global offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend its a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the source engine to new players csgo may feel a little back to the basics as this game does not have aiming down the sight unlocks attachments perks and killstreaks so its heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks this game does have a ranking system but its different from all the other shooters which ill explain later on but the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked its also a tactical teamplay based shooter so dont even think about buying it if you dont like teamplay only a good team can lead you to victory not a highly skilled lone wolf csgo offers a small variety of game modes those are deathmatch arms race demolition classic casual and classic competitive for those of you who are familiar with cod arms race is called gun game in cod you start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone youll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game whats rather interesting about arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins demolition is a combination between classic ill explain classic later in the review and arms race the goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill youll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs in my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because i never really feel the need to play them theres also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual teamdeathmatch its played 5v5 and all weapons are available except for grenades you play in a team but its every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins whats also interesting about deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points in my opinion deathmatch shouldnt be taken to serious its a good gamemode to improve your aim and i know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but thats in my opinion not the way counter strike is supposed to be played so that leaves classic casual and classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes therefore ill use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes classic consists of the two original counter strike game modes defuse mission and hostage mission in hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists in defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if its planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system youll receive money for all sorts of things playing a round of course the winning team receives more in most cases completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills the kill reward depends on the weapon a rifle or pistol will give you 1 kill reward while an smg except for p90 gives you 2 kill reward a shotgun gives 3 kill reward and a knife gives 5 kill reward while the awp gives only 05 kill reward at the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you dont spend will carry over to the next round so now the differences between casual and competitive in casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins in casual youll receive more money if you lose a round less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300 the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual competitive is played 5v5 and casual can be played 10v10 in competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual in casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and youre not supposed to leave until the game is finished because if you do youll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and ive seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown this is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case youll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair if you play casual youll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and winlose ratio and youll play with people of the same skill level as you theres also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules use community maps or even have completely different game modes i dont spend a lot of time on community servers so i cant tell you more than this in my opinion competitive is the way to play csgo i spend by far most of my time playing competitive casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive if youre new though i advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge why should you do this in casual well competitive is way more serious theres also an option to play against bots if youre new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players the only negative points i can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesnt always works as it is supposed to work and the ranking system has to be improved at the time of writing i am silver elite master fifth rank but some silver elites fourth rank are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players seventh rank are much worse and they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in css are way harder than expert bots in csgo making bot practice less useful over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter i even watch csgo esport its a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks i give csgo a 1010 this doesnt mean the game is perfect of course it can be improved but its based on the fun factor and even though i sometimes hate this game out of pure frustration ill always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it

the only thing this competitive game has that compares to call of duty is its fps aspect and a few of the guns otherwise its an upgrade to the original counter strike 16 and source with a few additional game modes and better graphics what i like about this game above its predecessors is its offline bots the dedicated fans that have been playing cs for multiple years makes the online multiplayer very difficult which is a good thing so what i like about this game is the offline bot mode which allows people who buy this game to enjoy a little pwnage or challenge when they crank up the difficulty to veteran when they cant get it online also everyone has an equal chance not thrown off by prestiging or leveling up which adds balanceoverall its a fun challenging and addicting game  id recommend it to all gamers especially those who enjoy a good fps

what first started as a half life mod became one of the most played games on steamshows how you can really go from nothing to something pros recoil balanced maps well most at least competitive community you can run a game even with a crappy computer with the vac system hackers get what they deserve skill is required community mods a special gun for everyone footsteps strategic in ways such as using flashes and smokes easy to play and get into neutral skins many people will say how skins dont matter and they are opinional but personally who would want to play with default skins no one would use stock skins so valve encourages people to buy keys and gamble away their skins in uncasing and bets i honestly dont know if this is a con or not since valve does encourage people to put more money into skins than the game itself cons hackers smurfs people can be salty debatable if some guns are op overall the game is a fun game and worth your money although if i recommend it you will probably get involved the gambling scheme valve proposed as most people say to me skins are opinion you dont need them to play the game well sir would you enjoy playing the game knowing everyone has better skins than you

so after 1000 hours of this game i know pretty much all i need to know for a review this game is amazing and all but there are a couple flaws i am currently mg1 and it was a long road to get there i had the troubles of when i got on a large win streak i would be on a game i was certain i would rank up then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team all we could do was report them and then get on with our lives then after another long win streak i was about to rank up when i got derankers of course all i could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life then there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs there is a small chance of winning when against a smurf and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank if you can get games with no smurfs derankers or hackers this game is amazing and i enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned i give it a 810 2 for hackers etc

i deliberately did not wanted to review this game after few hours of playing cause i wanted to wait out all patches and updates to come out what to say about this game now after 667 hrs on recordbest online fps game for me fair successor of cs 16 & source still has some flaws and isues regarding cheaters but it will be solved eventually buy this game its worth it

global offensive began development in early 2010 and while details on all stages of the games production remain scarce its more or less known that it was heavily troubled by design conflicts clashes with the communitys desires and not even developed inhouse at valve passed off to at least two other seattlebased development studios with hidden path entertainment fully developing the game until release it was touted as a reinvention of counterstrike in general aimed towards new players and especially console audiences one year and a half after release both console releases have become entirely redundant and featuring new communitydesigned game modes two gun gameinspired modes under the umbrella arsenal mode which has now been all but abandoned by valve while the game was in a disastrous state at the betas launch in december of 2011 its premature release in august of 2012 did offer a much improved experience but it still simply wasnt ready for release the console versions themselves were poorly made and the main pc version offered few features few maps and an overall lacking gameplay component especially on the competitive side now close to december of 2013 two years after the game first materialized as a closed beta its safe to say that after a full year and a half since its steam release with consistent robust and uncompromising postrelease development by valve csgo is a completely different product with the makings of a balanced monetization platform in the arms deal systems paving the way for a possible freetoplay rerelease huge new additions in gameplay and graphics alike and a renewed and refreshing focus on the competitive side of the game both ingame and out of game in some of the many prominent lan tournaments csgo has reached a point where its clear that it has become equal if not superior to cs 16 and make no mistake this could be only the beginning for the game there is still much room for improvement  certain aspects of gameplay which hamper the experience for both casual and hardcore players aimpunch weapon balancing and the lack of proper tutorials or any reliable way of explaining deeper mechanics the lack of content outside of the main classic game mode and the lack of support for the nighdeprecated arsenal game modes honestly a control point or holdout or vip mode could go a long way towards giving players more to do i also feel a broader selection of weapons both base weapons in the buy menu and sidegrade loadout weapons and equipment could freshen up a static and rigid gameplay formula which in dota 2 for instance changes radically every six months for the most part however this is counterstrike as deep and skillbased as its ever been but with adjustments and improvements which help it feel more modern and dynamic without compromising its core gameplay mechanics if they play their cards right csgo could end up being greater and more expansive than either of valves previous multiyear postrelease and freetoplay game experiences dota 2 and tf2 either way nows the time to get on board and for the mandatory horrendous pun for my closer nows the time to go go go

csgo mixes up source and cs 16 gameplay the recoil and the flashbangs are more 16 like and the rest is pretty much source in cs you have no aimdownsightsfeature what means that you have to control your fire by shooting short salves or single shots you can also learn the guns spraypatterns by holding down firekey and noticing the bulletimpacts on distance they arent really noticable but on short to middle ranges it works pretty well in long range firefights people mostly strafe left and right shoot single shots and try to hit their opponents head unrealistic but interessting and challenging you can duck pretty fast but it has almost no effect on your precision you will be slow and more vulnerable flanking is hard in this game because there is no sprint and maps are designed to have clear mostly open ways you can hide in only very very few situations because mostly you have great visibility its a bit bad and sometimes irritating that you can not disable blood decals mostly the only cover you can get is behind corners or of course headglitchpositions in this game you can not go phrone or lean around corners i think leaning would be a nice addition but no this game is still remains classic armor is more helpful than it was in source to me it feels like its more important to land headshots because of that its rather unlikely to get wallbangkills its hard to spray there is not much hitslowdown and armor is very powerful and sometimes wallbanging feels a bit random the sound in this game is good you mostly hear exactly when people run shoot or jump you can mostly locate loud players really precisely unlike in most modern games where you mostly have crazy boominess or randomized sound because of perks for example counterstrike is mostly comprehensible some maps got a really nice overhaul dust2 dust1 aztec office militia mirage train and cobble are very different compared to source or 16 personally i dont like them that much inferno is very similar to the sourceversion they only changed some wall textures and made some minor changes its good that valve changed the hostage rescue mode now its more tactical and more objective based but i think this mode doesnt work that good with the old map layouts its sad that there are only very few new competetive maps instead of new official maps there are buyable communitymappacks which are available in competetive and causal matchmaking for a period of time the ability to find or buy weaponskins is new in csgo on the one hand it is cool to have camos on your guns on the other hand its bad that you mostly find bad looking andor bad quality skins or cases most camos look very colourful and not realistic if you want good looking skins you most likely end up buying the skins for real money on the steam marketplace conclusion csgo is a new cs with mediocore graphics the textures are mostly 512x512 pixels and could be better sometimes the bloom and postprocesseffects are a bit annoying and also some animations could be better reworked maps new recoil and still not perfectly balanced guns but its fine it has most things that the old csgames already had but also some new things there is ranked matchmaking a great hud and an easy to use replayfunction its also very nice that you still have dedicated servers you have the possibility to make your own maps and use servermods these are all great features that every modern fps game should have if you want to customize the look of your guns you will have to pay for it its very very unlikely to find good skins and the amount of skindrops is limited to 28 drops per week all in all i think csgo is a game that continiues the series in a moderate way it could be better but it could also be a lot worse since this game is not too expensive i can recommend you getting this game

counterstrike global offensive truly is a game like no other in counterstrike global offensive you are tasked with globally offending as many people as you possibly can in 30 rounds with an array of tools such as mic spam teamkilling or racist bullet messages it differs from the original counterstrike known as 16 because there are 16 people still playing in the fact that its not 37 years old counterstrike hardline refines the tried and true formula of police voiced by nolan north vs counterpolice voiced by troy baker bringing in many new faces to each team such as jewish toad from super mario bros a black guy a ghost with a beret and a hot topic customer counterstrike black ops adds exactly 3 new zones for you to wreak havoc in bringing the total amount of maps to 1 but makes up for it with a large arsenal of over 70 weapons which i will now list for you ak47 m4 awp all in all counterstrike global defensive is a robust top down open world third person beat em up that tweaks the gunplay to its best with amazing graphics and sound design its bound to keep you hooked until counterstrike 5 05

it is kind of hard to say i do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay it is very addictive what i love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player from total noob to prolevel has the same arsenal of guns to use you can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money meaning it is skill experience and teamwork and connection that makes the difference but you can give your guns a personal touch by getting different skins adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers i really like the bomb defusal mode or bomb placement when you are a terrorist but there are also other game types hostage rescue armsrace  deathmatch and demolition also there is a big library with player made map all with their own rules and styles aim training headshots only all vs all achievement maps platformstyle and surfmaps this is my first ever fps so needed the first 1k hours i am a very slow student to learn how to hold a gun how to recognize enemies and friends learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team etc the overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time hey i am silver 1 lowest competative ranking  of course i am not a star player many other players on that same level are hacking have second accounts or are experienced in other shooters and their patience level with newcomers is about 0 so a mistake even if i had no clue i made one resulted often in an insta kick most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noobomg really if you cant practice in a competative match and get kicked out of casual matches toothen how on earth can you learn how to play despite an overall crappy community i met some awesome people lot of fun to play together preferably in a full team or just some casual matches armsrace deathmatch or training and training does pay off anyway you would think that by now i am a pro but hell no i guess i have to conclude i am not talented enough to get to a high rank on the bright sidei do not get kicked out of a team anymore at least not that oftenmust be doing something good still playing daily and still loving it so recommended hell yeh nb i just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad maybe thats just my feminine view but i think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over quite pathetic to be honest i learned to ignore it loving the mute button i just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl that would be really sad

i dont really know why global offensive costs less than source but nevertheless this is a great game the successor of a real legend its a little hard to adapt if you come from games like battlefield or cod because of the recoil and no sights but if you are dedicated you can master it in no time if you are a fan of shooters you must play this game but warning itll be addicting as hell

well this game is amazing and is very different from the past counter strikes graphics have improved alot which i believe why many people love games because of their graphics graphics arent everything as of the past counter strikes you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want arms race deathmatch etc etc in csgo you wont have to worry about that they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it i have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes probably since they reduce the recoil a bit but either way tap firing is always the key also many unique features they have added in this game first off there are the skins many people disliked this idea since they probably thought csgo would be like call of duty well adding skins doesnt really mean anything it just makes you be able to battle in style not to also mention offline mode offline mode is basically playing with bots now some counterstrikes did have bots such as counter strike source but i just thought it was nice that they would add bots mode back counter strike global offensive is way different from any other fps first person shooter its much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros so thats why i play offline mode if i were to rate this game out of 10 ill probably give it a 7510

on counterstrike global offensive since the announcement lay a huge responsibility after all the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters  a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game benefit  valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans two years later the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists  i can proudly say that cs go is really failed even more than  before continuing my review  it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance  ie confrontation 5x5  30 rounds of 1 min 45 sec  in which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points  and protection appropriate to allow this to happen one of the major advantages is the fact that cs go this type of game  with minor changes  placed in a separate section of the menu called  competitive mode   introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill in cs 16 and cs source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers  specially tuned for this type of game the gameplay is not changed  actually  nothing changed and is not required  a familiar mechanic works on hurray  fixed characteristics of some weapons  something removed something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect shooting became more random yes but perhaps the most realistic fps in the moment if multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay then welcome to the cs go valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices with proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon  pistol rounds in cs go is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies  but the most important advantage is the ratio of valve to his fans  almost every week there is a free upgrade  changing the gameplay for the better in order to achieve a perfect balance  approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 57 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode thats not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers in addition to all valve maintains its competitive community  sponsoring tournaments large sums  and i am delighted that the number of people playing cs go is increasing every day  but on the other hand it is the community cs was for me the only problem in this game because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation the only solution  only play with friends total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history to purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself  best multiplayer shooter at this point in my opinion  beardattack @ fren

ill just be straightforward with this this game is for ones who enjoy fps counterstrike games and pvp if you are one that doesnt enjoy those things then this game isnt for you you will be faced with a lot of frustration and will regret purchasing this game now for those that do enjoy those things stated before this game has better graphics than the previous cs games intense competitive fps matches remakes of nostaligic classic cs maps and new fun casual game modes like arms race so yes i will recommend this game for those that love fps

once again valve never fails to deliver an epic title such as counter strike for years the counter strike community was divided into two titles counter strike 16 and counter strike source but now thanks to valves latest counter strike adition we can finally bring back the family all together the addition of skins are all bonuses that make counter strike global offensive even more enjoyable following team fortress 2s hat and drop system the money being used for esports for the best to take place in the competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic as well as giving you the prestige for winning the game is not perfect but then again no game is but what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of hidden path entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay although there are many features that could be similar to dota 2 to make it even better but valve will learn soon thanks to this game more and more people are joining the community of this game and we should all work so that this game or should i say franchise becomes the best first person shooter series ever

death is a great teacher failure in counterstrike global offensive is as it always has been for this series the greatest way to learn where you should have gone what you shouldnt have done and how you could have done better counterstrike players spend a lot of time learning  consequently they are always getting better growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years for the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continues pieces of the counterstrike formula are dated at this point but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim counterstrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard but the changes are for the best  the underpass choke point in de_dust for instance has a new escape route even in the face of genre evolution global offensive doesnt care to adapt csgo is so dedicated to counterstrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in global offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters everyone is limited to what they have and can see with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages running and gunning is a useless play style even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill walking crouching or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fire consequently killing in global offensive feels good theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim if players arent watching corners providing covering fire or using smoke grenades and flashbangs theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman the desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better team if youve played counterstrike before global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counterstrike like counterstrike source before it global offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter while doing little to disrupt the core form and function at the same time it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic too theyre particularly useful during demolition matches which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between the new and modified maps in this mode arent as big as classic counterstrike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever the lake map is a standout  theres a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots to separate demolition from defusal players cant buy between rounds instead it takes a cue from the other new mode arms race in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly the better you do the more you have to switch up the way you play and because demolition is so fast youll need to be quick on your feet

for those who wants to learn seriously first of all the game respects to the original counterstrike soul what i mean with that close combats midrange combats long combats auido personolized cfg grenade training teamwork using communications are still have great affects on the gameplay so far what has changed first graphics and phsycs has changed weapons has changed community has changed players has changed matchmaking has changed i will explain everything what i mean by those but first things first for old players from the times of 15 or 16 or even older you may difficulties adapting to phsyscs and new gameplay as i said players has changed and the teamwork has changed there will be a lots of people telling you what to do why are you flashing why did you smoke there how didnt you heard the defuse but believe me you will understand that all after a few hours on the game with the new ranking system  i will explain this furter too there is much at stake your efforts and skills will affect you teammates ranks in competitive mode lets start to explain matchmakin mode competitive 5 to 5 serious matchs instead of an 32 player 1616 server which people often go crazy run around rushing cts you will experience a real clan match for example after you accept the game on dust 2 if you leave the game you will have a punishment for 30 minutes 1 hour 2 hours 24 hours 2 days 7 days same punishments for killing to much teammates or killing a teammate after the spawn after you have won 10 games in competitive mode you can see your ranksearch google for further reading ranking system is a revoulitoun for me like in chess you will face with opponents in your same skill level and that also offers a chalenge to up rank but also there is a risk to derank ranking system works on different ways and have a lots of different derrivatives for example winning matches while the opponents have higher ranks then you or having a 375 kd believe me ranking system is your friend weapons remeber the times that ak47 m4a1 awp desert eagle were over power forget it and also say goodbye to a lots of weapons including mp5 one of my favs goodbye to scout say hello to ppbizon ssgp250nova with these changes youll have a very expanded area of weapons to chose mag7 is op in close combat ssg has its pluses such as you can shoot straight while jumping fiveseven has a great armor penetration cz75 is an automatic pistol that you can rush with in an eco round the reason im telling you all these because you can choose your own weapons considering you style are you a rusher get your p90 ready 50 bullets low recoil high fire rate you are a closeholder get a mag7 you are good on sniping and pistols get your ssg options are much better then it was in 16 or else also do not omit the skins and market over 100 skins for weapons 10 different weapon boxes near 30 different collections trade up contract keys operation bravophoenix thats not something that i can explain you need to see it yourself and feel the difference audios are better community updates every second you can report cheaters phsycs are nearly awesome then every other fps games yes including cod go and get the game do not wait for price to go down you can make that money in game with selling weapons on the market for the time being 1499$ for this game is like paying 40000$ for a masseratti and masseratti doesnt helps you to make your money back trust me if you are searching for a great fps experience this is the most exciting game for time being

what i like in csgo counter strike global offensive i love how there are camosskins on weapons because no other game is like it i also love how theyre are a workshop where you can create skins maps stickers ect csgo also has a lot of people playing it so if you are playing on a random server you are guaranteed to have other players on there the fact there are servers you can make what i dislike the fact there are smurfs that play with silvers and just make there games horrible i mean this is not me since im not in silver im master guardian but that has nothing to do with this review anyways i dislike how they removed operation vanguard from the maps because i loved season and workout a lot i know you can still get the maps off the workshop and still play it but its just not the same i think valva should add more things to do in the tutorial so begineers understand more about the game sorry if this review is not good i have exactly made a review about a game before

counter strike is one of those games where no matter how much you play it you never have the same encounters it is fun and thrilling and should be game of the year every year
recommended
counterstrike makes you work to enjoy the content and youll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it weapons are a huge part of the series too with csgo not an exception each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance and with this you can purchase armour projectiles and weapons firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles and youll want to experiment with each one to see which works best what makes counterstrike such a popular series  and what will no doubt make csgo the next big pc shooter  is the thrill of the ego chase as you die often continuously the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better in a game where success is pinned on attention to detail death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load it becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better  and if you become a good player the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills global offensive builds on the cs series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible gun game as its own separate mode check competitive capabilities built in check map balancing here and there check check check as a result there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better the wide range of grenades for example will likely make play more tactical  laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes while decoys which fake gunfire and fool radar points are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players the actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come it has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel which doesnt sit well to begin with we eventually found ourselves enamoured by it and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play its what doesnt work however that is most notable regular mode has no new maps added to it while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic global offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the mp5 essentially pushing even more players to stick with the ak and the m4 sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous cs releases if one assumed this was counterstrike source with a visual mod installed there would often be little to shake that impression theres also now a split between casual and competitive servers  however many players arent yet aware of the differences mainly because the distinction isnt made obvious enough it becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it which have perhaps taken casual mode turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to source as possible at times arranging games in competitive mode feels like a chore joining a fiveonfive war is simple enough but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game and youll often hit a snag myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck simply being told that no servers were currently available when you finally do join it works fine but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback we eventually gave up and resorted to using irc to find matches as we would with source counterstrike global offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for and the response from the community often reflects this view on many occasions other players used phrases such as same old to us this is elementally counterstrike source with some finetuning under the bonnet and valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable rrp attached to it and yet the core dna of the game has not lost its appeal this is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters valves objective with global offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the source and trusty 16 edition it clearly has a good chance

death is a great teacher failure in counterstrike global offensive is as it always has been for this series the greatest way to learn where you should have gone what you shouldnt have done and how you could have done better counterstrike players spend a lot of time learning  consequently they are always getting better growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years for the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continues pieces of the counterstrike formula are dated at this point but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim counterstrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard but the changes are for the best  the underpass choke point in de_dust for instance has a new escape route even in the face of genre evolution global offensive doesnt care to adapt csgo is so dedicated to counterstrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in global offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters everyone is limited to what they have and can see with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages running and gunning is a useless play style even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill walking crouching or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fire consequently killing in global offensive feels good theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim if players arent watching corners providing covering fire or using smoke grenades and flashbangs theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman the desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better team if youve played counterstrike before global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counterstrike like counterstrike source before it global offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter while doing little to disrupt the core form and function at the same time it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic too theyre particularly useful during demolition matches which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between the new and modified maps in this mode arent as big as classic counterstrike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever the lake map is a standout  theres a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots to separate demolition from defusal players cant buy between rounds instead it takes a cue from the other new mode arms race in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly the better you do the more you have to switch up the way you play and because demolition is so fast youll need to be quick on your feet unlike other game types arms race allows for respawns its the most chaotic and carefree mode in global offensive with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible its a shame there are only two maps in arms race  a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than pc if you have the option playing the pc version is unquestionably the best way to experience counterstrike global offensive mods mouse and keyboard and the usual pconly options are better than the ports plus valve is much better about longterm pc support  it abandoned team fortress 2 on consoles and portal 2s level editor was pc exclusive if you prefer to play on consoles global offensive is the same great game with the following special bits

its different than previous installments in the series the recoil of the weapons is dramatic and infuriatingly unreal looking its very possible to almost completely miss a target standing in front of you at no more than 1 meter gamewise meter and deliver only one hit with the ak the awp for example isnt the surgical instrument of death no more the shoot area isnt a dot the dot in the center of your reticle but a quite large box also the physics of it seem a bit off i cannot understand how you can be stopped from running from being hit with a smoke grenade he grenade flash bang or molotovincendiary it is ridiculous and reminds me of the old stuckintheground with smoke launched at feet bug in counterstrike 14 i have the frustrating sensation that i am constantly playing a beta game a beta i have purchased also lots of cheaters in competitive matches competitive matches were supposed to be the bread and butter of the new series but the experience is very often destroyed by obvious cheat using players i guess it is so easy to cheat in this game since there are lots of them the overwatch isnt helping much and participating in the overwatch program ruins the faith in this program because 4 in 5 demos submited to overwatch have players blatantly using wallhack i guess the overwatch can vac ban one and while 10 more players start using it in spite of all it has potential it looks good and the maps the old ones and the new ones added are interesting and fun to play

teamwork and skill are the standouts that gap this shooter from many others improves on previous cs editions with imporved mechannics and alot of balancing along with micropurchases this game is highly addicting with a strong emphasis on cooperation and and mental strengh teamed with aim and many other factors with the goods there are still problems the biggest being the community with many people hacking or generally being a pain in the  i highly recommend this game for anyone that loves shooters and competive games

csgo is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters out there it offers such great gameplay and wide variety of gamemodes and maps to choose from counterstrike has been around since 1999 and has grown since then csgo may not please every 16 fan but it has a lot to offer to the counterstrike scene it has official competitive matchmaking and supports the esports scene of counterstrike most counterstrike major tournaments are hosted by gotv and other sources like twitch which you can find on the main menu it offers a ton of new gamemodes you made of heard before like arms race aka gun game and deathmatch a all out freeforall these gamemodes make counterstrike more friendlier to the casual players of the game the old gamemodes are back in the modes casual and competitive casual is mostly for pub servers because it offers a more casual experience to the standard counterstrike gametypes like de_ bomb defusal and cs_ hostage rescue by turning off teamkilling always buy the essential equipment like defusal kits and head armor in the competitive gamemode it brings out the standard counterstrike competitively accepted settings some are modified like bomb time not being 35 seconds and instead being 45 this gamemode is for people who want to queue up with their friends and have a serious match with other players in competitive teamkilling is allowed and many other hardcore settings to please the competitive audience you might say to yourself well since teamkilling is on doesnt that mean people can grief in competitive valve has implemented ways to stop griefers and trolls from ruining the game experience everytime you teamkill someone you get a competitive ban that can go up to 7 days and even a year which means you can not play the competitive gamemode for how long it lasts valve also has its own community overwatch service which detects cheaters and griefers overwatch lets you watch competitive games and see if someone is griefing or not the overwatcher determines if the person is griefing or hacking then the report gets send to valve for a final confirmation this has helped the csgo community get rid of hackers and griefers off of the competitive scene speaking of the community the csgo community is pretty friendly when it comes to new players most veteran players are willing to help out to teach everyone the basics of the game if they are having trouble many guides on the steam community guide page teaches new players on how to handle weapons and such i rate this game 1010 this game is near perfection when it comes to multiplayer shooters and it is a must have for every steam account

very addicting game the strongest point this game has is its history the game has been around for over a decade it has a very steep learning curve and a high skill ceiling to match the most vibrant competitive scene of any fps on the market you can see my full review of the game here httpwwwyoutubecomwatchv0xqxscuv_wq

great fps love the trading and the competitve gamemodes also ez skins ez life

its important to appreciate games like this for what they are and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history thats been buffed and polished and unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original counterstrike games im not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off basically it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are if youre a diehard counterstrike fan then this is probably all you can ask for if youre a more typical gamer who just finished playing crysis or battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend then trust me when i say that this is not the game for you its the online fps equivilent of dark souls in a way

good half guys well played

this is an extremely mixed and short review i think the game has cool and original gameplay though it doesnt highly innovate it stills maintains the counterstrike gameplay that has been going on for about 15 years lets talk about the community about 5% of the people you meet on global offensive are really nice people 95% think theyre mlg  and will kick you if youre not very good ive been kicked multiple times and it feels awful to think that people dont want you on your team makes my stomach drop to the bottomless pit seriously beware of the abysmal community and stick with your friends if you work together with your friends to prevent the opposing team from winning youll have a much better time than you would being john rambo but now im going to say this is an amazing game and i totally recommend playing it if you like competetive slowpaced games then play with a group of friends youll have fun

so counter strike global offensive csgo is the latest revision of the long running halflife mod fps created by hidden path the game is more of a refinement towards modern day military shooters then previous instalments such cs 16 cscz and css this is mainly to allow a more broaden appeal to the masses of cod and battlefield generation you see cs generally has always had a very hardcore user base that is highly skilled youd be lucky to find yourself top of your first few games as a beginner like you could do in the forementioned rival franchises in competitive multiplayer how have they achieved this and to what extent it is successful is down to personal preference the newly included arms race and demolition modes allows for a more fast pace and tightly confined cqc mode that allows the players little to no down time unlike the traditional bombdefuse or hostage maps that most players are familiar with for me though these modes are not the real meat of the game and if youre an experienced player these will only be glanced over and served as a side show at before delving into the traditional modes the inclusion of some new weapons and equipment helps to change up csgo such as the molotov and allow for different variations of old school tactics most of the well know maps are available from the offset and the workshop community is as good as it gets with newly created maps game types and weapon skins to name but a few there is the introduction of operation payback whereby a selection of community maps are promoted and available for players for a small fee across the whole of csgo and some of these are a delight to play so why would you choose this over css for the experienced player i find that it adheres to the original 16 far more closely then css ever did the aiming is tight and follows the recoil sprays on many of the automatic guys far more closely there are many updates that valve and hidden path are pushing though such as spectator mode competition spectators ie dreamhack newly released weapon finishes through drops and crate drops and newly revised maps being released mirage and cobble to name but a few for me the main reason for this instalment above all others if the great competitive mode ranked csgo was never really available unless you sign up to a league such as ed played pcws or cups now however with competitive mode 5vs5 ranked games are a blast if not for a few small problems that really need to be ironed out these include dropped players being replaced by bots hacking and over watch submissions uneven rank matches to name but a few if you though take the game as it meant to be played as a highly skilled social and fun game then the latest version of this simple but vastly complex game will delight you as it has me

death is a great teacher failure in counterstrike global offensive is as it always has been for this series the greatest way to learn where you should have gone what you shouldnt have done and how you could have done better counterstrike players spend a lot of time learning  consequently they are always getting better growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years for the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continues pieces of the counterstrike formula are dated at this point but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim counterstrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard but the changes are for the best  the underpass choke point in de_dust for instance has a new escape route even in the face of genre evolution global offensive doesnt care to adapt csgo is so dedicated to counterstrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in global offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters everyone is limited to what they have and can see with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages running and gunning is a useless play style even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill walking crouching or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fire consequently killing in global offensive feels good theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim if players arent watching corners providing covering fire or using smoke grenades and flashbangs theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman the desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better team if youve played counterstrike before global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counterstrike like counterstrike source before it global offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter while doing little to disrupt the core form and function at the same time it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic too theyre particularly useful during demolition matches which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between the new and modified maps in this mode arent as big as classic counterstrike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever the lake map is a standout  theres a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots to separate demolition from defusal players cant buy between rounds instead it takes a cue from the other new mode arms race in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly the better you do the more you have to switch up the way you play and because demolition is so fast youll need to be quick on your feet

cs go stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries this is counterstrike whatever the format you choose to play it on and there isnt a higher recommendation than that

whether youre a casual fps gamer or a very competitive hardcore player csgo is where its at a large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value there is no single player campaign though playing with bots is always an option csgos highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals it cant be understated that the hud stays very clean unlike most modern shooters battlefield and cod im looking at you unlike previous cs titles go includes a weapon drop system similar to dota 2 or tf2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics you can actually sell your free weapon drops on the steam market if youre lucky ive personally made $30 steam bucks so far for competitive gamers csgo is one of the largest esports in the world and the largest fps the dreamhack winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250000 its easy to get started because there is a great ingame competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5 with any internet game youre going to meet some jerks but ive had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of steam friends that have taught me a lot dont be discouraged by the learning curve with great effort comes great rewards now go buy it

initially i was very hesitant about this game it seemed very risky to make so many fundamental changes to a formula that was barely changed through counterstrike source and condition zero however seeing how much valve has listened and continues to listen the community and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term it has completely restored my faith in the game counterstrike global offensive is incredibly fun and featurerich with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players on top of this there is also plenty of ways to promote and support esports which is a muchneeded and fundamental step in reinvigorating counterstrike in the competitive gaming scene however the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly  and with a game as difficult and intense as counterstrike its extremely welcoming good stuff

i have to say originally i did not want anything to do with this game i have been a big fan of the series since starting with beta 4 way back when after css was released i was very content with the way the series had been progressing the updated gameplay and graphics gave me a boosted interest in a game i had not played in several years when counterstrike global offensive was released i was not feeling the same way the frantic and well edited trailers made the game look spectacular that is until i noticed it was still running on the source engine albeit a modified version given the hefty price tag i stayed away from csgo for as long as possible until i noticed how many updates had been made since the first csgo beta and the subsequent gold release it was obvious the developer planned on putting as much effort into maintaining the game as they were to keep the game fresh and even competitive once i finally bought the game on sale for a decent price i realized what i had been missing competitive mode has changed the way the game feels and works it was very easy to get bored playing css because as the popularity increased so did the servers pretty soon you were competing against 32 players on the opposing team making for a hellish freeforall despite the team based combat csgo found the perfect solution by introducing a competitive game mode instead of having to play with your friends in 5v5 tournaments csgo incorporated a 5v5 mode that mirrored the professional experience making it a lot more fun to play the finetuned competitive mode coupled with officially supporting death match and the arsenal game modes making csgo a game with a lot more replayability and a lot more fun some people are critical about the inclusion of skins turning csgo into team fortress 2 but they fail to recognize the importance of customization the skins dont really impact the gameplay and are not overly obnoxious like some of the content included in tf2 in addition to the developer created content the inclusion of community created weapon skins and operations allow community members to profit while increasing the awareness and fun of the game i am not a fan of dlc especially since most dlc is lackluster overpriced content that should have normally been included in the game at launch but was separated out to payfor downloadable content in the interest of pumping out sequels and printing money instead of focusing on quality csgo however chooses community content to include and gives back to the authors who continue to breath life into the game overall i was skeptical when it was first released but the developers constant attention to detail and genuine intention to keep the game balanced and competitive has made this the best game in the series i highly recommend fans of the series update to csgo and enjoy themselves

the latest installment in valve s counterstrike series brings us great addicting gameplay a colourful alive world in a game that combines great mechanics with great performance it is my second most played game soon to become the first the item drop system is similar to the one in team fortress 2  at the end of a match you may or may not receive an item a skin a weapon case you never know  the best way to play is to play competitively the game has a matchmaking system that finds you a nearby server to play on with 9 other players to fill your 5v5 match this is where you have to play good where you have to win after your first few matches you will be given a skill group that is your rank its based on your k  d ratio and the amount of wins and consecutive wins youve had in previous matches the matchmaking systems job is to match you with players of your level if you dont wanna play serious though you can still hop in the thousands of servers with random stuff deathrun zombie survival deathmatch you name it its still tons of fun but the real deal is in competitive so what are you waiting for get it  unsurprisingly i give it a 10  10

counterstrike global offensive is an online multiplayer fps shooter made by valve with the hours ive spent within this game i can confidently state that those hours were not wasted this game offers more weapons an item system new maps improved graphics and incredibly improved content from counterstrike source the game can be ran on nonup to date systems due to its adjustable graphics settings which will also allow the user to enhance the graphics i can confirm that the game runs smoothly and is not jumpy which prooves how good of an engine the game has pros  smooth fps  incredible graphics for a source game  balanced pvp  item drops makes the game that much more worth playing  wide variety of maps dlc  good players are rewarded within certain game modes  players that leave during a competitive match are dealt with correctly cons  the weapons and hipfire take alot of time to master if not played a source game before  match making server system in the competitive mode sometimes has one team where the majority of the players have a much higher ping avg 100  demos sometimes 90% of the time dont play correctly and are jumpy overall i give the game 910 and highly recommend this game

counter strike global offensive is a lets face it if you dont know what this is you need to climb out from under that rock csgo as its often abbreviated to is rewarding to those with skill and punishing to the casual gamer when played in competitive mode to get the best of out this game you need to invest time and effort to learn the maps and the spray patterns of the guns watching players with high levels of skill is like watching a football match on tv even if you dont like the game you appreciate people who have skill at this game because you can clearly see when a player knows their stuff and when they dont this game is more of a sport hence its overwhelming appearances in esports tournaments like esl and dreamhack etc overall if you are looking for a bit of fun for an hour or so stay away from this game to get the best from this you need the practice regularly and get a team of people to play with then its brilliant

this is a great addition to the cs series the maps look fresh the models are great and the gameplay is as tight as ever the competitive mode offers a very quick way to find relatively balanced matches one drawback though is the framerate issues the arms deal update has introduced which many are experiencing and valve dont really seem to be looking to fix any time soon

tldr stfu and play counterstrike global offensive is designed to be competitive and only competitive if being competitive is your kind of fun then this is definitely the game for you take note that if you have a high competitive rank do not use matchmaking during or after steam sales you will be queued against blatant hackers who will just pull your rank down valves method to address this issue is by limiting the wins of unranked players to 2 per day this is supposed to make boosting services more expensive but if your mom has the $$$ then it wont stop you from being a dumbass ge as for lower ranked players the only thing you should worry about when the game goes on sale are smurf accounts since the game was designed to heavily punish players for abandoning a match and to limit the range of skill groups many players have resulted to purchase more copies of the game  possibly a copy for each day of the week and for each range of skill groups this is a flawed system created by valve and i doubt it will ever be fixed clearly valve just wants to sell hats  or in this case stickers in my opinion competitive cooldowns are stupid competitive cooldowns aka temporary bans are given to players who abandon a match this is good for promoting competitive play and all but the current implementation for detecting an intentional abandon is completely  ret4rded  good job flagging this word fagg0t if you have random connection issues for a mere 510 minutes  possibly due to terrible internet service providers this will immediately be considered an abandon and you will not be allowed to help the four teammates you are clearly in a party with if you are live streaming on twitchtv and get dos attacked by one of your viewers you will most definitely be given a 7 day cooldown every single time you live stream if your game crashes in the middle of a match due to vpk errors and are forced to verify the integrity of your game cache or if windows update decides it would be a good time to install updates and restart your computer gg whoever thought it would be a good idea to give a cooldown to a player who teamkills a bot in order to prevent it from giving away free guns and knifekill rewards to the enemy please for the love of go csgo kill yourself csgo bots just like in dota2 are incredibly stupid no matter what difficulty you set them to they rarely follow commands and will most likely give the bomb as well as their gun to the counterterrorists bomber bots has been addressed in a previous update by allowing players to take the bomb from bots the ai remains the same  stupid and unresponsive overwatch is unreliable overwatch allows low ranked idiots with zero map awareness to be the judge whether a global elite is cheating or not valves idea of being qualified and experienced enough to become an overwatch investigator is based on numeric variables of your csgo activity basically all you need are 150 competitive matchmaking wins a decent rank not silver 500 hours of your game idling in the background while you watch anime and an account with low report counts aka nobody reported you for being better than them at the game if low report counts were to be the only qualification to be an investigator then eventually everyone skilled enough would have been reported by some newbie does this mean the newbies will be the only ones left qualified for overwatch since higher ranked players were reported by idiots only time will tell overwatch is in a way pretty useful for detecting blatant allout cheaters but extremely inadequate for spotting casual cheaters with minimal settings and who are very good at portraying romeo and juliet  this is because overwatch only shows the investigator outofsync portions of the actual demo based on events triggered by the suspect this makes it seem as though every suspect is using an aimbot especially with the low tickrate being used on the official matchmaking demos yet another waste of a very capable idea valve on the bright side competitive hostage rescue actually works really well compared to older versions of counterstrike carrying the hostage instead of having the incredibly intelligent ai of every valve game ever developed follow you with blindfolds on makes the gameplay a lot more credible for those of you who prefer playing casually you are better off playing counterstrike source i find cssource more casually fun due to smooth movement especially for kz bhop surf and trikz style game modes sadly the cssource community is now officially dead it would be common for people to assume csgo being the cause of the dead cs communities however this is not the case people get bored eventually so they end up looking for something different to try out a new game a different genre or even a different lifestyle the only thing csgo did to these older communities is to possibly hold on to what is left of them by allowing them to merge as one if valvehidden path were to introduce a matchmaking system in cssource and maybe even in cs 16 i am sure a lot of players would pick their preference clean bunnyhopping is possible on csgo if and only if you use hacks or serverside plugins with sv_enablebunnyhopping therefore this may not be a game for all you bhop pros surf and airacceleration still work though however it is not as smooth compared to cssource surfing especially on 64tickrate servers not to mention the game randomly stutters so much that it is impossible to do anything with precision and accuracy  memory leaks with the default value of sv_airaccelerate increased from 10 to 12 this makes it a lot easier to reach those certain jump spots that everyone enjoys doing good job valve now please increase the damn matchmaking tickrate or at least give us an option to choose speaking of options to choose valve has completely removed the sv_enableboost cvar which in turn killed the cs trikz community rip overall csgo is a good replacement for cs 16 fans and possibly for those cssource players who dont even know what airacceleration does

best phallus simulator i ever played first of all csgo is a game about magic there has more magic than harry potter narnia and our wallets on steam sale you will get all the dks at your head you will get almost all the magic by ak47 and other magic sticks when an operation stars the magic increments x1000 they nerfed cz75auto instead of cz75 you will get your  rd by tec9 gg this analysis is subject to have many changes from me in the future sry for bad english p dont took too seriusly this analisis

dont buy this game if you are a casual gamer that does not enjoy spending money on virtual gun skins and boxes of pure misery well i do enjoy this kind of games so i guess ive already blown off quite a bit of money on it already and more is to be dropped into gabes wallet if you play in europe there is a big chance that you will be queued up with russians they tend to only speak russian to you and nothing else which is kind of annoying i do find the game itself quite entertaining and frustrating at the same time but i do reccomend it if you are into 1st person shooters where the hackers are almost nonexistant i r8 88

another game in the counterstrike trilogy at first i didnt like it but now after all the updates and since it got more famous in the editing community then i gave it another shot and i have to say its a very good game the recoil might be a bit weird but youll get more used to it over time css is the best game ive ever played so its weird getting used to but you can master it a lot of nice ideas with this game and the community isnt too bad the skins eeerrhhh i dont know but its a genius idea from valve and also a goldmine for them i do enjoy collecting the skins and stuff but its not like i want to pay 120 for a knife skin thats just ridiculous but the game is very good and polished and definitely worth a try if youre a cs fan the competitive side in this game is really good and probably the best side of the game its just too amazing at being competitive one of the most perfect games to play serious in a little thing to the bad sides though when people shoot and till they actually hit someone seems to be weird theres a slight delay from shooting till it hits and that is what i find most difficult in this game really the recoil you can learn to master but this is just not good editing in this game is ruined compared to css you cant remove all hud or well you can but it can be tricky and it shouldnt be also the deathnotice pops up later than in any cs which can ruin hard cutted edits too and as i mentioned before the delay on the shots also ruin the editing a bit so yeah i dont know what more there is to say other than that i enjoy this game and its competitive side a lot too i highly recommend this game if you like cs and just fps games in general i would rate it 910 just because of the delay on the shots if that werent there i would give it 10 so please valve fix this if you can and it will be one of the best fpss ever anyways thanks for reading and i hope i helped you to make up your mind to buy it or not

ne of the most prominent multiplayer fps right now counter strikeglobal offensive is also one the most renowned the recipe of success for this game was very specific and it is not neccesarily related only to its visual part or the sound effects the technical sector works fine and will leave everyone contented nevertheless its charm is located to the intriguing way it puts you to cooperate with other players and deal with various scenarios either you belong to the terrorists or to the counterterrorists additionally there is a big variety of different levels and modes where you are called upon to put your reflexes to the test and stressful situations demand speed and effectiveness on the whole i strongly recommend this game if you are on the lookout for a multiplayer fps which is not only realistic but also fascinating

ah counterstrike what a wild mistress you are at times you are loving and caring offering great joy and hope then other times you are mad at me for reasons i do not understand and you cast me out alone and unloved first off let me quickly say that the game mechanics are great every gun handles differently and you have to learn each one it takes skill and practice and makes the game so much more rewarding as a side note however its a bit irritating when you can only see a guys head ie the gun is hidden behind a wall or something and they can still shoot you but i digress so in this game you have a few different modes that you can play and each one has a very different play style for instance in arms race there is no time to be subtle you need to get 27 kills before the next guy and you have to do this with every weapon in the game as soon as you kill someone your weapon switches out this can be annoying if youre fighting several people at once but the game is so fast paced that it really doesnt matter if you die instantly respawn and rush back into the field the speed of this game makes it great for some community banter you play in a team but as you are really only playing for yourself it doesnt matter if your team are doing well or not ill come back to this point about teams later team deathmatch is a fairly standard affair if you are familiar with any other fps game people spawn in and you have to kill them before they kill you simples as this game mode is slower than arms race you can afford to be a bit more patient there is a timer instead of a reach this many pointskills also every now and then a bonus weapon appears in which youll get more points if you kill people with that respawn with this weapon and kill people within the time limit and youll bag yourself some extra points person with the most points at the end wins again this is a mostly light hearted game mode and the community really shines through next up is demolition my least favourite mode it is much the same as the casualcompetitive maps in which you have to try and plant a bomb but the maps are smaller the main difference in this game mode is you dont get to choose your gun you start with a weapon and then when you kill someone in a round you change weapon at the start of the next round kill several people and you will be awarded with some grenades as well the reason i dislike this mode is people can get out of sync with the weapons if you do really well for several rounds likelihood is you will now be on a weaker gun or a gun you cannot personally use well while its good to get practice in the realisation is that the other team can simply be on better weapons leaving you at a major disadvantage again after a few rounds they may be on a gun that they cant use and it levels the playing field again but those few rounds can really be an irritant now we are onto the meat and two veg the bit the mistress both loves and despises competitive in my time playing cs i have went from an absolutely horrendous player having never really played many fpss to a fairly competent player over the space of a few months i went from unranked up to master guardian 1 i felt very proud of myself however the journey was not plain sailing when entering a competitive mode if you are not searching with friends you can end up with wildly different experiences this is where the community behind cs can really fall apart in a match with strangers you can have a great match with excellent communication which is really needed in competitive or have really bad communication and a lot of name calling if you make a mistake sometimes you will be supported with a lot of unlucky well get them next time or you will receive something along the lines of omg you suck noob ffs uninstall this is particularly true if youre the last one left alive and all eyes are watching you this isnt just from your team however i have had games where i have had great communication with the opposition and everything has been really friendly but well fought othertimes however they are raging across the keyboard at you yes you can mute players and often you may have to mute the opposition but it is quite another to mute your team as i said communication is really important in a competitive match even if they are only yelling obscenities at you they may occasionally have insight into where a player is a main problem for this is it doesnt even matter if you are winning or losing your team could just be massively unhelpful i have had a lot of fun playing competitive matches however as time goes on it is becoming less and less fun this could be because of all the steam sales with people buying the game and jumping on just to be irritating maybe they had been banned previously and have made new accounts or some such thing it just doesnt make for pleasant gaming however i dont play games to become annoyed and irritated i play them as a release there is nothing more satisfying than doing something well i remember playing a game on inferno as the terrorist and i had went up b i was to push up and give them a fright while my team was to go up a as i went up banana two guys came down to me i headshotted them both it was then that my team were shouting down the headsets they had lost the bomb at top of middle only one team member had survived he went to try and get the bomb and was instantly killed i was on my own with 3 opponents left i turned back round at banana and went up middle two were coming towards me and i take them out sadly i was down to 12 health now and the clock was ticking i knew that the last guy was up on the left at top of middle so i went through appartments silently as luck would have it a team mate of mine had a smoke grenade that had dropped there i threw the smoke into top of middle and as it burst out i went for the bomb with 30 seconds left to plant the final enemy started spraying into the smoke and i knew where he was i shot once and killed him acing the round or kill every enemey yourself ive had aces before but that one was special my teammates errupted with cheers as that was a very important round for us had we lost we would have had to eco which is to not buy so you can save some money it was those cheers and the great support that my team gave me that makes me love this game the community can be incredible a quick note about casual is that it is pretty much identical to competitive except with more players and thus less strategy and communication instead of only talking to your team you are often talking to everyone in the game the same issues with the community stand however sometimes they do a clutch or kick where the last surviving member of a team has to kill all the surviving members of the other team and win the round this can be damn near impossible if your team didnt manage to do anything this is often said when its 5v1 or over often the community doesnt really kick the person but i have seen it happen i have also seen someone clutch a 6v1 and then got kicked regardless so its a bit of a hit and miss overall i would highly recommend this game the mechanics are solid and the community as a whole is really great the support people give is wonderful often there is great banter to be had in the nonranked matches sometimes banter can come into the ranked matches but more and more of late it has just been abuse if you want to try your hand at competitive you will need a thick skin

win the round this can be damn near impossible if your team didnt manage to do anything this is often said when its 5v1 or over often the community doesnt really kick the person but i have seen it happen i have also seen someone clutch a 6v1 and then got kicked regardless so its a bit of a hit and miss overall i would highly recommend this game the mechanics are solid and the community as a whole is really great the support people give is wonderful often there is great banter to be had in the nonranked matches sometimes banter can come into the ranked matches but more and more of late it has just been abuse if you want to try your hand at competitive you will need a thick skin

this is not a game for people who merely wish to rack up immense kills or boast about their threesixty no scope headshot wallbang because this is no cod this is a teambased tactical shooter with many strategies and jargon counterstrike global offensive is not your average fps game sense and skill are very important when it comes to csgo what to expect out of particular opponents and the most likely situations youll be facing is a key part of the game if you wish to rack up kills run and gun and just barge into t spawn guns blazing with no plan this is not the game for you skill is the most important aspect and the most unique aspect of csgo and in any counterstrike game at that you will gun run and be outgunned but the most important part is to rise again and to learn from mistakes how did he get me what did i do wrong someone running around with an m4 and shooting every teammate in the face with a shot to the head does not necessarily mean hacks players can always be better and most of the time will be better than you so you need to learn to be better than them all in all csgo is one of the best games i have played the amount of teamwork and skill here is more than what i have experienced from other team based tactical shooters in short if you are looking for a hard to master easy to play competitive tactical based shooter pick this game up its very much worth your money

the third game of the famous counterstrike franchise the graphics in csgo are amazing  as well as the gameplay this version includes more gamemode to play  weapon drops and weapon skinning making weapon skins for valve to add by submiting them on csgos workshop its also a good way to make some profit for your steam wallet you can do that by simply playing and selling your drops on the steam community market however if you plan on quiting durring a competetive match  its not recommended youll be given a few bans and after that every single quit will lead up to a 7 day ban csgo is like counterstrike combined with team fortress 2 its a title that deserves the money tldr ive invested too much to fall back now

reviews for the deaf and hard of hearing  overall game  csgo has a lot of gameplay options for players  community servers offering a variety of game modes casual gaming ranging from defuse maps hostage maps deathmatch mode and a fastpaced arms race mode where you aim to go through each weapon until you get a golden knife kill to win beyond casual gaming there is a competitive system that rankmatches you similar to many other fps games and runs for up to 30 rounds of cs after which your rank is affected one way or another competitive play is both extremely challenging and extremely rewarding although some players either take it far too seriously or treat it like casual unranked gaming its hard to find a team that sits in the nice middle ground between the two if youve played a shooter game before go will be familiar wasd crouching walking as opposed to running and grenades its relatively straightforward gameplay only made hard by the skill of your opponents the game has a bit of a learning curve each weapon acts differently and may take some time to learn which you like and which works best in certain situations after that the grenades are the next thing to consider attempting to master they often can turn a losing game into a winning one the best way to learn is to play so get in there and have fun d overall rating 910  overall accessibility  csgo is not very accessible for deaf gamers the game itself has no captions that i have been able to find but the only thing that would need captioning is the weapons tutorial that youre likely to use once if at all cs can consistently be a challenge to deaf gamers because of the significant impact of sound during play many players often sit and wait for the enemy to come near reacting to footsteps or grenadesweapon fire that cannot be seen but can be easily heard one particular edge hearing gamers have over deaf gamers is guard the target area from a distance by listening for nearby enemies only moving out of hiding when they need to a deaf gamers need to see the target site to properly defend it puts them at greater risk of being killed additionally competitive mode gamers make heavy use of the microphone capability to communicate quickly there are textvoice binds in game using the z x and c keys that can convey significant messages rather quickly and easily but i find that most hearing gamers at midlevel skill are not receptive to either the voice binds or to text chat deaf gamers in competitive gaming may encounter hostility or discrimination from hearing gamers rating 310 subtitlestext  none though none are really needed chattingcommunicating  chatting is available for team and global chat during matches and while observing although as i mentioned some people are not responsive to chat it is still offered

i highly recommend csgo  counterstrikeglobal offensive to all my friends because of the low price and the high replayability with just this cheap game you will be able to play 10 times the time you normzlly spend on a triple a aaa i like they spend equal importance on the individual skill as they do on the team play for me this is the only real tactical shooter on the market at this moment i like the high variety of maps and weapons and that they dont stop updating it with new operations wich offer new free maps and the ability to support the developers by buying these expansions wich is totally unnecesary to be able to fully enjoy the game theres not only a casual matchmaking but also a competitive matchmaking for people who take the game more serious theres weapon skins to collect and trade and cases to open to try ur luck this game litteraly has everything an fps needs and fps fanatics want

this has to be the best matrix game ive ever played the story you play as yet another person who was awoken from the matrix and rescued by a zion ship the entire game takes place during a very specific training simulation that every recruit that has to run before he can jack back into the matrix again the aim of this simulation is to familiarise the trainee with various weapons he can acquire as well as basic tactics employed by terrorists and counter terrorist forces in addition this simulation is good at building a sense of teamwork and trust between the crew and their operator referred to as strat caller the gameplay of course as we learned in the movies most of these training simulations are far from perfect some of the code used in it has been written by people with no formal education and the rest was pirated from the matrix itself this is cause for many anomalies we can observe within the simulation but some argue that these glitches help the player get that surreal experience of entering the matrix after living in the waking world most of these are small things like weapon having the wrong magazine size missing fire selectors fresh magazines looking empty wrong ammo types akm uses 739x30 lolwut none of these subtract from the core of this game however the tension of being the last one alive and having all eyes on you is addictive this game is in many ways the opposite of what is sold on todays fps market while a lot of people are hyped and praise some developers for discovering the jetpacks and high movement shooters of the late 90s this game keep a slower more tactical pace the guns have massive amounts of recoil and any sort of movement can throw your accuracy out the window this places weight on map awareness and positioning more than what you would find in your average fps game the learning curve is steep and it doesnt simply boil down to learning recoil patterns a lot of the time you can win engagements by simply having better crosshair placement or having better communication then the enemy knowing where the enemy is and what gun they are using can easily win you the round even if you are outnumbered this game also challenges you in a very inuniverse way sometimes the game will place agents on the enemy team which will have all the godlike abilities they have in the movie they know where you are and they have perfect aim this can be a frustrating experience for most but nobody said bringing down an agent is easy the graphics they are serviceable not much to look at here you can run this on a toaster just make sure you stay away from vsync you want this game to run at 200 frames its also worth mentioning that this is so far one of the few games that run perfectly on nvidias dynamic super resolution feature as i havent encountered any ui scaling issues the performance impact was negligable for me the sound there is a lot of room for improuvemt here the guns sound very weak compared to titles like battlefield 3 and 4 the ak reminds me of a high pressure nail gun there seems to be a bug when it comes to the sound engine deciding on which channel to play a sound as people walking to my left sound almost the same as people walking on my right the final verdict grab it on a sale its a fun game to play with friends its also worth mentioning that it already paid for itself by giving me a bunch of boxes that i sold on the market place i ended up using the money to buy a bunch of gun which is also another addicting aspect of this game

i finally decided to write a proper review for csgo so i bought this game within a week of playing my first few games of counter strike source i was not disappointed i know its a bit of a bore reading  like this but if youre looking for an overall view on csgo skip down to the bottom for my overall view will you run it chances are youll be able to run it it isnt exactly the most intensive game so youll probably be able to run it smooth at a constant 60fps with anything built less than five years ago community the community is nice enough and often help you in the form of them raging at you through the mic okay so the community isnt the nicest before people rage at me not all of the community is so bad just the minority that can be pardon my language d some people complain about the russians some of them can be quite annoying thank god for the block communication feature but not all scream  blyat down the mic graphics if youre looking for a super aesthetically pleasingplanetside 2 ultra looking game then cs isnt for you the graphics arent bad but its not going to win any prizes either what i will say is that its a large jump from source where this game truly shines is in its gameplay gameplay the game is largely skill based and from what ive played so far requires a large amount of dedication to learn maps and how to use each of the weapons if youre coming from codlike shooters as i did youre going to need to be prepared to spend hours of practice in casual in order to learn spray patterns smoke spots and other subtle hints which can make a massive difference in competitive play theres a wide arsenal of weapons ranging from extremely short range the shotguns to extremely long range snipers unlike other shooters with a wide arsenal of weaponry each weapons has its place and time eg 3 different rifles for each team excluding the snipers the standard m4 and ak for a full buy but also the famas and galil for a force buy aswell as the sg and aug if youre a baller $_$ one of the most surprising features of the game was the extremely useful nature of the nades youll go into your first game buying 0 nades yet after your 2nd game theyll be one of the most utilised items in your arsenal no im not talking about that frag that kills everyone within a 5m radius in any other game youve played im talking about the flashes moltovs and smokes in fact even the decoy has its place youll end your 2nd game hating the frag however sure its good taking 20hp off a coupla people holding b site in dust 2 but you sure as hell arent gonna get any kills with the  as i said earlier the community does help sometimes most often in competitive however gamemodes theres 5 official gamemodes arms race deathmatch demolition hostage bomb all official gamemodes are teambased emphasising the teamwork element of the competitive game modes yet some gamemodes do not at all rely on teamwork such as deathmatch or arms race which is based mainly on your individual skill arms race here youll be in teams however as a solo player youll be looking to reach the golden knife first you get points for each weapon kill which will help in the advancement to the next weapon level deathmatch here you are also playing as teams however the main objective is to end the game with the most points i think it should be renamed awpmatch personally considering over 60% of the players use it i sometimes wonder why people even bother using custom awp community servers demolition heres a gamemode i have yet to build an opinion on having played it very little each kill every new round lets you advance to the next weapon so what happens if you get multiple kills in a round i hear you ask frags well for each extra kill past the first i mean you get an extra frag grenade eh f my  explanations ill give you an example so for example you enter a round get 3 kills and annihilate the enemy team youll advance to the next weapon due to your kill but also earn yourself 2 extra frags to use in the following round bomb so im not sure about the official name of the gamemode but its the gamemode most previous cs players will be extremely familiar with theres counter terrorists and terrorists counter terrorists playing the defensive role for the main part of the round while terrorists will be looking to head to one of the sites and plant the bomb you start the round with $800 in pocket and looking to spend as efficiently as possible in order to win the pistol rounds which will leave you in good steed for the oncoming rounds each round starts with a counter of two minutes which if the counter terrorists run down will lend themselves a victory within this time period the terrorists will be looking to plant the bomb shortening the round time down to 45seconds which is the time taken for the bomb to explode the counter terrorists then have to defuse within the time limit the round is won by counter terrorists by either running down the clock defusing the bomb or eliminating all of the terrorists it is won by terrorists by planting the bomb and it exploding or by eliminating the counter terrorists each round win lends more money than a round loss however increasing streaks of round losses lends itself more money however if the counter terrorists or cts run down the clock and win the round the terrorists will not earn any money for that round lost money is also earned by planting and defusing the bomb and for getting kills with a knife kill yielding the most of $1500 on the enemy team of course a teamkill however leads to a loss of money which can be a pain in the  unless youre a baller with $16k hostage largely the same game mechanics as the previous game mode so i wont go back through it all but with an extreme role reversal with cts playing an offensive role and terrorists ct playing a defensive role the cts objective is to get the hostages back to their spawn point while the tts have to defend and either run down the clock or eliminate the cts sounds the weapon sounds arent accurate in the slightest but do however sound pleasing and distinctive which can help in competitive play sneaky beaky like the first time i heard that i lolled<nuff said miscellaneous skins skins are dropped randomly after every game these are for the majority  common 003 skins and i even find that they often look worse than the default colours you can also get skins from cases but most arent very good and are worth a whole lot of  compared to the $2 you payed for the  motherf key some skins do look real nice though and ive heard also give extra damage bonuses and s  skill levels as of the new update a ranking system was implemented you get xp for your games which increases your level each new rank for each new week will grant you a skin mind you they are all  unless you have the new pass ranks so no one actually knows how this mysterious system works but that its based on an elo system each win supposedly increases your elo while a loss decreases it number of mvps also supposedly increases it this is factored into matchmaking but is abused by the smurfs that plague the game overall a word of warning this game isnt fun its repetitive boring really fustrating but  f addictive if youre looking for a game thats fun id suggest cod but it doesnt have the same feel as cs and not near enough rewarding when you get a kill overall id give it a solid 910 just down to the fact that some of the community isnt the nicest at the best of times

great true counterstrikelike competitive feeling in this latest addition to cs games it has most of the elements from the older cs games 16 and source but with updated visuals weapon skins and stickers matchmaking system and a goal to unite the two different counterstrike communitites cs16 and css this game does that pretty well having a lot of the good old content but still a lot of new stuff to discover   easy to use matchmaking system  updated content some new weapons that were not in cs16 or css and new versions of all the classic maps  overwatch is a great way to get the community involved in banning cheaters but its not perfect system not at all a lot of important information about the match is not available for overwatchers and in order to get ow you need to win 150 matchmaking games and have a rank at atleast gold nova 1 players on that level are usually not good enough to judge is someone is cheating or not and some more suspicious cases may get more votes on evidence beyond reasonable doubt even when no cheating is involved  skins and stickers these things keep a lot more casual players playing the game and gives the more competitive ones new and exiting content in the game after playing the game for thousands of hours  operations that make people play the new maps and all the available official gamemodes makes the game to have more content operations are usually pretty cheap 5 containing usually 5 or more maps that can be played on valves official servers and some kind of scoreboard that keeps track of your matchmaking stats like kills headshot % and matches won  big professional tournamets mainly funded by the community you buy a certain key to open a weapon case esport key in this case is the one that supports electronic sports and a portion of the money goes towards these tournamets these big events gather a lot of counterstrike people together watching the games and having some great entertainment when the professional scene does well the game itself attracts more people playing it  game gets updated really often compared to many other multiplayer shooters sometimes there can be updates every week some of them being quite major valve even listens to the community sometimes to make the game even better and more enjoyable obviously they want to hear what the pros have to say about the current state of the game   lots of hackers playing in the higher rankings in matchmaking as valve killed boosting in its known form most cheaters are just the one who want get to those highest ranks still some boosting appears to be seen even tho it doesnt work like that anymore  matchmaking system is quite broken rankings dont show the true skill and ability to play as a team but it still serves the purpose mm being 64 tick is the main problem or atleast thats what the community says when it comes to the system itself most players would still pick hackers over low tickrate if it was about matchmaking as whole the problem around this is that to be able to get any advantage of 128 tick your game needs to run at atleast that 128 fps not exatly but close to it and according to valve greatly over half of the players have an average fps of 30 or less thats not enough to get any advantage of high tickrate servers another proble with matchmaking is that sometimes it puts higher ranks against lower ones which is not equal at all and usually results in a slaughter of either side balance just sometimes isnt there  bad behaviour among many players makes some matchmaking games really feel like youd like to punch somebody people that refuse to use teamwork or communicate are even worse than bad behaving ones when you wantneed to win games  valve has a weird way of updating something like buffing a weapon without any testing if it will actually work like it was supposed to this has lead to cz75 aug buff the insane tec9 buff and a lot more weird but sometimes even funny updates still a little bit of testing on the field wouldnt hurt anyone all in all i would totally recommend this game for everyone even if it may seem difficult at first you can only get better by learning and playing for me it has been quite 455 experience so far so if you have the will give it a go

this is a very fun experience and you can harvest money from fanboys who buy skins  ive earnt my money back 3x from when i bought it gameplaywise it is fun and it keeps me playing it but many of the systems could be a lot better i love the tactical side of the game and keeping it small scale makes it work extremely well the use of flashbangs and rotating round the map gathering info on the enemy weapons and locations to help your team however the 64tick servers mean on my screen someone bleeds all over the wall because they took 3000000 shots from me then when i die apparently i did 0 shots the recoil is also a bit exaggerated and not as good as in counter strike source the ranking system claims to be elobased but seems to just be get a winstreak of 6 and youll rank up not at all based on your own performance or the enemy ranks in source your body would be jolted by the recoil and so your view would be shaken but your bullets still went wherever your gun pointed in csgo you keep firing and your gun stays in the same position but your bullets decide to bugger off to the moon randomly levitating from the guns barrel overall extremely fun gameplay but mechanics can be dodgy and faulty

best game i have ever played and yes i have played that many hours dont judge me  i just love how this game is designed from its looks to its sounds i have never heard any sounds like this having alot of bass in them sound is your best friend unless you want to get shot in the back of the head with an ak47 and yet i thought this game couldnt get any better but valve is still putting out updates for it including skins for your weapons to add that little extra dazzle to them while you deal some heavy damage to those damn terrorists it also includes a competitive mode and ranking system if you ever want to play a serious game but beware most of these people in competitives arent very nice no matter what you do however you may run into a few polite ones along your journey and even better when you shoot a chicken they explode they also like to dress up into ghosts and reindeers in holiday events if you ever have a spare $15 please please please pick up this game plus you can get some extra money from selling those skins for a few dollars d now please hurry the frick up and buy this game 2010 edited paragraphs after dashed line  well now im back to this review and oh god can i even begin to tell you how many updates they have put out since i have posted this they now have a workshop in which you can make youre own camosskins to be picked by valve to be put into this awesome masterpiece although it is a bit complicating this game is probably the most realistic game out there next to insurgency its nothing like ing cod where all you have is 10 year old trollers you actually find people who are willing to help out as a team now i know im rambling but stick with me im gonna put pros and cons in pros quite realistic can make some extra money long lasting gameplay competitive gamemode ranked demolition an awesome arrange of guns constantly gets updated cons people arent always the nicest griefers well i think that is all i can add to this review apart that it is ic pick it up now

yes there was this one game i fondly remember where our team was down 141 at the half i discarded my attire to let my testicles breathe and my pen1s immediately started getting more and more erect ultimately reaching a phallic state and with each kill 0rgasmic pulsations would run throughout my whole body i caressed the head of my pen1s and i ejaculated onto my keyboard looking up to the screen to see that our team had actually won

first off  i am glad to say that it is nice that valve gave me something that i can love and waste more time on than someone who loves making molasses i still cant help feeling hl3  short version  great gameplay is great matchmaking is okayish the weapon skins are also a nice touch but creates a gambling styled addiction among some players to get and open more and more cases hackers exist but few and far between generally worth astrnomical value on sale even for 33% or 20% frankly its price is perfect you dont have to grasp your head around everything at once but it is fun all the same with the obvious outta the way this game is great i cant possibly hate on it when i fail at it and i cant possibly not dance around in joy when i win its a fun action fps once you practice well enough but beyond that is it very tactical i love how you cannot aim down iron sights in this game seeing as every other game has used that as an excuse for you having such big wavy arm muscles you have to be as accurate as the death stars laser when firing 300 rounds per minute instead it forces you to adapt and learn to fire a gun accurately to the point where you can fire the m4 or ak47 30 rounds per clip without spraying once and instead firing each shot individually but more importantly accurately the gameplay is superb in this way the game modes are great but nothing particullarly rivals the competitive mode which has you challenged so well that it adds to the fun arms race is a great way to practice for beginners and i played it so much having very little time in the day only a half hour or hour and being unable to play competitive that i can easily get to atleast 20 kills in a match of arms race or even win within 3 matches often being the first however ever since then i got alot more free time that i had the liberty of playing competitive again matches have a nice 2 minute system where after that the defending team wins hurray i can now kill usually between 1520 people in a match on a good day i think my record was something like 36 or 34 good times valve really put alot of care into this because they always do they play tested the crap out of and you can tell this in any valve game be it left 4 dead half life or team fortress 2 oddly enough all of those sequels end on 2 and though this might be the 4th or something maybe 5th counter strike game beginning with the mod going 16 cs condition zerodeleted scenes cs source and counter strike global offensive it only feels to have gotten much much better over time this apparently united the rival forces of 16 players and css players into one happy community hey i cant argue that valve put time into this and to speak of its price tag during a sale like summer or christmas is astronomical in value i bought it for 350 didnt play it on my old pc since it was crap and couldnt run it didnt like it at first and kept with gmod but eventually my friends forced me to get into it its use of rounds as opposed to run and gun mechanics is great it forces the player to learn the enemy to win if challenged and also to learn themselves to play better and allows the player to be brought up into the game easier at first the game may seem daunting and frustrating but past that is spectacullarly great people new to the franchise tend to begin without thought run and gun that sorta thing however over time you begin to learn to think tactically i recommend the use of flashbang and smoke grenades as soon as possible as it will save your life literally the game rewards skill and intelligence and unlike other fpses where the biggest scariest and most famous gun wins this has the holy grail of gameplays as the only thing that matters is skill and luck but you cant control that so leave it be however there are some issues i have with the game i have the problem of hackers occuring on lower ranked matches with my friends i dont understand why anyone would cheat but in this game where you get the glory of winning by being the smartest i really cant wrap my mind around it the matchmaking is generally good though you are put into ranks according to your skill after 10 matches this allows fair and equal matchmaking generally you will get into the odd circumstance where you play against very high ranking players like gold nova 2s and so on but this isnt ever a problem because with your brain you can find ways around them and how to win maps have the issue of being favourable to one team but once you are skilled enough it means nothing but most people tend to play on maps that are familiar and work for them i prefer nuke and dust and it is a shame that i just cant enjoy every map equally openning cases can create a gambling like addiction in rare cases but i do love how it affects  nothing it just maps your crappy looking hd m4a4 into something cool stattrak is also pretty nice but i do not like how it is built to give you something crap before something good still i like how everything can we sold on the marketplace for money to put to more steam games cant argue all in all this game is more fun than a dolphin dancing around a dragon statue worshipping its new fake god if i had to rate it id say 910 for the lack of good maps like dust ii and occassional hackers but everything else is perfect i recommend buying this game all the way do not hesitate

my review of csgo  counter strike global offensive  ok this is my first review so well review might not contain in depth well content i dont know xd ill split the contents or fetures into good moderate bad and terrible letting you guys know this is my review its my opinion of the game i will give a final score like 510  5 out of ten  or something like that good content ok lets start off with the good stuff in csgo runs on nearly all pcs  not to brag but i have an i7 3610qm nvidia gt 630m and 16 gb of ram and it runs on lowest with 100300 fps  smooth feeling the movement feels really nice and smooth i really enjoy the game movement guns are balanced  well now they are  i think the guns are very balanced they all have their weakness and strength like the awp yes its a very powerful weapon  one hit kill to the body up  but the awper can be easily taken down by smoking and rushing with a rifle or the best thing to rush with a shotgun or smg never gets old for me this game iv been playing since its release  2012  and my hours on it might be crazy for some people like how could you play one game so much i really enjoy this game it never gets boring for me because youll never be the best of the best but you can always try and try to get better right now as this review im sitting on nova 4 what is kinda bad for having 15k hours but i play for fun not to have the best world rank  global elite  reason this game never gets boring i think would be because of the updates  new update maybe every 4 weeks or less sometimes  moderate content ok all games has some moderate stuff ranking system ok i was going to put this in the good but it has too many issues sometimes if your a silver 4 you vs nova 2s what is unfair and you lose the game and then also smurfs some people say these people are issues i dont think its much of an issue if anything you can learn from these people able to make money from skins  locked in steam  this also should be in good but i have some issues with it first i have people joining the server saying trading ak47 red line in a match making match this is a competitive game not a casual game like tf2 but then also you can get other games you want for free by selling  trading skins or crates bad content 64 tick servers people always complain about this in csgo but never has been fixed well at least not yet anyway some server do have 128 tick  not valve ones  i have had issues with 64 tick servers like i shoot someone with an awp on the body then they just stand there looking at me then shoot i die they do not the community hard where to start the csgo community is full of rude hackers scammers or account hackers scammers  this issue only came when trading was added hackers  this is a big issue for what some people say but i have never encounter a hacker on a match making match only on one community server account hackers ok this is a huge issue and again only came along from trading people will add you saying i want to trade for your knife for my m9 bayonet fade add me on my main account here fake scam link never click this link if you log in your account will go bye bye just block these guys report them and remove but there are other account hacking ways like the photo scam where they send you a link saying wtf photo link and when you click it it downloads a virus without your permission and takes your csgo items iv had this happen to one of my freinds then he send me a message with the scam link because the virus also sends out a scam link to all your freinds dont trust any links from anyone rude people of corse every game has the mean people in the community its normal for that but it seems csgo has grown a bigger one then most other games if your a new player to csgo i recommend playing with a freind in match making as people will kick you if you are bad at the game only way to stop if you have someone to vote no or if someone votes no but they can always revote to kick you off again and again and keep trying till the last guy accepts hope this review helped you guys thank you guys for reading my review review by goldenhawk

gameplay this game much like but also more so than the other counterstrike series is very competitive and even has its own game mode for such a style of gameplay its noticeably more competitive due to its live streams on twitch and hosted events this means that this games requires you to be more aware of your surroundings being a better team player and good team leader at times it requires to be a lone wolf and get new common selfawards such as a clutch or an ace aka finishing off the opposing team as the last man standing compared to games like call of duty which i consider very fast paced this game takes things slow and even with a 2 minute time limit you are required to take precautions before moving in graphics although im not bothered about graphics and doesnt really play a major factor in my decisions of getting games these graphics have definitely improved from the previous valve engine and still have that counterstrike feel some maps of course are imported from previous counterstrike games and therefore have that similar but still fresh look however the new maps have a definite sense of improvement and renewed style controls & movement the controls to this game are exactly the same to the other counterstrike series and therefore has its playability output increased however for those new to the game and have played previous game such as call of duty and battlefield etc getting used to this may prove difficult to some the controls to counterstrike global offensive are quite simple but getting used to the way the mechanics move may take a small amount of time thats the good thing about counterstrike though its a reasonably easy game to get into but difficult to master although with help from community workshop maps that help improve accuracy youll be able to have a small advantage conclusion overall this game is fantastic bringing a classic fps to a new generation of games this games requires skill and isnt all about shooting first and thinking after especially in competitive situations playing with friends is easily still really fun and has a userfriendly interface even though theres the addition of buying weapon skins etc i find thats a bonus to the game if youre really committed i think that this is a game where you can endlessly rack countless hours up and be none the wiser rating gameplay [910] graphics [810] controls & movement [1010] overall [910]

sometimes you would just rather play with a team of chickens than a team of silver 1s at least the chickens wont flashbang you plus you never have to buy for a chicken so you can save all your money to buy auto snipers every time if you get hungry you can cook them with a molotov and eat them the silver 1s might complain if you do that in chat of course because mics are overrated best of all roosters dont have  im not sure how that last point was relevant but i felt like it had to be said i would rate this game 10 out of 10 but stick to casual if you want to keep your sanity intact also avoid spending $200 on a painted knife in a video game trust me its for the best

good day valve gave us cs 16 made the continuation of the game called cs go in 2012 cs go quality game great physics good gameplay make this game one of the best games in the section of shooters the game has an abundant variety of skins for weapons plus all this that the players themselves can spread the skins and if they get to the top they can appear in the trace updating in the box copious amounts of cards almost all of which moved from 16 with beautiful graphics the game will cost you in the moment 450 p but i assure you youll be happy with what you get apparently speak out i put the game 910 but the game is suitable only for those who know how to shoot  thank you and good luck with your game

counterstrike global offensive review & regret pros you acquire pennies in the form of random drops  you get to be mad with friends  you become culturally enriched  you recognize your online breaking point  you learn teamwork off of the other team cons better connection means better player  luck is a big factor for a lowmid skilled player  hit detection 60% of the time it works every time  hacking happens more than people admit less than people assume  more smurfs than gargamel knows what to do with conclusion all in all its a fun game and even more so with friends the worst part of it being the community to which there is no real escape if it isnt a person trolling or being a pain in your retinas its a person who is light years ahead of you in skill but has a fresh account waiting to ruin your experience the skill gap is more of a chasm leaving for a compilation of infuriating gameplay and a mountain of progression you can find yourself climbing up or falling down the online play is more connection warfare than any other fps ive played meaning players with a bad connection have a strong probability of being held back severely the dedicated servers provided dont help the cause either numerous professional players and full time csgo streamers claim the hit detection simply doesnt cut it even through all this there is good by far the best part about this game is the enjoyment you get out of playing it with a few other friends you can share your victories your laughs your tactics and yes your anger with people you know and people you enjoy so even if you arent enjoying the match you are still enjoying something recommendation if you enjoy first person shooters and havent picked this up yet there is no reason not to give it a try its one of the most popular and populated fps on the market today and will continue to dominate in that respect whether you should continue to play after you have tried it is completely up to you this game has a way of killing the fish it hooks

this game can seem fairly daunting when you first play it especially with the type of gunplay involved but once you get the handle of the guns and recoil this is a super fun game that can be enjoyed by yourself or on you own 910
recommended
if you dont feel like reading full recommendation in the last paragraph first things first counterstrike global offensive csgo is extremely addictive you might disagree but thats probably because youre one of those people that just wants to try and be unique so you hate the game because you want to hate it rather than because its actually bad if youre playing this game to have a good time good times will be had with a bunch of different gamemodes to choose from there is always something for you to do whether youre looking for a fun way to spend a few minutes before leaving or if youre looking for an intense match against other players the game itself is unique in the main gametype competitive the terrorists and the counter terrorists face off to see who will come out on top the terrorists have to plant the bomb in one of the sites and the counter terrorists have to try to prevent that if it happens then they have to try and defuse the bomb in the time given it takes a lot of time and effort to learn the game because it involves learning a lot of different maps and the various locations that can be found there learning how to shoot properly in this game with very unusual shooting patterns and learning how to work as a team to come out on top learning to shoot in this game involves learning how to stop before shooting not shooting in midair and controlling your spray so that as many shots as possible hit the target all of these involve lots of practice for people new to the counter strike series you also need to work together with your team you have to make sure to use your money appropriately for the situation and determine a buying plan with the team you also need to develop a strategy for which players will go where to get the bomb planted in the site or how your team is going to defend the site you need to learn and make callouts and preferably use the voice chat to make sure your team has as much information as possible you need to remember to buy grenades and remember that they are an important part of the game so its worth spending the money on then you need to learn how to use these grenades youve got there is a lot to consider when playing csgo and its an enjoyable experience to learn what to do in what situations communication is a really fun and important thing to have in this game from callouts of enemy players to casual conversations about madagascar communication is everything in csgo your teammates will depend on you and you will depend on them and thats what makes playing this game so fun you have to be able to trust your teammates to give you the right information but you also have to know that no intel is 100% its also important that there is no dislike on the team which you cant always control because you might end up playing with some of the most annoying people in existence but if you dislike someone or someone dislikes you they wont be playing their best and they might not even be playing at all however the matchmaking and ranking systems in csgo are not very good in your average competitive game where youre playing alone you will often notice that youre either with some of the dumbest people on the planet or rarely that your team consists of some pretty cool people that you might want to play with again smurfs people that buy new accounts to play with people below their rank are very common so its not rare that youll get placed in a game with a player that is supposedly far below your rank and playing like a top player the system for dealing with hackers is still a pain even with recent updates that improved it because if you get put against a hacker youre expected to have to deal with playing the entire 45 minute game even if you dont have to deal with the result of the game when the hacker gets banned also there is a chance youll get put against extremely high ranked players if they queued with someone of a low rank on a similar topic you cant surrender when your team is obviously being wrecked and there is no chance of success unless someone on your team abandons i think its really annoying to have to play through 45 minute games even though it tells you at the beginning youre committing to it if no one is enjoying the game its a pain and really just not worth the effort the ranking updown system is extremely painful you never know how close you are to ranking up and its determined solely by whether you win or lose as far as i know it doesnt take into account individual skill this is extremely important in matchmaking since you could get put in a team with awful players and lose because of that and i dont think it takes into account how much your team wins by or the rank difference between the players the rankings are still generally a good representation of a players skill except for the players starting rank but thats not that big of a deal anyways but i believe its still too vague and has a lack of depth a big issue though it would be a hard one to solve is community support when you get banned from competitive because you timed out and couldnt get back in time or due to something out of your control unless you want to spend tons of money on it there is nothing to help you get back in although its always a temporary ban it can still be a pain to have to wait it out its pretty unfair at times although its good that the community is involved and gets to contribute to the game in the form of weapon skins and maps its just not enough to have a good strong community another thing i really dont like about csgo is its community of course there are a lot of good people that are extremely helpful but some people just want to  you off i made a thread about the above issue at some point and there were too many people telling me if you cant get back to the game in 3 minutes you should spend an unreasonably large amount of money upgrading your pc and router its even worse in game there are constantly trolls that dont even try annoying players that will be abusive in the chats although you can block that its still an issue in the community and smurfs and hackers that shouldnt exist a really big issue for me is bots in competitive matches a full team is essential and having a player that cant do anything and wont even listen to the ingame commands that control them half the time is extremely harmful sometimes you cant control when someone has to leave or times out and things like that and not having a lot of control over how that 5th player does things can easily cause the loss of rounds its one of the worst things in the game to be playing at a disadvantage because having an advantage over the other team is everything in csgo competitive you also have no decent way of getting rid of them because if you hurt them you get banned as much as you would for killing an actual person overall i think the game can easily be worth $15 though it does have some flaws most of them arent really gameplay related and i would easily recommend this extremely fun and addicting game id still suggest getting it while its on sale because then of course its cheaper and theyre pretty common so you wont have to wait long but if youre really excited to play counterstrike global offensive then i wouldnt be against buying the game at its original price congratulations if you read through this entire review and i hope it helped in your decision on whether or not to buy this game

if you dont feel like reading full recommendation in the last paragraph first things first counterstrike global offensive csgo is extremely addictive you might disagree but thats probably because youre one of those people that just wants to try and be unique so you hate the game because you want to hate it rather than because its actually bad if youre playing this game to have a good time good times will be had with a bunch of different gamemodes to choose from there is always something for you to do whether youre looking for a fun way to spend a few minutes before leaving or if youre looking for an intense match against other players the game itself is unique in the main gametype competitive the terrorists and the counter terrorists face off to see who will come out on top the terrorists have to plant the bomb in one of the sites and the counter terrorists have to try to prevent that if it happens then they have to try and defuse the bomb in the time given it takes a lot of time and effort to learn the game because it involves learning a lot of different maps and the various locations that can be found there learning how to shoot properly in this game with very unusual shooting patterns and learning how to work as a team to come out on top learning to shoot in this game involves learning how to stop before shooting not shooting in midair and controlling your spray so that as many shots as possible hit the target all of these involve lots of practice for people new to the counter strike series you also need to work together with your team you have to make sure to use your money appropriately for the situation and determine a buying plan with the team you also need to develop a strategy for which players will go where to get the bomb planted in the site or how your team is going to defend the site you need to learn and make callouts and preferably use the voice chat to make sure your team has as much information as possible you need to remember to buy grenades and remember that they are an important part of the game so its worth spending the money on then you need to learn how to use these grenades youve got there is a lot to consider when playing csgo and its an enjoyable experience to learn what to do in what situations communication is a really fun and important thing to have in this game from callouts of enemy players to casual conversations about madagascar communication is everything in csgo your teammates will depend on you and you will depend on them and thats what makes playing this game so fun you have to be able to trust your teammates to give you the right information but you also have to know that no intel is 100% its also important that there is no dislike on the team which you cant always control because you might end up playing with some of the most annoying people in existence but if you dislike someone or someone dislikes you they wont be playing their best and they might not even be playing at all however the matchmaking and ranking systems in csgo are not very good in your average competitive game where youre playing alone you will often notice that youre either with some of the dumbest people on the planet or rarely that your team consists of some pretty cool people that you might want to play with again smurfs people that buy new accounts to play with people below their rank are very common so its not rare that youll get placed in a game with a player that is supposedly far below your rank and playing like a top player the system for dealing with hackers is still a pain even with recent updates that improved it because if you get put against a hacker youre expected to have to deal with playing the entire 45 minute game even if you dont have to deal with the result of the game when the hacker gets banned also there is a chance youll get put against extremely high ranked players if they queued with someone of a low rank on a similar topic you cant surrender when your team is obviously being wrecked and there is no chance of success unless someone on your team abandons i think its really annoying to have to play through 45 minute games even though it tells you at the beginning youre committing to it if no one is enjoying the game its a pain and really just not worth the effort the ranking updown system is extremely painful you never know how close you are to ranking up and its determined solely by whether you win or lose as far as i know it doesnt take into account individual skill this is extremely important in matchmaking since you could get put in a team with awful players and lose because of that and i dont think it takes into account how much your team wins by or the rank difference between the players the rankings are still generally a good representation of a players skill except for the players starting rank but thats not that big of a deal anyways but i believe its still too vague and has a lack of depth a big issue though it would be a hard one to solve is community support when you get banned from competitive because you timed out and couldnt get back in time or due to something out of your control unless you want to spend tons of money on it there is nothing to help you get back in although its always a temporary ban it can still be a pain to have to wait it out its pretty unfair at times although its good that the community is involved and gets to contribute to the game in the form of weapon skins and maps its just not enough to have a good strong community another thing i really dont like about csgo is its community of course there are a lot of good people that are extremely helpful but some people just want to  you off i made a thread about the above issue at some point and there were too many people telling me if you cant get back to the game in 3 minutes you should spend an unreasonably large amount of money upgrading your pc and router its even worse in game there are constantly trolls that dont even try annoying players that will be abusive in the chats although you can block that its still an issue in the community and smurfs and hackers that shouldnt exist a really big issue for me is

pros 1 i can easily say that the competition on matchmaking the ranking system which is only available on csgo made this game is the best of the serie 2 weapon skins and the stickers for sure theyre making the game much more better 3 the operation events theyre selling access for these events and making so many maps and some bonus case drops whoever joins the operation events and theyre fun  i think therere like 3 events already finished and one is still alive cons 1 cheats i really cant imagine how valve cant stand against all these cheaters there are so many cheaters in this game like in every other fps game 2 bad servers not usually but sometimes you lag too much even disconnect because of bad servers cons update for 64 tick servers valve needs to upgrade its servers to 128tick
recommended
i dont really like this game but mostly because of my preferenceopinions csgo isnt really a casual game but more focused to competitive people who have gbsec internet and can run games smoothly and use every trick in the book to use against you however from other peoples experience that i have talked to public competitive matches is not the way to go due to the different types of players it matches you up with for example you have a smurf which is a high ranking competitive player using an alt or some other way to change hisher rank so its lowthat way they get pitted against new players for target practice also a large majority of people on steam get vac banned due to abusing hacks in csgo even top of the line players can be using some form of hack this review only scratches the surface of it but needless to say a lot of people may not like this game as i have not to say its badits just not something i cant mess about on to enjoy without the seriousness like the filthy casual i am 3

quoted the ok lets go prolog that started every single round that all shooter fans from the 90s are familiar with csgo is the latest edition to the one of the most well known and played shooter game through out the history of the world  the counterstrike franchise and just like the counterstrike back then more than a decade ago was never about fancy features stunning graphic or special effects counterstrike global offensive is about the good old classic gameplay but revamped polished and improved such as gameplay balances animation interface presentation audios and visuals then powered by the modern systems and technologies to keep this franchise uptpdate with the flow of time however csgo is not counterstrike 2 or the counterstrike source that merely replaced the engine and optimized a bit on top of it but a better newer and more advanced edition to the series which can shine its veteran brand that was left untouched in the last 13 years i recommend this game to those newcomers who wonder how the shooter game back then was played and interested to give it a try as well as a definite must buy to the old players who have been playing shooters before the terms like ads or aiming down the sight which also known as iron sighting was invented q1 what can i expect as a player who never played a shooter without aiming simulation before a1 youll notice dropping an opponent is no longer as simple as counting one to two meaning right click to aim and left click to pull the trigger youll also need to hone not only your aiming skills but also how you fire your weapon especially the timing in order to synergize the hitting pattern of your weapon on to your target in simple words things just got more difficult in a somewhat inhuman way q2 what else a21 counterstrike has a lot of depths in how you move how you aim how you fire your weapon and even how you approach the position you have in mind after a new round started and thats not the end of it a22 it uses dedlicate server server browser and matchmaking it focuses in a delicate scale of combat where players will play the game through a 5v5 scale by standard default custom scales ranging from 8v8 to 16v16 is supported depending on the actual serverside setting of the server you were connected into a23 given that there is hardly a cheap easy kill for players there is no health regen and it took quite some study and patience to get things started  counterstrike global offensive is a renewal of a classic way of how players used to play shooter games a harsh or perhaps just like i said inhuman shooter game by todays standard for average players sum if you neither a old timer or a newcomer who really interested in the old classic proven way to play a shooter game then there wont be any particular reason i should recommend you to get this game with the only exception being youre sicked and tired how easy todays shooter games are like

computer based tactical shooter extremely high skill if youre willing to put in the effort you will be rewarded russian players is a big problem for everyone in the matchmaking so id recommend anyone for esea there isnt a lot of them  i met a lot of wonderful people in this game friendship forever p 1010

csgo is arguably one of the best first person shooters fps currently available and short story its more then worth for the price now long story though there is a lot more to it first if you are new to cs series before you go for it prepare to die a lot in this game fast reflexes and good aim wins the game and that is something you get only with time so be persistent and more you play it more fun you will have on the brighter side weapons are greatly balanced unlike any other fps so no matter what team you pick you can be sure that your opponents have no adventage over you in that matter now there are several mods and i strongly recommend not to go into competitive unless you are sure you know what you are doing reason for this is because your team will offten expect more then what you can give that will probably result in some insults via chat messages also you may get voted off kicked out of the game that further might result in competitive cooldown so for first time you probably want to try so called arms race mod where you will get your chance to test most of the weapons and figure how they respond also you can move on to some deathmatch for aim improving and of course some classic casual and community competitive before you jump on to real thing also be aware as there is people who simply dont like losing the game they will always find an excuse and that may be poor 64 tick server preformanse or having cheaters in opposing team and as you become good they will probably accuse you as well for those kind of people there is no help actually when i think about it twice whoever seem to bother you you can completely mute him and continue your superawesome game for the actuall cheaters you may hear there is tons of them but again read section above unfortunatelly there is some here and there for what i have played i met only few but they get sorted out by quite unique system called overwatch for the overwatch i wont go into details but very good players get to decide who is cheating and whos not in tons of cases they get false reports again because of people cant stand a loss  bottom line of the review get the game its among the best currently available and you will have tons of fun with it

ok now that ive almost played 1k hours of csgo i made my own picture about this game at first i really love csgo and i like to play with friends and win with good strategies at the beginning of csgo i was pretty bad got ranked in silver but i got better and better now i am at legendary eagle and after so many months of playing csgo so much things have changed at first valve started to set the keys for cases to an amount that is totally overpayed for 1 key u need to pay in euro 229 thats too expensive in my mind because what u get out of it is mostly just crap but the worst in csgo what pisses me off and let me think to stop playing it are those hackers i mean im a person who calls very often someone a hacker for no really good reason but if im not the only one there must be something going on in like every third game in matchmaking that we are playing there is mostly 1 guy who is playing way better than his mates or even his rankskills and i even experienced that some people got even a vacbann while playing a game if valve what do more stuff against the hackers instead of setting the price higher i think more people would even play this game and also those crap 64tick server are horrable u cant even improve ur skills on those server especially if u played already atleast once or twice on faceit oder esea all in all csgo is a very awesome game and one of my favorits but some things just have to change

counterstrike global offensive is certainly an interesting game when i first got into the game i played and was horrible i then put in a lot of time into this game i went from silver 3 when i was first ranked and now im gold nova 3 my highest rank was gold nova master overall this game is a quality game it is frustrating with the ammount of hackers and smurfers however im learning that it is just a part of the game smurfing is understandable hacking is not you need to really understand the maps callouts smokes and flash spots when you jump into a competetive game realize that your money is not your money it is your teams money if you do not play with that mentality you have no reason to play competitive this game is an a for me overall it has the most hours for me on steam for a reason however valve please get a better hack detector i know for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction this time however it seems that the reaction is far better than the action if you come into this game wanting to play something that is exhilerating and competitive you my friend have come to the right place

counter strike global offensive is better than call of duty the video game so dont get cod get counter strike ok i recomend this game for anyone all ages especially 812 yearolds its really great for young minds to get into mindless killing unfortunately there was a major lack of dank memes wich lead to vulgar and explicit language across the globe creating even as much as riots but the game is still good so get it because its good 107wasnt call of duty

ah counter strike it takes me back to to a hot summer day back in 2011 when i pirated half life one and this came with the bundle of course it was 16 well needless to say i sucked more at this game than johnathans mom but i soon grew accustomed to it and then i came up upon this nifty program called steam i bought it  when i still had a cast and i was disgusted by the difficulty but now im writing to you as a silver one and after a year or so i call it progress  dont insult my skills negur ill smoke you quicker than you got your hand in your  well csgo is one of the best games i have ever played and my little clique seems to enjoy it too the gameplay guns maps and whetever else you want to name surpass my expectation if you get this game get it for the competitive not casual this game is subject to numerous updated for stupid stuff due to valve changing all the  we players complain about counter strike is a great way to work on teamwork and it will basiclly change your perception of a true fps the weapons require knowledge on how to use them and they also require you to not be a little whiny girl over them there are so many people who play and the newcomers understand it quick if they are committed to the game i give it nine monica lewenski  out of ten
recommended
this is game is very enjoyable in my opinion i think that if youre into shooters that are slightly more realistic take more skill than just run and gun all the way and you actually have to put time and effort into then csgo is also very strategy based if you dont know what to call to tell your teammates where enemies are your team will more than likely lose that game make sure youre into that kind of thing and youll absolutely love csgo i was a bit sceptical at first but then i really got into it and havent been able to not play it at least once a day hope you guys enjoy it as much as i do

highly recommend this game its the second most famous esport after league of legends and is pretty oldschool which all of us like you plant the c4 and defend it from the counter terrorist team or if you play as ct you have to defend your bombsites a and b from the terrorists in certain maps you can rescue hostages too this game has also many mods casual competitive classic esl game in cs 16 but with cs go ranks if you want to have fun this game can also offer it with the other mods surf deathrun etc

once this game has aimdownsights a major feature of all fps games i might actually consider taking it seriously or even at some point recommending it

who needs a review this is cs compared to 16 and source  this game definitely holds its own no its not perfect but its an excellent up to date version of a multiplayer classic  and in my view  still the finest multiplayer fps in the world

one of the best modern shooters as long as you dont define a good fps game something simmlar to another game for example cod series or some other fps this game will be awesome if you expect awesomley thrilling sp campaign  no you cna play with bots but the gameplay may seem outdated it is nostalgic not outdated it has taken some of the best fps game features and compined it with cs 16 and css great competiteve excperience servers sometimes might not be the best for competiteve experience but there are some free better server alternatives you will not like the game if you expect something like huge map invasions like in planetside 2 or battlefield series it has awesome team play elements hard controlable gun recoil this game is everything you want if you haev the time to actually learn it and understand the simplest principals of how it works after that it is just practise of aiming and teamplay awesome game 910

tldr > tried this out eventually opened a few boxes got some knives and other $100 gun skins sold for profit bought lots of other fun games thanks gaben 1110 feeds my digital gambling itch my route to getting this game was interesting in that i was almost completely turned off what is currently 1974h at the time of writing this review my most played game i initially had traded for this game and accumulated around 20ish hours of playtime only to have my copy revoked fortunately someone was nice enough to gift me this game a short time later if you like teambased multiplayer games gambling by opening boxes firstperson shooters fps gambling by opening boxes the counterstrike series 16 was my baby and gambling then you will really enjoy this game the aesthetics are very good  the amount of detail in the background guns and character models is welldone the sounds and music are great and add to the intense atmosphere but i eventually muted the music in favor of my own usually ariana grandes soothing voice while i unleash hell on my enemies except in competitive where i dont play music you can even buy custom music packs if you are offered it randomly however i dont recommend doing this unless you have some extra cash or really love a track you can borrow anyones custom music if you want to sample its nice that the gun sounds are distinct enough that you can identify what weapon is being fired with enough practice the controls are easy to learn and typical of your standard firstperson shooter there is a very helpful tutorial you can play that shows you everything you need to know complete with valves helpful popup tips the learning curve is minimal to extreme depending on your experience with fps games and how far up you intend to climb the competitive ladder unless you wish to only play casual game modes i was rusty as i had not been playing fps games for years last counterstrike title was 16 and last fps was probably black ops 2 on the ps3 so i waited until i had 110ish hours of casual play before i felt good enough to play competitive i havent turned back since although i sometimes dabble in casual game modes there are a variety of game modes like deathmatch arms race kills give you a different weapon and you must eventually obtain a kill with a knife to win and classic objective games bomb plantdefusal and hostage rescue in casual play there will be a maximum of 10 players on each team while in competitive play it is always a 5 vs 5 format people who are kickeddropped will be replaced by a controllable bot gameplay can be fastpaced and intense however at many times especially in competitive it can be very slow and equally intense if not more unlike games like battlefield and call of duty you cannot aim down the sights ads with every weapon instead you can only ads with a scoped battle rifle for either the terrorist t or counterterrorist ct side there are three sniper rifles you can use with 2 levels of zoom there is a pistol on the terrorist side that can be switched to burstfire and a rifle on the counterterrorist side that can be similarly switched cts also have a pistol and assault rifle that starts off with silencer quieter more accurate shots that can be removed there are a few weapons that can be switched out ex the m4a4 for cts can be switched with the silenced m4a1s you can also switch default skins on guns with ones you have in your inventory these skins can be obtained either through random drops as you play given at the end of every game or by opening boxes this costs money unless you are a trader you can also obtain skins from the steam marketplace or even outside it but i highly recommend you check resources like rglobaloffensivetrade on reddit to help you out in combat you can crouch but not go prone you cannot climbmantle over objects however you can boost in competitive game modes where unit collision is allowed by jumping onto a crouched player in order to reach a higher position there is recoil in the game and accurate range plays an important role in determining whether or not you will actually hit your opponent bullets can travel through material like doors and various types of cover for less damage wearing a helmet will block one shot to the head however and other subsequent headshots will result in an instant kill game matches consist of several rounds 15 in casual 30 in competitive best of and at the beginning of each round you must purchase your equipment  consisting of your primary and secondary weapons armordefusal kithostage rescue kit and grenades smoke flash decoy etc you can hold one primary and one secondary weapon if you die you will start the next round with only the default starting pistol if you live you will refill ammo for whatever weapons you are holding money is used to buy all items and money is given to all players depending on their performance ex winning side gets more money a critical element in this game is the lack of selfregeneration  what you have is what you have your health is only refilled when a new round begins so playing smartly will aid you greatly i do recommend playing competitive to help you understand the mechanics of the game better  there are generally a lot of nice people willing to help new players overall the game is easily one of my favorite in the fps genre and this is being raised also as a battlefield and call of duty child and is even more amazing if you can manage to play with friends if you are interested in multiplayer fps gameplay at all you definitely must check this out absolutely recommend

if you could see it then youd understand that glistening antikoan punctuates the chorus of coldplays skyscraping 2005 single speed of sound and the lyrics profound meaninglessness has doubled as a mission statement for the megabands career thus far theyve established a reputation as mainstream rocks koi pond architects designing music thats deceptively shallow but if caught at the right moment shimmeringly beautiful to the point that you could focus on it for hours impossibly indulgent on a sonic level while retaining the intellectual depth of a cell phone commercial coldplays catalog is largely experientiala reflecting pool for the hopes dreams and heartaches that listeners wish to apply to the music this pliability has meant that coldplay can come off as impersonal a gaseous giant of anonymity in rock musics solar system nearly 10 years ago the stultifyingly dense third album x&y threatened to swallow the band completely as coldplay refined the postpostpunk affectations of 2002s a rush of blood to the head until they were left with an immobile monolith on the verge of overreaching coldplay doubled down with 2008s viva la vida or death and all his friends a worldbeating document of giddy experimentation and costumerock bathos that stands as their most thrilling impressionistic work mylo xyloto followed three years later which took its predecessors widescreen template and enlarged it to imaxsize indulging in ravey piano stabs and nightflight flourishes with the colorfilled exuberance of a child that cant stop eating crayons mylo xyloto was further proof that coldplay are at their best when they embrace their corniest impulses their sixth album ghost stories finds them taking a sharp left turn preceded by the nonsingle midnight a watery electrofolk bon iver facsimile accompanied with a video reminiscent of an itunes visualizer nearly everything about the arrival of ghost stories has seemed small the ninesong tracklist the spartan deepblue angelswings cover the disappointing lack of costumes the absence of grandiosity signaled to eager fans and sneering bystanders alike that this time around something might be a little off that something can be traced to martins marriage to actress and $600handcream guru gwyneth paltrow which quietly imploded in march of this year more a separation than an outright divorce recent court documents revealed that the couple are still living together and in a 2008 spin profile the only subject that the otherwise affable martin bristled against discussing was his personal life with paltrow as long as the worlds known him chris martin has also proved impossible to truly know so whether his recent familial troubles would seep into his bands latest was anyones guess and yet ghost stories is unmistakably coldplays breakup album a subdued work that finds martin and his band crisply moping through midtempo soundscapes and fuzzy electronic touches that have the visceral impact of a down comforter tumbling down a flight of stairs featuring production from longtime collaborators daniel green and rik simpson along with behindtheboards pro paul epworth dronetechno auteur jon hopkins and kanye west collaborator mike dean the record is serene and weightless to a fault coldplay abandon the musical tourism and extroverted strides of their last few albums and find themselves adrift the closest the record comes to a bona fide anthem is the moderately enjoyable a sky full of stars a rocketfueled single on the level of clocks and speed of sound tainted by swedish dance producer aviciis cheapsounding drum presets and boilerplate synth motifs i dont care if you tear me apart martin wails at the peak of the songs endless chorus a passionate exclamation that doubles one of the most nakedly personal admissions hes made on record ghost stories certainly sounds like the product of someone working out their private pain in public unfortunately the results are less blood on the tracks and more can i borrow a feeling coldplays catalog has plenty of examples where martins words have failed him but his diaristic reflections on ghost stories are abnormally painful tell me you love me if you dont then lie he coos on the spandau balletgonedisney ballad true love during the plodding anothers arms he ruminates on lost domestic bliss watching tv with a loved one your body on my body if the expression of carnal closenessviativo makes you cringe imagine how he feels ink is the albums most indefensible moment musically and lyrically and the song handily snatches the title of worst coldplay song from x&ys impossibly leaden inmagnets stinker what if got a tattoo and the pains alright martin cries while running through a series of loveaspermanence metaphors over rippling guitar and burbling atmospherics ripped from phil collins tarzan soundtrack the last time coldplay indulged in rainforest rock it was viva la vidas transcendent gorgeous strawberry swing which featured martin exclaiming beatifically its such a perfect day on ink he moves from vine to vine until swinging in solitude at the tracks end exclaiming with a sigh all i know is that i love you so so much that it hurts fittingly ink is one of the few tracks on ghost stories that leaves a mark and thats partially due to martins lovelyasever vocals when not chronicling his own pain he occasionally breaks into appealing birdsong a wordless pitterpatter that marks the chorus of the records pleasantenough lead single magic otherwise ghost stories is a collection of unmemorable songs from a band thats made enough memories to last a lifetime everything sounds pristinethis is a coldplay album and instrumentally the band is as exacting as everbut by the dreary pianoled closer o youre left with a series of songs that are fragile plain and forgettable conventional wisdom says x&y is coldplays worst album but amidst that records shiftless bloat there were realdeal highlights that hit with blunt impact and have since stood the test of time ghost stories contains no such moments and thus threatens to rob x&y of its dubious title its intimate nature shares the most kinship with coldplays first album 2000s peerless parachutes twelve years later that album sounds like the work of a different band and thats because it is coldplay have become one of the biggest acts in the world since their comparatively modest debut and as a result ghost stories attempts to return to closemicd intimacy come across as outoftouch as lucille bluth asking how much a banana costs the callback to parachutes hushed whispers also means that ghost stories is the first time coldplay has sounded explicitly selfreferential theyre a band thats withstood enough comparisons to u2 over the years and the warmedover leftovers that have marked bono and cos last decade as a creative entity are enough to suggest that if coldplay continue to head down the path of addressing their own legacy their best moments are truly behind them

a nice game with the traditional counterstrike feeling im not much of a reviewer the aiming feels alot different compared to 16 cz or css i really like the graphical design of the game and its really fun to play with friends i like the addition of skins in this game purely for the reason of seeing the same guns all the time can get quite boring and for some people that likes to collect items for games but never gotten into the more heavier item games such as tf2 or other things it can be quite nice though of course there are the fair share of fools who believe that skins makes you imediately better it really doesnt but id recommend the game its kinda fun but you can get banned if youre too good in a low skillbracket just saying

if im going to compare this and css i want to say that css is more for the fun stuff like minigame gungame surf ba_jail and etc but csgo this game its a really good game actually in the start i was thinking it was bad well i was wrong this game is very good but i think its mostly for the competitive players btw there is also a new game mode demolution if you want to play serious you should get this instead of css this game is worth the full price 455

counterstrike is said to be the most popular tactical teambased firstperson shooter with a timeless soul the fourth fullfledged part of this game counterstrike global offensive makes old school players feel at renovated home the rules are known to all yet hardly anyone knows everything and its obvious that devil is in the details you can play in several modes but classic competitive deserves attention primarily five terrorists against five counterterrorists in two varieties plantingdefusing bomb or detentionrelease of hostages the formula is simple but not simplistic its a pity that there are many players trying to cheat fortunately some of them are consistently disqualified by valve the most beautiful thing in this game is visible growth and major obstacle may be the first steps and initial figuring out the system and players behavior there are neither unusual skills nor fancy tricks the tools are simple  a dozen guns and other weapons like grenades as well as your ideas and tactics which you can share with others that actually being a must it is gratifying that this product is still being patched and from time to time new maps are created and there are real gems among them well of course its a chance to meet a lot of great gamers with whom you can play other productions as well you must be prepared to be yelled at sometimes you may hear you dont know how to play that you are fking noob with no skill one way or another csgo teaches humility and cooperation ive never been an avid fan of this series but this game is really addictive because i am able to feel that i play better with each match the magic progress is oozing and there is no way to measure this numerically
recommended
game is for nubs 1110 would bang again
recommended
if you havent already played a counter strike game then youre doing something wrong global offensive is just like the rest simply improved as time progresses best part of the counter strike series is that you know exactly what to expect from each new installment

in love this game
recommended
another game by the valve company its the counter strike  the game that we all should love the competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork skill and tactics its nice that team with a leader a guy that command hisher teamates via team chat or voice chat will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader soo the teamwork in this game is very superb all the weapons in this game is balanced so no matter which gun you used as long as you can used it you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon and if you didnt like competitive you can have fun too with a call of duty style team deathmatch and free for all its really fun all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever recommended to all competitive and also casual players  ps you can actually earned money from this game item drop so you can actually have fun and earned money d

a worthy update to counterstrike source csgo improves upon tons of mechanics that were lackluster or made the game too easy to get good at in its predecessor i think its clearly safe to say this game also removed the stain left in the professional counterstrike community after a few cal judges made unnecessary bans to advance their teams through tournaments its already had almost two dozen torunaments with multiple professional 5man teams that many may recognize from cs 16 this game made quick work to fix some things that were decidedly annoying in css one being the toooften consistent bullet patterns when not on a flat surfaceeg jumping surfing et cetera some guns have been removedlooking at you mp5 and m3 although they have been given replacements and are joined with other new weapons that make the game much more fresh and keep things interesting overall combining this with the skin updates that will now be regular the game can even pay for itself within a few weeks the features allowing you to download demos of your games watch the pros and casual high ranks alike live and tons of exclusives for watching tournaments not only brings up community morale but increases the excitement of the game you can also link your twitch account to make it all easier very cool community servers are surprisingly still full and almost as numerous as the last 3 games even though competitive play has been enhanced with an elo system and ranks to go along with it like always if you can get good at this game youll be good at any first person shooter making it a key title to own and play it brings a set of new graphics that are amazing to compare to the other cs gamesnostlagia withstanding made all the better because of valves typical work to offload graphics processing to the cpu when possible for what its worth it hardly tolls even lowend gpus like my current 525m with maxed settings and very high levels of antialiasing im able to keep a minimum of 80 frames per second and average about 150 all in all im pleased to say that i have over 600 hours sunk into this game and am only about 200 hours off surpassing my css playtime as of writing valve did an amazing job with this game and i cant wait to see what its successor in source 2 will look like

command and strike global alert is a game this turnbased roleplaying game combimes stealth and action not too distant to the assassins creed series unlike the assassins creed series however this game doesnt mess around a risky lack of story really pays off with the powerful emphasis on coopertative puzzle solving id caution new players to the call of strike global warfare series as the steep learning curve is somewhat of a disservice to the overall experience however if you can get over that curvature with ease the experience opens up a lot of interesting rpg elements not typically seen in a third person shooter if youre looking for a similar feel to the antiquated versions of this game but with more refined visuals theres no reason to not pick this up i give this realtime strategy visual novel a snow white out of a disney princess

i am one of those  veterans who started playing with counter strike 16 didnt have my own account by those time though and i have long story of relationship with counter strike universe and csgo universe especially telling in advance  i made long way from hating csgo up to loving it but anyway to the point for people who dont know what counter strike is and who never heard about this game before counter strike is unique semireallistic game which is build around global opposition of different terrorist groups somali pirates phoenix connection etc and different law enforcement groups sas gign gsg9 swat fbi etc game features several rounds from 16 up to 32 depends on a gamemode and server rules where every player have only one life per round as soon as round time ends or one of the teams eliminated round is finished after every round players respawn and acquire a sum of money to buy a weapon and different gadgets armor flash and smoke grenades etc game features several game modes classic hostage rescue maps with ct_prefix counter terrorists must steal hostage or any of the several hostages from a place secured by terrorists and bring this hostage to a safe zone as soon as hostage is brought or whole terrorist team eliminated counter terrorists win if time ends and counter terrorists did not bring hostage to a safe area terrorists win as soon as counter terrorist carries hostage whone ct team gets extra 130 minute time to reach safe place classic bomb defuse maps with de_prefix terrorists must blow one of two bomb plants problem is theres only one bomb per whole team as soon as bomb carrying terrorist falls dead another terrorist can pick the bomb and plant it at the bomb plant point counter terrorists can not destroy the bomb or bring it to another place if its fallen as soon as bomb is planted round time stops and to win counter terrorists must defuse bomb if bomb is blown even though all terrorists are dead terrorist team wins the round gungame honestly forgive me if i make mistake here but its one of the gametypes i barely played the least teamplay addicted game type you start with one of the weakest weapons and as soon as you kill anyone you get new weapon as soon as you come through all the weapons including knife you win the map you instantly respawn after death i remember there was also gungame gametype where you had only one life but gungame is not my cup of tea so lets finish on this deathmatch also one of the gametypes where you respawn right after death but unlike gungame you choose weapon you want at the start of a new life you should kill as many enemies as you can thanks to respawn in random places of the map fight itself reminds a messy war where enemy can shoot you in the back just because he respawned there and so on i dont normally play this gametype aswell but if i remember right this gametype was brought by community also community made more gametypes like zombiemod bunnyhop or whatever is it called and deathrun where you need to reach some point now for people who played cs for a while main differences from cs 16 and css here are partially new weapons updated radio commands updated hostage rescue mode where you need to actually pick up only one hostage and bring him to the safe place weapons have changed physics so youll need to learn everything again and an old problem which became more important duo to competative gamemode cheaters cant say there are many cheaters but when you meet them whole fun is ruined same when you meet stupid people as we reviewed the game i tried to be as short as possible ill express my mind on it firstly i hated this game it seemed like you need to deliver like 10 hits to your enemy it had and it still has changed radio commands yes i was one of those few people who used radio commands you couldnt and still cant choose your player model only team like in css beta you had and still have some grenades which probably dont even exist decoy and incendinary the molotov analogue btw molotov here bounces from the wall wtf or at least i was unable to find any info about them in hostage rescue mode why would you need to save only one hostage why would cops leave another one behind you couldnt place silencer on m4 and base ct pistol or use flashlight and many more things which i couldnt remeber right now with time valve fixed their gaps and i came to some reanalysis of the situation first of all lets all agree with the fact that csgo is unlike css a complete sequel of an online game so of course it should have some differences like radio commands weapon reballance and stuff more over with time it turns out you dont need to hit your enemy 10 times its just you moving so thats why you dont hit the enemy the ballance itself is still the same 16 shots depends on what weapons do you use indeed you cant use player model but they made 5 different models for each side so youll have no more 3 twins out of 5 people playing which actually compensates your choice of the model some changes were made for the sake of ballance talking of hostages and some weapons accuracy grenades well firstly i cant say these grenades are something scifi like i believe that even if they dont exist humanity can create them using our own technologies also valve made special inventory where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons so now you can use old good m4a1 with silencer just as you did in css and cs 16 among with usp and its silencer and another new pistol for exchange they also made different skins for all weapons so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color though imo its a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players weapons just because they love colorful schemes talking about radio commands again its better using voip instead of them so updating radio is not a big deal and now id say the best part of csgo  its competative mode competative mode features only classic gamemodes in competative mode you play 5vs5 the more wins you get the higher your rank is the higher your rank is the harder opponents and better allies are met competative mode is where whole tactical potential of a game is shown theres no map with perfect spot enemy can always attack from the side so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other or rush same place from different directions to capture it with no any losses heres where all weapons are needed short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range though medium range weapons are the most often used i must admit you can play in a party with your friends but be ready because game will give you more cooperated team of course not everything is perfect  sometimes game gives you wrong ranks or you meet alwaysragingidiot or what is worse cheater who kills you through the wall but all in all its a good game a good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths what else can i say if you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike or you are thinking of buying it or not my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game its just the game you should understand too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games

if you havent already played a counter strike game then youre doing something wrong global offensive is just like the rest simply improved as time progresses best part of the counter strike series is that you know exactly what to expect from each new installment

in love this game

another game by the valve company its the counter strike  the game that we all should love the competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork skill and tactics its nice that team with a leader a guy that command hisher teamates via team chat or voice chat will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader soo the teamwork in this game is very superb all the weapons in this game is balanced so no matter which gun you used as long as you can used it you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon and if you didnt like competitive you can have fun too with a call of duty style team deathmatch and free for all its really fun all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever recommended to all competitive and also casual players  ps you can actually earned money from this game item drop so you can actually have fun and earned money d

counterstrikes globals offensive is a game which has surely bucked the trend in making a new counter strikes games as they have put the awp in tf2 instead which is a better game my least favourite part of this new counter strikes is when i was was running down the hill at the terrorism man and i shot him first but he shot me instead this is like that controversy in star wars when they say ham shot the man first because when georgie lucas remade the film with better actors its called lord of the rings if you are interested in watching the special effects are to die for and there is a talking tree which is just genius ham solo was shot in the face and died which made lots of people sad because he was a really good actor especially that bit when he got frozen in the black ice stuff andhad to stand still in an uncomfortable position for a really long time i once had a job where i was on the register at a shop and had to stand still for a really long time but i entertained myself by committing minor acts of shoplifting really it all just comes back to crime and if you want to be the counter terrorism guy and shoot the bad guys in the face this is the game for you but if you are a renegade soul who just needs to see the world burn like the bad guy in that batman film who died then i would suggest a different game like peggle

this game will bring you alot of fun and hours played ive played the first counterstrike 7 years ago ive been a counterstrike fan since i first tried it out ive got a total of 4000 hours in total of all the counterstrike games combined over my 7 years of service this game is alot of fun and the operations are really great if you feel like you dont hit either become a better player by training your aim and reaction or you could switch from valves standard 64 tick 64 updates per second to a paid 128 tick server costs if youre gonna do it the pro way some free servers for it in the server browser this game is very cheap and on some sales which is common it can cost around 3 thats the price you sell one or two cases for which drops very common this game is updated and maintained alot this is a very good game and i support it to 100%

great game usually a one time fee of $15 but the past winter sale had it at $299copy valve does have some work to do on this game while other games have balancing issues and a crappy player base this game is not so much affected by that so much as it is affected by the subpar servers about 95% uptime but when they go down you get a penalty for leaving the match and get banned from competitive servers this may happen multiple times in a row and an undeserving player may find themselves left with much rage and a 7 day ban

csgo is currently my favorite game no other game comes close to this one csgo is a great game for casual and serious gamers if you want to have some fun you can just join a casual match or browse the community servers for nice community made mods like jailbreak hidenseek or zombie escape but you can also play serious games by joining competitive games those require 2 full teams made of 5 players they play a full match against each other every single match is recorded which means you can report cheaters and other bad gamers cheaters get banned pretty fast in this game sometimes they dont even last 3 hours and they account is banned this game beats other games like battlefield for cod when it comes to competitive gameplay once you played csgo you cant go back to them anymore because they feel like kiddy games you can also download a lot of custom maps made by the community valve doesnt forces you to buy dlcs like other game publishers

first off if you play other shooters and are the same way i am you will hate this game at first there is no aiming the game is very frusterating until you really get the hang of it there is no realism here at all even if they think there isbut the game still manages to be fun after spending some time in it and really learning what i was doing requires patience because you will die alot

i am one of those  veterans who started playing with counter strike 16 didnt have my own account by those time though and i have long story of relationship with counter strike universe and csgo universe especially telling in advance  i made long way from hating csgo up to loving it but anyway to the point for people who dont know what counter strike is and who never heard about this game before counter strike is unique semireallistic game which is build around global opposition of different terrorist groups somali pirates phoenix connection etc and different law enforcement groups sas gign gsg9 swat fbi etc game features several rounds from 16 up to 32 depends on a gamemode and server rules where every player have only one life per round as soon as round time ends or one of the teams eliminated round is finished after every round players respawn and acquire a sum of money to buy a weapon and different gadgets armor flash and smoke grenades etc game features several game modes classic hostage rescue maps with ct_prefix counter terrorists must steal hostage or any of the several hostages from a place secured by terrorists and bring this hostage to a safe zone as soon as hostage is brought or whole terrorist team eliminated counter terrorists win if time ends and counter terrorists did not bring hostage to a safe area terrorists win as soon as counter terrorist carries hostage whone ct team gets extra 130 minute time to reach safe place classic bomb defuse maps with de_prefix terrorists must blow one of two bomb plants problem is theres only one bomb per whole team as soon as bomb carrying terrorist falls dead another terrorist can pick the bomb and plant it at the bomb plant point counter terrorists can not destroy the bomb or bring it to another place if its fallen as soon as bomb is planted round time stops and to win counter terrorists must defuse bomb if bomb is blown even though all terrorists are dead terrorist team wins the round gungame honestly forgive me if i make mistake here but its one of the gametypes i barely played the least teamplay addicted game type you start with one of the weakest weapons and as soon as you kill anyone you get new weapon as soon as you come through all the weapons including knife you win the map you instantly respawn after death i remember there was also gungame gametype where you had only one life but gungame is not my cup of tea so lets finish on this deathmatch also one of the gametypes where you respawn right after death but unlike gungame you choose weapon you want at the start of a new life you should kill as many enemies as you can thanks to respawn in random places of the map fight itself reminds a messy war where enemy can shoot you in the back just because he respawned there and so on i dont normally play this gametype aswell but if i remember right this gametype was brought by community also community made more gametypes like zombiemod bunnyhop or whatever is it called and deathrun where you need to reach some point now for people who played cs for a while main differences from cs 16 and css here are partially new weapons updated radio commands updated hostage rescue mode where you need to actually pick up only one hostage and bring him to the safe place weapons have changed physics so youll need to learn everything again and an old problem which became more important duo to competative gamemode cheaters cant say there are many cheaters but when you meet them whole fun is ruined same when you meet stupid people as we reviewed the game i tried to be as short as possible ill express my mind on it firstly i hated this game it seemed like you need to deliver like 10 hits to your enemy it had and it still has changed radio commands yes i was one of those few people who used radio commands you couldnt and still cant choose your player model only team like in css beta you had and still have some grenades which probably dont even exist decoy and incendinary the molotov analogue btw molotov here bounces from the wall wtf or at least i was unable to find any info about them in hostage rescue mode why would you need to save only one hostage why would cops leave another one behind you couldnt place silencer on m4 and base ct pistol or use flashlight and many more things which i couldnt remeber right now with time valve fixed their gaps and i came to some reanalysis of the situation first of all lets all agree with the fact that csgo is unlike css a complete sequel of an online game so of course it should have some differences like radio commands weapon reballance and stuff more over with time it turns out you dont need to hit your enemy 10 times its just you moving so thats why you dont hit the enemy the ballance itself is still the same 16 shots depends on what weapons do you use indeed you cant use player model but they made 5 different models for each side so youll have no more 3 twins out of 5 people playing which actually compensates your choice of the model some changes were made for the sake of ballance talking of hostages and some weapons accuracy grenades well firstly i cant say these grenades are something scifi like i believe that even if they dont exist humanity can create them using our own technologies also valve made special inventory where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons so now you can use old good m4a1 with silencer just as you did in css and cs 16 among with usp and its silencer and another new pistol for exchange they also made different skins for all weapons so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color though imo its a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players weapons just because they love colorful schemes talking about radio commands again its better using voip instead of them so updating radio is not a big deal and now id say the best part of csgo  its competative mode competative mode features only classic gamemodes in competative mode you play 5vs5 the more wins you get the higher your rank is the higher your rank is the harder opponents and better allies are met competative mode is where whole tactical potential of a game is shown theres no map with perfect spot enemy can always attack from the side so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other or rush same place from different directions to capture it with no any losses heres where all weapons are needed short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range though medium range weapons are the most often used i must admit you can play in a party with your friends but be ready because game will give you more cooperated team of course not everything is perfect  sometimes game gives you wrong ranks or you meet alwaysragingidiot or what is worse cheater who kills you through the wall but all in all its a good game a good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths what else can i say if you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike or you are thinking of buying it or not my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game its just the game you should understand too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games

a worthy update to counterstrike source csgo improves upon tons of mechanics that were lackluster or made the game too easy to get good at in its predecessor i think its clearly safe to say this game also removed the stain left in the professional counterstrike community after a few cal judges made unnecessary bans to advance their teams through tournaments its already had almost two dozen torunaments with multiple professional 5man teams that many may recognize from cs 16 this game made quick work to fix some things that were decidedly annoying in css one being the toooften consistent bullet patterns when not on a flat surfaceeg jumping surfing et cetera some guns have been removedlooking at you mp5 and m3 although they have been given replacements and are joined with other new weapons that make the game much more fresh and keep things interesting overall combining this with the skin updates that will now be regular the game can even pay for itself within a few weeks the features allowing you to download demos of your games watch the pros and casual high ranks alike live and tons of exclusives for watching tournaments not only brings up community morale but increases the excitement of the game you can also link your twitch account to make it all easier very cool community servers are surprisingly still full and almost as numerous as the last 3 games even though competitive play has been enhanced with an elo system and ranks to go along with it like always if you can get good at this game youll be good at any first person shooter making it a key title to own and play it brings a set of new graphics that are amazing to compare to the other cs gamesnostlagia withstanding made all the better because of valves typical work to offload graphics processing to the cpu when possible for what its worth it hardly tolls even lowend gpus like my current 525m with maxed settings and very high levels of antialiasing im able to keep a minimum of 80 frames per second and average about 150 all in all im pleased to say that i have over 600 hours sunk into this game and am only about 200 hours off surpassing my css playtime as of writing valve did an amazing job with this game and i cant wait to see what its successor in source 2 will look like

command and strike global alert is a game this turnbased roleplaying game combimes stealth and action not too distant to the assassins creed series unlike the assassins creed series however this game doesnt mess around a risky lack of story really pays off with the powerful emphasis on coopertative puzzle solving id caution new players to the call of strike global warfare series as the steep learning curve is somewhat of a disservice to the overall experience however if you can get over that curvature with ease the experience opens up a lot of interesting rpg elements not typically seen in a third person shooter if youre looking for a similar feel to the antiquated versions of this game but with more refined visuals theres no reason to not pick this up i give this realtime strategy visual novel a snow white out of a disney princess

before i start i will admit even if i once was a hardcore first person shooter player i kind of got tired of them over the years i had counter strike source and day of defeat source but i pretty much only wanted them for garrys mod the last cs i played for hours and hours was the 16 version of the original and that was over 10 years ago now after these summer sales i saw csgo at 5 looking at other mainstream serious fps these days like cod and battlefield that usually go arround the 6070 not counting the load of dlcs it seems like the best deal ever it actually is the awnser is yes oh man i do still suck a bit at these games after playing nothing but tf2 for when it comes to fps games but i still had fun like the old days the game is done to perfection guns work as intended no stupid recoil like the recoil you see in other  fps games here it looks realistic and it feels good the maps are good as well feel just like the originals while the new ones add originality and the ones made by the community are always amazing the gameplay is smooth right now im using a  pc since my old one kind of blew up it probably could not handle my afro and this piece of crap runs the game without that much issues on lowmid settings while games like cod ghost or hardline always bring dumb problems because of horrible optimization i have like 30 hours so far with this game and i bought it on the summer sales that ended like a week or two ago i have been in normal servers filled with both new and old players i have tried bots and i have played 10 matchmaking games so far and without counting the mm match where i ended with a bunch of russian s who did nothing but to yell crap on their microphone blame me and then ragequit i had nothing but fun and thats another thing the community is amazing some people might stay silent most of the time but they wont get that mad unless you really screw up something or act 100%  like dropping your gun at the start of the round buying nothing going 1 vs 5 with your knife and then say that this game is a bad ripoff of call of duty i have found one dude like that and i think he was not trolling but totally serious and well i did  up at times on my first matches i wasnt used to the new buy menus the changes of the maps the new models i find of teamkilled 2 friends so far but they where not mad probably because they where new too at some point and know how it sucks to be that guy the sale is over and it doesnt cost 5 anymore still the full price is like 12 or so and if you really like competitive and serious multiplayer fps action this is your game doesnt matter if youre a filthy casual a nooblord or the classic mlg that will probably kill the other team in 30 seconds with 5 bullets all headshots oh and while the weapons feel balanced i got to say that the shotguns are really underrated further more i fcking love them it might be because im an oldschool unreal tournament player i have been in tournaments and  and my favorite weapons from that game was the flak cannon but i find it fairly easy to kill scrubs who tryhard with m4s and aks with 1 or 2 shoots to the face while they crouch and spray their bullets all over mordor give them a try if youre new you wont regret it if you dont believe it look at the screenshoot below at the end i played nothing but classic pistol rounds and nova the whole game and i ended up with 4318 being the mvp of the match and im not that good you can probably do it way better than me besides killing 1 player with the nova gives like 900$ while weapons like the awp best sniper rifle only give 100$ whats not to like and if in the end you find the game boring just idle on servers with time you will get drops and items that you can easily sell in the market with some time you will get your money back i have gotten 2 so far just with the new crates so httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid281036740

counterstrike is one of the biggest names in the pc gaming community and for good reason it revolutionized multiplayer fps games after the original cs hit shelves along with 16 and source counterstrike global offensive has set the bar even higher and jumped over it tenfold sticking close to its roots global offensive employs its famous bomb defusal and hostage mission game modes available in both casual and ranked 5v5 competetive types along with integrating some other fun modes such as arms race and deathmatch bomb and hostage scenarios are lead by a buying system encouraging successful kills and objectives like planting the bomb to aid in buying gear in the next round players are required to use teamwork and tactics in order to come out on top against the enemy team and winning a game gives a sense of satisfaction unlike any other firstperson shooter game ive ever experienced if you are expecting this game to be anything like call of duty or battlefield you will be sorely disappointed counterstrike global offensive is an excellent addition to the cs saga and i strongly recommend picking it up and giving it a try

best cs ever so far thanks to the match making system and epic skins competitive mode finally brings possibility to play the game in the way how it always should have been played without necessity of finding 9 people to play so called mix the rank system finds a valid opponent for everyone whether you are newb or cspro you will have be matched against opponents at your skill level and comparing to other games with similar mm systems this one in cs really works well after like 100 games 30 round game happens very often the only thing i would like to see in game is 5v5 casual mode with rules like in competetiveso i could still play with my friends who are banned for disconnecting

csgo is a nearperfect multiplayer shooter unlike the previous versions which were often difficult to get in to this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels it has a large community and a well supported workshop ensuring that this discountpriced game will be around for years to come in short you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster its been around for years and has spawned many imitators the game isnt much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original half life 2 was however valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis is it worth getting if you already own counter strike source yes css was always counter strike shoehorned into the source engine csgo feels far more like a standalone game valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game the best feature must be the competitive play you cannot leave these matches or youll suffer a temporary ban from the feature after 10 wins in this mode youll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level these matches are exciting occasionally scary or frustrating but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game ever

csgo may seem too familiar to those who have played source source felt a bit wishywashy with no official modes and servers csgo is not only wellorganised but more catering to less experienced players whilst still retaining the essence of what makes counterstrike a proffessional gamers shooter new weapons may seem more like reskins but i prefer the simplicity of having no silencers and the properly working stats and decent achievements right from the games release as oppose to an update 5 years after the games release or something global offensives graphics arent vastly different but it is certainly the best looking shooter on the source engine to date and doesnt look as outdated as it should do for a 2004 game engine the game seems well balanced snipers are impressive the scoutssg is no longer terrible and genuinely viable in competitive matches blur is added to sniper scopes while moving to balance them too wweapons do seem balanced and people use more than just ak mr deagle and awp the 4 game modes  casual competitive classic competitive demolition and arms race means theres something for everyone sure theres no capture the flag but in a game where theres no sprinting health regen killstreaks aim down sights or ability to revive or heal teammates its probably for the best gun game is finally officially supported and demolition simplifies the game by removing the need to buy weapons ive always wanted to try counterstrike properly but source was just far too disorganised and had other distractions global offensive brings the classic game into a modern setting without falling into the trap of being a call of duty clone its still counterstrike with exactly the same gameplay mechanics as the original but presented in a more appealing and fun package it certainly feels more welcoming for newcomers than source which is a big plus not only for competitive gaming but for the franchise as a whole the only thing lacking is team deathmatch however this would require a create a class which would turn it into cod arms race fills that spot and demolition combines classic cs with gun game the primary reason why this game is more accomodating is because it was meant to be a port of source to xbox live so obviously some things needed to be changed or added to broaden its appeal and for the most part valve have done a great job matchmaking is efficient bots for offline play are exclellent with decent ai programming rather than the predictably linear source ai and the package as whole is much more modern as oppose to source where it was a case of too little too late when they decided to update it if you havent played cs before and want to give it a go this is the best game equally if you are a seasoned veteran it might make for a refereshing start if you are looking to get back into it

lots of reaction time and skill based gameplay constant updates to teamsided maps skins and workshop support vac misses a lot of cheaters through the loopholes doesnt have same competitive rules as dota 2 making it feel dated keys and drops are the devil

1010 good graphics good registry bad lag bad team mates smurfing has totaly screwed up mm if i go alone either get against a smurf hacker or have a mentally challenged team ive lost a game with over 50 frags other then that the trolls and general rude people that youll occasionally meet on any game its a good game overall overwatch is fun and helps the community would buy again you should buy this and some skins from the market and keys and some more items gg valve

way too balanced needs aim assist to help me feel pro and the balance is so harsh the game needs overpowered secondaries needs pointless deathstreaks needs op killstreaks and most importantly stop making changes in the new versions of the games but need to put more polygons stop putting in good maps by fans put in terrible maps that looks like circles stop helping the community make the game paytowin and put hats in it lol if what you pay for is what you get all the other first person shooters are overpriced for 15$ you get a legendary game for 60$ you get more polygons

bad hit reg awful servers always stuck with teams that dont speak english rage inducing 420 would noscope blaze it

where to start cs is very diverse in the array of gametypes it provides in the people that play it and in the communities those people have created communities and creative individuals of those communities have invented a wide vareity of very innovative gametypes different gametypes from any other game like surfing where each player must slide down large slopes to gather momentum to launch themselves over large gaps in the slopes  if you dont have enough speed you fall die and restart the speed and intense feeling of gaining that momentum is an entirely amazing concept alone theres also jailbreak where the terrorists are in jail cells and the counterterrorists are the jail security guards and one counterterrorist is picked as the warden the warden will use their voice to issue commands to the terrorists in specificallymade maps that contain minigames like a jumping obstacle course bomb dodging arena surfing course and in one map i even saw a skeetshooting arena where the skeet were the terrorists hahahaha if the terrorists are found betraying what the warden says the security team has rights to terminte that inmate which makes for an amazing level of deception as a terrorist and a sense of mystery and hunting as a jail security guard these clever vareity of gametypes are only the tip of the iceberg as there are many servers with mods such as warcraft where players gain exp to purchase skills and upgrades that give abilities such as a grapeling hook a power jump or temporary invisibility while all the different gametypes are perfect for casual time spent playing and socializing with the hundreds of thousands of players constantly playing this game ive yet to mention the competitive side which is by far the stakeintheground of css longlasting playability the professional scene while it is great is not my primary description of competitive side the competitive side is more the general philosophy that if a player is willing they can nearly always improve upon themselves there are fundamentals in this game that once learned you can build upon by yourself with friends or with an entire community to create quality and constructive gameplay for thousands of hours this philosophy alone is the groundwork for the seemingly endless vareity of topics any player can choose to constructively upon build their skills here are a few examples of different things in the game that contribute to its learnability gamesense the sense you get when you dont see an enemy and you can determine where they are based on where they are not gamesense also runs deep with the strategic and competitive de_ or demolition style gametypes which are roundbased meaning when you die youre dead until the end of the round in demolition there are 2 bombsites that the terrorists have to choose from and the cts must guard both until they get a feeling of which bomb site the ts have chosen once they depict which way the ts are heading the cts must rotate or reroute their attention through the map to the other bombsite this rotation creates predictable motions from either team and you can learn to expect certain actions and invent creative ways to approach the bomb sites this style of gameplay greatly contributes to the total capacity of the gamesense cs instills gun spray control unlike most shooters each gun in cs has a pattern that a spray of bullets from each gun has most shooters have an algorithim that seemingly randomizes sprays but cs has a learnable and controllable spray there are many other variables such as movement speed crouched status and spray speed that factor into it but overall spray patterns are discoverable through experience and experimentation which can greatly contribute to how powerful the weapons can seem at different levels of awareness of these variables map strategy cs has a wide vareity of maps in some closequarter and inthemoment reaction is needed and in others much more planning and teamwork is required to prevail also some maps as mentioned are gametype specific so depending on what youre looking for out of cs you can browse community servers to find it or que up in competitive matchmaking and only play the maps you wantthere are also many tricks in each map such as jumps grenade bounces houses or buildings you can throw grenades over to position them strategically all of these aspects greatly contribute to the philosophy of selfgrowth and trying to make yourself a better player regardless of what people you play with what gametype you play or if you even decide play competitive matchmaking its all up to you and this game can provide you that great sense of progression and growth that ive not found in a video game in a long long time

counterstrike global offensive is one of those games i just wanna play all the time this game is really good the graphics are good the gameplay are fun and the game modes are fantastic i have been spending so much time on this wonderful game mode competitive competitive is a mode where two teams are fighting against each other and the first team that wins 16 rounds win the match you can play this game with your friends you can play this game with yourself and you can play this game with strangers i really dont get tired of this game it keeps my mood up and if i dont know what to play i start csgo if you dont already own this game you should be a shame because this is a must own all in all you wont regret that you bought this game if you like fps games the cs series and games made by valve and here comes the best thing  skins you can buy several skins for your favorite guns there is alot of skins  you get drops every week these skins can be bought from the community market another review by niko bellic written by myself 1010

overal rating 1010 good gameplay mechanics graphics are quiet good feels little bit like modern warfare 2 camos awesome maps epic comebacks from 141 to 1414 in no time if you communicate suka blyat is not but karma is a bich so does kurvva bad servers are unstable sometimes radiculous ban systems if i get a ban its automatically 7 days if someone else gets its simple as that only 30 minutes  ultimate rage after that conclusion this is an ultimate rage machine if you ever played this you know what im talking about

i recommend this game only on certain parameters if youre looking for a story theres none i could find theres pratically an economy on this game as in people will spend outrageous amounts of actual money on such as gun skins it hasinteresting shooting mechanics to say the least not your standard shooter but thats what makes it funner like shooting people in the faceak only this is probably the game for you and probably already in your library somewhere
recommended
counterstrike global offensive aka the hate machine or also known as aortic aneurysm simulator 2012 is best described as a slow steady descent into a blind blackout madness fueled entirely by your desire to see your virtual rank increase it is guaranteed that at the very least 60% of your time spent playing this game will be comprised of spectating your 14 year old russian nonenglish speaking teammates continually fling themselves into an autorifle oblivion barrage and blame you in their foul slavic tongues for their resulting deaths

for those of you whore new to the counter strike series this game has been around longer then any battlefield or call of duty game most commonly known to now as csgo this game has been around since 2012 and the previous one counter strike source since 2004 counter strike global offensive features a sufficient amount of gamemodes such as demolition hostage and defuse missions which actually require teamwork and coorindation to win csgo has its very own competitive play system which youre placed into a 5v5 match of people the same skill level as you which is determined by your ranking on official vac secured servers to fight it out on a gamemode and map of your choice this game isnt for people who like to give up easily it required skill in knowing the maps how to handle recoil and working as a team to achieve victory id highly recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a challenge in fps shooters

if youre of a competitive nature this game could very well ruin your life if you love seeking tiny arbitrage opportunities in an entirely demand driven totally off the wall market this game could very well ruin your life if youre sick of  flashy shooters and actually want to be considered good at a shooter thats universally accepted to be very difficult and have one of the highest learning curves this game will definitely ruin your life if you think i used to be like basically pro cs12 imma rock this game ofc you should uninstall totally different game  my opinion two thumbs up ruined my life

in counterstrikego you play as tom clancys younger brother al clancy growing up tom gave al a hard time ruffling his hair and calling him names such as weird al barbara and john clancy brought up these two whiper snappers in the state of ohio in the usa they were a middle class family when al turned 7 his mum and dad bought him a pair of night vision goggles for christmas tom being the the young nipper scallion he was decided it was a good idea to steal these as they were proper flipping oreyt the sense of achievment tom got when he stole these glasses was second to none it didnt take long for tom to get addicted to ruining christmas fun fact the grinch is loosely based on this story as they grew older it became clear that all tom and his football friends wanted to do was ruin christmas they called themselves christerrorists this new movement led to the boys seeing a darker side of themselves they began finding care packages santa had dropped for deprived children and strapping c4 on them the ultimate way to ruin christmas al was enraged when he became aware of this he did the only thing a right wing father of 3 christmas loving american could do in this situation bought a metric sht tonne of guns and grenades he began handing these out to friends and neighboors on his cul de sac they soon became the count christerroists the game is purely story mode with this special addition you play as both christerroists and counter christerrorists in a sort of heads to head spoilers the story gets a little confusing as it is mainly about how many quick scopes you can do with the awp and standing at mid with bomb while your team clear a plant site and then losing the game i dont want to give too much away so i will leave this review here i hope you found it helpful i would rate this game a 710 it could get a 9 but due to it being a christmas game i can only play around the festive time of year otherwise it seems a little silly like when you here fairy tale of new york by the pogues in august it just doesnt feel right
recommended
very unforgiving towards new players however after youve done your time learned the game and mechanics very few games feel more exciting and rewarding than cs if youre into competitive games and shooters you need to have this game
recommended
stop hacking
recommended
the perfect balance between ultimate joy and wishing youve never installed it im talking about counter strike global offensive or short csgo a first person shooter with a way better community than cod and believe me ive played cod2 in the past and thats one of the better games made you may not receive constructive feedback on your plays but at least none of the players have had intercourse with your mother the game has different types of game modes maps weapons and skins you can play it either single or multiplayer what more can a person wish for 910 definitely worth if you  enjoy fps games  like stabbing people in the back  are a competitive person skip the game if you  cant handle working as a team  rage easily  basically only contribute in a negative way
recommended
who are those idiot 5% who dont like the game cs go is the best game in the world it is so strategy based unlike other fps games even though individual skill is needed and even right when you start you can play casual which is tons of fun with great people i dont know why you wouldnt get this game edit take it from someone with 1000 hours

this game is one of the most amazing games ever created you will find yourself losing hours in this game whether it be happily or with a frustrated tone the game itself is relatively simple you plants bombs or you try to stop others from doing so the vast amount of guns helps keep the game interestingdont use auto snipers in competitivejust dont also all guns have alternate skins for the gun so collecting those can be fun to do but you may end up spending hundreds of dollars on keys and cases so in my opinion just buying the skin outright is cheaper than opening tons of cases to look for one you want overall the game will frustrate you and please you all in the same hour and youll always return to it so you should get this game
recommended
if you love to chase chickens around and slash them with an overlyexpensive virtual knife that serves no real purpose other then looking cool then this is the game for you oh yeah you also gotta shoot people but that is besides the point
recommended
this game taught me to analyze graphs and numbers better than my school did 1010
recommended
great competitive game
recommended
warning highly addictive great game to play with your friends and if you dont have any you can find some while playing it requires both skill and good tactics to win the match and as a team game csgo is one of the best ever created most people tend to think that its all about shooting enemies but its more than that the aiming itself is difficult and you will have to control the recoil by moving the mouse in the opposite direction as the gun is going so learning to aim well is crucial to be successful in the game but you will also have to learn grenade spots and be able to read your opponents mind and know where they will be and what they will do next once you get to know the basics go ahead and create your own team and compete in online ladders and tournaments or if it feels too difficult serious or anything just play matchmaking and have fun killing your opponents learning to play at a decent level will take lots of practice and im talking about hundreds to thousands of hours but in csgo you dont have to get destroyed by the better players because of its matchmaking system which is great for new players it places you in a match with players of the same skill as you even if you had just bought the game yeah you will still have to play a few placement matches against [probably] better players before so have fun with that and to enjoy the game you dont even have to take it so seriously as community servers offer plenty of fun gamemodes such as kz surfing bhop etc that are really fun to spend your time on so with that price tag you shouldnt be reading this review anymore and just buy this game trust me its worth it

its time for me to write my review of this games gameplay only after playing it for almost 800 hours note i wont be writing about the skin  drop system i will be only writing about the gameplay i cant type perfect english so excuse me on that firstly  counter strike global offensive is a game which will require individual skill  teamwork and good communication when  i started playing counter strike global offensive  i was a guy who always like to do things solo and not give a crap about my teammates i would just not listen to my team and just do whatever i want once i started learning more about counter strike global offensive  i started to reliease that this game will require patience as you need time to get better at your individual skill and not to get angry at your team if they are not following to your calls secondly  counter strike global offensive has a handful of cheaters be physically and mentality prepared if you face a cheater on the enemy team dont start to rage as your mood will affect your gameplay  just play the game like there is no cheaters at all in that particular match thirdly  i will recommend this game to people who wants to get better at fps games as this game will help you in your individual skill and teamwork you will also make more friends and you end up playing every competitive match with them i give this game a 810 rating why not 1010  you might be asking there is many cheaters on the loose and they not have been banned  that is the reason why i dont give this game a 1010 finally  good luck and have fun if your planning to start playing this game hope this review has helped you if your planning to buy counter strike global offensive if you have any questions  feel free to write down in the comment section and i will get back to you asap  distinguishedmasterguardian itz_v

csgo certainly is a hard game to master so if you answer yes to any of these following questions you like the shooting system of call of duty you like to stay in cover and recover health you love games that are p2w then id not recommend this to you since csgo is the exact opposite of that there is recoil and tapping doesnt make it easier with some exceptions that is like many fps games csgo has a system which indicates your health there are no weapons you can buy you can only buy weapon skins on the steam marketplace these skins do not add anything apart from the skin itself tldr its a good fps game definitely worth the 14 euros

ive determined that counterstrike global offensive is from another dimension its a game that doesnt need to exist pc gamers are perfectly served by counterstrike source and cs 16  content with the decadesomething of tuning and attention those games have received but heres go full of doppelganger desert eagles and de_dust deja vu quantumleaping from some parallel timeline whose game industry briefly intersected with ours playing it is like running into a college crush at the supermarket you immediately notice differences oh youre married your hair looks different but that experience of reconnecting is pleasanttheyre mostly still the person you admired during geology in other words gos familiarity helps and hurts minor deviations from the cs you mightve known or loved are easy to identify the mp5 is now the mp7 but it lacks the same clicky report and underdoggy this is all i can afford please dont kill me personality the tmp is replaced by the mp9 ragdoll physics dont persist after death curiously you cant attach a suppressor to the m4 for some reason im not particularly bothered by this stuff i dont need the mp5 reproduced precisely as it existed in 2006 or 2009 to live a fulfilling life what does bug me are some small but significant changes to firing feedback when you shoot someone in go they dont wince theres a sneeze of blood and audio that conveys that youre hitting them if youre within a certain range but they dont do this  and i dont understand the decision to omit a flinch animation on character models especially at long range it takes a little more effort and squinting than it should to tell if im hitting someone or not and counterintuitively bullet tracers new in this version of cs are an unreliable source of feedback they seem to trail the path of your actual bullet by a few microseconds with rifles and smgs my eyes would wander away from my enemy and crosshairs what i should be watching and try to interpret where my bullets were falling based on the slightlydelayed streaky particle effects the small upside to tracers is that they mitigate camping a bit

cggo is a blast to the past a nod to the oldschool days of the late 90s and its more than welcome in my gaming livery whilst i love cod and titanfall theres something uniquely compelling about starting up a match of csgo with its deliberate and stayed pacing and its risk vs reward gameplay mechanics its no wonder this game has taken off for the 3rd time in its lifecycle its popular right now for a reason and that reason is good a mustbuy

this game was made by war veterans and arma 3 tryhards if youre willing to spend a long long long time trying to get good at a fps game when you could be doing more productive things with your life then this is the game for you have fun playing 40 hours of offline bot matches to actually not suck at this game when youre done with your bot matches youll realise just how useless that preparation time actually has been for you when someone headshots you through a wall with a ak47 and then goes on to kill the other 4 members of your team this game also has the best matchmaking system ensuring that you are always on a team of noobs trolls and other ers and the enemy team are all smurfs be ready to be kicked by your teammates for carrying them and giving them helpful non abusive game advice because counterstrike has the best community full of rich 9 year olds that found their mothers credit card and bought knives and other completely unnecessary in game items that make them play better well at least the community isnt as bad as dota or lol placed in the silver ranks after your first ten games well then youre ed and no one can help you csgo is for people who havent played a cod game and are willing to devote their lives to a realistic gun game when they could just be doing something else like cooking or sports 710

consider purchasing this game if you like to experience at least one of the following points  getting killed everytime without standing a chance because there is a smurf on the enemy team once again  being insulted because you suck you use the p90 or because you are better than them basically everyone hates you  being in a financial crisis because you are addicted to opening cases so your weapon looks a bit cooler  getting friend invites from scammers because youre lucky enough to get your hands on a knife  losing ranked games due to some idiots shooting at team mates for the sole purpose of getting kicked if these points sound appealing to you i can recommend you to buy csgo theres nothing better than wrecking havoc with your friends and have quick round of total domination against those filthy casuals am i right you even learn russian from the kids screaming at you because you suck so what are you waiting for

applying multiverse theory every round that takes place in csgo is actually happening in different universes thats why the bomb code never changes but there is a lot universes where the bomb code is different but were just focusing on the ones with these bomb codes every time you play a different round youre entering a differnt universe and some crazy whacko is keeping the score

introduction counter strike global offensive is a multiplayer fps game where you are either part of a terrorist organisation or part of a team of counterterrorists the aim of the game is to work together with your team to defeat the opposing force even with many new maps weapons and features this game still has some classic maps and guns from the older counter strike games pros over 20 different weapons to choose from many game modes including casual death match arms race competitive and more unique skins and possible drops at the end of each match operations that feature new communitymade maps and skins cons trolls hackers and smurfs can ruin a competitive match in general the game does not have a very friendlykind community some ingame itemsfeatures can be quite costly competitive bans may last as long as a week overall csgo can be addictive at times and is a lot more fun when playing with friends the graphics are nice and i personally enjoy the musicsounds communicating and working well with your team can be a huge advantage to the game but there are those who prefer to stray away from the rest of their teammates and play by their own rules my rating would be an 8510

counter strike global offensive truly the best fps ive ever played as the war owl put it csgo is a marriage of teamwork strategy and skill and that is the utmost truth this is a game that leaves you wanting to do better to learn and to grow in your own skill as a player if you put in enough time into this game i guarantee you wont regret it

i played cs back in the beta days all the way through when it went source including a bit of competitive totally dig this game and csgo is actually a very nice combination of all the things that were good from all the various iterations of the games history purists  off the problem for me is the community  ive found that the only way to enjoy the casual game is to turn off all voice chat mute everyone the game seems to draw some of the most vile hate filled bitter gamers ive ever dealt with perhaps its the lack of humour in the game tf2 has its share of racists and mysogynistic wingnuts but the levity of tf2 draws a incredibly varied set of people that more than offset the bitter element csgo on the other hand has no such levity and unless you play with your friends whom you probably made in tf2 or are a hate filled bitter racist mysogynistic wingnut yourself youre likely to be turned off tldr its still a great game as long as you dont let the bitter scum get to you note competitive mode in csgo is a different story the wingnuts seem to stay in casual or are at least more focused in competitive

counter strike global offensive is probably one of the best fps games i have ever played not only are the graphics of the old maps polished but also the combat there is a great range of playing style to suit you such as rushing in with an smg or sitting at the back with an awp which accommodate you to your best ability this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here another good part of this game is that the teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short so theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way if you are interested in a both challenging and exhilarating fps then i recommend you buy counter strike global offensive 9510

after 250 hours of intense gameplay i learned the meaning of life i play counterstrike global offensive every day i have not gone a day without counterstrike since i first bought it on the steam store however i do not like the gameplay of counterstrike in any way at all the game itself is complete trash and was probably developed by the same people who made the first tentacle gang bang video but there is a golden egg among the pile of crap this game is the chickens i follow them with my default knife around inferno recording their every step with nvidia shadowplay batteries not included and counting each individual chicken i spot and add it to the list the chickens are pretty simple and flawless they do not make my frame rate go down i run csgo on the potato from portal 2 unlike skyrims chickens and they explode if they are killed i have only seen one chicken ever explode and that was in a competetive game in which xkittenfall my rival on the terrorists team slaughtered one in front of my eyes with his karambit fade knife i now suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and kill anyone who comes near my chickens they are only for me do not harm my chickens anyone who even bats an eye at one of my precious birds will take an awp headshot to the foot be it friend or foe i fear for the safety of these chickens they are why i live i was created by the chicken god in order to protect the godlike chickens chickens are the meaning of life and if you attempt to argue with me i will shoot you until youre dead right in the foot with a glock18 ultra overpowered tbh do not mess with my chickens and if you come across me in a session oh wait you wont because i swore off multiplayer after people killed the chickens i only play in bot only sessions by myself and kick the bots following the chickens around and hoping they do something new i have studied the chickens so well i have memorized all of their spawnpoints on inferno there are 14 that spawn on the map and i am obsessed with them stay away from my chickens part 2 the 800 hour benchmark i whip around the corner and 1 tap flusha the crowd goes wild with excitement i just won the esea tournament for my new team symbiotic confetti falls around me and led lights illuminate the entire gaming stadium i won one million dollars for the squad i began screaming as my team carried me out of the stadium back to the gaming house when night came i began to work on source sdk my lifes new legacy for a month i had been working on an ingame dream home that was secluded from the world and had no guns it had a back yard exclusive to chickens and a statue in the living room dedicated to chickens i smiled as i looked over the entire map and began adding more props and chickens to make the house more lively i looked at each individual chicken to make sure t were on point and ready to be presented in the map when i finally upload the map on the workshop people will be able to view my amazing home it is on and island in the middle of the ocean with a home on it the chickens are safe from all harms in the entire world the map consists of three skyboxes the house & island compiling skybox & the easter egg skybox which can be teleported to through a secret trigger_teleport in the secret skybox is a race track dedicated to bringing back func_vehicle 2012 valve did not include func_vehicle from source in csgo and it angered many mapmakers they could not make drivable cars in our beloved counterstrike what a scumbag move we need to bring back func_vehicle to the counterstrike series in order to improve our community as a whole can we do this i love chickens and balance the life between competetive gameplay and chicken worshipping on a secluded island thank you for considering the message by nas

at the momment the only competitive fps game with some of the good implementetions when it comes to matchmaking and also playing with your friends has very steep learning curve when it comes to weapons  recoil spread etc i would reccomend this game unless you are anoyed by next few things i am about to mention first and foremost russians very annoying trying to communicate in their native language even if it not a international language words they use blyet sukha second problem kids because of this game i decided i will never have kids they are god awful creatures if you give them pcs and a bad headset tend to scream and curse even when not provoked of course block communication is a viable option but then you exlude one of the biggest parts of this game out of it still i like the game and i think it would worth you a while to buy it and play it added on 20141017 after so many hours i have found a fundamental flaw with this game it is called the a cooldown period what it does basically is punsihing you for leaving game killing team mates or dealing damage to your team mates also if you lose connection you will be spanked by valve why is this a flawed system well i will explain that with as few words as possible first of all is noobnes level of the players i play with silver you may throw grenade and he might run into it and die of course who gets punished you again russians and how ly persistant they are if you say b you can almost guarantee he wil go on a screaming at the same time suka blyet obama bad so eventually you are forced to kill him take the bomb and plant i wrote this review in hope to get some feedback because i play 23 matches and then back to 7 day period cooldown i honestly hope to get some suggestions aty least and i hope you will find this usefull

hey i am just curious if anyone else does this every day when i take a shower i like to turn the water super hot hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason so instead of itching them i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation ive ever felt in my life it feels amazing and im doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them i just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else as ive been doing this the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working i know its weird but im telling you it feels incredible im not saying other people should try it but if youve got an itch perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water posted 19 april 2014

its an okay game but there are quite a few things which are so wrong with it which make you miss css new csgo likes to crash when loading in to games especially competitive and now i have been issued an unfair ban of 24 hours for the game crashing which i could not prevent the ban system is nice but why not at least make it ban people after the warm up because it could fill a slot 1 playing casual you will most likely play the same map over and over which is boring since so many choose the same map when you leave to find another you will find the same map de dust it makes the game really boring and angry that everytime you leave for a new map you find the same map and even on that server everyone votes for it again 2 everyone is skin crazy and it is even worse than tf2 cosmetics so many of the players of csgo seem to think having skins makes you better at the game those who do not own skins are looked down upon but most of the time do better than those with skins i have a few skins myself brought 1 and found the rest 3 the game is amazing and i love the guns but 1 makes you feel bored with the game if you could vote for the map and the map you just played wasnt an option it would be fun and would make it less boring ive decided to stop playing casual now because of this and only stick to competitive since you seem to find players who wantknow how to play and a chance of seeing a map other than de dust that is basicly it great game spoiled by small cons

a review mostly for me so i know ive completed the story high game time as well as feedback on the game my thoughts a team based fps ct vs t can be fun with a bunch of friends and the competitive mode is good fun with weapon skins and team colours as well as a few good modes to pick from like death match arms race casual and some more achievements 156 of 167 93% achievement graphics an improvement on the last counter strike source game but nothing too special game play team based type game where you have to rescue hostages or defuse a bomb the aiming can take some time to get used to as when you go full auto with weapons you have to follow the bullets and not the crosshair story na replayability can become addictive if you play with friends or competitive what could be added different player skins colours rating 910

after 250 hours of intense gameplay i learned the meaning of life i play counterstrike global offensive every day i have not gone a day without counterstrike since i first bought it on the steam store however i do not like the gameplay of counterstrike in any way at all the game itself is complete trash and was probably developed by the same people who made the first tentacle gang bang video but there is a golden egg among the pile of crap this game is the chickens i follow them with my default knife around inferno recording their every step with nvidia shadowplay batteries not included and counting each individual chicken i spot and add it to the list the chickens are pretty simple and flawless they do not make my frame rate go down i run csgo on the potato from portal 2 unlike skyrims chickens and they explode if they are killed i have only seen one chicken ever explode and that was in a competetive game in which xkittenfall my rival on the terrorists team slaughtered one in front of my eyes with his karambit fade knife i now suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and kill anyone who comes near my chickens they are only for me do not harm my chickens anyone who even bats an eye at one of my precious birds will take an awp headshot to the foot be it friend or foe i fear for the safety of these chickens they are why i live i was created by the chicken god in order to protect the godlike chickens chickens are the meaning of life and if you attempt to argue with me i will shoot you until youre dead right in the foot with a glock18 ultra overpowered tbh do not mess with my chickens and if you come across me in a session oh wait you wont because i swore off multiplayer after people killed the chickens i only play in bot only sessions by myself and kick the bots following the chickens around and hoping they do something new i have studied the chickens so well i have memorized all of their spawnpoints on inferno there are 14 that spawn on the map and i am obsessed with them stay away from my chickens part 2 the 800 hour benchmark i whip around the corner and 1 tap flusha the crowd goes wild with excitement i just won the esea tournament for my new team symbiotic confetti falls around me and led lights illuminate the entire gaming stadium i won one million dollars for the squad i began screaming as my team carried me out of the stadium back to the gaming house when night came i began to work on source sdk my lifes new legacy for a month i had been working on an ingame dream home that was secluded from the world and had no guns it had a back yard exclusive to chickens and a statue in the living room dedicated to chickens i smiled as i looked over the entire map and began adding more props and chickens to make the house more lively i looked at each individual chicken to make sure t were on point and ready to be presented in the map when i finally upload the map on the workshop people will be able to view my amazing home it is on and island in the middle of the ocean with a home on it the chickens are safe from all harms in the entire world the map consists of three skyboxes the house & island compiling skybox & the easter egg skybox which can be teleported to through a secret trigger_teleport in the secret skybox is a race track dedicated to bringing back func_vehicle 2012 valve did not include func_vehicle from source in csgo and it angered many mapmakers they could not make drivable cars in our beloved counterstrike what a scumbag move we need to bring back func_vehicle to the counterstrike series in order to improve our community as a whole can we do this i love chickens and balance the life between competetive gameplay and chicken worshipping on a secluded island thank you for considering the message by nas

were talking about the absolute titan in classic competitive first person shooters the father of addictive multiplayer combat set in a contemporary universe before call of duty before battlefield before anything else that hefts up an ak47 and and pulls back the charging handle this did it first and in many ways it still does it best ive met incredible people here some of the best friends of my life are actually from this ive had incredible moments in this game ive had laughter moments of triumph situations to overcome comradery that i cannot even begin to describe and a feeling of satisfaction that nothing else for $1499 can come close to short of a roadside bj from your locals finest nothing compares to the sharp precise aim the satisfying and punchy weapon bob the sexy sharpened and modernized gun models crisp antialiased graphics running on a mature and tight version of source and the fact that this entirely new looking package is wrapped around the same hardcore game that 16 popularized wayback when albeit with a few tweaks between all of the versions means that it has a whole other layer that battlefield and call of duty can never touch what is that layer you speak of you say many things and the fact that i can see this clearly without ever stepping into the beating heart of csgo  competetive [at the time of this posting finally with no text limit i have finally played 5 rounds of comp 3 wins it is a whole other amazing side to the game] is an achievement regarding the message this game wants to send its playerbase  its all about the community its all about a skill that needs to be honed not unlocked its about playing for hours and perfecting that single shot down that hallway its a game that stands perfectly on its own as a shooter but manages to weave the mlg aspect into it seamlessly without in my opinion dividing its playerbase its all there all the time a feeling of professionalism can wash over anyone in this game at least once in their time with it i can not say that about source or 16 those were daunting trudging beasts leviathans that i feel newcomers could not make headway in if they just wanted to have some fun and see what all the fuss is about with the slight exception of source my time with that title was a mixed bag its graphics felt disjointed and decidedly a mod which is perfectly acceptable duh but its shooting seemed almost random and many 16 purists will say similar regarding not being able to enjoy the ballistics the fact is that counter strike is often all about the mlg nowadays and yet this entry in the franchise can stand on its own as a fun game to just mess around in without feeling the pressure it is something to truly behold for any pc gamer being able to enjoy the hardcore without being hardcore is a treat as you get better the progression of your skill as a gamer feels tangible you do not need unlocks and idiotic modifiers to your gear to feel like you are getting anywhere nothing gets in the way of your skill no unlocks no killstreaks no aiming down sights its just you your gun your knife and your ability to  up the opposition nothing else it is such a worthy game that within a year of its release id been able to put over 350 hours into it and i feel like more time could have been spent within its corridors its rooftops backrooms and its long stressful hallways the feeling of personal progression and satisfaction i felt made me say left and right that i wished theyd add some kind of personalization and a smart system that makes you more addicted not hats just some way to make you give back to yourself in a meaningful way a customization and unlock system for vanity gear would be fantastic a new horizon for the game it makes the game feel timeless and without need of many other entries for some time just updates for polish and valve always listens its not perfect but the skins add a new breath of air to the game even if youre not good youre still the snob with that purple tier weapon and everyone hates you and they should its ok to hate on it just as much as its ok to use these new pieces of bling everyone is doing it and to speak of content valve games main strength has always been community based content that keeps your game living and breathing never slipping into the pile of used up theres always more to play with and now with the integrated workshop and official server support for top map creationsif you donate to both valve and the makers a hugely smart way for valve to make money in a less greedy way than map packs you can be assured that csgo has a lot more than just the addicting gameplay community the entertaining mlg scene and most importantly self growth to keep you coming back thanks to these additions the arms deal update has its hand on your wallet but through means of community driven sales not just ones from the company and none of it ever affects your skill unless that purple ssg 552 fills you with divine rage that you just cant help but get headshot fever you can make some decent digital goods money and so can everyone else i so no issue regarding this update and thankfully after some weeks of growing pains it seems everyone is on the same page intense firefights room for skill growth the ability good luck to have incredible social interactions hilarious conversations things that ill never forget especially thanks to the people id managed to call my best friends from this those are all the luck of the draw but when you buy this game one thing is for sure youre buying a piece of gaming history with the freshest breath of fresh air ive ever seen and it is a triumph

the good points csgo isnt reinventing the wheel of first person shooters if youve played any iteration of counterstrike over the years youll find most of the content very familiar that said go adds enough to keep it interesting all of the weapons feel unique and the variety of gameplay modes will mean endless hours of entertainment the bad points ive been playing video games for a long time and the csgo community might be the worst ive ever dealt with in addition to the runofthemill trash talk you can expect to be inundated with antisemitic racist andor homophobic slurs ive heard some people use all three at a time to insult other players i dont think ive ever heard someone say something insightful on the mic in all of the matches ive played your best bet is to simply mute as many players as possible all in all a great game as long as you ignore what everyone says during a match

to the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is hitting an upward stride in the modern military competitive shooter world for good reason partially due to its strengths but also id argue not here due to the state of the game industry theres little reason to be a pc gamer and shooter fan and be clueless to this juggernaut if you have even a bit of tryhard in you and a bit of skill id highly advocate absorbing csgo like a sponge and saying goodbye to any other shooter you previously thought was relevant i could go on and on about the honed balance structure from the economy to the maps to the weapons all asymmetrically tilted to empower skill and enable strategy but i wont take my word for it its as close to perfect as ive seen a game get dont get me wrong i can nitpick some things a few minor fringe gun complaints 64 tick servers instead of 128 tick but their patch performance at least shows overall that theyre on the right track the chief of these points being restructuring maps to play better competitively something i cant remember seeing in any other competitive fps ever maybe in the ut quake days idk but theres a good chance you already knew of this legend youve heard the fanboyish cries of devotion and likely thought to yourself why the hell would someone pay $150 for a gun skin the game is that good when you get into the competitive aspect however i must say for a casual player especially one who has little to no interest learning competitive theres not much here for you there are casual modes but theyre hard to enjoy knowing more light and carefree shooters are out there to play instead the casual side of csgo is functional and passable but itll feel like owning a ferrari and only driving it in first gear youre really not getting the potential out of the product but who am i to judge perhaps youll get into the gun skin craze too and play the casual modes and have a blast i doubt it but hell the game is cheap and goes on practicallyfree sales every time we turn around so why the hell are you reading this just buy the thing all the cool kids are doing it

great competitive game the only thing i would say i dont really like is deathmatch they didnt even try to make an attempt to make decent spawns you constantly spawn infront of enemies behind enemies and in groups of enemies basically if youre going to play deathmatch then go in there with the knowledge that you will be spawn killed several times in a row and its neither your fault nor the fault of the person who killed you also keep in mind that deathmatch is plagued with awps because theres no cash system in it you can use whatever weapon you want other than that i definitely recommend this to people who enjoy competitive fps games the other game modes are fun community servers are nice as well some of the weapons need a bit more balancing but theyre not too bad the community iswell its a gaming community take that as you will if you want to play competitive mode on an official server i highly suggest finding friends to play with its not impossible to get in a game with a group of random people who are fun to play with but its extremely common to find people who are just in there trolling being afk jumping in front of shots teamkilling and just being obnoxious in general do keep in mind that playing with friends who are higher ranks than you will pretty much always lead to there being people on the other team who are higher ranks as well edit after playing more i have one more thing to add thats not good play with friends the csgo competitive community is one of the most toxic gaming communities ive ever had the displeasure of being a part of if you want to have fun play with a full team of friends 5 people including yourself otherwise i would just advise avoiding competitive like the plague

csgo offers the addictive and tense gameplay all counterstrike players know and love with amazing weapon feel great graphics for the dated source engine great maps and a good community to play with even for beginners csgo is a must buy for competitive fps players

countless allnighters come to my mind when i hear the name counterstrike that game is something ill remember discovering during my middleschool years it to me and im sure others was a great way to escape and unwind after a long day i dont see it slowing down in that department with global offensive it combines the old with the new and i will admit that there is indeed a learning curve when it comes to aiming with those weapons but all it took was a few rounds of deathmatch and then i could effecetivly kill without being the bambie so to speak dont think this game is all gold and now scuffs this game sure does have its short comings but that goes with any top notch game unless youre standing still and throwing grenades you should compensate for the movemnet of the nade i understand that this use to be something in css and other titles but i feel its more apparent in global the balistics are far better than previous counterstrike games imoand its interesting to see how the different guns have different spread and penetration etc this game is fantastic to play with friends or if youre looking to make friends this game is still fun to play dont forget to practice if youre having a hard time with aiming or understanding the map

this game is a very popular terrorist counterterrorist fps it features casual and competitive gameplay it has a few different game modes and a large player base the game is very balanced there is alot of different weapons to choose from and the graphics are fine you can also play against bots or play deathmatches if you happen to die and you have a bot in your team you can control him to help your team win but it will not increase your own score ive only played 1 mode so far it is bomb defusing in this mode you have 2 teams and the terrorist team has a bomber the person who gets the c4 is chosen randomly and must set the c4 in one of the specific points the counterterrorists must defend the points and or kill all the terrorists to win the round the terrorists needs to detonate the c4 the first to win 8 rounds like that  they take about 2 minutes each  wins the match i think its a good game overall and if youre a fan of multiplayer fps games try it the only cons would be that you get crates while playing which requires a key to open  you have to buy the key with real life money  i do believe the only thing those crates contain is cosmetic stuff its already a paid game so its a bit surprising but its not pay to win also some servers just lags even if your ping is good no idea why but usually finding a good server dosent take too long

a very complex gunplay system makes for extremely realalistic fire fights its a change of pace from bf34 and cod but it requires more skill to play then ether of these games this will lead to a higher tiers of playing although the ranking syatem needs an overhaul for the competitive mode as it is based on wins and not individual score this can often lead to mis ranking you to lover or jigher tiers 8510

a great shooter in comparrison for others in the same genre csgo relies on a knowhow basis on how to aim and control your firing aswell as the differnce among each weapon the fourth game in the cs series if you rule out the japanese ones csgo is quickly described as an updated css but with much better graphics animations more content aswell as a whole new shooting system there are alot of old weapons from the previous games though all having their different stats changed to suit csgos new system 8 new weapons are introduced aswell some replacing previous ones from the other games as for playable characters csgo has a whole new layout previous cs games had 4 cscz 5 characters to choose from after selecting a team this isnt the case with csgo here you are forced to be one out of 5 almost identical characters from a certain faction as an example anarchists all sharing the same model but wearing different masks and small details several previous factions like the phoenix connexion return though not all like the arctic avengers while the increase of factions has made csgo interesting to play sadly since its launch 2 years ago the game has yet to have seen any new added factions visually the whole game feels more down to earth and realistic the default maps are plenty and several old maps from previous games return including aztec office vertigo dust maps among others something new in this cs game that wasnt in previous games is weapon skins the idea coming from team fortress 2 you have a chance of getting item drops at the end of each game it could be a weapon skin or a case tf2s version being the crate using a skin will replace the default weapons looks you can trade or sell these weapon skins and cases over the steam market or buy from the market itself with real currency this cs game also introduces competetive play searching for a match you are teamed up with 4 other random players to fight against 5 other players on the opposing team playing 15 rounds in total each time you win you get closer to getting a better rank same goes if you lose a match you get closer to getting your rank decreased usually with this rank system you are played against and with players on the same rank almost it is a common thing that you face against players near your rank rarely ever exactly the same rank you can also play with friends despite their rank being either lower or better than yours this leads to a very unbalanced rank system that csgo has the community is by far the most negative thing about this cs game it is very common for players to insult each other making this community by far the worst of all gaming communities in history even exceeding the cod communities be wary if you are very sensitive to insults this community is also known for its scamming for weapon skins because of the high amounts some of the more rare items cost over the steam market alot of scamming goes about with different ways to trick other players into giving their weapons for free or lesser priced skins valve has stated they wont be able to help you if you get tricked the most common trick is a random user on steam adding you then sending you a link if you add them if you press on this link you risk getting a virus that will take over your account overall this cs game is worth every cent but be wary of its community

csgo is a nearperfect multiplayer shooter unlike the previous versions which were often difficult to get in to this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels it has a large community and a well supported workshop ensuring that this discountpriced game will be around for years to come in short you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster its been around for years and has spawned many imitators the game isnt much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original half life 2 was however valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis is it worth getting if you already own counter strike source yes css was always counter strike shoehorned into the source engine csgo feels far more like a standalone game valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game the best feature must be the competitive play you cannot leave these matches or youll suffer a temporary ban from the feature after 10 wins in this mode youll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level these matches are exciting occasionally scary or frustrating but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game ever there are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join really if i was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice its bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come something that cant be said for the call of duty franchise which is probably its closest rival remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year fragmenting the community plus you can customise your weapon skins in csgo surely thats the most important feature all they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in csgo

field ratings remarks graphics 95 definitely a huge improvement for the counterstrike franchise gameplay 90 different modes will try to entertain us id say casual will always be the best in mind story na all i know is that you hold a gun and shoot stuff multiplayer 80 half of the community is russian and not speaking english making it difficult to play competitive sometimes other then that its alright replayability 10 great game with a great replayability overall 1010 ever since i played counterstrike 16 i loved that game but due to motion sickness i never liked playing it sometimes gave me the headache and wanting to vomit dont worry its a good game then i strolled over to counterstrike online it was a awesome game a good improvement from 16 it was back then i didnt had steam when i have steam i saw counterstrikeglobal offensive really looked alike like modern warfare but the game was so different and that is what makes it so enjoyable good game my most played game forever

currently one of the best and only real competitive fps out there a great variety of weaponry and maps the game also gets constant updates from community feedback however it has a vey big learning curve for the first 50 hours or so you wont be very good at the game as long as you get decent skill after that you will have alot more fun

global offensive is a new addition to the counter strike series this game features a unique tactical gameplay with 2 teams the counter terrorists cts anti  terrorist group from over the world sas swat fbi and the israel defense force their objective is to rescue hostages in cs_ maps or in de_ maps to defend a bombsite from the terrorists  the terrorists ts terrorists are the bad guys they need to defend hostages from being rescued from the cts or need to bomb bombsites that the cts must defend ofcourse this counter strike feature new and the classic maps like de_nuke and one of the best maps  de_dust2 and also features new gamemodes like arms race an official version of one of the most populair mod gun game where people need to make kills with all weapons given the first one to get a kill with the golden knife wins demolition a all new gamemode with elements of arms race within small demolition maps where ts need to bomb the bombsite deathmatch a deathmatch on counter strike maps with the idea of the chaos from game like quake 3 this game is for everyone from counter strike veterans to people that are new to fpss altough it can be hard to get started in my opinion the best thing they added to counter strike is the competetive modes counter strike always was one of the most competetive games ever but you needed to find matches and a team on chatrooms like irc quakenet and those sort of things now it doesnt matter if you have a full team or your on your one you can always find matches like this this is just the normal counter strike maps but the gameplay changes drastically this is a dead serious mode so this is not somewhere where you should grief or  around this is a competetive mode people want to compete prepare for battle however you dont need to be the best in counter strike to play competetive mode after 10 wins you will be set in a skill group to this skill group you will be matched to people with almost the same skill so you dont have to worry the new arms deal update provided us with many new skins for you guns this is a great addition you can buy and or get weapons for free by playing the game also new in this series is temporary map packs like the operation payback and the operation bravo this is a mappack that you can pickup for 5 eurs that feature the most liked custom maps on official valve servers no lagg and your favorite maps on stable servers my opinion about global offensive is that it is the best counter strike i started playing counter strike source 5 years ago i loved the gameplay and the tactics then global offensive came out and i was tought this wasnt gonna be a good game but it proven itself valve did a great job with this game most of the things i missed on source are there in global offensive for example the competetive mode i explained before written by stefan tsweezy

i love this gamei may suckbut that doesnt matter rright

ive played this game for close to 800 hours over the past year or so and i have nothing better to do so heres a really long indepth review of counterstrike global offensive to start id like to point out that this game has a huge skill gap meaning someone whos been playing for a year will be exponentially better than someone whos just starting which is common with most games but this game needs to have a lot of time put into it in general to be semi decent learning spray patterns and maps can be time consuming but in the long run will pay off hugly cs doesnt always have the best community to help you out though this can be a major turn off in this regard sure there are videos to look up and guides on the steam hub but if you lack knowledge of something ingame you can assume youll get flooded with insults and negativity not all people are like this but from spending lots of time in silver ranking i have noticed lacking some information is just asking for trouble with some players silver is the lowest of the mm ranks meaning the newer or lower skill level players the reason i bring this up is that most people will be placed in silver meaning that they will have to go through huge amounts of negativity before being able to improve and ofcourse there is always the option of reporting people for being offensive or not being a good teammate but as in other games this is nearly never enforced this isnt always an issue in the higher ranks though some people can be supporting and helpful in their pursuit to get better so if youre new to gaming you may not really understand the importance of having a group of people to play with do you this is one of the things i cant stress enough to people who wish to play this game or who are having troubles with it never play alone plant those words into your head never forget them now i dont want this to seem like some guide to get better but all i want to bring to attention is that this is a team based shooter with that being said its a lot better to have a nice group of people to play with so keep that inmind if you decide to buy this title as i said in the first part of this review the random people you meet ingame arent always the nicest now that that is over lets get into a more fun yet controversial topic skins and ingame transactions the only reason im adding a small section for this is due to the fact this can push people away from games in the fear of them being pay2play and i wont lie when i say valve does it right with csgo they made it a truley fair platform which seems to be hard for most devs to do now a days there are 3 mains things you can spend your money on in csgo one of those being skinsstickers skins and stickers are mainly added to make your weapons look nicer than their default variation this ofcourse being 100% optional no skins or stickers raise stats of guns theyre just reskinned weapons the nxt way you can spend money ingame is with valves famous ingame gambling i mean weapons crates and keys a case and key are basically items ingame that can be used together to craft or open another item usually being a reskinned weapon crates can be bought from the market for their ongoing price which goes up and down depending on the situation of the economy they can also be gotten from ingame drops which are basically random items you can get from playing games of csgo while im on the topic of drops you can get reskins from drops too but these are the worst of the worst skins in most peoples eyes and then all you need from here is a key which you can happily buy from the csgo shop for $25 or your national equivalent before i move on to the third and last set of things to be bought id like to say that opening cases is never worth it im not trying to be a buzz kill in any way i just want to bring it to peoples attention that wasting $100s isnt always going to guarantee you a nice shiny skin or your money back and now for the last but not least operations operations are like dlc in the sense of it adds 5 new maps to the game but only for the limited time usually 34 months the operations have differing prices when it first comes out it will cost around $7 then go down to $4 then to $1 operations also give you nice rewards like case drops that only operation owners will get these are nice in the sense of they sell for lots of money on the market and can easily make your money back from what you spent on the pass now thats all i want to say about this subject but again i just wanted to make it clear that this game is not pay2play at all does this game have a dedicated dev team to fix problems and update the game this question is something you always want to ask when buying a game like this since in the end its all multiplayer and can get old over time well ill be honest when i say yes and no the dev team is really good about coming out with updates every week or two may they be bug fixes or full blown out updates new maps weapons etc theres always the issue of missing things or adding useless things into the game but that doesnt seem to happen too often does csgo get old meh that isnt for me to say it did for me but that can change from person to person they try to add and remove enough every so often so it doesnt but theres always the fact of a game being played to the point where it just isnt fin anymore nothing can stop that and while were on this topic id also like to bring up that valve has added an amazing workshop feature to this game it really gives people the power to add to the game and makes it fun to see how creative some of the players really are id like to end this by saying that csgo is a good game full of amazingcommunity servers competitive gamemodes and just lots of fun to be had with friends for this price id reccomend this to anyone who enjoys fps and skill based games thanks for reading and have fun if you do end up buying the game d

the next era of counter strike a game more focused on the competitive side of things you will get addicted to it even if you one of the skeptic that enjoyed source and 16 so much that you think that global offensive isnt really for you just try it you will love it and then it will become a sickness it still got that cs feeling but with better graphics more maps and some new guns how can we say no to this pros  competitive matchmaking  skins  swag points  you can actually make some money off skins  lots of maps a mix of classic and new ones  new operations being released regularly  gaben cons  squeakers and mongols  cheaters  ban system specifics you can get a 7 day ban for losing connection for example 810

the game itself is actually very good but it has some really big flaws its mainly popular because of skins with that comes the following scammers theft phising accounts befriending rigging throwing smurfing trolling all around s 13 year olds that are sleeping with my mom and last but not least hacking all of the above are main reasons i dont put much time into this game anymore the skins are fun and great but i personally think they ruin the community with too much corruption steam says 140000 playing now 40000 are in idle servers waiting for drops of cases and skins play at your own risk dont click any links from anyone ever if you start trading i still recommmend checking it out as like i said it is a good game

awesome game when you first begin to play it it might seem like  in the beginning but then it gets more enjoyable really like how they put in the competitive mode but the queue time might be fked up from time to time the first 10 wins should also be more accurate on how you performe cuz if you get carried up in rank you can expect to meet people way above your skill level all in all a great game d

growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 yearsign

counterstrike is wellknown to be the best competitive modern first person ego shooter obviously competitive is stressed this means the game is very hard for the beginners because of its depth you simply cannot jump into that game without any knowledge or guide you can do that on casual ones tough and there are too many of these out there esports is also the priority of the game it is also responsible for the extreme balance and balance fixes that valve takes care off this is a significant factor to keep the game enjoyable on the long term of course you can run and gun with a p90 or camp with the autosniper which is easy but good players can defend themselves well some have great crosshair placement to eliminate the threat with a simple click  boom headshot not only crosshair placement but also the recoil control the positioning the movement or lets just shorten it the whole experience and skills can differenciate a cs veteran and a simple amateur these skills and experince need to be trained otherwise you end up being punished badly the main focus of the game is the competitive mode where you play with four teammates against five enemies for up to an hour talking about teammates playing with friends is the best thing you can do there in most games the team isnt as important as in csgo everybody is important since its 5vs5 and not more you need to communicate this is the actual key to victory aswell as having a glorious match there are too many strangers who do destroy the game experience and like every competitive game they can be toxic after winning a while youll get a rank which allows you to play with people with the same skill set as you do well most of the time im talking about smurfers those arent a long term problem tough  theyll get to a certain rank and then its useless but can be used for trolling luckily i havent met many trolls back to the ranks i have a certain statement about these i wish they added team ranking aswell as solo rank just as they did in dota 2 oh they should definitively add more clan functions like the other game i mentioned hacks are a minor problems there  overwatch will take care of it but someone has to suffer until the hacker gets banned many outsiders think that cs has bad graphics i dont think so since csgo theyre decent and acceptable and every other thing makes this problem up the source engine is not bugfree of course but is has been proven to be relatively reliable it should not be forgotten that cs can run on many hardware flawless skins and operations are not required to be paid  youll get drops and if your friend has an operation you still can play with himher skins can be obtained by simply playing betting through csgolounge buying from the steam market steam trading and by opening boxes the boxes require keys which cost 2 euros each you can get a really expensive skins mediocre skins and skins that you wish you could undo it chances are that you end up at the third option and are trying to build a time machine operations are seasons passes with maps provided by the community these only last for a while i must say that is good idea that the community can earn money from valve by providing maps and skins when its successful enough all in all csgo is a good buy if youre willing to spend enough time on it itll come to fruition and become a rewarding game some matches can ruin it tough valve proves again for being one of the greatest video game developer

what can i say this game is made by valve therefore i am obligated to love it in all honesty this game is in some cases harder than other fpss ive played and in other cases easier the community is largeive yet to find a lobby that has less than 5 people in it the game also runs on the source engine resulting in very attractive graphics that have a minimal impact on my gpu either way i love this game and recommend it to anybody who is looking for a cheap easy first person shooter
recommended
csgo is the latest entry into the counter strike franchise and a worthy one at that guns feel and sound powerful classic maps mixed in with the new spice things up a little and its ohso rewarding when you finally master that gun youve been trying so hard to get more equipped with pick it up if youre looking for a challengingbutrewarding multiplayer shooter

buy now if you are looking for a good fps game controls are great and there are also diffrent controls like to see how your gun is when you have your left over cents you can buy some camos for your gun but they could get scratched in any other words i would suggest this game 
recommended
a great successor to source global offensive delivers in every way from improved graphics to overall better gameplay it is very much a modern shooter while staying true to the counter strike franchise any fans of the previous game and any new players should check this out
recommended
this is such a pretty good shooting game or fps you can play whatever you wanna play example  if you wanna fight with other players like serious you can play competitive  this mode is pretty nice when youre having a competition with other players  but if you dont wanna get serious playing you can play casual there are many noobs there seriously but sometimes therere so much players and i dont wanna play with them cause i cant kill anyone  lol  anyway therere many funny guys on casual so if you wanna play for fun you can play casual but dont get serious on it cause its not competition its just play for fun though hope this guide helps  see ya

ive been playing cs 16 since after its release hell ive been playing cs since the release of 15 evenmainly on nonsteam lan tho i must confess and thus far this is probably the best it has the smooth and proper aim of 15 for most part when it counts the accuracy of pistols are absolutely nostalgic in it and all pistols are actually worth playing with now with the change in damages when it comes to smgs and rifles its much more similar to 16 in early days except for ak47 god knows how i missed the superaccurate ak47 from 16 it also makes more sense to play with galil and famas now about the sniper wellive never used sniper when it was serious but an amazing sniper i knew got interested in this game after playing around with awp and ssg for around 10minutes almost forgot about the heavy group of loadout being muuuuch more fun to play now and how the shotguns arent useless from more than 10meters away the only thing which was abit harder to enjoy on this release was jumping harder than 16 but with much more of akindaaircontrol guess i should say might be annoying at first but youll surely enjoy it after getting used to it on top of all those improvements there are weapon skins now making it more fun for the casual players another thing worthy of mentioning would be netcode improvements since ive always played videogames with higher amounts of pingtime ive been more careful about that part in csgo you get to search for servers with pings as high as 350ms nowit doesnt really sound good when said alone but the netcode is done well enough to make sure its still playable with such high latencyhowever you have to cover the high ping time with better and faster reflexes at the end again on a last note i really hope valve improves the source engine a little bit prettier envirounment and characters while saving the simplelooking options wouldnt hurt

like the previous games in the series global offensive is an objectivebased multiplayer firstperson shooter each player joins either the terrorist or counterterrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team the game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a teams objective is completed for most game modes once a player dies they must wait until the round ends to respawn players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions like killing a teammate or hostage takes money away from the player in addition when a round ends all players receive some amount of money with players on the winning team receiving substantially more counter strike global offensive adds new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments most notably the firebomb for each side molotovs for terrorists and incendiary grenades for counterterrorists these temporarily cover a small area in fire dealing damage to anyone passing through

growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 yearsign

i thought cs 16 or quake would never be outdated but csgo managed to make it ill go straight to the point this is the best multiplayer shooter game a real game for esport and casual competition  a great gameplay for huge possibilities for whoever can appreciate fps games  an addictive game when you find a team or people to play with  graphics are great cs source players youre going to feel a change  a high required level of skill strategy and game sense so a really competitive community thats not cod kids and the game is still young and probably going to be still improved as usual many cheaters and some obnoxious players may blot its copybook but damn this game is great

ive gone through at least 3 keyboards purchased 4 seperate copies spent >50 on skins and subscribed to 4 csgo twitchtv channels all because of this one game what can i say its the purest fps shooter that money can buy no killstreaks no deathstreaks no commander mode no marksman bonuses nothing you buy a gun aim it at someones head and bang the person with the highest skill level level will make it out alive thats why the game is still so popular if you enjoy the fps genre do yourself a favour buy this game

you have to play this game i never saw anything like this an awesome first person shooter i recommend it to everybody d
recommended
the counter strike franchise was introduced to me by csgo several friends of mine were constantly playing so i decided to buy this game one of the best decisions ive made this game is the best competitive fps out there and one of the best fps games its not a game where you play to unlock guns attachments scopes etc the only thing to work foward to is getting better this game has a pretty big emphasis on death because the fact you live once per round and you must buy guns at the start of a round you do not spawn with them this game also has a huge emphasis on strategy there is strategy everywhere from how to defend bomb sites to where you plant the bomb on the bomb site there are two competitve gamemodes a bomb scenerio and a hostage scenerio in bomb scenerio the terrorist are trying to plant the bomb on site a or site b and the counter terrorist are trying to stop them in hostage the counter terrorist are trying rescue the hostages while the terrorist are trying to stop the counter terriost both gamemodes are fun and require strategy and map awarness the competitive match making system makes it easy to hop in with friends or your clan and find a match fast with eneimies around your skill level the gameplay is very smooth the shooting mechanics are one my favorites parts on this game with a pretty big emphasis on recoil and headshots compared to other fps games a downside to this game is the visual element its not bad it is playable just not the best the game could look seeing how it was released in 2012 counter strike has a decent community most people are open to new players and will give them tips to help them out i highly recommend this game for people who enjoy competitive fps games if you enjoy this game you will most likely find yourself pouring countless hours into this game to improve your skill i rate this game a 9810

its a really good version of counterstrike probably my favourite the weapons are far more balanced there are more reasons to use grenades other then flashbangs and the gameplay on the whole feels more refined its still counter strike to its core but it shows valve isnt afraid to risk  off their fanbase to release a new one good job

sadly i have to edit my review im playing this game now for just too long to understand the core thinking of the makers of the game sadly i have to give the game a thumbs up anyway because the thumbs up are maybe for the best 1st person shooting game of all time i played them all fromcs begginings till now even cod bf probably all versions till now but i have to admitt all this games cannot top csgo cs is just a very fast team oriented 1st person shooter that will pull you in and never let go atleast what i thought so till now now i have to come to the problem and the problem is cheating since the game came out i knew there would be cheaters it sadly now belongs to almost every online game there is but this became different allredy at the beggining i was wondering about the price of the game  found it kinda cheap for such a good game only 14 euro or something at that point i allready thougt that its kinda easy for cheaters to rebuy a new account even if they should get banned but i could never ever even imagine that it gets even better untill i realized that its beeing sold atleast once a month for ca 3 euro i dont know if this is aa dream or a insult to all the players who want to play a clean game i dont think i have to explain what consequences this had on cheating so because of that the complainments and reports pilled up and valve was searching for a solution that doesnt cost them a thing and they get the cheaters atleast a lil bit under controll so they made overwatch now they dont have to pull a finger and they work is beeing done by slaves players who are hoping on a cleaner game one day nice story but whats this the game costs 3 euro again so this guy cheater buys this time 6 accounts so he has resources now for atleast 4 months to play and cheat this is getting out of control valve you are making allready big money with this skins and market stuff why in gods name cant you spent some of the money for making the game more enjoyable where you bann those cheaters and get us 128tick servers if these arogant stance of yours wont change you will loose probably a lot of players i am a very active player but i quited the game for almost 2 moths last year because of that

the best tactical shooter in the mulitiplayer scene csgo offers a game where uses and tactics are endless this game has a massive learning curve one like no other game but once you overcome this get ready for some tactical owning awesomeness some people do counsider cs 16 and css as better games but that is personal opinions

thank to my friend darkwolf i get this game  ty bro <3
recommended
great game endless fun if you havent already buy this game at once every cent is worth it 1010 fave game
recommended
this game have chicken 1110 better than battlefield and call of duty series
recommended
probably best counter strike ever made i only tried it after 2 years of coming out but i have to say i made a mistake if i know i would buy it even earlier skins for the wapons are also a great idea from valve
recommended
always been a counterstrike fan played them all and this is my favorite one by so far and this brought me back to the series after a long break absolutely love the competetive matchmaking to find players to almost equal skill level as you and the feature to party up with your friends and play a game casual or competetive with them and the new game modes are also fun and the fact that you can search official cs servers and the community made ones the game is good but they need to buff the shotties a little bit except the mag7 cause im tired of getting 8098 damage point blank espacially with the nova shotties are made to kill with one shot or medium damage with fast followup shots c okay rant part is over summary i love this game alrdy even tho only 70 hours in the bank but it has its problems like every game out there if you like fps games andor counterstrike give this game a try and be brave and try out the competetive matchmaking too 3

i just noticed that i havent recommended this yet well not much to say eitherways its not like its my favourite online fps of all time or anything i never played much of the previous games of the franchise but i think i can safely say that cs go is a huge improvement in comparison to the previous games not only in terms of graphical fidelity but also in terms of gameplay map design weapon design and overall everything you know how valve is eitherways even though it was hidden path entertainment who developed cs go i believe valve still has some saying on how they did it and how they keep on improving it the game still is regularly updated mostly due to community feedback and competetive gamers and profissional players feedback and suggestions they not only keep optimizing the maps but also they keep tweaking each weapon which is both good and bad its mainly bad because it will take some time to get used to how the gun works post patch i only have some small complaints about the game the matchmaking system and the hit registration on servers seems to be pretty bad ive heard from other people that in lan games cs go hit registrations are perfect one of the best if not the best out there other than that im hyped to see how the game will progress and how the hardcore community will react to future updates counter strike global offensive is obviously not a game for everyone if youre looking for a casual experience youre better off playing call of duty or battlefield cs go requires time practice and skill that said i cannot recommend this game enough i simply love it
recommended
most addicted game ever
recommended
this game is awesome d
recommended
awesomeone of the worlds most played fpsall must have this gameits just great and fun time
recommended
its nice and awesome for me  competitive play sometimes can be unpleasant because of cheaters or communication issue with your team there are many gooddecent players and sadly more than few bad apples if you find the team for you its awesome 
recommended
alright so here it is counterstrike a game where you shoot people counterstrike condition zero a game where you shoot people but this time it has a singleplayer option counterstrike source a game where you shoot people but with a slight graphical update and ragdoll physics and counterstrike global offensive a game where you shoot people has a graphical update and ragdoll physics and doesnt suck 4 rootin tootin mclovins out of 5
recommended
if youre an american and like counter striking on a global stage this is your offensive or be a terrorist and bomb random unknown locationsign 710 not like call of duty
recommended
the game is actually the old cs 16 with the new graphic i recommend to everyone ho had played cs 16 to try csgo 10 for game 
recommended
such a good game i do not know whats so bad about it yes the recoil has changed but im pretty sure its easy to get used to good game definetely want you to get this
recommended
an endless cycle of getting mad and quitting the game after playing some competitive

very very good game a mustbuiy for any serious gamer

seriously fun no other shooter out there has such a high skill ceiling to a point where there is always room for improvement and always some one better then you csgo adds a true competitive nature to the world of first person shooters that no other shooter can clame to obtain  thumbs up
recommended
this review is in englishportuguese english this is counterstrike do i need to say something else buy it no seriously this game is awesome a survivor of the old shooters were skill aim and care is the most imporant things you can have well actually most important thing here is teamwork and flashbangs portuguese isso  counterstrike preciso falar mais alguma coisa compre no srio este jogo  demais um sobrevivente dos velhos shooters onde habilidade mira e cuidado so as coisas mais imporantes que voc pode ter bom na verdade a coisa mais importante  trabalho em equipe e flashbangs
recommended
pewpewpew i tried going competitive and like really focus on improving didnt actually go so well for me but great game though my friends are crazy over this and it is really fun to watch fps taken to a whole new level realistic and requires real skill you say youve played insert fps game here and say you are good really good well dont get your hopes up because you suck here mechanics are good game play is good learning curve is not that complicated you just need a lot of practice like a lot ps always carry a defusal kit or take from a dead teammate
recommended
ive created a strong love for this game there is something about it to where it doesnt get boring because theres always a great feeling making big plays and being in a 1v3 having your heart racing and being extremely excited you just want more im here to say this game is not for everyone but if you want to get into it this is the time theres always plenty of new players flowing in and learning the game there are some things that really will ruin your experience and that would be cheaters dont be a cheater its good to know the game and gain the skill insteasd of using hacks to improve gameplay but when you get a truly good match its 1515 you know you want to win and its super tense thats when you get a love for the game but if i were you i would truly try to stay away from matchmaking once your past eagle simply because theres to many cheaters and its gotten worse of the years so i highly recommend deathmatching alot play matchmaking while your unranked or a silver for practice learn angles spray control nade flash spots team flashing tends to happen alot make sure you avoid that was much as possble but i highly recommend this game its countless hours of fun expecially with your friends but the number one rule is never give up your going to die alot theres always going to be better players then you thats why you indure your lack of skill and set a goal to be better then those other players also always be positive while doing a competitive matchmake never say good game gg just because you lost 3 rounds in a row that kills your attitude and your teams which will only guarentee a loss also have good sportsmanship like nice shot ns good luck have fun glhf good half gh and remember this games a learning curve so never give up because you will excel at the game at some point so just jeep deathmatching learning map calls gaining game sense and learning angles and never let someone bring you down ignore people who trash talk and make you feel like  always stay positive because you will be big someday youve just got to own it

csgo is love csgo is life

counterstrikes newborn weapon handling and movement are nearly perfect no aiming down sights besides the sniperrifles and really hard recoilbulletspread that you can learn to control it has a hard learning curve but after some time you can get the hang of it the competitve matchmaking is really easy to use and you get most of the time people who are in your skill group after 10 competitive wins you get thrown into a skillgroup now you can rank up or get downranked depends on your skill ingame you can collect skins for you weapons they dont have a advantage there are some skins called stattrak that you can just get through opening cases with a key they have a little killcounter on the weapon that well count your kills that you made with that weapon cases can drop  just like skins after a match but no after every match and there is a drop limit per week if you really want a fancy dandy skin like a m4a4 asiimov or a special kniferarest thing you can get you can either gamble and open cases with bought keys buy your favourite skins on the steam market or use the tradeup contract with the contract that you can find in your global offensive inventory ingame you can trade 10 weapons from one collection for a new better quality weapon from that collection
recommended
its a classic ive sunk way too many hours into this game and i will continue too its frustrating its a brutal game that will tell you when youre crap and when youre good its a great game with some good communities its only 15 dollars its a must have for any gamer that likes a good fps this along with the previous cs games are the king of the fps
recommended
when it was first released counterstrike in few days it was so popular then they created it on new engine more realistic movememnts and realitic physics and two years ago they came to here counter strike global offensive which is serious game compared to its older versions it have clans  competetive gaming and also weapons which are in every color 1010

what else can i say csgo just got better and better since the first time i played it i just love it

counter strike is a very nice game each game has its advantages but also its disadvantages advantages you have many options to play counter strike you can make competitions can be played on normal and abnormal funny servers you get temporarily weapons or boxes that you can use in the game disadvantages disadvantages include the steam or valve occasionally have problems with the servers  it has also cheaters who get nothing in life to the series and want to achieve something in the game although it has more pros and cons but i think thats enough i recommend it to anyone but do not become addicted so have fun with it
recommended
really good game im just not good at it
recommended
what to say about this game everything is on a much higher level than cs 16 you cant compare that two games at all playing it everyday mostly 95% in competitive matches with my friends recommended
recommended
i love this game so much but i have some ideas for other names negev simulator awp simulator auto sniper simulator blame people of hacking simulator but counterstrike is good i guess buy this game now
recommended
obvious as it is  this game is next part of legendary counterstrike series would recommend to everyone who previously played cs 16 or css with lots of graphical improvements this game still has its atmosphere of cs lots of new maps workshop content weapon skins different stream and competetive matchmaking 5v5 with ranking system will keep you entertained all the time higly recommend it

this game will make you cry because of the damn 64 tickrate it will make you throw the object next to your left hand out of the window it will make you laugh because your friend will get 360 noscoped by a teammate but whatever happens you will come back you will pwn people dominate them and get the most beloved global elite rank you will comprehend the euphoric feelings when you get the next rank unless youre a skrub in that case just uninstall

the newest addition in the counter strike series counter strike remains one of the few first person shooters that features a tremendous skillgap both for individual play and for cordinating with your team playing the classic competitive gamemode truly demands you play at your best if you want to climb in the ranks of course csgo has a pretty decent ranking system that pits you against players of your skill level fear not new player while the precise aiming timing your movement with your shots and the recoil patterns of the main rifles are difficult to learn at first once you start controlling them you will be greatly rewarded you will notice you will systematically become better than the newer players at that point the game starts to become addictive getting headshots left and right is just so satisfying in my opinion anyone who calls himself a competitive first person shooter player should play counter strike and invest some time in it theres really no other shooter quite like it
recommended
heres where id put my stamp of approval if i had one
recommended
another great fps that has more to choose from and do then all the counterstrikes with the added skins for weapons it makes the game worth the effort and time to play love the game and i approve of getting it im happy i did
recommended
i like the bit where the guns shoot people  610
recommended
this is the new game of the award winning counter strikes you play as a terrorist like binladen or a counterterrorist who counters the terrorists you buy guns and shoot the enemy until theyre dead or the terrorists plant the bomb there are different gamemodes though such as gun game where you shoot someone and your gun transforms in your hands into another gun and you shoot more good game
recommended
when you get the time or have the money i highly recommend you buy this game if you like to game and havent bought a counter strike game you really havent played most games this game is casual and competitive so it suits every type of fps player and like every valve game you can have custom servers if you dont want to play deathmatch hostage mission or demolition from the 300 some hours ive played on this game id say it was worth the money droid 1

csgo counterstrike global offensive is an online first person shooter game the game is very simular to the other counterstrike games out there but this one is special it has new maps new types of playstyle a great community & ofcourse skins its basically the type of game that you could play for hours and still never get bored of it thanks to a growing community new maps etc this game isnt a hardcore mlgpro 720 noscope simulator like call of duty no offense to the cod community this is basically an awesome game now to the part why you should buy it as i wrote before you could play for hours and still enjoy it this game is not too expensive yet not too cheap it could get expensive if you get into buying skins and such but thats just your choice gameplay gun sounds are good you could recognize every gun and pretty realistic atleast in my opinion sound quality is good especially if you have good quality headphones footsteps etc is good to listen to for improved gameplay aiming and such is very diffrent to other games but is easy to master if you change your crosshair and your sensitivity to what you like and feel comfortable with ________________________________________________________ overall a very good game worth the money 9810  chipflexes

what is the game about in counter chicken global strike there is an infestation of chickens who inhabit such areas as german nuclear facilities or at medieval castle sites this minigame has become a primary game mechanic as any player whom dedicates their time spent online killing these chickens and helping volvo slow their respawn rates you get a flip knife slaughter called peta which can be sold on the community marketplace what else does the game offer also in chicken global counter strike the secondary minigame is the competitive mode in this mode players are put in teams of 5 to combat eachother and test their ability to kill chickens by killing eachother you get assessed and ranked on your ability to kill chickens in this mode verdict i r8 88 gr8 b8 no h8 its just l8

at first this game seems like a childish shooter some relate it to call of duty with no aim actionhowever it is much more than that with a harsh rank system and a rather tactical gameplay which for most will take weeks to master it becomes a game you can no longer put down you may get killed by a p90 10000 round mag  and say you wil never play this game ever again trust me ive been there however if its on competitive you cannot leve therefore it forces you to play more this may lead you to get a 34 killstreak destroying the p90  and all his littel elves this gives you the courage to carry on and may even win this godfosaken match which youve now lost 2 stone over trying to get round corners without becoming a human target however if you use teamwork and dont spray and pray and trust me theres a lot of praying in this game you may win your first few matches therefore leading onto your love for the game missed every single bullest with the awp pulls out pistol gets a headshot and kills him 1010

ok i change my mide csgo is one of the bast fps game i have every play but there still the macth makeing thing that place you in a game with batter ppl that the only con i foundothere there that the game play is good how the gun fire is good the only thing that is sad is that if you do bad for a round everyone call you a nood and if you do good in a round and you kill i lot of player on the other team thay we star calling you a hack  so good luck and have fun and csgo

great first person shooter no doubtyou can kill chickens muahaha chicken simulator 2033 now something serious tho there is no support from other players whatsoever for example when you join a competative match there is no one who helps out a new player all they can say is suka blyat and any other russianslavic language lel and when youre last alive ofcourse your whole team judges every move you make and when you get into a 1v5 clutch situation you get rekt from behind dont forget the votekick system they dont like newbies so prepare to get kicked within 15 seconds on a competative match i do recommend it but pls go play 200 casual b4 you join any competative match or you could just be an ignorant c and dont listen to all the bull i just wrote just join a in compateiv match and lean on your voice chat key and spam darude sandstorme and cheeki breeki all over da ing de_dust 2 map why cuz you can  of other people and try to stay in game without getting kicked and if that aint enough all the russian swearing will eventually give you eye canr oh ehh try to buy an awp and teamkill your friendm8s and you eventually start to think that you are funny for trolling people enjoy the vacbans ladys c

cant play with friends becouse their rank is either too high making me feel like garbage or too low making me compete against 10 year olds i dont want to shoot to kids in cs thats what cod is for random team is either russians most of them cannot team play [ ] either korean so i end up with stats 00 or arabian i cannot play with somebody who sounds so funny either way 910 if youre lucky

csgo is a fast paced action game with many modes many skins many knives and alot of competitive players trying to go for the top of the hill back when i was involved in the beta there were few players that i knew but alot of great enhancments from 16 and source it did take a while to get used to the new engine but as i progressed into the game i got used to the new hitboxes the arms deal update  this update introduced new ways to customize your weapons with different items from either map packs collections or tournament events trying to get the rarest can sometimes get easy or rare cheap or expensive knives are hard to get but also are some of the covert rifles why do i enjoy this game i am able to play with many other players of similar skill and more of the updates are helping making this game alot better with the reddit community having a voice

valve hasnt dissapointed me in 14 years of playing counter strike counter strike source and now counter strike global offensive this is another great title that will keep the community of counter strike enthusists entertained as long as the franchise has exsisted if you have seen the rest cs has never dissapointed where to start the awesome drops you receive from competitive or from playing on community servers out there new skins the ultra rare butterfly knife skin is what lots are looking for overwatch is the newest and best system out there to keep out the cheaters who think they can win at all costs i am glad that overwatch is out there i cant wait til it branches out to all counter strike series play csgo and you will enjoy it

this game is something else you will start as a rookie you will not be a pro in a few weeks hell not even in a few months but once you learn how to play this game properly and master it you will enjoy it this game does not only require gun skill however 90% of this game is teamwork yes you will need friends to play this game with otherwise youll be stuck with other people that scream  kurwa noob over the voice chat and you will most likely lose those games so get some friends start up csgo go practice and have some fun oh yeah you can also buy keys to unbox crates and possibly get items worth more than they are irl great game 910
recommended
in two words great game the controls arent complicated the works of the game arent complicated yet they always pose a challenge sick of spraying and seeing cod noobs run past and kill you to just sprint off again play counter strike if you run and gun here youll miss 999% of your clip and get shot right in the kisser

my teeth were clenched like how my fingers were clenched on the handle and forestock of my awp that i had scavenged earlier i had paused to admire the blueish purple honeycombs on the sniper rifle now i no longer cared about how my weapon looked like as long as it could fire a projectile fast enough to end the life of my target i was satisfied the fiend was still shooting his battle cry was fresh in my ears as was the sound of the bomb the timer ticking away his imi negev pelted the gap in the wall with dozens of bullets each one threatening to take my head off that sorry fate had happened to my comrades who laid dead on the ground with 556x45mm bullets in their still corpses i was the last one i could avenge my comrades defuse the bomb and emerge a hero or i could die i looked for other options leaving the bomb was not an option going through the double doors would only sign my death certificate as my lateteammates proved i had to do it the terrorists gun had a high rate of fire but it was inaccurate at such a range it was the only gamble that i could take a mental clock timed down in my head threetwoone i bolted through the gap but not all the way i brought up my rifle staring through the scope at the madman who continued to shoot haphazardly his bullets were flying around i felt a searing gash of heat on my thigh and knew i was hit once but it would not save the murderer my crosshairs now laid upon his chest which was drenched with sweat and stained with the blood of men my finger already closed around the trigger squeezed it the shot rang out and the 338 lapua magnum round tore through the air and into the terrorists chest ending his life instantly i lowered my rifle panting heavily i had no time to celebrate i looked down at the planted bomb less than 10 seconds away from igniting i leapt down from the boxes landing squarely on my feet i had cast away the awp pulling out my defusal kit instead i gripped the pliers and squatted down my fingers reached for the bomb closing around it i eased the pliers between the wire hearing the beeping get faster and faster i squeezed my right hand tight and the beeping stopped i fell back on my backside dropping the pliers as i took massive gulps of air this was the ninth operation i took part in and the ninth one that i emerged alive that was my story depicting my recent competitive game on dust 2 yes the awp was the electric hive skin yes it was at b if you want a summary of a good round of csgo there it is if you want my rating of the game here it is 1010 would play again for every day for the next 3 years get what i am implying valve where is my hl3 xd epilogue d alarms blared in the dormitory i quickly did up my uniform lacing up my boots and reaching for my heckler and koch p2000 and my knife as i slid them into the holster and the sheath i could feel the adrenaline rushing in my tenth operation i pulled my balaclava on followed by my helmet my mind began racing thinking about what would happen should i be able to return from this i would be assessed by the board and designated to a squad i had spent many nights dreaming about the moment of course to reach that moment i would have to come out of this operation alive and i was going to come out of it alive i will survive not just survive i will win

i used to like this game its funny because id rather team fortress 2 over this now ever since late 2014now  csgo is full of toddlers  teens saying how theyre better than you and you are   people unboxing on youtube screaming gabengaben oh please gaben to the point where its not even funny and cringeworthy and not to mention a handful of gamer girls on twitch unboxing and playing the game just for money nowadays you probably cant get put into a game without some kid with a five nights at freddys picture  some kid screaming praise gaben into the mic and people with a $1000 inventory and theyre not even good at the game even when you go competitive and you are going to get harassed by the other team and called a hacker when you get good shots or are better than them before people actually complimented them getting a nice kill or an ace  now its just hacker  lol enjoy the vac bro lolol and if the other team end up getting a nice kill on you its just  lololo get remt  rekt u   get good at the game remt remt remt remt but the game itself is actually really good and has nice gunsmap designs and mechanics but the community itself is slowly turning into a cross of call of duty and team fortress 2 tldr  csgo community is  but game is good

high energy diverse community and a glorious history are but a few terms one may use to describe the counter strike series global offensive takes the cs game back to the forefront of fps gaming with updated graphics weapon customizations and an overall remodeling of the game mechanics csgo is well worth the purchase and is a welcome addition to the valve developed game library time to pick up that negev and say a few hail marys

this game seems really easy yet it is quite hard from the start of the game i noticed that looking down sights on all weapons is a lost luxury hip firing and learning how to burst is the name of the game it gets frustrating sometimes but the game is an overall fun game i recommend it 910

one of the best shooter game ive ever seen

favorite current fps but not all time all of the game modes that the game offers are fun if you enjoy the game and often made updates to the game are satisfying operation packs aside from cheaters and griefers who youll come across surely matchmaking is my favorite along side with casual community servers offer a lot of fun maps and game modes as well such as zombie de_surf de_rats etc the game offers a bonus minigame which is called unboxing a case if you choose to play it you will often be left with disappointment and questions raised by your family such as where has all the money gone some say the ecstasy you recieve from winning some of the rarest items in the game is worth the tears you cry after opening some of these cases legend says that by selling the most valuable item recieved from the unboxing a case game youll have enough money to buy ever game on steam 1010 would open more

preordered the game during its first launching hours  this game was the next up coming game for the counter strike franchise as it was developed by valve and released in 2012 the game features new maps and weapons such as smgs such as the mp7  mp5 and mp9 other pistols involves the tec9 p250  along with p200 along many patches and updates comes more features and maps  one such as the past counter strike 16 and source  silencers were brought back along with classic weapons  m4a1  usp  very recommended for favour fps shooters with its low prices  would be great to purchase it at half price $750

since i played 16 and stopped it i thought i would never come back to a counterstrike game again i was wrong saw the game on sale flipped my  when i couldnt buy it when it was low and bought it at full price 1010 anyway it really brings the competitive scene that has been missing in counterstrike for casual players matchmaking mode is really fun especially when you get at least decent teammates my friends list became twice larger ever since i started playing this game ive had my laughs ive had my cries in this game but i still cant get enough of it you constantly want to improve and get a bigger rank there are also really good alternative versions of matchmaking called pugs pickup games really addictive for casual and competitive fps players

first of all note that graphon really managed and not even in terms of the cruisey hiendnote graphics but in terms of quality of work of designers mappers modelers and others because the maps look really good modelki weapons and players are also good that is in fact they just made qualitatively and of themselves are good but look if they do well in this game is another question  in short graton i liked despite the fact that generally counter strike is not a game where important grafon at least there is no such flatulence excessive brightness as in source  graphon go just a nice where you have the gloomy where it is bright in general good graton normal pleases the eye and the stars from the sky is not enough and the map is very good that is as most of the maps in go are copies of classic maps from 16 however in contrast to the same source environment and the design altered almost completely  if the source just got my texture added normal sormovsky features like lying all over the map garbage there is virtually completely redesigned the concept and idea cards leaving almost intact the original structure of the map for example de_dust2 in 16 and source is a common eastern city with pointed domes and intricate paintings a la cartoons about aladdin in go this map looks like a very levels of some cod 4 because now this is not the tale of aladdin but rather dilapidated streets of say syria in this respect go a head taller than their predecessors meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression most of the maps in go are copies of classic maps from 16 however in contrast to the same source environment and the design altered almost completely  if the source just got my texture added normal sormovsky features like lying all over the map garbage there is virtually completely redesigned the concept and idea cards leaving almost intact the original structure of the map for example de_dust2 in 16 and source is a common eastern city with pointed domes and intricate paintings a la cartoons about aladdin in go this map looks like a very levels of some cod 4 because now this is not the tale of aladdin but rather dilapidated streets of say syria in this respect go a head taller than their predecessors meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression all salt that go missing like to call it nanowaste 16 was very simple very cozy home to some source immediately i did not like  but even he was closer to 16 go looks more like a reincarnation of some kalouti in the setting of counter strike but not the reincarnation of 16 which oldpage will cry tears of joy and childishly happy face to fill the rep laying bombs it rather smacks of a banal desire to cut money for the same game for the third time as would be sad as that sounds another thing i want to say  go is very ambiguous in terms of its scall ie developers for example wanted to add in a new game mods from the old games that were very popular this well but they added for some reason only the gungame mode  it is here we must pay tribute implemented well and about no less popular zombiemod deathrun jailbreak somehow forgot it seems that the developers do not know how to make the game was close in spirit to the original but it has pleased the fans of modern soulless postrelushka and add a little bit of everything in the blind hope that this trick will work now added for example gungame here graton pulled well the rep and icloud too but what pushed statistics and ranks these ing added new weapon why dog on earth added everything seems so normal it was but no  added some idiotic tactical grenadesblende some molotov cocktails which blu ive never let nobody uses zapili some popsource trailers on youtube that all so spot on and crap  oh what a new counterstrick soapcool goka przekazu and get the cannon in tf2 but the whole point of the game is that not myltse and not even in puschka here such pies well something like that i think of my words and colour illustrations can in principle be what is no idea of global offensive actually to make it even with the beta then i even review i wanted to write but somehow it never happened in general after the beta not much has changed popisil nasty bugs added new pictures to the main menu oh yeah all other nonsense  but the game itself remains the same and even then at the stage of beta you can understand what is still feil because valve have tried to keep up with two rabbits and make a game that would love and ardent fans of the series and fans of the newfangled postrelushka and chip fellas that for example those lovers of the postrelushka will not find in the new game is none favorite blokov or hurricane some gameplay or killstreaks equipment single campaign in general starburst solid and only and the old farts in the new game will not find the spirit of the old school old models of weapons any hints rasprygat and other joys of life and it is not clear to me boys for whom this game is made and no im not saying this game is bad not at all it is able to inspire and not even for one night and maybe even someone to buy the box with the game which will be even smell good  but from the studio named valve everybody has come to expect more summing up short so to say the verdict csgo is a game for a generation who does not know what b51 and dablack the only question is lol do i need itself go to this generation

game is really fun and has a very good competive match

one of the best games i have ever played there are some anoyying bits here and there like how you get cooldowns after every 2 games you win if you are unranked or if your computer shuts down and you dont get back in the 3 very very very short minutes then you get a cooldown and if that happens over and over again you can get a 7 day ban well other than that it is a fantastic game i have been playing it for 3 weeks and have had so much fun competetive is the best its not like your playing call of duty and you can just play for fun most of the time its serious because you are trying to not derank and you are trying to rankup overall 55
recommended
while getting into this game can be kinda hard since its not your average noskill shooter the moment you get the basics this game become extreme fun you rely in your teammates more than you would think and communication is key i would buy this game if you like teamwork and you like games that require skill to play or you can just buy a p90 rush and enjoy silver rank

csgo is a nearperfect multiplayer shooter unlike the previous versions which were often difficult to get in to this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels it has a large community and a well supported workshop ensuring that this discountpriced game will be around for years to come the game isnt much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original half life 2 was however valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis is it worth getting if you already own counter strike source yes css was always counter strike shoehorned into the source engine csgo feels far more like a standalone game valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game the best feature must be the competitive play where you play 10 games that you cannot leave unless you want to tarnish your reputation after which youll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill meaning that the game is challenging but fair no matter what skill level you are there are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join really if i was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice its bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come something that cant be said for the call of duty franchise which is probably its closest rival remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year fragmenting the community plus you can customise your weapon skins in csgo surely thats the most important feature all they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in csgo

one of the best games i have ever played there are some anoyying bits here and there like how you get cooldowns after every 2 games you win if you are unranked or if your computer shuts down and you dont get back in the 3 very very very short minutes then you get a cooldown and if that happens over and over again you can get a 7 day ban well other than that it is a fantastic game i have been playing it for 3 weeks and have had so much fun competetive is the best its not like your playing call of duty and you can just play for fun most of the time its serious because you are trying to not derank and you are trying to rankup overall 55

im gonna redo the review since mine was outdated go is counterstrike and its just as punishing as the other ones but compared to source you have better hitboxes and recoil system what makes it the most played cs today is that for one its the newest one but more importantly valve actually updates it and built it from ground up from pro and community feedback gameplaywise youll have the same experience with enhanced visuals if youre a seasoned csgo player but if youre new youre probably going to get dominated if you simply jump into competitive games new players should watch pro plays to get an understanding of game sense and get comfortable with a role and for your own sake dont soloqueue or youll grow a hatred on everything that remotely sounds russian the roles are entry and second rifler lurker and awper even though many say awping is for noobs dont get discouraged if you feel yourself comfortable with the scoped 1shot rifle go for the role regardless as for matchmaking community it goes as is silver will be the nicest teammates you can have and might even gift you skins but their kindness doesnt make up for skill if you seek the competetive edge nova will be okayish but theres some toxicity master guardian to dmg will be toxics who flame you if you dont execute a play their way even if its a win eagles and upwards take this game too seriously pursue a career in esports or soon will have a vac badge on their account now that ive aforementioned skins arms deal introduced them at first it was recieved negative fire from the community and even called tf2fication nowadays youll find everyone being in posession of skins theres even gambling sites for digital items from this game and keys have become a digital currency making the tf2 point somewhat true in terms of economy youll want to consider whether or not to jump into this game as itll take a lot of time to be decent since the competitive part has a lot to learn if youre more of a casual player theres also game modes that cover that and the legacy community servers which are put into the background but luckily still existent and very active competetive or not its a worthwhile shooter for its price which can even pay itself if you have sufficient semantics skill or are plain lucky and if you look long enough you might find the nicer part of this community but also pay attention to your expenses should you get into unboxings as special offers and music kits are also cosmetic items in a nutshell you dont need them because theyre cosmetic but you get them anyway for bragging rights or to be part of the cool kids now jump in and dont forget the defuse kit [if you happen to be russian ignore the last sentence]

the definitive competitive online fps it blows away the competion with good map design and the overall gameplay this game is all about getting every slight advantage you can and using it against your oppenent this game is not like battlefeild or cod this game is very much like chess where your placement and positioning can affect the outcome of a game this all adds up to make csgo one of the most addicting games ive ever played id reccomend playing with friends instead of solo queing because you are very likely to lose if you solo que with that said good luck have fun

first of all note that graphon really managed and not even in terms of the cruisey hiendnote graphics but in terms of quality of work of designers mappers modelers and others because the maps look really good modelki weapons and players are also good that is in fact they just made qualitatively and of themselves are good but look if they do well in this game is another question  in short graton i liked despite the fact that generally counter strike is not a game where important grafon at least there is no such flatulence excessive brightness as in source  graphon go just a nice where you have the gloomy where it is bright in general good graton normal pleases the eye and the stars from the sky is not enough and the map is very good that is as most of the maps in go are copies of classic maps from 16 however in contrast to the same source environment and the design altered almost completely  if the source just got my texture added normal sormovsky features like lying all over the map garbage there is virtually completely redesigned the concept and idea cards leaving almost intact the original structure of the map for example de_dust2 in 16 and source is a common eastern city with pointed domes and intricate paintings a la cartoons about aladdin in go this map looks like a very levels of some cod 4 because now this is not the tale of aladdin but rather dilapidated streets of say syria in this respect go a head taller than their predecessors meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression most of the maps in go are copies of classic maps from 16 however in contrast to the same source environment and the design altered almost completely  if the source just got my texture added normal sormovsky features like lying all over the map garbage there is virtually completely redesigned the concept and idea cards leaving almost intact the original structure of the map for example de_dust2 in 16 and source is a common eastern city with pointed domes and intricate paintings a la cartoons about aladdin in go this map looks like a very levels of some cod 4 because now this is not the tale of aladdin but rather dilapidated streets of say syria in this respect go a head taller than their predecessors meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression all salt that go missing like to call it nanowaste 16 was very simple very cozy home to some source immediately i did not like  but even he was closer to 16 go looks more like a reincarnation of some kalouti in the setting of counter strike but not the reincarnation of 16 which oldpage will cry tears of joy and childishly happy face to fill the rep laying bombs it rather smacks of a banal desire to cut money for the same game for the third time as would be sad as that sounds another thing i want to say  go is very ambiguous in terms of its scall ie developers for example wanted to add in a new game mods from the old games that were very popular this well but they added for some reason only the gungame mode  it is here we must pay tribute implemented well and about no less popular zombiemod deathrun jailbreak somehow forgot it seems that the developers do not know how to make the game was close in spirit to the original but it has pleased the fans of modern soulless postrelushka and add a little bit of everything in the blind hope that this trick will work now added for example gungame here graton pulled well the rep and icloud too but what pushed statistics and ranks these ing added new weapon why dog on earth added everything seems so normal it was but no  added some idiotic tactical grenadesblende some molotov cocktails which blu ive never let nobody uses zapili some popsource trailers on youtube that all so spot on and crap  oh what a new counterstrick soapcool goka przekazu and get the cannon in tf2 but the whole point of the game is that not myltse and not even in puschka here such pies well something like that i think of my words and colour illustrations can in principle be what is no idea of global offensive actually to make it even with the beta then i even review i wanted to write but somehow it never happened in general after the beta not much has changed popisil nasty bugs added new pictures to the main menu oh yeah all other nonsense  but the game itself remains the same and even then at the stage of beta you can understand what is still feil because valve have tried to keep up with two rabbits and make a game that would love and ardent fans of the series and fans of the newfangled postrelushka and chip fellas that for example those lovers of the postrelushka will not find in the new game is none favorite blokov or hurricane some gameplay or killstreaks equipment single campaign in general starburst solid and only and the old farts in the new game will not find the spirit of the old school old models of weapons any hints rasprygat and other joys of life and it is not clear to me boys for whom this game is made and no im not saying this game is bad not at all it is able to inspire and not even for one night and maybe even someone to buy the box with the game which will be even smell good  but from the studio named valve everybody has come to expect more summing up short so to say the verdict csgo is a game for a generation who does not know what b51 and dablack the only question is lol do i need itself go to this generation

csgo counterstrike global offensive is an online first person shooter game the game is very simular to the other counterstrike games out there but this one is special it has new maps new types of playstyle a great community & ofcourse skins its basically the type of game that you could play for hours and still never get bored of it thanks to a growing community new maps etc this game isnt a hardcore mlgpro 720 noscope simulator like call of duty no offense to the cod community this is basically an awesome game now to the part why you should buy it as i wrote before you could play for hours and still enjoy it this game is not too expensive yet not too cheap it could get expensive if you get into buying skins and such but thats just your choice gameplay gun sounds are good you could recognize every gun and pretty realistic atleast in my opinion sound quality is good especially if you have good quality headphones footsteps etc is good to listen to for improved gameplay aiming and such is very diffrent to other games but is easy to master if you change your crosshair and your sensitivity to what you like and feel comfortable with ________________________________________________________ overall a very good game worth the money 9810  chipflexes

csgo is a really good game but it has one of the worst communities in the history of games its a really good game to play competitive matchmaking with your friends but if you play alone youll quickly find out that you would much rather not be playing a competitive match can last up to 90 minutes and if you abondon the game kill 3 teammates or deal a lot of damage to them abuse the kick system afking or cheating you will get punished in bans the first time you break one of the rules above you get a 30 minute ban if you break the rules after that you get a 2 hour ban then 24 hours and finally a 7 day ban now think of it like this you decide to join a competitive match while playing alone you get matched with some really nasty people and you have to sit there and deal with them for the next 90 minutes and if you leave the match you get punished for it 1010 would play with friends 010 would never play alone soloqueue

 1010  im addicted this game is so much fun its great to play with your friends easy to learn and has multiple features that keep you coming back there are five differnt game types so there is always something you can play even if the game types get old there is custom where you can play user made maps with endless different types of things to do something really cool about it is that there are two versions of the main game competitive and casual in casual you can practice and it just for fun with nothing ever being saved in competitive wins and losses affect your points the higher points you have the higher rank you get people in competitive hope to one day make it to global elite the highest rank possible which very few players ever make it into another interesting thing is skins and using the market i cant really explain that so you will just have to play and see i dont often give a perfect score but 1010

okay time for a real review this is the first counterstrike game i actually got into and i never realized what id been missing all these years the mechanics of this game make it unlike any other franchise avalible today but with a game this big that just means more people and more problems im am currently distinguished master guardian at the time of writing this review and i can firmly say that each game i play in matchmaking is either against at least one smurf someone of a high rank on a new account playing against lower ranked players or a hacker sure there are external matchmaking services like esea cevo or faceit but the ingame matchmaking should still be playable that being said if you dont already own this game i would highly suggest getting it but if you find that you like it a lot and want to get better be prepared to play a lot this is not a game you can just pick up and be amazing at like call of duty or any other arcade shooter you actually have to invest time into this game if you want to play competive matches and get better at the game for one thing you shoot while you are moving and you also need to learn how to control the spray pattern of your weapons because bullets do not stay on your crosshair closing words this is a fantastic game with its flaws of course very solid gameplay mechanics that helped shape pc fpss today but also ran by a company which is known for not being transparent with their customers if you really want to get into this game and learn what its all about find some friends and start playing because soon you wont be able to go 3 days without playing a match glhf

hard game for beginners but eventually its fun this is the first fps game ive played that demands careful shots thanks to recoil than bullet spamming enemies once theyre in your crosshair the bullet penetration adds the realworld flavour and theres even a warmup round for shooting just about anywhere even that filthy hostage if youre on terrorist side 1010 would recommend for challengeseekingcompetitive gamers mostly but not so for the easygoing casual fps gamers who prefer continuous bullet spam

this is a super awesome and fun game that reminds me of cod modern warfarebetter known as cod4 anyone who has been playing fpss for years will understand what i am saying and generally everyone agrees that cod4 was one of the best franchise fps games ever developed while i dont think csgo is on the cod4 level it certainly does have that feel to it and thats what draws me towards this game the feeling i get from this game is one of simplicity and functionality something too many game corporations out there continue to skip right past all they want to do is make these crazy fps games with all these unnecessary gadgets and killstreaks and tons of other crap when in reality all the game community wants is a simple stable fun and hardcore matchmaking powerhouse for me csgo hits all of the high points while only hitting maybe one or two of the low points get this game

this game is amazing it is a remake of an old classic which is still strong on top 10 most played steam game after 15 years running counterstrike its a game that is simply defined as a barebones tense shooter its very simple you either defend an objective be that a hostage or more commonly a bombbombsite from the either side or attack said objective its a game where the tides forever shift in one instant your team may have bomb control an insane advantage for ct side in another its only you left against a lone terrorist and the bomb is ticking down slowly though it may not be appealing for everyone if you like shooters and dont want to churn out $60 each year for trash heaps of lame socalled twitchshooters look no further oh also there are weapon skins but no one buys a game just to show off expensive knife skins right right  rating knife10 would blame 64 tick again

in my opinon the best fps ever created the match making is great for competitve play or just playing some casual games with friends it also features revamped graphics and interface from counter strike source it also has some nice new gamemodes like an offical deathmatch and gungame  a new gamemode called demolition which is kind of like gungame and a normal bomb plant gamemode combined i enjoy this the most out of the cs series it even offers some new weapons that are fun to use like mollys a sawed off shotgun my personal favorite the tec 9 and even a tazer
recommended
your skill is based on the market value of your inventory skins can be worth 25 times that of the game itself you get one hit by most guns if people can use them well most people can use said guns well larger concentration of 12 year old australians than tf2 little s beg for skins seriously  australian kids 1110 would buy again brilliant game edit 1000 hours on and ive wasted hundreds of dollars on this game im ing le said id stop at nova christ almighty come to realise that there are shitcunts galore and i am one of them i literally did buy again i have purchased the same ing game purely to  on new players and feel superior  this game 1210

the best competitive game ive played so far it is a lot of fun especially when youre playing with your friends in competitive mode i can totally recommend this game
recommended
a very fun game to play this game is very competetive and at times you will have your team shouting at you because you didnt do something correctly there is no doubt in my mind that this games community is extremely toxic putting this aside it can be very fun game to play once you get that first initial learning curve down one thing that everyone says about this game is that its easy to learn but hard to master  jimmy

i like this game im defenitly not a smurf 911
recommended

awp simulator 2012 i like it virtual knives that cost more than real knives stickers that cost as much as they do in the real world and weapon skins worth 10 cents and let everyone know you are good this game has everything you never knew you wanted out of a game
recommended
this game is absolutely sickening proving to be a well rounded fps that really gets the headshots pumping really enjoy clicking on heads gj
recommended
never played this thing my 1st hour of playing was discovering how to buy grenades now i can kill people with boom of course i always miss
recommended
the community of this game is pretty offensive ahahahahaha im sorry ill leave  1010 from ign i like league of legends mroe than dota2  at me nerds
recommended
shoot someone then shoot them again repeat
recommended
the objective of counterstrike global offensive is to find cases after matches then sell those cases on the steam marketplace so you can earn money to buy a better game
recommended
im a single father and gaben banned me from competitive until half life 3 comes out  which will never come out  if you like this post it will help me raise enough money for me to buy another csgo please help god bless ps  i got banned for taking hostages in csgo and sacrifing them to ea it was a mistake im sorry gabe plesae forgive
recommended
counterstrike global offensive is both a good and a terrible game and if i say terrible i mean the deathmatch the deathmatch is on the same level like his mw 3 counterpart which means it is unplayable it allows to kill people from behind and the spawn protection is to long the fact that cs go needs a spawn protection for a deathmatch mode shows how bad the game designe is and yes i know that deathmatch is the most unimportant game mode but this doesnt change the facts the rest in a short form casual to many players per side it would be more playable with 8v8 or 7v7 matches arms race  demolition at all funny modes if you have a 30 minute break at work and nothing to do play it competitive try to play it just with friends playing with randoms can be really annoying
recommended
bought it for pho s moaning
recommended
best way to learn russian as fast as possible 
recommended
game would be pefrect without smurfshackers and russians
recommended
its the greates counter strike yet
recommended
sold nearly all of my skins to buy gta v then i found out it wasnt even on sale rip
recommended
this game is the best game ive ever played i may have a slight skin addiction but thats not important when i say slight i mean major beware of the skins it doesnt even matter if youre good or bad at the game all that matters is how your weapons look so with that 1010 would go broke again
recommended
one of the best fps games i have ever played get it
recommended

i think cs go is one of the best fps games you can play normal games and you can play competitive games the competitive games are 5 vs 5 and by playing you get a rank if you loose much your rank will decrease and if you win much your rank will increase you can buy weapons of the steam market for steam wallet money you can watch streams of pros and tournaments
recommended
all my friends left my chats to play comp 1010 would cry alone again

recommended
good game if you play comp and can find a team to play with solo queue sucks feed gaben by opening cases 1010 would unbox knife again
recommended
this game is truly a masterpiece it provides hours of fun weather you are playing alone or with friends it has a competitve stage for people who really just want to play to win and there are tons of community servers with different mods and gamemodes the game also has skins which change the appearence of you weapons in game you can get these skins by random chance at the end of each game or open up boxes for a chance at different skins for a fee these skins can then be sold on the steam market for real money or traded for other skins while this game is amazing it also has its cons there is a notable amount of hackers in the game even though valve is trying its best to keep them out of the game they are still there but that is the main con of course the game has some glitches here and there but the hackers are really the main issue even with its cons this game is really amazing 910
recommended
used my mothers credit card to buy a karambit knife was evicted wasnt disappointed 910 ign approves
recommended
one of my most played games recently although i didnt play the other games in the franchise global offensive hooked me in its simple yet complex gameplay the gunplay is remarkably fun and veterans to the franchise will no doubt tell you of the strategy and competitive nature of the game semieasy to learn difficult to master and tons of fun to play

best game on steam by gaben d
recommended
do i recommend this game yes in the most ironic way possible counter strike is not your traditional first person shooter but by golly is it one of the best what i love about this game is the fact that running around and spraying doesnt work at all sorry call of duty if you do that you wont even get a single hit on your target just a shot to the head and not a second thought this game revolves around coordinated team work and if you dont have that you are not going to win a single match being good at shooting will only get you so far this game is best played with a group of friends to form your own 5 man team because sitting on skype or any other third party voice communication program with 5 people you know is a lot easier than holding a key to talk to people you dont know but the beauty of this game is that most of the time you have to learn to stratagize with people you have never talked to before and that is really cool everyone wants to win so everyone works together of course there are always some people who team kill dont work with the team or just spout omg hax everytime they die but dont let these few people scare you away from this game it is the most fustrating yet sastifying fps i have ever played each day i get better at it and each day i enjoy it more and more only about 50 hours in and lots more to go to be a global elite in summary csgo requires practice team work and patience but when you start getting the hang of it by damn is it a great time no matter how angry it can make you its a whole lot of fun
recommended
its like roulette fun until it turns into russian
recommended
less snipers than dota 2
recommended

recommended
this game is a very competitive and fast paced shooter that actually requires skill use of tactics flashbangs grenades and team work is very important in this game to succeed there are hackers but usually not alot of them in the upper ranks mg1ge this game is an opportunity to play competitively with friends or other random people or to just mess about on deathmatch either way youll have fun 
recommended
what can i say really its counter strike play it kill people rage when they kill you then blame it on the lag
recommended
my csgo review oh csgo how much youve changed when i first preordered the game i thought man another one in the series i bet this is going to be the best and so i was right 1st day it came out played it won my first round myself i still rememeber the feedback i got game came out and someone has already skilled it oh the wonderful comments but something happened i started leaving it i dont know why then i wouldnt read what gamemode i was playing started leaving getting a cooldown not caring and now up to this point ive reached a 7 day everytime then i started leaving the game again 2 days 4 days etc ive left it for sooooo long i finally came back when chroma case came out now i go back to find the game not like it used to be screaming gamers 12 year olds getting the game because they wanted to be cool salty casual people who rage at everything and last but not least unboxing i knew it would happen just like tf2 which is already ruined with hats and miscs and crates the game i used to know has been ruined people buying crates unboxing sellingskins they run the place now im here with people thinking there better then anyone now of course ive fallen within that catergory ive unboxed bought skins and i feel guilty that the happy excited me has fallen within this pathetic part of csgo however i still like the game gamers still try to be the very best like noone ever was others want to play for fun others want to be rich or make subscribers out of unboxing i respect that but it annoys me how this is becoming a thing with most popular valve games not hl2 now all the people who dislike this review i dont mind people who likes this review agrees with me i honestly dont want to have a fight in the comment section so i give this a thumbs up because the gaming community can get better if we stop buying skins and just appreciate what a wonderful game is under there if we stop ragingunboxingcaring about trading and look within what a awesome game this was back when it came out thank you valve for making a wonderful game within crates and unboxing

i reccomend all people to get this game it is amazing

recommended
game is called global offensive yet only seems to come with some map called italy or something am told by global elites that there is one other map called de_dustii but nobody ever plays it jokes aside this game is better than source by a long shot and i think over time it will get better than the 1016 glory days

well now that i have what was it like 1 whole thousand hours in the game i can give it a fair review ive been with this game for a long time now since it was released infact and i dont regret it now ofcourse there are some pros and cons im gonna carefully explain why i love this game and why i hate it sometimes here we go to start off this game is great and i mean great as in its highly competetive and it has a long learning curve so you cant just hop in and wreck noobs right off the bat you have to learn the game to like it for some it may seem stupid and it makes the game less accessible for newer players which is true but its a good thing this game also has a ranking system which is not always fair and it may give a new player a higher rank which then will be callibrated as he plays competetive games ofcourse with a system like this there are flaws but ill get into them later this system has a thing called overwatch which lets people decide which player seems like hes hacking and so on again more on that later skins its all about skins these days isnt it well if you like wasting your hard earned money on cases keys or already unpacked skins this is the game for you they give you the feeling of awesomness you feel invincible ofcourse its only to the point where you get pounded in the  repeatedly by another player but thats not the case you can bet these skins sell them and really do whatever you want with them they give no extra stats to the guns theyre purely cosmetic now we get into flaws this game has alot of hackers and i mean alot not to the point where its unplayable and every single competetive game has a hacker but to the point of this is just ridiculous ofcourse lower ranks have no hackers but there are some kids who think that everyone whos better than them is hacking and they just start blatantly using aimbot and wallhacks about overwatch ofcourse the system is great but just like any system out there it has some flawes to start off let me say that this system is imperfect it really is most of the time people get banned wrongfully i myself has been banned multiple times on smurf accounts im against them but i just like to play with my friends for 7 to 365 days and trust me im not a very good player either i want this system changed completely like make it so people only can become investigators when theyre actually a high rank make it mgdmg or something and more than 200 games played instead of 150 so i started off by hoping to give this game a fair rating so here we go this game is a strong 810 with some ballancing issues but thats fixable the developers listen to the public and theyre giving players what they want and i like it so do you agree hit that like button so the people will see it

i only have about 60 hours into this game so far and i am only a silver 1 at the moment but so far i can say i love this game since this is my first proper review ill just give separate ratings for each main aspect notice in this review i compare many aspects to call of duty that is because cod in my opinion gameplay  910 unlike games like call of duty csgo takes skill concentration and communication in competitive matches which is obviously the main part of the game correct me if im wrong you absoulutely can not run off on your own and try to kill every enemy like people try to do in other fps games you have to talk with your team plan your strategies buy the right gun and play the right role there is no medkit you cannot sit behind a box and wait for your health to regenerate as for the guns each different gun has different stats such as damage fire rate and mobility on top of the different stats they also have recoil patterns that take a bit of time to learn and master unlike cod you cannot run around shooting and expecting to hit everything take the awp for example in my opinion it is the most widely used sniper in the game one hit kill from the waist up i think except it is terribly inaccurate while moving or unscoped this forces the user to scope and take time to practice their shots multiplayer  10 as for the multiplayer i cannot think of a proper score for this as every person will have a different experience online in half of my games the players were toxic cursing out teammates over the mic calling people names starting fights and being flat out douches in the other half however i really enjoyed playing and talking to the other players in the game we communicated efficiently even if we lost a round we wouldnt get mad at each other in some of those games people even offered to help improve another players skill and no not sarcastically like hey [player name] if you ever want to get some tips or anything just message me and ill be happy to help actual message i got graphics   i cant judge the graphics of this game its running off of an engine thats 5 years old i like it but i cant rate it overall rating 9510 would play again notice that i capitalized in my opinion because i want people to know that those are my opinions you dont have to agree with them

this game is a very competitive and fast paced shooter that actually requires skill use of tactics flashbangs grenades and team work is very important in this game to succeed there are hackers but usually not alot of them in the upper ranks mg1ge this game is an opportunity to play competitively with friends or other random people or to just mess about on deathmatch either way youll have fun

alright little late cough but a review counterstrike global offensive and the entire counterstrike series are amazing games it combines infinite user designed maps on custom servers for extreme amounts of fun if you are not already interested in the competive mode the bare skin and bones of any counterstrike game to date it is the core game inside this game that makes it so fun the reason it it so fun is that urge to get better to be the best counter strike is a game where you can always be better and there is always room for improvement and it is that skill and randomness of skill in the games even global elites the highest rank in the game can play like the lowest rank if they dont practice for say 3 months it is that that makes counterstrike the game it is why we sink so many hours into the game and why it is our favorite game it is not for everyone but it is for those people who strive to do better be the best and have a fun time with friends through losses and great victory this is counterstrikeglobal offensive and all cs buy it today
recommended
an amazing addition to the cs series whith the series best graphicswhilst fast and easy on ramgpu systems interface and gameplay that is uncomparable to any of the other games as the gameplay might be closerit is a fpsit still keeps the feel and play of cs with an additional amount of new feautres and cleaner hud the menu and interfaces in the game unique and works well and is quik and easy to get used to without distracting or steering away from oldermodern interfaces as for the new official gamemodes for the game adds more hours and fun to the game versus source or any of the others

i played cs from 15  started out when i was 12 or 13 i believe played 16 for years went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch i remember the wcg in 2006 with sweden vs poland and how much i just loved the game eventually like everything scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing in november of 2014 i wanted to give a shot at my favorite old fps  which now was csgo downloaded tried it at first i wasnt fully convinced due to the fact that i havent played cs in ages and i was still used to 16 however  with some more time i started to like it watched dreamhack final 2014 ldlc vs nip and was glad to see familiar faces i knew from 16 like f0rest and get_right i got hooked up once again and now its for sure my favorite game yet again there are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes planting hitboxes jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes valve needs to add 128 tick servers for matchmaking games and we need way more stats and indepth graphs of our own performance on our profiles some weapon still needs some tweaking awp got nerfed too hard haflway from now and older awp would be perfect and some pistols are still a bit too op all and all tho even with these problems its still a great game  however if in the long run valve doesnt take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of csgo i can see the community getting  in the long run but theyre smart so hopefully it wont happen overall i give this game a 810  that could be a 910 if they fixed the hitboxesweapons and a 1010 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis cheaters are a huge problem of this game so i also hope that valve would seriously expand the vac team i stopped playing mm for this reason now mostly 10mans and faceit

graphics and game play are much better than the counterstrikes before it but like all other cs games playing online can be a bit hectic ive played online only a few times and realized that i dont possess the patience needed to play with others in the cs community there are some that are real great competitive players out there and others that are screaming kids that you have to mute but i assure you that im neither one those so i enjoy casual play offline with bots from time to time
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played
recommended
you dont know how epic is counter strike so sad i need no explaination for this one
recommended
this game is extremely fun especially with friends i like the competitive side of this game there is a lot of information to learn and if you really want to be great at this game it becomes addicting
recommended
hmm this game is still in beta to me this game is true to its past but thats not at all a good thing this game needs its mm servers updated to 128 tick as many people believe aswell they also need to work on their vac system less hackers would be nice but seeing on how they make money off them i dont see that being fix any time soon but all in all its an alright game with ok game play & the community is true to its past
recommended
best game ever but lot of hacker 
recommended
amazing gunplay hard for newcommers but once you learn how to successfully play and work as a team it makes csgo a memorable experience this is the third installment to the famous counterstrike franchise and does not fail it competitive mode is a mustplay for any serious player in competitive you are put against players with your same skill level and you must battle it out to see who is the best this game is phenomenal everything about it is great 9210 awesome game

this is probably the best shooter ever made csgo has anything that was in the previous versions of cs plus it adds awesome skins and item drops like crates if youre lucky enough you can get rare items dropped which you then can sell on the market that being said you not only have an awesome shooter with millions of maps plenty game mods and brilliant matchmaking in csgo you also have a cashcow go idling milk the cow if youre lucky youll get an awp skin or a knife model in that case you can quit your job and lay back
recommended
classic counterstrike for the modern age taking the feel and style of 16 with the graphical and technical improvements of source csgo makes a strong case to be the best counterstrike a well done matchmaking system makes it easy to find matches with stock rules this is furthered by the ability to choose between casual rules for when you want to practice and ranked competetitve mode with the original rules and should you still want the modded community servers its got that too the esports community is alive and well with events like dreamhack and multiple other major tournaments with massive prize pools drawing in the top teams from around the world counterstrikeglobal offensive also introduces a weapon skin drop system for customization and seasonal passes to support mapmakers all in all this is the best of source and the best of 16 mashed together into one shiny fluid and amazing game if you only are going to get one counterstrike this is the one to get
recommended
if youre not already playing it religiously you should csgo is the best damn game available on the pc right now i know its sad that nothing can compete with counterstrike for over 12 years now but thats the way it is you dont want to be some kind of a scrub whos bad at competitive online games right theyll call you a n00b and a scrub and make fun of you if you dont get good at this game so stop wasting your time playing casual garbage and pick up this game right now

this game is so fun to play if youve played css counter strike source then you will love csgo with the awesome graphics which make the game fun and the slight realism towards the game by contrast cs is totally egalitarian everyone has access to the same items and players arent ranked nobody cares if you play four hours a day seven days a week all that matters is how well you negotiate the next firefight you might take out half of the enemy team but then again a much less skilled player might blind you with a flashbang grenade and unload his topoftheline shotgun into your skull its not unusual to see a good player climb to the top of the scoreboard only to decline back into mediocrity in cs skill and alertness are your primary weaponsand when you get tired there are no unlockables to help you keep your edge

classic counterstrike for the modern age taking the feel and style of 16 with the graphical and technical improvements of source csgo makes a strong case to be the best counterstrike a well done matchmaking system makes it easy to find matches with stock rules this is furthered by the ability to choose between casual rules for when you want to practice and ranked competetitve mode with the original rules and should you still want the modded community servers its got that too the esports community is alive and well with events like dreamhack and multiple other major tournaments with massive prize pools drawing in the top teams from around the world counterstrikeglobal offensive also introduces a weapon skin drop system for customization and seasonal passes to support mapmakers all in all this is the best of source and the best of 16 mashed together into one shiny fluid and amazing game if you only are going to get one counterstrike this is the one to get
recommended
graphics and game play are much better than the counterstrikes before it but like all other cs games playing online can be a bit hectic ive played online only a few times and realized that i dont possess the patience needed to play with others in the cs community there are some that are real great competitive players out there and others that are screaming kids that you have to mute but i assure you that im neither one those so i enjoy casual play offline with bots from time to time
recommended
so after playing counter strike for about 1 year now and putting over 1000 hours into it i thought i would make a little review throughout the time ive played ive seen many goodbad changes made to the game i still think some of the changes are a little stupid but ive come to get used to it although there are a lot of cheaters i still manage to have fun whenever i encounter a cheater i just laugh and mess around with them because its funny to think people would waste 15$ on rebuying the game for multiple accounts to cheat on i was recently reading a reddit post by a proffesional csgo player by the name of dazed in where he mentions a way that can reduce cheaters by a mass amount of numbers he basically stated that csgo should add a system so that the first 50 queues are unranked so the cheaters would basically be going against other cheaters he also said that after you finish the first 50 queues you can start playing for ranks and start playing on 128 tic servers i agree with all of what he said this was originally going to be a small review and it turned into a little over a paragraph if you actually read all of this and have any opinions leave a comment letting me know and ill try to get back to you

every friday after i recieve my paycheck i deposit it saturday mornings i wake up not remebering the previous night with a headache and a sore  i roll out of my bed on to the floor and pick myself up just enough to click play on csgo i spend the time that it takes me to load csgo no ssd master race here getting up from my starting position to sit in my chair very hard to do with a wrecked bottom naturally at this time i start to remeber certain details about the previous night i check my phone a text from my bank ive overdrawn my foggy bits and pieces start to clear and gradually turn to horror as i see a little yellow box with a 10 in it under the word inventory and a message telling me i have new items i click inventory as i am suddenly overcome with the dawning realization of my previous nights activities as my shiny new stat trak skins bounce into view on my screen so much red i lose control of my bowels and also vomit all over my keyboard and screen then pass out if you buy this game it would be smart to also buy some lube in bulk dont play csgo if you dont want your anal region violated again and again game mechanics  crap teamwork crap community of friendly people for beginners crap but u can buy skins for your gunz to make them look pretty so you spend your entire time distracted by the colors while you get shot at and lose the game for your team valve is a cruel cruel mistress i cant ing wait for saturday morning 1010 will buy lube again

it started back in the 8th grade when i was put in ell i was surrounded by  and no matter how much i begged the principal to let me out of there he kept telling me i was also  and there was no way i would suceed in life i spent days in the ell classroom learning with people i hated and puzzles i couldnt solve coloring inside the lines was not only unacheiveable but i had to watch the coolest kid in ell eli chubin do every day it wasnt fair i wasnt like the rest of these kids i could do 20 pull ups if the principal wouldnt advance me to regular classes i would have to it myself using the problem solving skills that landed me in ell i devised the plan to kill every other person in the class because then i have to be moved up i mean they couldnt have a class just for 1 person right i searched online to find out how other people did mass murders and it seemed like the most efficient way was with shooting the place up so i decided that was what i would do i didnt know where to start though so i searched online once again to find out how all these murderers started i quickly learned that it was violent video games was the thing that all these murderers had in common so i decided that must be the thing that makes killers i then bought counter strike as i heard you could learn how to be a terrorist and played it every day after school after a week of playing i felt the evil inside of me and i was ready to shoot up the school using what i had learned from counter strike and the guns i borrowed from my father i went into ell that day and killed every kid in my class as a result of that i got moved up into regular classes just like i hoped would happen without counter strike i would still be in ell to this day

i am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of this game 110 score years ago a great american in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the valve game submission contract this momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of terrorist slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity but two years later the terrorist is still is not free two years later the life of the terrorist is still sadly crippled by the manacles of the m4a1s and the chains of counterterrorists two years later the terrorist lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity two years later the terrorist is still languished in the corners of counterterrorist society and finds himself an exile in his own land and so weve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition in a sense weve come to our nations capital to cash a check when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the tradeup contract they were signing a promissory note to which every player was to fall heir this note was a promise that all men yes terrorist men as well as counterterrorist men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of deagle awp and the pursuit of bomb sites it is obvious today that counter strike has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her players of terrorism are concerned instead of honoring this sacred obligation counter strike has given the terrorist people a bad check a check which has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this game and so weve come to cash this check a check that will give us upon demand the riches of deagle and the security of awp 1010 would let freedom ring again

in this game you can point and click to kill people and win a free iphone it also features many great maps including dust ii and dust ii this game can be very difficult for new players as it features people who are really good they can get running head shots with an ak47 from ct to b double doors on the best map dust ii it also features a skin system similar to tf 2s item system but skins arent really usefull they just look nice and allow you to show off how much money you can throw at people no iphones can actually be won from playing this game major rage and saddness may occur please seek a medical proffesional before deciding to use this product

csgo is my favorite game on steam so far as far as competitive gaming goes look no further than counterstrike or dota counterstrike is a game where the outcome is based on each players skill reaction time and teamwork communication with your fellow soldiers is crucial to win calling strategies reporting enemy whereabouts and working closely with teammates makes this game more immersive than most pc shooters make sure you follow your teams economy to decide what gear to buy at the right times learn common locations on all the maps so you can keep your team aware of all happenings around them it also helps that the games mechanics are about as fluid as it gets have fun

there are so many things to say about this game but so little time as im struggling to find words with mixed feelings about this game it is hard to give it a review let me just make a procon list pros team based playing seriously this isnt ing call of duty guns arent easy to use why is this a pro so kids on call of duty dont play variety of weapons there is a gun for everyone  the rank system is very well done and its hard to level up this is good because ur skill level means alot more then omg i just reached 4th prestige by getting 360 tomahawk kills there is competetive for the serious ones and casual like me for the ones who arent serious its ing valve they are going to suck you into this game faster then ur mom sucked me off last night cons ing p90s ing autos ing novas ing random headshots ing smurfs ing hackers ing guys with twitchtv9324ui0tj0239jg023 in their name ing ok guys knives only server do it or be kicked ing guys who are afk in casual when one team has 7 wins and u cannot kick him ing hackersboosters with their friend and u try to kick the hackerbooster but it needs to be a unaminous vote and the booster obviously says no ing dust2 ing dust11 ing unaminous vote on dust11 7 games in a row ing valve not letting us use fpsbanana to get skins but rather skillfully persuade us to buy their skins for high prices so we can give it names like  u  when your playing on a casual server and you think no one has a mic until a girl talks then out of a sudden everyone is talking about how strong their biceps are ing kids who think they are the best ing dj in the world who play songs that no one likes with their   turtlebeach microphones ing kids who lead their team in casual like they are commanding the 97th battalion into france on dday ing kids who ask for free skins on casual but you see that they have an inventory with about 20$ and they refuse to sell any of those to get a 20 cent skin ign valve for making us pay for missions and we always say oh were not going to buy that stupid  but we find ourselves buying it anyway ing volvo making me put up my morgage on the community market because i need to get that karambit fade factory new statrak souvenir ing volvo for sucking me into this game for 700 hours and 699 of those hours playing dust2 in retrospect i believe that with all that has been said if you see urself playing this like an hour a day and then quitting if u can do that please teach me ur ways buy this game however if u are easily sucked into games and are already thinking of buying some skins even before getting the game do not ing buy it holy  when u see how pathetic u are with the amount of money u spent on virtual items and u are ashamed by how many hours you played in the last two weeks that u have to make your profile private then u will realize what im talking about gg hf

a full upgrade over its predecessor counterstrike source global offensive manages to revive its playerbase that was lost from the previous game and as always introduces new players to the franchise if i were to briefly describe it id say its a modern day classic there are 4 modes the main 2 are casual and competitive while the other 2 are arms race gun game and demolition like gun game but a kill awards only 1 weapon to be used in the next round there is also a deathmatch mode basicaly tdm with quick respawns that is usually used for practising different weapons with the arms deal update which introduced camos and some weapons to the game there are drops at the end of matches and it slightly feels like tf2 but not to that extent the matchmaking system is kind of meh although it is much better than some other games ive played in competitive there is a 5050 chance for you to join a balanced game without your team being on a losing streak that is if you go soloits quite a gamble there are also some minor hitreg issues that are barely noticable but still important enough to determine the outcome of the round and thats freaking annoying 64 tick if you intend to take this game seriously you can join a competitive team 5 people and spend time practising recoils patterns and the like who knows you might end up entering a tournament as far as game content is concerned new guns and camos are constantly being added to the game plus valve introduces operations last one was operation vanguard that include a handful of new maps from the workshop after about 45 months the operation ends and the most popular maps have a chance to get the main game while some others pass on to the next operation the thing is that this counts as dlc and will set you back 6$ if you are willing buy it from the start the price drops over time so i suggest entering when it is about a dollar or so overall with the price of 11 15$ its much more than you pay for and with more than 800 hours currently in the game i can safely say im very satisfied great game 9510

counterstrike global offensive is probably the most balanced fps game in all existence i personally started playing counter strike when source had been out for 23 years or so ive always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat and the fact that the game is all skill there are no unlockables the only things you can earn by playing are stats and skins a pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer thats new to the series other than his skill great engine great servers balanced gameplay smooth gameplay excellently constructed maps stays true to the franchise cheap no unlockables except skins ingame purchases with real money 16032014

since i havent seen really any serious or informative reviews for this game i decided to write a review on my impressions or competitive play and the community 50 hours in as well as go over the basics of the game counter trike global offensive is a competitve multiplayer fps and the newest installment in the counter strike series the game was made to be played competitively which can be enjoyable with a good group of guys the competitive game mode consists of a best of 30 rounds half of them being played as counterterrorists the others as terrorists the goal as terrorists is to plant the bomb or kill all of the counterterrorists when the goal of counterterrorists is to kill all of the terrorists or defuse the bomb if it was planted this game is in no way a twitch shooter as in he who shoots first wins and requires marksmanship and strategy unlike some other popular fps games competitive mode reqiers a full five man team to win not literally but if someone on your team is a bad sport not listening or is a bot youre almost guaranteed to lose if you want a serious game almost every time i recommend playing with atleast 1 or 2 friends of the same skill level playing with serious players is a lot of fun and for the most part people are good sports in the game instead of yelling wow you didnt clutch fk you man you will usually hear good try man well get this next round but sometimes you will hear the first quote ive made some good friends playing counter strike and it was worth it this game takes alot of practice skill and strategy but once you get it down it can give you literally 1000s of hours playing

this game does a lot a lot of good things  and a lot bad things the good things  you will learn in a short amount of time  with no real effort this language of epic proportions called russian  if you are lucky you get to enjoy the game as you escape everytime with 1 hp you lucky   dont spend a single cent and you get to be a millionaire  random noob who just purchased the game gets a key as a birthday present opens the case and receives a knife stattrak that is not even on market good job random noob  you will laugh at the inexplicable trails of shots  you will cry a lot the bad things  the amount of hackers in this game is astounding more hackers appear every day than valve manages to ban every year  if youre not lucky you get to stay dead because your enemy escaped with 1 hp happens every round you know unless you get an awp and do 6 damage in 1 hit with it how is that even posibrr  getting kicked for not grasping the russian language and not rushing as a ct on defuse maps  getting kicked for trying to 1v5 and not rushing as t on hostage maps like your fellow russians did  ruins friendships had to delete all my csgo friends thanks valve should of made halflife 3 instead  you will get tainted by those guys whom you learnt russian from            spend money and enjoy being bankrupt  a guy who wasted more time playing this game than spending it with his girlfriend sells his waifu with big boobs to buy a million keys for a chance at a  texture on a virtual item no knife drop gj now go buy a real one which is cheaper you know and kill yourself random noob wins  you will cry at the inexplicable trails of shots  you will cry a lot long story short you will cry a lot

if you want to understand why the human race will not survive long term then look no further than this game to say the community is toxic is a bit like saying escobar did ok in the drug business you will come across cheats racists cheats kids cheats and cheats before long the hate will rise inside you work and family will seem less important than ranking up you will discover that somehow you can curse fluently in russian if anybody plays better than you they must be reported for cheating and you live only for your next knife kill after which you scream rekt new players should not be afraid of losing their first few games you will find the skill tree a little messed up high ranking players often have alternate accounts so they can dominate lower ranks for fun if you are a silver or nova then congratulations you are almost certainly playing more global elites than actual global elites if you ever make it out of that hellhole things will get easier trust me good luck and may god have mercy on you noob 1010 cka blyat

its the followup to the groundbreaking fps series counterstrike and its brilliant counterstrike global offensive retains the same classic feeling of counterstrike and does it while strutting its stuff i can remember playing counterstrike 16 when i was but a small child and i still have fond memories of it the graphics feel appropriate and i love the art style the fandom for this game still grows strong today and i cant imagine the funds that its raised for valve & its employees good job guys hopefully there may be more to come in the series

counterstrike global offensive is probably the most balanced fps game in all existence i personally started playing counter strike when source had been out for 23 years or so ive always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat and the fact that the game is all skill there are no unlockables the only things you can earn by playing are stats and skins a pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer thats new to the series other than his skill great engine great servers balanced gameplay smooth gameplay excellently constructed maps stays true to the franchise cheap no unlockables except skins ingame purchases with real money 16032014

its like skyrim with guns  ign the game really does offer the decisive rpg role that very little firstperson games offer unfortunately it incorporates a lot of mechanics from the popular mmorpg world of warcraft and can at times feel like a complete clone if you havent played wow you will enjoy it but if you have you will feel some obvious and uncomfortable similarities the games singleplayer is really expansive and really allows the player to explore the mystical world known as pandora and offers you to play as 1 of 4at one given time playable characters all with unique personalities and trates brick  a slow tanky character who at times can seem very stupid but as the game progresses his soft side opens up and you can see him as a caring personality roland  a militarytype honorable character who at times can seem like a pervert who spies on young children you can often find him stealing other characters televisions and smoking blunts mordecai  the only homosexual member of the group can be found in massive orgies his fetish is bleeding anuses lilith  a complete autistic psychopath who can be found having sex with skags and fondling herself the characters enrole in the us military where they will fight their way throughout a chinese insurgency the campaign really demonstrates the power of the games frostbite 3 engine and really drops the players jaw at any given moment the multiplayer can be described as call of duty with swords and offers 4 playable classes knight vanguard man at arms and archer all of which are equally effective in the art of combat the mutliplayer takes place in 14th century europe where being heterosexual was a crime and gay orgies were publicwhich later resulted in the spread of the black plague so dont let your kids play because they might immitate the gay orgies that the npcs participate in the community is made up of 12 year olds using their mothers laptops 1510 its ok in all actuality this game isnt as great as everyone says it is honestly it has less depth than cod and an even worse community yes a community of people with superiority complexes because they play a fps thats not cod think battlefield community except with people who think theyre super pro leet as far as gameplay goes its solid and the maps are probably the best part of this game other than that dull repetitive and has a  matchmaking system 610

this game has the best chicken ai of gaming history 1010 would knife those chickens again csgo is a nearperfect multiplayer shooter unlike the previous versions which were often difficult to get in to this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels it has a large community and a well supported workshop ensuring that this discountpriced game will be around for years to come in short you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster its been around for years and has spawned many imitators the game isnt much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original half life 2 was however valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis is it worth getting if you already own counter strike source yes css was always counter strike shoehorned into the source engine csgo feels far more like a standalone game valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game the best feature must be the competitive play where you play 10 games that you cannot leave unless you want to tarnish your reputation after which youll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill meaning that the game is challenging but fair no matter what skill level you are there are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join really if i was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice its bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come something that cant be said for the call of duty franchise which is probably its closest rival remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year fragmenting the community plus you can customise your weapon skins in csgo surely thats the most important feature all they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in csgo this game has the best chicken ai of gaming history 1010 would knife those chickens again

a full upgrade over its predecessor counterstrike source global offensive manages to revive its playerbase that was lost from the previous game and as always introduces new players to the franchise if i were to briefly describe it id say its a modern day classic there are 4 modes the main 2 are casual and competitive while the other 2 are arms race gun game and demolition like gun game but a kill awards only 1 weapon to be used in the next round there is also a deathmatch mode basicaly tdm with quick respawns that is usually used for practising different weapons with the arms deal update which introduced camos and some weapons to the game there are drops at the end of matches and it slightly feels like tf2 but not to that extent the matchmaking system is kind of meh although it is much better than some other games ive played in competitive there is a 5050 chance for you to join a balanced game without your team being on a losing streak that is if you go soloits quite a gamble there are also some minor hitreg issues that are barely noticable but still important enough to determine the outcome of the round and thats freaking annoying 64 tick if you intend to take this game seriously you can join a competitive team 5 people and spend time practising recoils patterns and the like who knows you might end up entering a tournament as far as game content is concerned new guns and camos are constantly being added to the game plus valve introduces operations last one was operation vanguard that include a handful of new maps from the workshop after about 45 months the operation ends and the most popular maps have a chance to get the main game while some others pass on to the next operation the thing is that this counts as dlc and will set you back 6$ if you are willing buy it from the start the price drops over time so i suggest entering when it is about a dollar or so overall with the price of 11 15$ its much more than you pay for and with more than 800 hours currently in the game i can safely say im very satisfied great game 9510

after being around cs since the olden days back when we had wonids and suchthis is a drastic change in a good way i still kept playing 16 for awhile even after css was released my pc couldnt handle it but i was more than satisfied with what 16 had to offer once i upgraded my pc and was able to jump into css it was nto what iexpected it did not go over well with the way i had gotten used to cs 16 i stopped playing css and went back to 16 i got into the beta of cs go once it was announced tried out ok ok seems to work like 16 but with css visualthis is nice the game actually plays very well it does have some drastic changes from what we <16 vets remember i think wayne campbell said it best in many ways its superior but will never be as recognized as the original its a great step up from the original take the first step i know its frightening but trust me youll like it

counterstrike global offensive abbreviated as csgo is an online tactical firstperson shooter developed by valve corporation and hidden path entertainment who also maintained counterstrike source after its release it is the fourth game in the main counterstrike franchise counter strike global offensive was released on august 21 2012 and made available for microsoft windows and os x on steam xbox live arcade and a usonly version on playstation networkthe linux version was released in september 2014it features classic content such as revamped versions of classic maps as well as brand new maps characters and game modes crossplatform multiplayer was planned between windows os x and psn players but was ultimately limited to windows and os x because of the differences in updatefrequency between systemsthe psn version offers three input control methods which include using either the dualshock 3 controller playstation move or usb keyboardmouse like the previous games in the series global offensive is an objectivebased multiplayer firstperson shooter each player joins either the terrorist or counterterrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team the game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a teams objective is completed for most game modes once a player dies they must wait until the round ends to respawn players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions like killing a teammate or hostage takes money away from the player in addition when a round ends all players receive some amount of money with players on the winning team receiving substantially more counter strike global offensive adds new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments most notably the firebomb for each side molotovs for terrorists and incendiary grenades for counterterrorists these temporarily cover a small area in fire dealing damage to anyone passing through currently global offensive features five game modes for online play counterstrike s most wellknown game mode both involving bomb scenario and hostage scenario missionsat the start of each round players can purchase weapons and gear with money earned from various actions from assisting on kills to completing objectives regardless of mission type a round ends when one team completes an objective eliminates the other team or lets the timer run out bomb scenario the terrorists must plant a c4 explosive at one of two designated bombsites the counterterrorists must prevent the bomb from exploding either ensuring that the terrorist team does not plant it or defusing it once it is activated hostage scenario the counterterrorists must rescue hostages from the terrorists and bring them to an extraction point the terrorists must prevent the hostages from escaping if a terrorist or counterterrorist attempts to kill hostage they will suffer a heavy cash penalty an update later changed how counterterrorists rescue hostages instead of leading them around players must carry one hostage at a time to the extraction point arms race a deathmatchbased mode where each player is rewarded for each kill with a new weapon with the first player to get a kill with every weapon in a predetermined set winning the game demolition a roundbased mode that removes weapon and equipment purchasing instead rewarding players who manage at least one kill by giving the next weapon in a predetermined set of weapons after a second kill with that weapon the players are also rewarded a grenade of a random type along with their new weapon for the next round deathmatch added on november 12 2012 a mode consisting of 10minute matchesplayers must gain the highest possible score by earning kills with different weapons or desired weapons the number of points from a kill depend on the weapon players may also take advantage of bonus timers for different weapons using them to score extra points like in arms race players automatically respawn after getting killed but also when they choose to respawn with bonus weapons global offensive also offers two offline modes offline with bots which offers the same game modes with aicontrolled bots and a weapons course for inexperienced and veteran players alike global offensive supports matchmaking and leaderboards for all online game modes provided by steamthe provided online service offers the ability to filter by game modes maps and a builtin steam friend system valve also employs valve anticheat which can automatically remove and ban players from the valve online network to match players of similar skill levels for an enjoyable experience the game uses a heavily modified version of elo rating systemthe pc version of global offensive also supports private dedicated servers that the player may connect to through the community server menu ingame these servers may be heavily modified and can be completely different from the base game global offensive began as a port of counterstrike source to xbox live arcade by hidden path entertainment during the development valve saw the opportunity to turn the port into a full game and expand on counterstrike s gameplay global offensive began development in march 2010 and was revealed to the public on august 12 2011 the closed beta started on november 30 2011 and was initially restricted to around ten thousand people who received a key at events valve attended to showcase global offensive after issues such as client and server stability were addressed the beta was opened up to progressively more and more people approximately 100000 beta keys were given out as of july 4 2012 until the beta became open for anybody to join and playbefore the public beta valve invited professional counterstrike and counterstrike source players to playtest the game and give feedback at e3 2012 valve announced that global offensive would be released august 21 2012 on all platforms with an open beta starting roughly a month before thatit was never released on the playstation network in europe the game originally launched with four game modes classic casual and competitive demolition and arms race at first csgo started with six of the classic defuse mission maps aztec dust dust ii inferno nuke and train the map vertigo was added in a later updateas well as mirage overpass cobblestone and more later the demolition maps included bank lake safehouse shorttrain st marc sugarcane hostage missions started with two mapsitaly and officeand later added assault and militia a few important changes to the original hostage gameplay mechanics include randomized hostage spawn points the requirement of having to carry a hostage instead of having them follow the player and a rescue kit to shorten pickup time lastly there are now three more modes arsenal arms race arsenal demolition which combines defuse and arms race and deathmatch overall rating 1010

why you need to buy this game please read and rate 1 csgo is alot more simple than other fps such as call of duty or battlefield csgo is very basic and easy to learn all the steps on becoming a very advanced player other games like call of duty offer things like attachments killstreaks prestiges levels and advanced player options which can be good for some players but it takes quite a while to get use to all the controls and how everything works but in counter strike you get the game and start playing right away not having to learn all the controls 2 you can make money counter strike and other games by valve such as tf2 and dota 2 offer an in game market place in the market you can buy and sell tools guns stickers crates keys and many more things the market allows you to convert in game items into real money which will be put onto your steam wallet as soon as some one purchases your item now games like call of duty dont allow you to make money all you can do is play the game 3 the game offers free downloadable content csgo gives everyplayer the latest updatedlc for free games like battlefield call of duty and borderlands 2 make you buy the game which is very expensive and on top of that the dlc charges you about 15 dollars and up 4 the game is cheap counter strike is only $1499 on steam and it goes on sale very frequently most fps games cost anywhere from 3060 dollars such as the new call of duty games which all cost $60 on release so obviously you will be saving alot of money 5 the game is over all very fun now i cant argue this point because call of duty and other fps games are also very great games but csgo is worth the money so i suggest you go ahead and start playing you will love it

what amazes me about this game is the special ambience the player lives while playing the game consciously its not just a random fps game thats about shooting the adversaries randomly as it requires subliminal reactions and reflexes the simplicity of the game makes the gamer focus more on the precision of his shots and actions than on the graphics although the graphics are acceptable and on the rest of the petty details blatantly the game was thoughtfully developed by the brave developers who are still working on the game till nowadays and are still considering the complaints of players and working on improving the gameplay to satisfy everybody in the other hand there are many hackers that are still there ruining everybodys gameplay i cant deny that valve is doing its best trying to get rid of these ashamed creatures but however theyre still getting away with it this game is a great successful accomplishment to the developers of valve despite of the cheaters whore trying to ruin this success and are definitely failing to do so proto tips the hat overall fascinating game edit yes the cheaters and the annoyinguneducated kids are everywhere ruining the gameplay but however its no reason not to buy this game so yeah fck that

amazing and unique there are so many other words to describe this fps but they wont fit in this page buy it now

cs go is a game that caters to people that love skill based fps games it is a very competitive game though that should not deter people new to counter strike there are plenty of casual modes like deathmatch demoliton arms race and a casual competitive if your in the market for a new fps game to enjoy definately consider picking this game up

it may lack some of the community niceties beloved maps assault anyone and little features of past games but global offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful polished and better looking counterstrike for whoever wants it even if the community doesnt meet the golden standard of 16 and source csgo will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons

best competitive fps out there right now in my opinion most publishers have forsaken the serious gamer and those oriented towards professional gaming counter strike global offensive on the other hand is geared to just those people no modern fps today relies so heavily on teamwork communication and cooperation

after over one thousand hours spent this is my review of counter strike global offensive first of is gameplay i think the gameplay of csgo is so close to perfect that it becomes beyond addicting its almost always a challange in almost anything from competitive matchmakings to jailbreak servers from arms race to surfing there is endless creativity out in the community and it keeps getting better with the support of the developers is it different from counter strike source to be completely honest yes its not counter strike 2 but its something in between and this is not a bad thing in fact its great it still has some remaining feel of css but with new looks maps gamemodes skins and ui the list keeps going why should i listen to you this is my opinion not yours all this is just a little push in the right direction for a new player who does not know counter strike the final score ill give this game 910 for the reason of amazing communities massive esport events developer support design performance and in general its one of those fpss you need to really grind to get really skilled at and when you have developed that skill you will have a new challange waiting around the corner fridge [csgo competitive player]

have you ever felt excited and frustrated at the same time or laughed and then felt like punching the closest wall to you well if not this is the game for you counter strike global offensive has a continuously growing player base and incredible content that updates monthly it is similar to the other cs games so i wont dive into all that but in short its a must if you like a well balanced competitive shooter

the ranking system is complete trash but the game is still fun

basically its counterstrike if you dont know what counterstrike is and know battlefield you are safe but if you only know call of duty you are not safe ok lets get into my personal review about this game basically its still counterstrike with added features that makes the game more fun to play with they added skins which you can make money off it or to show to your friends the one thing i like about csgo is their matchmaking systemit groups you into your respective skill group to play against the same ranked people you are in beware of smurfers tho there are alot lately but i find it fun battling smurfers since i can have a little view or insight about how high rankers play ok about the skins its not call of duty but its optional but hey you can make money off it since you can get case drops skin drops etc for the game itself its still counterstrike thats all i can say basically its still cs with added features and such to make the game more enjoyable than the previous ones if you get hooked up with the skins you will last a few hundreds of hours yes hundreds of hours since i already done this on my first account and i really enjoy doing what i like to do with skins there may be hackers and such in matchmaking or any other gamemode but all i do is just basically report them and just ignore them throughout the match even if its 100% lose for us anyways for me this is the best version of counterstrike i ever played since 16 which is i played it on another computer p pick this up for 15 bucks or 419 philippine pesos or whatever price your currency puts it to since its an awesome enjoyable competitive game and it lasts ages heck 16 even has a few hundreds  thousands of players playing it and about this around more than that pick it up its a nice first person shooter and i will recommend this to any kind of person either casual players or competitive players i would rate it around 9  9510

its a decent game a basic shooter with basic mechanics even though the technology and graphical details of this game are horseshit for the generation its released in the freedom to create neverending unique and creative custom content is what makes this and all other valve games the best community experience youll ever have in games even though valve promised lots of features some of these were planned and even revealed yet not added to the final revision in comparision to the previous almostadecadeold release under the bland name of counterstrike source this game does have loads of improvements which were mandatory in the past counterstrike global offensive kicks counterstrike source down in a bottomless pit of shame your experience will differ from server to server avoid national servers at all costs and stick with playing on the same server you enjoyed playing on in the past every game community has its down sides and this one definately has a problem with accepting new players expect to be heavily insulted and to get kickedbanned from servers for not being a skilled player

dear guy who just quit league of legend dota ok i get it you hated being stuck in your elo because your teammates constantly trolled you or threw your promo games and you wanted something new to play with a better community im sorry to be the one to inform you all those same trolls play this game as well and as an added gaben in your face this game has hackers out the  all that aside counter strike has been one of the greatest fps consistently throughout our lifetimes and we cant blame them for humanity we can call them greedy as the skin system in this game was left to the peoples to decide and some conspiracy theories later we end up with digital skins that are worth more than some peoples cars and you know gaben is taking that 10% of all market transactions but if you can avoid the hackers and mute the trolls it is possible to solo carry yourself out of silver this games version of bronze and make it to nova where you should find simi skilled players that can communicate with you to a moderate degree about dust ii befriend these noble gentleman as they are crucial to making it out of nova after that its all hackers ge smurfs semi pros and streamers i suggest looking into alternative matchmaking prospects to hon your skills such as esea cevo or faceit good luck my friend i hope to see you on the sands of dust soon may gaben be with you always jove_gaming

you will hate this game and never want to play it for the following reasons competitive matches usually place you in games with higher ranked players disguised as lower ranks sadly theyll be on the opposite team the amount of hackers and absence of valve doing anything about this will annoy you on a spiritual level the matchups for competitive are absolute poop youll usually be placed against a team who are higher ranked you will be put with bad players who never know what theyre doing and even with a & b spray painted everywhere to show where the sites are theyll all be blind to these and go to the opposite site to where bomb is planted you will lose all of your hair mainly because youre pulling it out with anger you will be screamed at constantly by your teammates usually children even though youre at the top of the leaderboard with best kdr most mvps and best score you will be screeched at enjoy not to mention if you do end up playing well youll be screamed at by the other team for being a hacker even though theyre usually the worst player on their team oh and then you think cool ive won a case after losing 160 in a competitive match against smurfs and hackers but then valve screws you over again by giving you a damn awful ump skin which youve uncased 12 times in the past week would i recommend this game yes do i want to kill all of my teammates and myself yes do i still play this game yes so if you have anger problems and need somewhere to go to take out your frustration please buy this game and join competitive since we need more screeching children to really make this game complete

this may seem like an old outdated fps in comparasion to the cod and battlefield series but dont be fooled the element of competitive fun and rapid button tapping is alive and kickin gameplay is fast and unrealistic at times but always fun in addition to the standard modes and maps the cs community really shines with its custom gameplay modes eg zombie mode death runs and custom maps buy it you wont be disappointed

loving the ban times on competitive anyway this game is amazingly amazing if you arent up against hackers russians communists andor smurfs as that completely kills the fun in the ranking system and csgo itself this game also features a few gamemodes and many of the old maps from cs css i recommend you open up your wallet or purse  leave a few quid on gabes counter and swipe this from the store if you have a good rig or else itll just be plain laggy and framy and youll have no one to blame but yourself for refusing to get off your butt and upgrading your pc 3 and last but not least if you are really feeling it feel like raging and having fun with friends or no friends you loner  then this is for you >d

whether it be the graphics guns or the strategy csgo drags the player in to play more and more i would buy this game even if it was $30 yes it is that good csgo has one of the best selections of game modes and game maps so you are never bored even better you can play the same map over and over and still like it csgo also has a wide selection of weapons to choose from and the weapon buying system is ingenious the recent addition of weapon skins adds just that kick you need when playing all you want to do is just unbox one more crate for that chance to get a knife worth over $400 long story short get this game stay classy gamers jamesthegreat3

counter strike might be ur old fashioned fps game from ur childhood but this game has evolved and grow and we too have grow beside it it was once a worldwie famous tactical fps game and i can easily say that fact has never changed cs gos ranking system and its competitive mode has been a wonderful experience to play with ur friends for skills alone wont help u win the game but tactics and teamwork is the golden apple that is needed to win the match
recommended
great game 9 out of 10 csgo is a hard game and takes a lot of time to learn everyone is equal with the same guns and you cant unlock new guns like in cod call of duty or so i have heard once you learn how to play properly like control ur recoil with every gun and things like that you might find it hard to stop playing the game and not get addicted d i think its a great game because it has great maps and dust ii is my favourite by far however the maps arent exactly balanced i would say the game is quite funny at times and there is proof in some of my screenshots d the only reason why i dont give it 1010 is because its not exactly balanced with the maps the maps have like different camp areas for each team and some areas are better and things like that bomb spots hiding spots etc but apart from that this game has made me play 1500 hours already and i think ive only been playing for a year you could call me an addict but once youve played this game you wont blame me

this version of counterstrike aims to unify the counterstrike 16 and counterstrike source fans into a new iteration of the classic first person shooter the casual mode is while fun most of the time a bit lacking in meaning to any halfway serious gamer the competitive classic ranked matchmaking mode is extremely competitive with most players simply looking to rank up at any cost or simply not rank down at worst hackers and smurfers run fairly rampant in competitive and can be a large deterrent to serous legit players the game is updated fairly often with new operation map packs available perhaps twice a year carrying with them the added excitement of new skins for weapons in the game overall the game is a blast whether you just enjoy fpss to shoot things or create an elite team capable of conquering the world

i definitely reccommend this game it is by far one of the most fun fpss i have come upon gameplay is very simple there are different types of gamemodes with different objectives additionally the variety of maps also makes the game more unique simply because of the different secret and strategical locations there are you wont be meeting any cod fanboys in this game because it is simply class however a recent change made a few guns have scopes similar to cod gun scopes guns and all equipment is very well balanced allowing for a fair environment counterstrike global offensive simply brings a sense of real fps no healing no medics just guns and people trying to shoot other people

this is an excellent first person shooter that takes time to get used to its not your average call of duty or battlefield you dont frag people for some random scope for your rifle or a suppressor instead you are trying to master out the legendary weapons that have been in all cs titles the ak47 the m4 and the awp these are the quite important ones and the way to go

recommended
imo its starting to become better than tf2 less spam less f2ps lol noobs and campers get ruled out more easily it isnt all about who can unload your magazine the fastest nor spamming with melee the trading is much more simpler more far and more desiredand isnt controlled as much by people who just want to make their bp worth more so it compensates for their lack of a girlfriend or for their small  the physics are less whacky due to recoil and require much more precision than tf2 even tho there are only like 30 maps its still fun 1110 flutterdoges would reccomend as well

such a good game must buy 1010 buy buy buy give money to steamvalve buy buy buy

this is a remarkable next step in the counterstrike franchise that has been volatile for over a decade with wellrounded gameplay near perfect balancing of the weapons fun innovative maps and great graphics that compliment the gameplay we have a beautiful and challenging first person shooter here but what separates this from other big franchises like call of duty and battlefield well the almost infinite skill ceiling allows this game to stand out from the rest while you can still dive into casual games run around and score a couple of kills those who spend hours and hours practicing in competitive mode will have fine tuned their skills to only aiming for headshots and other skilled tactics counterstrike global offensive provides a simple but deep first person shooter experience that provides customization refreshing content and a whole lot to learn for an extremely fair price compared to fps counterparts

global offensive is definitely a counterstrike sequel  it looks and feels familiar  with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players  this is a demanding  skillbased multiplayer game thats as satisfying now as it ever was  but its for a specific kind of player  if youre not willing to learn to play different than youre used to  look elsewhere  otherwise  this is a toptier tactics game that will probably share the longtailed legacy of its predecessors

this game is probably the best game ive purchased on steam i mainly play this game competetively so if you dont like games that get harder and require practice to eventually be really good at i wouldnt think that youd love this game but i am not saying that this is a bad game by any means i have tons of friends that never play competetive but still love the game this game is also fun to play with friends on community servers to play common things like surf mini games or jailbreak even if you dont like the competetive aspect of the game you should still buy it and try it out considering that its only 15 dollars another thing that makes this game great is the economy ive probably made about $25 dollars off the game so far but also given back about $30 dollars from gun camos dlc and cases etc if you have an extra $15 to spend i tottaly recommend this game but you never know you might just end up with about 500 hours in the game like me

player base is horrid controlls graphics and gameplay are old tired and rehashed match making is flawed and the game is riddled with bugs that will get you banned temporarily out of your controll its okay 1010  ign

buy game for 15 buy useless skins for bragging rights  $300 be prepared to waste money
recommended
yes i aprove shooting
recommended
i am one that generally does not enjoy the fps style of games there is just something about counter strike global offensive that makes me not able to put it down you feel like becoming a better person is the goal of the game each time you get a clutch victory or even die in a bad 1v1 this is a skill based shooter the game is not about getting a new scope for your weapon improvement of yourself as a person and understanding how things work i cannot recommend this game enough to anyone i talk to if you want to become a better person and learn about discipline selfrespect and teamwork you need to try this game

its kind of hard to actually recommend this game since its so similar to counterstrike source it really looks like an updated version of source with high definition graphics and some extras of the new things included are offline with bots which is a nice touch and can be used to farm achievements the bots ai are very nice and the difficulty scales well easy will be easy hard will be hard everything regarding multiplayer is almost completely the same with workshop support nothing is really added at all in that area though it has the feeling like call of duty where people buy the product because they know multiplayer will be fun there is also an added menu for choosing which game style you want deathmatch planting the bomb arms race competitive etc gameplay mechanics are very similar to source literally they are the same same old ladder climbing same old running and walking same everything its basically an hd remake of counterstrike source on the source engine one other bonus is the twitchtv support i assume it has to do with tournament streaming etc because competitive mode is a rather large thing if youve never played a counterstrike game i definitely recommend it if you have buying is borderline would you buy call of duty black ops 2 if you heard it was similar to call of duty black ops you get many people who upgrade for the hell of it and the others who decide to stick to the older game as they feel like the sequel is a waste of money csgo is definitely the case of that of course keep in mind that this is a much newer game and has updated steam connectivity very very easy to connect to your friends or join a random game for a quick round playing with a microphone is highly advised not to be played with a controller valve does not rub out players for money for dlcs or anything that makes this game paytowin anything received in game could even be sold for a profit reallife that is obligatory score 910
recommended
very great game and can be handled by even an underbudget pc on high settings fun for all and the best part about the game is competitive play you have ranks which improve as you improve so you get ranked with the people from your skill level and as your skill level improves you improve your rank as well so you get higher ranked people as enemies and teammates its very cheap aswell and you can even make money with the game itself from the drops that you get after a game its not much but the game is very big and also has its own community servers has ongoing support from the creators and gets updated around every month with new skins for guns there is no in game purchaseable content except for the operation challenge coins which give you an advantage over other people very fun game and i greatly recommend it

this is the ultimate fpstitle no questions asked its not even a thing of opinion its clear that a battlefieldgame and a call of dutygame comes up every year delievering same thing every year this is different there are multiple reasons why csgo is superior over any other fps game ive ever seenheardplayed price its dirtcheap yes no csgo2 coming up next year gameplay this game is competetive all the way none of that cod competetive where there is a kid from iran singing some one direction song in the lobby community one of the most active communities out there mapmakers skinmakers you name it content in this game there arent any map dlcs the only things close to dlcs are the operations where you can pay a couple of bucks to support the community mapmakers and getting access to those maps in official valve servers yes and the official matchmaking is the nail in the other games coffing it offers not only a great but annoying d rank system it brings out serious gaming for the meta only thing i curse in this game is the tickrate any csplayer knows the  behind valves servers the tickrate the rate that in the server updates in a second usual tickrate for official matches is 128 valve servers offer 64 what the hell valve but still it offers hugely enjoyable expirience this game has become one of my alltime favorites why because its the ultimate competetive shooter with tactical gameplay teamwork need of gamesense and a kickass skin system thats why

p250  franklin isnt worth $100 gg valve but in all seriousness though this is the premiere tactical esports fps game not much else can be said about its complexity and craft
recommended
finally a worthy successor of the famous cs 16 in the best traditions of their ancestors but with better graphics and features it is also fascinating and more tactical
recommended
i was never a fan of the way css played compared with 16 however csgo has really captured the original and taken it to another level i enjoy the ability to get the old competitive feel with the new ranked competitive mode ive connected with a number of old playersfriends and gotten back into this definitely worth the purchase
recommended
they say it only costs $1499 but it will take alot more than just that from your wallet and your family

when i bought this game in early 2013 i didnt think it would become into on eof the most biggest esport games of 20142015 at first i wasnt that keen on the game everything was unbalanced and it was so weird and bad compered to 16 and source then when valve decided to put some efort into polishing this game it turned out to be one if not the best game that they made everyone on steam needs to have this masterpiece of a game 1010

highly competitive while the feeling of losing after a painful 45 minute competitive match the feeling of a close win makes you so happy that your uterus will hurt personally i find myself to be the most inconsistent player in the world and consistency is a key thing required for this game as you need to win games in a row in order to rank up i cant handle this and therefore my punishment is keeping my forever in the silverzone there are quite a number of hackers you may meet eventually though

puts over 300 hours into the game still dont know how to aim

basically the same shooting game you have played 1000 times but if you are obsessed with being the best or smtg then ranked is for you most common languages you will meet is english and russian best of it is that if you are pist off by noobs you don`t have to worry about it here once you gain high rank you will play only with similar ranks you can find interesting events and communities and hey  mby even friends and if you have friends you can play ranked together the first thing i recommend  never ever shoot teammates in first second and never ever leave ranked penalty is ridiculously high and if you think that 11eur is too much you can always wait for discounts like 50% & 75% off which is nice

counterstrike global offensive is what a fps should be this has to be the best skillbased fps on the market the guns feel powerful and rewarding and the addition of camos is great the only problem with the game is the difficulty the game is played competively and a good amount of the players on it have been playing counterstrike since the beginning are godlike so the game has a bit of a learing curve in the respect that it takes practice to be able to compete against some of the other players but once you are to that point this game is extremely rewarding getting a kill in this game is so much more satisfying than any other fps ive played mainly because getting kills arent easy all in all counterstrike global offensive is a must have for any fps fan due to the rewarding gunplay great map design and large community as soon as you overcome the learning curve
recommended
too cool to be true i have no idea why the players of 16 and source hate it it is an amazing game it has great matchmaking so noobs dont play with a pro try it

one of the funnestmost addicting multiplayer games out there today this is easily one of the best games i have ever played with that being said it does have its flaws for starters the community is one of the worst in the video game industry constant arguments insults sarcastic and obnoxious people littered all over csgo competitive is taken very seriously and you better hope you have a good team or else it wont be a fun experience be prepared to get randomly kicked in games sometimes and insulted for no reason besides some technical flaws and the community once again csgo is one of the funnest games on the market to date 1010 cm

its official i am hooked burned over 5 hours straight playing this game after purchase i was a little hesitant in getting it and asked a few steam friends about it and they said it was very good i like the new graphical updates to source it looks great and runs smooth sound and music are well done also i like the stat and achievement tracking feature it has i also like the fact that it has bot support for when i do not feel like dealing with whiny 10 year old punk kids i enjoyed checking the new maps and gameplay options out they are a lot of fun & challenging csgo is a great addition to the franchise i highly recommend picking this up for the low price tag it is being offered for i look forward to all the new content that valve has in store for csgo as well that is the great thing about cs is its mod support and added content that unlike battlefield and cod you seem to have to pay for or its no as user friendly for mods recommended

the best modern fps ever

this game that will probably not charm every player out there the gunplay is precise effective and unforgiving rush into the enemy and youre kia fail the objective in front of your supervisors and you will get shouted at unforgiving thats what this game is and then you get a kill you check the right top corner just to be sure yep you got him ice cold feels good doesnt it and then it happens your team is dead you clear the site you defuse seconds fade away as your sweat slowly surrenders to gravity you did it you did it your team the same people who called you thrash minutes earlier commend you and virtually pat you on the back you are the mvp you are the hero of this round thats what you get out of counter strike global offensive a gameplay formula that withstood its fight against time a diffucult challenge so rewarding it will keep you coming for more and more you will struggle doubt and fail a lot but your proggression will not remain unnoticed every frag you take every knife you sink deep into your enemys flesh will get you closer to a coldblooded killing machine you will play until you become a murderous husk screaming at your less experienced teammates for every little mistake they make but hey you will probably have a ton of fun until then
recommended
i like but too many cheaters
recommended
the best game i have ever played nuff said
recommended
this strategic teambased first person shooter brings back the classic elements of an oldschool arena shooter but with a strategic almost moba style map design a very refreshing shooter in a genre dominated by arcade shooters that dont require any level of skill well crafted with beautiful maps and solid mechanics counterstrike global offensive is the only game that deserves to follow its predecessors if you buy this gem beware you will lose days of your life to this masterpiece of a multiplayer first person shooter the only serious issue i had with this game is almost bad enough to turn me off of every valve game the soldiers wear very bland shoes how difficult would it be to give the soldiers some colourful shoes with pointy tips of maybe springs in the heels why would the developers not take into consideration the fact that players spends so much time looking at their feet that perhaps just maybe they would want to see something other than generic boring quite frankly lame shoes on the feet of their character step it up valve this game is a solid 810 as it still lacks tactically more entertaining footwear
recommended
this game shows how much fun simplicity can be worth your 15 bucks for sure

recommended
its not as bad as everyone claims it imho its one of the best titles ive ever played
recommended
the entire counterstrike series has prided itself on strategic competitive and difficult gameplay this game is the embodiment of thathighly reliant on teamwork individual skill and communication anyone who has wanted to play something that makes them yearn for improvement should purchase this game the skill cap is immense and there are always new things to learn valve volvo constantly releases patches and updates for the game and frequently introduces new mechanics to keep the players on their toes you wont be disappointed
recommended
not quite as good as the good old counter strike source but still fun to play especially with some friends and skill haha

recommended
the game allows you to shoot chickens animal abuse peta no approve 010
recommended
counterstrike global offensive is definitely a step in the right direction all the people who played the older cs games will feel right at home with all the classic maps however everyone no matter if its a new player or veteran will have to get used to new things like recoil patterns movement etc so everyone has an equal chance of winning depending on how much theyve played and gotten use to the game of course csgo combines tactics with shooting skills so well that it is one of the best wellballanced and competitive shooters out there
recommended
in my opinion the best counterstrike and a lot of fun
recommended
counterstrike global offensive cs go offers a simple yet surprisingly fun approach to the fps genre coming from battlefield 3 which i find fun as well i found cs go to be a refreshing alternative while there isnt much variety in what weapon one is able to use compared to many other shooters it does make it easier for the developers to ensure that gameplay is well balanced the fact that it is so easy to find a match to jump into also helps to make cs go a great game my only criticism is that you are not able to disable bots in private matches either that or i cant find the option to do so when i sometimes want to play 1 vs 1 with a friend edit you can disable bots using the bot_kick command ingame overall at the normal price of $1499 usd which is the price of some dlcs in many games cs go is a great value game that is worth every cent let alone its price during the many sales valve holds on steam

recommended
this game is a skill game unlike call of duty and battlefiled you have no iron sightsso you have to know how to shot your weapons if you have played counter strikesource or other cs gamesthen this is the game for you this game is not noob friendly it requires you to work as a team it is not a rush in and kill everyone yourself game you have to be careful as if it was a real life moment how ever it is still a fun game if you have the nerve you can still learn to play and be as good as everyone else i hope this helps you becuase it would have helped me
recommended
counterstrike global offensive is actually really good not like 16 or source but still fun if youre going to buy this game i recommend you to play with bots for some days because you will find pro players everytime and aiming is hard too oh yeah the only thing i think it sucks in this game is that no sprays 7510
recommended
great game fun to play casually or play competetivly completly recomend it
recommended
i love this game its a great fps shooter that actually requires skill to kill your opponents i play it all the time and you have to work as a team to win there are many different gamemodes even competitive which is really what im into
recommended
i was a bit late to the counter strike franchise i played most cods mw2 waw and black ops 1 my life untill shown steam i do own the other ones but this one being the most current and with its own competetive online play is fantastic get in a group with 4 other friends and youll have a blast yelling at each other for the entire game as someone will mess up and then everyone will start fighting its pretty great fun especially since after mge its very common to come across ddosers wallers triggerbots and aimbots all in all i do recomend this game its pretty fun and when youre not in a game with any of those people and you really get into it with some friends its fantastic to play get in there and start terrorizing or counter terrorizing

the classic thinking mans shooter updated with contemporary graphics and online fixins this is the only fps for me period it was preceded by counterstrike source probably one of the greatest competitive fps games of all time and only added great things to it with the new update the console version sucks this is the one to play like someone before me said more eloquently you either die like a s c r u b  or live long enough to be called a hacker

counter strike go is the return to the beloved multiplayer shooter game counter strike but will you want to play the new one or stick to the classics  of course everybody knows what counter strike is about essiantly counter terrorist and terrorist fight and each of them have diffrent objectives honestly i love this game the gameplay is way faster tighter and way smoother than ever the gunplay and awesome and you feel highly rewarded when youre on a killing spree the game has a few modes and all of them are fun for theyre own reasons there are some problems that need fixing the hit detection isnt always the best sometimes when you shoot the enemy square right in the face the shot doesnt connect overall the game is really fun and i enjoyed it alot and if you liked the previous counter strike games you need to own this title i give counter strike global offensive a 810
recommended
gg one of the best games

first game i bought on steam and would do it again

this is a great past time guaranteed to get you all worked up
recommended
best counterstrike theyve made yet  honestly imagine 16 gameplay updated graphics and all those little things that make life easier stats ranks builtin spectating collectible skins sensible gameplay options updated maps streamlined hud  and especially matchmaking i just love that you can get some friends together and be matched against 5 other people who want a competitive but not too serious game awesome
recommended
certainly a game you have to stick at for a while to have any sort of fun with more often than not i am frustrated by my inability to hit simple targets due to the way recoil works for people like me it can be a brilliant game one moment and horrible the next the player base in match making seems mostly comprised of people whos main aim in life is to tell you how much you suck at video games and generally treat you with contempt and unfriendliness but if you play with friends and ignore the unpleasant mob you can find a rewarding game and even some genuinely friendly people who are there to help you improve or just have fun in bad situations before jumping into competitive its probably wise to familiarise yourself with the rules as friendly fire and dodgy internet connections alike can result in temporary bans the graphics are quite nice some of the voice work is a bit weird to me but often a source of hilarity
recommended
imo its starting to become better than tf2 less spam less f2ps lol noobs and campers get ruled out more easily it isnt all about who can unload your magazine the fastest nor spamming with melee the trading is much more simpler more far and more desiredand isnt controlled as much by people who just want to make their bp worth more so it compensates for their lack of a girlfriend or for their small  the physics are less whacky due to recoil and require much more precision than tf2 even tho there are only like 30 maps its still fun 1110 flutterdoges would reccomend as well
recommended
such a good game must buy 1010 buy buy buy give money to steamvalve buy buy buy
recommended
1010 would play 200 hours a month again
recommended
this is a remarkable next step in the counterstrike franchise that has been volatile for over a decade with wellrounded gameplay near perfect balancing of the weapons fun innovative maps and great graphics that compliment the gameplay we have a beautiful and challenging first person shooter here but what separates this from other big franchises like call of duty and battlefield well the almost infinite skill ceiling allows this game to stand out from the rest while you can still dive into casual games run around and score a couple of kills those who spend hours and hours practicing in competitive mode will have fine tuned their skills to only aiming for headshots and other skilled tactics counterstrike global offensive provides a simple but deep first person shooter experience that provides customization refreshing content and a whole lot to learn for an extremely fair price compared to fps counterparts

ing buy this good ing   ing good community ing good gun skins ing fun to play using caps to make this message look important d

counter strike global offensive is an excellent first person shooter in every way possible the community is for the most very good and friendly one of the best aspects of this game is the competetive mode where you and 4 other friends can play versus other players around the globe while you rank up and earn new camos for your weapons some elements of this are not so good like problems with lag and disconnecting depending of what part of the world you live in probably will get fixed i will recommend csgo very much to the avid fps gamer and it is a must in your steam collection
recommended
most recent iteration of one of the purest fps games to ever hit the market mm needs more restrictions to keep out cheaters otherwise great

recommended
not great but keeps my attention for an hour or so if valve would spend less time making pretty weapon skins and stickers and more time improving the servers and the game mechanics itd be very good maybe as it is its barely a 710
recommended
its the worlds best call of duty
recommended
pretty good game aye

if youre ready to get verbally abused screamed and yelled at then this is your game get ready for the excitement of being called trash nub or scrub all while getting gunned down mercilessly by smurfs and hackers 5 stars

havent played an cs games before and bought this because i can see a lot of my friends play this the first time i played this game and i hooked myself into this game apart from little bit waiting time in matchmaking servers i dont have any negatives for this game graphics is good maps are excellent control is easy and overall game is fun and enjoyable it takes time to master the game but nevertheless it is a good game i rate this game a 1010 it is a must buy for all gamer for its sheer variety of game types
recommended
this game alone is a game that will be known forever its amazing maps to its amazing weapon skins this game does it all this game is byfar is the best first person shooter in my opinion it is also my favorite first person shooter of all time valve holy crap you did a great job with this game
recommended
yeah its good spent lots of money on it
recommended
just buy it
recommended
counterstrike global offensive raises the bar for tactical first person shooters this game is finely tuned and balanced not only in gameplay but with map design as well to create an even fight for both teams this pushes players to not simply hope for lucky shots and instead think more strategically about their every move the introduction of weapon skins gives people a cosmetic incentive to strive for as there are different weapon skins to fit the individual style of every player this combination of pristine gameplay and ingame economy makes this one of my favorite first person shooters to date and it will likely never be overshadowed by another
recommended
amazingly rich storytelling and character development 1010
recommended
very solid game i would buy this game
recommended
i would recommend this game to any player still missing that great feeling from playing counterstrike some things i really enjoy about this game is that its a improvment over css and does feel more like cs 16 all the original maps with a few minor changes to help make the maps better new guns and improvments and custom weapons are a plus
recommended
good for fps lover because its mix everything and it very fun
recommended
best skin simulator on the market 1010

100% recommend fantastic game either play for fun with your friends on all of the variety of servers or test your skills in online competitive where you can get ranked to play with people within your skill level

you either die a scrub or live long enough to get called a hacker

what can i say this game harbours an explicit way of first person shooters run aim and shoot but you ask yourself is that really it my answer and hundreds and thousands will agree with me here in saying no this game is not explicit this game is so complex that it breaks away from every shooter to date this game is an anomaly this game will treat you hours upon hours of enjoyable strategies intense nailbiting games immeasurable comebacks casekeypurchasing hacker allegations skin buying and the most celebrated attribute to this game fun competitive gamemode is what i will be discussing in this paragraphcounter strike global offensive does what call of duty and many other shooters cant team strategeies while team strategies dont prove to be utmost prevalent in some fpss this game basks in that essence it basks in that oasis of serenity team strategies is so important in this game that if you have a bad team you will find yourself a little vexed because one guy cant smoke mid or cant aim with an ak47 but when you do find yourself that perfect mix of players then will you really enjoy the essence of the game now the noncompetitive gamemodes do add in a sort of haven for people just starting out arms race the gamemode in which you start out with a gun and once you progress killing the opposing team your guns will also progress once you reach the gold knife level then you really have a challenge casual servers are perfect for practicing for competitive and gun aiming too now some cons in the competitive servers are that you will find some players are quite belligerent and abasing in the sense that they will troll you teamkill you annoy you and will critique the very way you play but in my opinion just have fun and try not to get those types of people inside your head in conclusion i strongly believe that this game is fantastic it strays away from that different side of fpss and delivers fantastic gameplay and enjoyable hours i reccomend this game to anyone that owns steam
recommended
great game so many hours gone d
recommended
its a good fun game to play with large groups of peoplefriends whatever even if the anticheat is  there are tons of smurfs and you rage for the stupidest reasons only if it was a blanaced game overall its meh

counterstrike global offensive is a spectacular game with great immersive multiplayer experience and community the developers actually listen to the community and fixes the problems of the game while adding new and fun content theres tons of updates coming in which makes it more and more enjoyable since it came out overall this game is one of the best 1010

cs gothe latest competitive valve fpsworth itor just stick with the old ones that must the most asked question that everyone makes when facing with the choice of buying this gamewell i hope this little review helps you decide csgo provides some new right choices and some bad ones being a competitive game this game excells at almost everything the right way from the way weapons feel when you shoot them or the maps with new layouts reinventedalthought from time to time ocasionally suffers from some ramdomness fireshoots directions where the bullet ends up being away far from where you aim for no appearent reasonsbut in rare casesand with the new patchs upcoming it will probably be fixed that moment in the decising moments can end up being felling just unfair where you feel you could have done it the new matchmaking for ranked games work well but then again from time to time it fails horriblywhere you find yourself teamming up with players with too much width range of skill gap betwen where then again you find yourself in a more of a 5vs4 match then a fair match but it isnt game breaking and doesnt ruin it by farand on top of ranking lvl that gap quickly disappears being that world elite class the new molotov cocktail granade provides a welcome new mechanic to the game being only fully used yet on highter ranks believe me it makes a quite difference the graphics specially the shadows look amazing the new source 2 engine feels more natural and vibrant then ever for that in my opinion it deserves a 82 out of 10 being itself not a fps innovator by far it furfills almost all of the cs 16 and cssource mistakes and errors and on a good side of course some people might argue that 16 shooting is the real quake style where skill is the king of the game that might diverge from person to person pros graphics look amazing mechanics feel more natural hands and movements of characters feel natural and human new map layouts competitive ladder weapon skins unlocks addes quite a welcome variety cons still has to improve in hitboxes in some ocasions server regions make some people have and average of 87\110 latency\ping in ranked matches has lower gamemodes then source and 16 not casual hasfun game has source or 16

take that amazed feeling you had when you first saw css for the first time while playing 106 now get rid of that image because that doesnt apply here then take all the challenge of mastering weapons behaviours from 16 and source and get rid of that as well then take the broken husk that is left force it to have a child with call of duty and you have counterstrike go play something else
recommended
very good game for first person shooter good graftics and i play like 1 hour a day really great game

let me tell you about this ing game this game is the bane of my existence i swear that if i couldnt get money off of it through community market i would barely play this ing game its like i swear its like crack cocaine i know its just eating away at me soul and body but i cannot stop snorting it its just too good when youre good its entertaining as  you have a good team and you have fun but its like its like being obsessed with lemons and then every day you come home with paper cuts all over your hand satisfying as  but it hurts so bad and you cant really get a good nights sleep all in all the quality is good just frustrating as  810 silence dogood this game is played by the 00th regiment of foot

my opinion about this game can be just positivei started playing counterstrike very long time ago and i always used to like itbut year by year it just became bad because of cheatersscripts and that stuffso my friend have gifted me counterstrike global offensivein the beginning i thought it is bad game because i only had 2030fps and that is considered as unplayable frame rate but i will still playing finenow when i upgraded my pc this game seems to be awesomewhy is it awesome no much cheaters as in previous versions of cs competitive mode i love it new visual effects some new guns new game modes skins no need to download em just collect i think if you love counterstrike games you should buy this one and try it you wont regret it
recommended
its the best game i have ever seen multiplayersingleplayerzombiesurfminigames and much more this is the best game buy it you will not regret it
recommended
either you die like a scrub or become a pro really nice competitive game love this game
recommended
definitely a fun game and reminds me of good old 16 the only downside is the accuracy that people pull off while running backwards and fleeing is ridiculous as well as accuracy while jumpingfalling this should be 0 or 00001%  it seems to be around 50% accuracy i wish they would have allowed for more spots to be spammable but i guess they did create this towards a newer generation gamer who had no idea what 16 was like all in all i would recommend this game it still is fun regardless of all the downsides you can compete in competitive without mirc but when you get higher a lot of cheaters appear and you can also play offline
recommended

the friendly russian players in competetive matchmaking will make you love this game and if you dont feel all snuggly you can join casual games where you can almost always find this one superpro player who has 10x less playtime then you and somehow manages to get mvp every round if you stop him however and kill him once he might quit and give you a chance to become the number 1 player
recommended
another addition to the counter strike franchise been playing this game for 10 years plus and still am finding new ways to do things each and every day the community might be daunting and condescending at times but once you persevere through it and start working towards your end goal whichever that might be this game will bring hours of enjoyment
recommended
absolutely the best competitive fpsgame right now probably the best ever 1010 would play again
recommended
shot someone enjoyed it would shoot again
recommended
pretty impressed at the fact that valve improved the graphics quite a lot and added a few more game modes like arms race etc which does make it a bit codish but still the simplicity of the counterstrike series was maintained although many new maps were added we still notice the classic maps like dust dust2 aztec etc its not a very fast paced fps like cod or bf yet its very enjoyable to play
recommended
competitive game with great community addicting fun and sporty dont play after a sale though lots of hackers are coming there are more modes of gameplay theres arms race which is basically gun game for those who have played previous cs titles deathmatch classic casual classic competitive classic is in my opinion the best to spend time on and once you feel ready you can hop on a competitive with your friends dont worry if none are available the matchmaking system will match you with adversaries and teammates with matching skill improve your skill and more important have fun who knows maybe youll be the one to beat the champions
recommended
latest in the counterstrike series  in theory same thing with fancy graphics  but some weapons changed the way they fire a bit  and not since long  but they added keys and crates into the game  with weapon skins exactly what it sounds like  some paint finishes for your weaponsand also stat track weapons stranges counting kills  because yeah  its a valve multiplayer game  and like team fortress 2 and dota 2  it had to go this way  some may complain about the way the weapons fire  how they liked the old look for the maps  incompetent players that are camping or idk what but i tell you this  give this game a chance get over 10 hours into it so you can get used to it and you should begin to like ithowever if you still do not like it you are one of the few people that hate this game because really  this is a game that is done pretty good i say it is worth buying  even more if you buy it with the bundle or at a sale

well how to start im counterstrike boy starting from v 13 big fan of cs all the way its my favourite game when csgo showed up i was really sceptic about that game thats why i didnt bought it in 2012 csgo is one of the best fps games you can find right now on the market its really balanced from every pistol shotgun smg you can kill with anything weapon is not so much important as in 16 where mostly you heard sounds of ak deagle or awp as for meeven if i played more then 2000 hrs of cs 16 it was really complicated in my first matches since textures and graphics changed a bit but its not really that hard to get used to engine graphics i really like the competitive system since i remember that pain in  called mirc d id recommend to buy the game at all costs
recommended
it makes me horny
recommended
absoloutly godly this game is a musthave why the hell are you reading this go buy it
recommended
i only played it for one day so far and im already in love with it i highly recommend it
recommended
great improvement on the cs series only thing that is lacking is the wide arrayof maps that were always present in earlier versions like climbing maps knife maps scoutsknives etc i mean they do have servers that have them but 99% of the few that are are always empty also miss the servers with the add on mods like warcraft low gravity superhero etc granted those were not the primary game but they were nice to have to relax and mess around from time to time still the gameplay is great and the system is set up well just wish hitboxes and registry were a but more accurate

arguably the best counterstrike ever made csgo feels heavier obviously more realistic and is getting even more exciting than its predecessors from the new marketplace created for us to utilize an awesome array of new weapon customization new default maps from vavle to constant updates and fixes to better serve our preferences ingame easily has the game on the up i recommened any competitive fps gamer to choose csgo
recommended
the game is very awesome
recommended
when i was kid i started play with cs 13 then keep playing css comes out css was not so good so i stick with 16 now i really love csgo its more fun than casual 5v5 scrim its more social its more realistic more than game its very competitivelikeso totally worth it and of course we love custom skins community maps  steam workshop is perfect 1010 if you like fps genre must have it
recommended
simply the best competitive fps game

despite what youtube griefing videos implied to me running around in gun game knifing people to demote them isnt nearly as easy as it looks and that experience is all i wanted to get out of this game this is just another case of me being  at a game and saying its bad because i never wanted to play it in the first place hahaha its really good guys
recommended
counter strike is a very nice game each game has its advantages but also its disadvantages advantages you have many options to play counter strike you can make competitions can be played on normal and abnormal funny servers you get temporarily weapons or boxes that you can use in the game disadvantages disadvantages include the steam or valve occasionally have problems with the servers  it has also cheaters who get nothing in life to the series and want to achieve something in the game although it has more pros and cons but i think thats enough i recommend it to anyone but do not become addicted so have fun with it and if you have some question you can ask me
recommended
simply the best fps competitive game on the planet

its gud

have you ever wanted to be a car kid well now you still cant but you can cry yourself to sleep over the rounds you dropped the friends you let down and the relationships that you destroyed on csgo also this game came in first at the iowa state fair of 1945 for its help in the manhattan project at trinity this game has a halflife to that similar to that of carbon14 and is now being used for carbon dating techniques based on your winloss ratio on vertigo whenever a bomb is thrown off of the side of the map the carbon14 deposits plummet by the iq of the closest spider to the dalai lama

counter strike global offensive a game that incorporates the original classic revolutionary critically acclaimed features that changed the fps genre helping mold what we have today im not finished adding a new needed take visually gameplay wise and performance wise counter strike global offensive is a game created by valve to bring it to the everyday player and the experienced or not so experienced competitive player the game looks beautiful it works like a charm and again revitalizes the game without straying too far from its roots if youre a cod player a bf player or a player who generally is adapted to playing with a scope will be confused for a couple games the weapons course will help new players and old players alike get a definitely needed insight on how this game plays in comparison to others but again it works and it really does help you out the modes include offline and online for players who have different play styles and you wont miss out on any action or feel oppressed by it either valve has touched up the game and is continuously updating the game to keep it fresh the game not only allows you to play preset game modes but allows you in tradition with source to host create and join created maps by the community what types of mode youre asking surf  players use their keys to surf along linear or nonlinear pipes that incorporate puzzles and reaction speed and etc survival  players play in a hunger games styled game mode that pits everyone against each other until the last man or woman is left standing etc etc etc this game has a lot of content for such little that it depends financially and hardware wise however there are some flaws that should be duly noted whenif purchasing it being a steam play game it may experience some issues with server lag latency issues ping issue which disrupt gameplay and well  time that is the only major hiccup and rarely happens but when it does it ruins the overall experience my score 45

when it comes down to it counterstrike global offensive may follow the same old formula of gameplay seen in previous versions of counterstrike but its still a wellrounded tactical shooter it may not try anything drastically different or revolutionize the series by taking it in a new direction but theres still enough there to appeal to newbies and hardcore fans alike

the best game ever

one time i went into this random server and there were about 20 people good guys and bad guys and they were making a pyramid they were all so happy they saw me and said hey  we need one more person for the top they smiled i climbed up their eager bodies and stood at the top believing what i was seeing a whole world and all that lay before me was justice and understanding and people coming together when i was done unloading my ak47 into the tops of peoples heads chaos broke out sides turned on eachother brother killed brother blood filled the room they cursed my name and said i was banished from the game forever i believed them but vowed i would return to reclaim my place at the top now more than 10 years later i am ready to kill those who have wronged me actually its hard this game is hard 810

csgo is a nearperfect multiplayer shooter unlike the previous versions which were often difficult to get in to this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels it has a large community and a well supported workshop ensuring that this discountpriced game will be around for years to come in short you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster its been around for years and has spawned many imitators the game isnt much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original half life 2 was however valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis is it worth getting if you already own counter strike source yes css was always counter strike shoehorned into the source engine csgo feels far more like a standalone game valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game the best feature must be the competitive play where you play 10 games that you cannot leave unless you want to tarnish your reputation after which youll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill meaning that the game is challenging but fair no matter what skill level you are there are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join really if i was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice its bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come something that cant be said for the call of duty franchise which is probably its closest rival remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year fragmenting the community plus you can customise your weapon skins in csgo surely thats the most important feature all they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in csgo

recommended
currently the best competitive fps indeed  it is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning but with some practice you should get the mechanics of the game the strong point is that valve publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the esport with esport cases team sticker or event cashprize esl one dreamhack valve is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the operationseason pass like operation breakout or operation phoenix so you can play community map in competitive mode  the weak point imo is the community youre a noob ou youre a cheater furthermore there are many cheater when the game is cheap on steam but these low prices are usually followed by many vac ban this game does not look like other games as the call of duty saga this game is for child and noob and they want to make money csgo is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community  gl & hf  thanks volvo d

this game is very nice i enjoy it a lot

just awesome and perfect game <3

counter strike global offensive has a perfect mix of casual and competetive gaming if you are just starting out on the game you can play modes such as deathmatch demolition and arms race before jumping in to competetive competetive is the perfect way to prove yourself as a good player as you will be placed in to games based on your competetive rank which is good for newcomers to the game i personally enjoy the competetive aspect of the game over casual although i have noticed a few faults with in the matchmaking system sometimes somebody who is a low level gold such as myself you are sometimes placed in to a game with the top level golds or sometimes even master guardians this could be because the mgs are playing with their lower leveled friends or it may be the system trying to test your level for promotion i would give this game a 810 and recommed it to anybody who hasnt tried it

its awesome
recommended
this game is great when i first played it it was in beta and i thought its a crap game however after recently buying it i noticed that it has changed a lot since beta and i enjoy playing it if someone likes cssource but has never tried csgo before then i recommend buying this i think its a lot better than cssource ever was
recommended
such an improvement to css if you like cs then youll love csgo

best game  it has some skins and gun styles  but it need high graphics to have the ability to play this game in high fps 100

recommended
counter strike has come a long way since it was a halflife mod in the late 90s and is still just as fun as the first day i played it if youre looking to purchase an fps that will outlast any cod or battlefield game youve ever owned stop here weve been playing on the same core maps since the beginning and we still come back for more theres no other fps experience like it valves best title in my opinion

this game is about losing friends be it through failing to trade kills or teamflashing or failing to find a more fulfilling andor lucrative hobby or the lack of social development because youre too busy trying to defend your actions in competitive 1010 great work valve raise your glass heres to 10 more years of cs
recommended
buy this game if you want to ruin your life and get addicted to spending more money than you need to
recommended
first of this is cs so you should already know what you are getting into there is no better fps game out there in my opinion i personally like the mode competitive the most but there is alot of servers out there that is quite entertaining like climb surf aim maps etc there is an endless opportunity in this game if you are looking at getting better in fps games in general this is the game you should go from cs will teach you the most basic & the most advanced as you can tell by my hours i do absolutely love this game hope this helped you ^^

recommended
csgo is a trully revolutionary expirience in gaming you get to fly jets and take down skyscrapers this game has the realism of 300% ot of 7% possible getting headshots is really rewarding you feel as if you just shot someone in the facepeople rarely enjoy when i unexpectedly spray my heavy load all over their faces and chest load of bullets that is i give this gave a trillion coinswhich means that the metascore for it is 98 ing awesome 
recommended
i never played this game for a single second ever in my life but apparently i can write a review about it cool

counter strike global offensive stole all of my money and ruined my social life dont regret it one bit totally worth it 1010 damnit valve youve done it again some of its awesome features this game focus on realism incorporates real world elements you can climb ladders without using your hands you can defuse an armed bomb by looking at it you can only aim with guns that come with scopes which is like 4 all other guns are hip fired you sound like a fat elephant plodding around when youre running but when you walk slowly youre as silent as a shadow ragdolls realistic bullet physics and bullet spread fall damage friendly fire jumping crouching running walking awesome gun skins that come in various qualities and conditions the ability to show off your awesome gun skins ingame excellent ai excellent ai names i dont know what else valve could do to make the game even more fun and realistic valve sure hit the nail on the head with this game
recommended
best gameever coop with friends is amazing
recommended
this is just a marketing game even its named global offensive so its abbreviation come out as go dat marketing skills tho nothing global in this game although there are some new maps that take place in a different part of the world but if you liked the cs 16 youll defenitelly like this as much because the developers were too afraid to adapt any new mechanincs in the game even the ridiculous ladder climbing remained the same they could have made an animation for climbing but many say that that would slow the gameplay but not if the character would step two ladder rungs instead of one or something like this its just looks horrible among the few realistic mechanisms but while they tryied to implement realism the way you have to aim with the scope with rifles the aiming system is still well undeveloped to me its a good thing that the most liked maps like dust and assault are still in it and they are all improved with destroyable doors barrels and other objects and in the game not all weapons works the same way thats a good thing again this is why its hard to say wheter i recommend it or not i of course recommend from an aspect that many players bougth the game the 16 version were so popular i bet you have a friend on your list who play this game but in the other hand this game is nothing but a poor work making new source of money in my opinion but saying positive again for conclusion im an audiophile and i love its music the music system is very well made when you get killed the dramatic music kicks in and so on and i cant complain about its graphics if i look away from the animations overall yes i recommend this game
recommended

one of the best fps games available a must have title for those who like fps games
recommended
being playing counterstrike for 10 years and i have to say that the new version defintily have some improvement but it doesnt have all the maps 16 and source have except on community server the inclusion of competitive gameplay now helps to regulate competitve players to play in a competiton style while there is a casual style for noncompetitive people to play this game is a definitly must to play if you are veteran of counter strike 
recommended
i now have over 12k hours on all of my accounts combined and its still as fun as the day i bought it if not even more i love counter strike global offensive and can see myself playing this game for years on end this is the most value i have gotten for my money ever i encourage any person either pro or just got on pc buy counter strike global offensive there is a spot for every one here this means either pro scrims or pick up games with people on your skill level

most passive fps ever god its terrible a
recommended
probably the best counterstrike at the moment it just keeps getting more features  competitive mode matchmaking skins for guns to raise funds for cs league video and highlights from all your past matches watch live games better hostages mode gun game mode includes however they just keep adding stuff without fixing all the issues and bugs from past updates this games is unplayable for some people over the internet but great in lan the gun skins update brought lower fps to the game going down by 80 to 120 fps
recommended
great game all around and cod is bad

its a good game d
recommended
it is quite a change csgo is clearly not the same game as css or 16 weapons feel more realistic and the gameplay feels a lot stiffer than css there are new weapons and introduces very different aspects to the already famous game this time around it really feels like a professionals game nontheless csgo is very fun and if youre a fan of the counterstrike series i think youll enjoy this too you just have to get used to the new mechanics its not the best of the lot but counterstrike global offensive is a welcome change to the cs community
recommended
if you shoot and kill someone he doesnt die for real i killed some guys few times in a row thats good you should try it
recommended
this is the best game ever plz subscribe
recommended
if you like old good cs 16 and you wonna somthing more realistic just buy this game 1010  addicted the creator
recommended
if you havent got this game already then it is worth the buy if you thought counter strike source was good wait until you get your hands on this

this is the most addictive game i have ever played the various coop maps make it more interesting then there is badge system which lets you know where you stand in the game community you come back again and again to take your rank up this game is really awesome
recommended
counterstrike global offensive csgo the newest addition to the counterstrike franchise supposedly takes the best from both its most famous predecessors counterstrike 16 and counterstrike source i as a person who has played 16 for approximately 8 years cannot confirm that wholy but i can at least say that the game is fun to play with the biggest advantage it has over its older brothers being the matchmaking i would easily pay valve $100 for 16 with the matchmaking from csgo but that is not gonna happen so for the time being i just have to settle with what csgo offers i might have sounded a little more negative than i wanted the graphics are nice enough even though well aged source engine although with the newest tweaks cannot compare with latest aaa production apart from new look you will find your all time favorites from previous counterstrike games same goes for weapons and game mods however there is not only an old content you will find couple of new guns and what i appreciated most were new maps created by community and published in buyable packs by valve providing the creators with part of earnings later on the game suffered an attack of dropable content fortunately valve did not step over cosmetic changes so you can only spend your hard earned bucks on different weapons skins at least for now
recommended
this is a great game in many ways it is more accessible then the 16 version which was already very accessible but new players are able to learn how to play very fast and their enjoyment is greater then the one they would have had at the start of 16 or cs source but on the other hand there is one little gripe i have and it is that i balive they made it to simmple and when i say little i mean tiny so the gripe is only personal i believe and it shouldnt effect your gameplay enjoy the game 
recommended
counter strike global offensive what a game in my opinion money well worth spent every penny you invest in this game is worth it you must have the teamworkcoop skills as in battlefield and the small map skills as in call of duty yet there is multiple things we must have forgot your own skill matchmaking skins a wide variety of real weapons still being used today automatic communications team chat medalsachievmentsbadges to collect and earn a fancy skill level to show the world you are awesome you can make your own skins for a profit realistic gameplay such as weapon recoil damage and graphics this game also works very smoothly with just about every computer 1010 no if ands or buts mr j

recommended
this is a ok for right now could be a lot better csgo has changed a lot i first off enjoy the game because of the competiveness and the skill that is needed but they are a few problems like hit dections and the rekt9 the new meta of the game run and gun should not even be in the game lets say you have a guy who is good with an ak he misses his headshot because the guy is running with a smg jumping around in theory the guy with the ak should have killed him but no since the spread of bullets when running is like a circle the guy with an ak is died that most often happens in the silvers also not to mention there are a bunch of cheaters in this game i think valve really has to step up there game with the cheaters because they are a lot out there they are ruining the game for people also the smurfs i have found a solution for this the reason why people smurf is because they dont want to play with cheaters it is like a circle if there is a cheater in the higher ranks the guy who is not cheating will want to buy a smurf so he doesnt play with cheaters if valve steps up there game with cheaters then they wont be any smurfs now back with the run and gun the rekt9 is the most over used gun in my opinion you dont even have to aim for the head because you mostly are going to get a headshot with it also the most over used gun in the silvers is the p90 i dont see a lot of p90s the reason why i hate it it is because the moving spread of the p90 you also have 50 bullets basicly you and just spray with it that is my review if there is a update of csgo with the meta change i will update my review

this game is by any case or point like a bf or cod this game has no super ac130s no nukes no tanks no nothin that might sound boring but it is not the game is amazing you have to put in so much moar than just run around and kill you have to talk to your te m mates and play safe buy the right weapons at the right time throw a granade and blind a enemy then take them out what makes this game great for me is the team work and the just the love for it i just cant tell why i just love the game this is not like cod wean 1 preson guns down a whole team no if you just run in with no help even with super skill you will get gunned down so you need to tell your team mates so they can help and the learning curv for this game is the gun recoil and clutch yeah the game is fully based on recoil you have to studdy and try and try agen to get the best shot i with 160 hours is still haveing a blast with new gun skins everymonth and new maps yeah there are skins in this game kinda based on tf2 with stat trak being like a strange and knifes being like hats so yeah this is vavle and if you know valve they like making money of pixels so yeah items can range from 002 cents to 1000$ so yeah there is that but the guns dont make you better they dont do anything so this game does not force you to buy things after you buy the game if your looking for a new fps or tacticool shooter or you liek warteam work shooter if you want to know the bases of the game it is that there is two teams terrorist and counter terrorists terrorists try to plant a bomb and make it explode they have a or b bomb site and they have to plant the bomb and try to protect it till it goes boom the counter terrorists want to kill all the terrorists or if the terrorsits planted the bomb they try to defuse it if the bomb explodes the terrorists win if the bomb is defused the counter terrorists win if the terrorists kill all of the counter terrorists the the terrorists win and if the counter terrorists kill all of the terrorists and also the terrorists get a time limit if that time limit runs out before they plant the bomb or kill all of the counter terrorists they lose there is also a hostage saveing game which you can think of what it is thank you for reading my review sorry for eny eeeeglish mistakes i made im not that great this game was breath taking 1000000000010

rank 810 recommendations play other counterstrike titles before and get off those silly actiony fps titles major theme skills in fps this game sets the standard and is the standard globally bought at price $13  preorder special the counterstrike seriesfranchise has grown up with valve over time instead of trying to come up with something completely new  and ultimately wreck games like ea  valve looks at ways to stick to the roots and build off that the biggest issue i should address before anything else is mechanics counterstrike is not about realism which is the first thing i point out to newbies but rather mechanics the game mechanics have been modernized that is a fact of life and thus has made the game more accessible to people some people wish counterstrike global offensive would have been a simple graphical upgrade to counterstrike 16 or counterstrike source put it this way you will always loose people in game transitions there was outcry in the community when backend changes were made in counterstrike source valve has made mistakes in that title like the famous scaling purchases system but has learned from that and moved on the community in some regards hasnt moved on and crys about almost anything it can common problems 16source players have this hud is way to big my gun sways when i move my gun takes time to get to where im aiming it doesnt run on my toaster anymore fov doesnt scale like it used to these probably dont matter to the vast majority of people but for people who take cs seriously they had or still have issues to this day with those items valve just like other games allows you to customize your experience it doesnt have to be workshop but the backend settings are exposed for you in menus it is obvious that the game is designed for consoles in mind but the options are there to make it your game for instance i prefer the older style of crosshair maybe im old school but thats just what works for me i can press a few buttons or even console settings if it gets down to that and i get a crosshair i want i should make a quick note even i dont like some of the changes made most recently gun game or arms race was updated to make it more even in doing so top players from each team are in a sense punished by being made globally visible for a period of time during and after shooting in addition instead of 1 kill to 1 level its now 2 kills or 1 knife kill killing a team leader means an instant level up instead of the 2 normal kills these changes have left a bad taste in my mouth and thus i no longer play the gamemode speaking of gamemodes the new demolition mode allows people who are new to get a grip on one bomb site before they play the standard two bomb site maps in casual and competitive modes unlike before valve has integrated a standard competitive mode which allows for easy comparison of skill level you can still play the classic casual mode with large team sizes enough on mechanics i guess moving on valve has added a weapon skin system into the game this is very much like dota 2 and tf2 where they are simply cosmetic items you can look in the market and see some of these items are listed and sell at above the $200 mark graphics wise the game still shows some console optimizations on the pc such as windows showing up black from a distance with a sniper scope this is the area portal working and can be addressed other than that its basically a portal 2 branch to sum it up mechanics are a big part of csgo and they take a while to learn they have been updated along with the graphics to make the game more accessible to everyone outside of the hardcore cs community

this game is about losing friends be it through failing to trade kills or teamflashing or failing to find a more fulfilling andor lucrative hobby or the lack of social development because youre too busy trying to defend your actions in competitive 1010 great work valve raise your glass heres to 10 more years of cs
recommended
buy this game if you want to ruin your life and get addicted to spending more money than you need to
recommended
first of this is cs so you should already know what you are getting into there is no better fps game out there in my opinion i personally like the mode competitive the most but there is alot of servers out there that is quite entertaining like climb surf aim maps etc there is an endless opportunity in this game if you are looking at getting better in fps games in general this is the game you should go from cs will teach you the most basic & the most advanced as you can tell by my hours i do absolutely love this game hope this helped you ^^
recommended
great multiplayer game worth the money the trading is fun too
recommended
1 game so good very nice

recommended
csgo is a amazing first person shooter with great graphics and oneline play there are quite a few guns here that are easy to learn but hard to master the tutorial is in depth and quite fun but agent humans there are lots of stratigies to play the diversity of maps and gamemodes is alot for games of these type from large and small maps to hostage scenerios to straight up deathmatch this game is highly fun and is a good pc version of a fps but still has potential as cod and battlefield are also there for console gamers
recommended
play competitive mode
recommended
warning this game includes voice chat make sure to disable it or to fart out loud in your microphone great game
recommended
wanna learn some russian simple play this game and you will speak fluent russian

this cs is awesomecs 16 is full of cheaterscss is good but cs go is awesome
recommended
        16  source   
recommended
dunno why i need to write a review i came in this game from tf2 while trying to get competitive and cs go just has this however this is cs go not cs 16 so dont use the deagle there is no deagle round this doesnt exist definitly a fun game to challenge yourself but dont forget its a game when you do and rank is everything its just worthless
recommended
according to my point of view the best functioning und balanced onlinecompetitive fpsshooter with a creative community that always is integrating their content into the game thats what makes csgo so special it is developing all the time recommendable without any concerns
recommended
very nice i like this gamer i love it
recommended

recommended
if you have friends this is a great game to play with them if you dont have any friends this is a great game to play alone if you dont have the game to play get the money for it if you dont have the money for it get a job if you dont have a job rob the bank if you get arrested robbing the bank at least you tried

recommended
there has been a great deal of controversy on whether the game fulfilled the peoples expectations and whether it deserves to be considered as worthy as its ancestors many positive points to be noticed great graphics for a cs game and satisfying gameplay that can make you unable to stop playing especially if playing with friends on the negatives compared to the previous titles it has many things that devs could fiximprove plus the matchmaking system is not working as expected and as it seems no serious efforts are made to change that last but not least i have to point that the cs go community is likely the worst still worth buying 710 nearly 700 hours of gameplay multiple accounts
recommended
skins skins every where

the best strategy and tactical fps game  p must recommended to every fps game lovers d

its team fortress 2s big brother not as fun but can kill people tf2 has hats battlefield has nice maps cod isnt serious i faced csgo with inexperience buy the game if you like to shoot people and get funny stickers on your guns you can shout allahu akbar to other players when you get a kill 63
recommended
this game is the best i would perfer it anyday over source or gayva it combines a skill game with a mostly mature community to make a wonderful game i would recommend this game highly it will take you a little bit to learn the recoil but once you get it youll be having a lot of fun
recommended
possibly the greatest shooter series ever forget cod forget battlefield this is where the skill and fun really is at it just has so much replay value its unbelieveable its good that theyve included all the old cs weapons and their weapon sounds and maps counter strike is a very tactical game so spraying wont work if your are a cod noob and want to play this game learn how to master trigger control first game is very enjoyable and i cannot recommend this game enough 
recommended
passed knife to get a sandstorm twice now

is quite a good game same as counter strike  source but batter

this is the nokia 3310 of shooting games
recommended
the good game
recommended
currently the best competitive fps indeed  it is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning but with some practice you should get the mechanics of the game the strong point is that valve publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the esport with esport cases team sticker or event cashprize esl one dreamhack valve is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the operationseason pass like operation breakout or operation phoenix so you can play community map in competitive mode  the weak point imo is the community youre a noob ou youre a cheater furthermore there are many cheater when the game is cheap on steam but these low prices are usually followed by many vac ban this game does not look like other games as the call of duty saga this game is for child and noob and they want to make money csgo is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community  gl & hf  thanks volvo d
recommended
this game is very nice i enjoy it a lot
recommended
just awesome and perfect game <3

really good competitive game but sometimes you just feel like world would be so much better place without russia
recommended
best game and cause of the matchmaking option it makes the game really fun and i hope you will find it fun tood
recommended
csgo is a fun competive game for competing aganist players and settling scores but it seems like csgo is going to become the new tf2 why must i say that well because theyre adding tradable weapons crates keys and trading in general soon just like tf2 csgo shall be free to play then everything just becomes really overrated but overall fun game to play
recommended
very addicting

yo this game is gud 1010 piggies

one of the greatest fps of all time highly addictive and provides hours and hours of fun you simply just cannot go wrong with this game especially if you can even make profit from it definitely a worthwhile experience for all your fps gamers out there now enough of that get out there 360 no scope some n00bs and make them take a ing seet m8 cs go is luv cs go is lyf
recommended
this game is amazing i was a call of duty player and after some time i realized how bad it actualy is so i thought i need something new and i saw this game on sale and i though why not and it was awesome first at all the matchmaking works great its not like when your new your gonna ger dropped in all those high ranked skilled players but with people which have around the same skill as you second you need a lot more skill and teamwork for this here is an example when youre on the terrorist team you need to plant the bomb at site a or b but on the other hand when youre on the counter terrorists team you dont know where they are going so you need like 3 people to a and 2 to b if somebody gets shot at a you need your team to help up there you need quite some skill and a good eye to play this game because you cant aim down your sights and you need to learn the recoil patterns you also have gamemodes like deathmatch and arms race which need an small improvement on the spawns but after all its a great way to improve your aim and learning your recoil patterns you can even earn some money out of it by getting camos and cases and sell them on the market i made like 10 euros out of it and bought new weapons for it how awesome is that but now were comming to a verdict im giving this game an 1010 one of the best first person shooters i played 
recommended

salt simulator 2015 1110  ign thanks for the salt i needed some with my french fries
recommended
1 year ago i was like css and cs 16 are much better than go but now i think diffrent css and cs 16 is better for just casual and fungaming custom maps csgo is much more of a competitive game its easier to get into the competitive scene and its thougt to be a serious counterstrike i only have one problem with this game i think the ranking system is too much random often you feel likei played vs guys 5 ranks higher won 2 times in a row and was both times top fragger why no rankup but for this problem you have many solutions id like to go and play on the many even more competitive gamemodes on faceit cevo or esea because there counts more to your rank like entry frags clutches and so on i recommend this game to everyone who knows what he is buying dont buy this game if you expect call of duty or battlefield feeling buy this game if you want to master it play serious and play competitively

just spray and pray ^_^

an fps with mmostyle drops and items this game does a lot of things right and a couple things wrong casual play is slightly skewed by an overabundance of the cheesiest sniper rifle ever put in an fps but all in all its fun and addictive and a great way to hang out with your friends 400 hours in a game that cost me $4 its hard not to recommend a game which presents that kind of dollar to time ratio
recommended
great fps with a unique overarching game mechanic terrorists vs counterterrorists that is quite fun and most of the time requires lots of strategy to be implemented ive shot more chickens than players 1010

strategy teamplay dedication and fun

if i had a choice of getting my  cut off or never be playing this game again id choose getting my  cut off
recommended
csgo continues the brutal infuriating and wonderful counterstrike series that taunts you to be a better player with every game i was somewhat skeptical during the beta before the addition of the casual mode but the continuous updates and gameplay additions makes it the new tf2 in my mind the bifurcation of competitive from casual and gungame does a good job grouping players with like minds this title is endlessly playable with a vibrant community that is quite a bit more mature than the cod fish players that slime around the net the map system and continued mod extensibility makes it a premiere title on steam my lame complaints no more tmp mp7ump are too awful aimpunch kinda broken dont really detract from the goodness to be had graphics got a very nice upgrade over source and most of the maps got carried over 910 for my next obsession
recommended
the best game ]
recommended
to start this game as realized in many discussions with others on the matter is one of the most if not the most tactical shooters on the face of the earth the elegant pacing of the battle between the ts and cts is astoundingly welldone and has my mind rushing to the planned calculations of chess matches it is a playercontrolled masterpiece that doesnt need ambient story or environment to create its appealing nature the raw fps skill that is needed to even contend in this game has me excited to keep playing and reach the top of the proverbial mountain day after day pick this game up it will consume your fps experience in the best way imaginably possible at this price you cant go wrong

you know i love this game like genuinly do but i just ing left a game and restarted my computer and i made it back into the game before the ban but because i wasnt in the game and playing i got ing banned it really needs fixing so that when the player clicks reconnect the ban timer stops because not only did i get 2 ing hour i got deranked on a game i was banned from what ing fix it

csgo best shooter game in the world       valvethank u
recommended
i recommend csgo to veteran players and beginners alike as the game has a balanced community you can meet people who are complete s yet find some that are rather tolerant the graphics are ok for a game that was pretty recent and maps created by the community are also playable if youre aspiring for an competitive environment this is the place for you
recommended
this game is a very fun game to play has skins  cases to open which might empty your wallet you get profit from this game alsowhile having fun you get caseskins drop you can sell and get other games you want

guns sound scary especially sniper rifles and detailed character dialogue keeps you in the combat loopcounterstrike global offensive is different than almost every other shooter because it demands intelligent hardcore tactical play from every last one of its players
recommended
the most balanced and competitive shooter out there right now with one of the best dev teams behind it cs go is everything i wanted 16 to be years ago and nearly 500 hours in im not bored of it yet
recommended
what can i say counterstrike global offensive is one of the better first person shooters not because it has the better visuals or because the game has a more upstanding community but because the gameplay in this particular game was bred for competitive play counterstrike has been achieveing this level competitive play since the begining and hasnt stopped since if you are looking to pickup counterstrike global offensive here are some reasons to persuade you to pick up csgo over its competitors 1 csgo is not about running and gunning  in csgo accuracy is everything and timing your shots could be the difference between life and death where in games like call of duty and battlefield where the game has a community of squeaking children who dropshot in order to get a kill in csgo you will find it more likely than not if you run around and spray you will die more than you will frag this is because of the accuracy system 2 unlike most other first person shooter games csgo requires alot of teamplay to actually achieve a victory in the competitive gamemodes if you come into the game unprepared you will probably get yelled at by some experienced players but do not let them discourage you you will become better and surpass even their skill level learn calls smokes and any other tactical thing you can learn in this game to give yourself the edge and most of all never talk negative to your teammates as this will just provide stress and tension between your teammates and yourself 3 skill groups are a big part of csgo in games like battlefield and call of duty your skill group will always go up as you play the game and earn exp but in csgo the ranking system is a little different elo is what csgo uses and it does a really good job of accurately matching you against an opponent of your skill level everytime you play a full competitve match of csgo whether it be a win or a loss your elo will take a hit so if you win your elo ranking will increase and if you win most of your games you will end up at a higher skill group which is displayed by an ingame rank if you lose most of your games you will most likely downrank which is fair as if you lose most of your games you probably do not belong in your skill group and got there by pure luck or beating other people that do not belong at their skill group 4 skins  alot of people hated skins when they first added them as they thought the game was going through a transformation into team fortress 2 but they couldnt be more wrong about such an event skins were added to the game to be monetary gain and to show support for the game by making it so community members could create and possibly get their content implemented into the game this allowed the general community to have a bigger impact on more things in the game skins come in all colors shapes and sizes to fit the default guns in the game and add an artisitc visual to the game that is otherwise nonexistant by the games map and other textures skins can also be traded and vary in prices so you can make money just from playing the game and also sink tons of dough into the game 5 its fun  this game will not always be fun as the learning curve in this game is massive and you will probably find yourself asking yourself why you are even playing this game but then you will remember that you want to learn how to be better and once you do the game will open up and become one of the better games you play as this game is has everything that other games from the same genre are missing keep playing and never giveup this is just a taste of the game and everything else their is to love in csgo comes naturally to those that play the game frequently i hope you read this review fully and are intrigued if you do not already own this game

well spent time of my life i dont regret 1010

this game has kept me entertained for a while the matchmaking may be broken as  due to the overwhelming amount of smurfs you get in every game the hacking in this game is becoming less of a problem as gaben and his team work to fix it the price of this game is well worth it in my opinion

the king of fps games buy itits the best game you can buy on steam my opinion
recommended
this is by far the best game ive ever played i like shooters so thats what i tend to look for on steam when you pick this game up youre going to have to forget everything you know about modern shooters if you want to win first off the game has an insane competitive atmosphere 5v5 matches that use a mediocre ranking system last up to 90 minutes at a time leaving you on the edge of your seat for those clutch moments the community is amazing at helping you learn the game and youll find the right people and the right playstyle you have to be dedicated to win here learning map callouts and memorizing different plays recoil patterns and likely spots where an enemy can be its a great game to pick up and play casually but even better to go hardcore with your buddies however with every great game there are bad parts to it as mentioned before the ranking system is slightly mediocre nobody really knows how it works but some games end up unfair next youll stumble upon hackers often especially at the high high ranks you can report them and theyll get bannedmost of the time but most of the time you lose the game and youll get deranked recent changes make it so that if a hacker is reported and banned the loss will not count towards your official statswins but if you do manage to win it still counts lastly theres the workshop if youre talented you can make skins and maps for the community and if valve likes them they go into weapon cases then they can be sold on the market some weapons can run you up to $400 dollars while others are a measly 2 cents overview pros competitive scene playing with buddies awesome people you can meet teamplay cons hackers scammers s mediocre ranking conclusion  if you like shooters and competitions pick this game up for you and 4 of your friends and go own some noobs

counter strike global offensive is a good fps game that may be hard at first especially if it is your first fps game there are a few reasons it is hard i find it hard because it is difficult for me to aim with no iron or attached sights because i am used to call of duty it is also difficult to learn the different spray patterns of the guns that are available for use there are a lot of things that you can learn ingame by hours and hours of playing i mean i have played 800 hours and i still cant use the ak properly xd i definitely recommend that people give this game a go i have enjoyed my experience so far
recommended
this game has learned me the russian langugage like no other after only one hour playing time i could understand and write most of the abusive words in russian after two hours i could speek even buisnessrussian fluently after 2 days of playing and playing i got a russian id and a russian family i also took over the russian traditions and can walk in undees through deep snow i fully am a russian right now xd

great game been playng since the release been playing cs since css i mostly play competitive and the ranking system is ok i think it could be more user friendly by telling the player how close or far from ranking up or down the only frustrating thing ive came across is smurfs and wall hackers

in this game you are a terrorist or an elite counterterrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts you must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies the goddess of guns can materialize guns in your characters hands a few seconds before a round starts however your character must pay for the guns which have vastly overinflated prices when you have the right amount of money the goddess will flash a menu in your characters eyes allowing them to select the guns they want more advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places vandalism is a very serious crime in the counterstrike series so elite counterterrorists are deployed to stop them unfortunately for the terrorists they are dumb and only packed one bomb however the counterterrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb so the terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend in some maps the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and lowlevel desk jockey in a building the counterterrorists have been deployed to save one not both of the hostages in reality this is just a thinlyveiled excuse for the counterterrorists to murder the terrorists while pumping rounds into invincible hostages one weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a hostage rescue kit which somehow gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your characters shoulders when your character wears a kevlar vest every part of your character except the head are made out of steel therefore the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head this can be annoying at first but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a characters body overall counterstrike global offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on earth even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with parkinsons disease you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic its worth picking up and i highly recommend this game

first off gameplay is fun and challenging but after playing constantly gets a bit bland next up the real reason im writing this is for the skin system i hate it like its horrible and people have lost to much money on it i havent been trading for a while and my knife which was 250 is now 200 prices drop and theres a huge market crash right now just a message dont get into trading please save yourself skins arent worth it

its a good game but the community is very toxic if you do good youre a hacker and if bad or decent youre a loser well not everyone can be satisfied the skins are really cool a lot of people play this game but not too many people play it very seriously matt jaredsucks @eugenious however i would recommend this to friends so i can smash unranked noobs

as hard as it is to wrap my head around firstperson shooters counterstrike global offensive was unexpectedly one of the easier games to pick up and wrap my head around i was always afraid of competitive id never played a multiplayer match until about a month or so ago and i never expected much by way of nice attitudes from the community boy was i wrong bout 90% of the matches we hit had fair nice understanding and overall goodhearted players theyd understand if you made a mistake and would help you through it on occasion this game has its fair share of exploiters hackers and general douches who will act like  to you but theyre quite the minority from what ive seen

meet interesting people and knife them when they fail to wear headphones every summer this is hands down the most fun you will experience making 12 year old children cry without the risk of a restraining order listen to their prepubescent cries of omg h4x as an endless series of small children who all claim to have slept with our mothers fail to understand that the ak47 is perfectly accurate on the first shot and that awps can kill through walls 1010 would make the children suffer again

i simply cannot get enough of this game once you get bored of something there will always be else to play
recommended
waste of time
recommended
one of my favorite games i play it every day one of the only fps i like at the moment its really fair if you die its most likely your own fault and not by some cheap killstreak reward love the competitive matchmaking it also has dedicated servers with most of the mods from source if you like cs it is a must buy if you are not really good at shooters it can be fun to play arms race deathmatch and other random custom gamemodes can be really hard to get into though but the game has ranks that will match you with opponents with the same skill level if you put some time on it you will improve quickly 
recommended
i like this game and i highly recommend it to others because im cool like that

this game is so addicting its got such a different engine compared to other fps games so its really unique id say this is the best teambased game out there and nothing beats the adrenaline rush when in a clutch situation nothing

gameplay 55 matchmaking 35 mechanics 455 visual 45 optimization55 my pc isnt horrible but horrible pcs can run this csgo in a nutshell very good game like the other counterstrike series and is my favorite amongst them all the gameplay is great mechanics are amazing aswell although there are some bugs here and there game is geared towards smooth fps and gameplay rather then the graphicsvisual but still looks very appealing this game isnt pay to win in any aspect which makes it absolutely skilled based you can spend some money on it to get weapon skins which are 100% cosmetic and have no change on the game as a matter of fact some weapon skins just make the gun easier to see and can lead the player holding it at a disadvantage however there are some exclusive maps in operations that are sold in passes which cost money despite that the original maps are still the best in my opinion only thing i dislike about csgo is the matchmaking system sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesnt in csgo there is a competitive mode for getting ranked and playing 5v5 in classic mode style you can either play as a premade team which is up to 5 players partied up and ready to play or solo queue now dont get me wrong solo queueing is risky in this game and doing it is very ballsy you might get matched up with trolls players out of your skill level better or worse than you by alot you should probably get a team or at least 3 friends to play with that can help you improve in the game when playing competitive try not to invite friends that are simply friends and are not good at the game trust me they can lose you many games and possibly even get you demoted valve tries to keep you matched up with people around your skill level if you had a silver 1 lowest rank and a global elite highest rankpremade they will likely be placed against nova or guardian ranks averageish ranks game can be frustrating sometimes but remember teamwork is key getting a random solo queue team that youre playing with to follow your strats will practically win you the game yelling at your teammates or being toxic isnt going to help if you dont feel comfortable or simply want to play the game for fun and not getting ranked there is casual casual is basically where you can just have some fun  if you want to get better read guides on the internet and practice practice and practice deathmatch is good for getting your aim down and community aim maps are good too there are also community servers for multiple gamemodes note while playing csgo you can get drops in the game you can then sell them on the market and they can get you some small change which you could later spend on some cheap skins if youre lucky you could get some crazy skins worth quite a bit but thats very unlikely yes this does mean you can make profit and trade in this game

looking for a fun way to make money off of a game you will enjoy playing with your friends well look no further because counter strike gloabal offensive is just the game for you you can get weapon skin drops worth some money but you can also get case drops and open those by buying a key yes you can end up getting a 4 cent skin but there is also a possibility of opening a case and getting a $400 knife its not easy though its all based on luck of the case opening i myself have gotten great skins from case openings but thats not all the gameplay is great i love the competitive and deathmatch modes but this game i give it 1010

this is by far one of my favorite games of all time and in my opinion the pinnacle of first person shooters counter strike has always achieved elegance with simplicity the mechanics are seemingly simple but the learning curve is massive and incredibly extensive making this game addictive and enjoyable also being made on the source engine the game is very stable and well optimized in all aspects networking gpucpu usage etc

bring back a classic shooter and add in high definition graphics the counter strike community just never dies

csgo also know as counter strike global offensive is a very competitive game with ranks placing you in a certain skill group it is a 5v5 tactical first person shooter that involves counterterrorists trying to prevent the terrorist from planting the bomb the other game mode involves the terrorists trying to prevent the counterterrorists from rescuing the hostages with many weapons to buy every round with money that you have earned from the previous round this game is very diverse although the game can be very stressful at times it is a great game to have fun with friends this game is by far my most very favorite game ever

well i made an earlier review but it was not a justified one counter strike global offensive has to be a different and refreshing alternative to the most popular fps games such as call of duty and battlefield keep in mind cod has its pros and cons but to a experienced gamer in both fps games and their change from smaller maps and guns you unlock through leveling up through cod to the bigger maps and same type of system in battlefield these two gaming franchises have huge similarities but small differences they both have their small and big maps with different gamemodes but the small differences with being able to use vehicles in battlefield where you call in killstreaks to gain an advantage through a small period of time throughout the match but when it comes to counter strike or any valve game in particular it is based on the knowhow and people skills also the teamwork aspect unlike call of duty and battlefield where you could just pwn then noobs all by yourself and go rambo valve games focus on winning the game through teamwork which now adays is used to win games in cod you basically point and shoot where you aim you fire same with battlefield but when it comes to csgo you cant just go in guns blazing without controlling the recoil and bullet patterns to me cod and battlefield are entertainment but counter strike it is an art a skill

best game ive played so far matchmaking can be a bit unfair sometimes but that doesnt matter if you just become better each time  at first it was hard to learn how the new system worked compared to css but after times and times of playing i enjoy it more and more also the fact that u can play matchmaking without going to a website like enemy down and esea is fantastic cause now more people will play competitivly and will add more fun and mix to the game patrico out

death is a great teacher failure in counterstrike global offensive is as it always has been for this series the greatest way to learn where you should have gone what you shouldnt have done and how you could have done better counterstrike players spend a lot of time learning  consequently they are always getting better growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years for the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continues pieces of the counterstrike formula are dated at this point but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim counterstrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard but the changes are for the best  the underpass choke point in de_dust for instance has a new escape route even in the face of genre evolution global offensive doesnt care to adapt csgo is so dedicated to counterstrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in global offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters everyone is limited to what they have and can see with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages running and gunning is a useless play style even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill walking crouching or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fire consequently killing in global offensive feels good theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim if players arent watching corners providing covering fire or using smoke grenades and flashbangs theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman the desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better team if youve played counterstrike before global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counterstrike like counterstrike source before it global offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter while doing little to disrupt the core form and function at the same time it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic too theyre particularly useful during demolition matches which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between the new and modified maps in this mode arent as big as classic counterstrike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever the lake map is a standout  theres a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots to separate demolition from defusal players cant buy between rounds instead it takes a cue from the other new mode arms race in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly the better you do the more you have to switch up the way you play and because demolition is so fast youll need to be quick on your feet unlike other game types arms race allows for respawns its the most chaotic and carefree mode in global offensive with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible its a shame there are only two maps in arms race  a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than pc if you have the option playing the pc version is unquestionably the best way to experience counterstrike global offensive mods mouse and keyboard and the usual pconly options are better than the ports plus valve is much better about longterm pc support  it abandoned team fortress 2 on consoles and portal 2s level editor was pc exclusive if you prefer to play on consoles global offensive is the same great game with the following special bits playstation 3 for those who want to play on playstation 3 but dont want to deal with the imprecision of analog sticks counterstrike go supports mouse and keyboard giving it a pretty noticeable edge over the xbox 360 version if youre feeling saucy move is another option although nuance dies with the motion controller move is accurate and your quick reflexes will score kills but the unavoidable instability of holding a remote will give your cursor some seriously unpleasant wobble worse moving the wand quickly can confuse the controller which often and irritatingly misinterprets basic leftright looks as a want to turn around 180 degrees xbox 360 aside from the lack of keyboardmouse input the xbox 360 version of global offensive is functionally identical to that on ps3  the new radial userinterface on both platforms is as elegant as it is on pc because its a hardcore competitive game counterstrike blocks party chat in an effort to combat cheating forcing players with headsets to play with friends or brave the wild west of obscenity that is xbox live the verdict global offensive is definitely a counterstrike sequel  it looks and feels familiar with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players this is a demanding skillbased multiplayer game thats as satisfying now as it ever was but its for a specific kind of player if youre not willing to learn to play different than youre used to look elsewhere otherwise this is a toptier tactics game that will probably share the longtailed legacy of its predecessors

gameplay 55 matchmaking 35 mechanics 455 visual 45 optimization55 my pc isnt horrible but horrible pcs can run this csgo in a nutshell very good game like the other counterstrike series and is my favorite amongst them all the gameplay is great mechanics are amazing aswell although there are some bugs here and there game is geared towards smooth fps and gameplay rather then the graphicsvisual but still looks very appealing this game isnt pay to win in any aspect which makes it absolutely skilled based you can spend some money on it to get weapon skins which are 100% cosmetic and have no change on the game as a matter of fact some weapon skins just make the gun easier to see and can lead the player holding it at a disadvantage however there are some exclusive maps in operations that are sold in passes which cost money despite that the original maps are still the best in my opinion only thing i dislike about csgo is the matchmaking system sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesnt in csgo there is a competitive mode for getting ranked and playing 5v5 in classic mode style you can either play as a premade team which is up to 5 players partied up and ready to play or solo queue now dont get me wrong solo queueing is risky in this game and doing it is very ballsy you might get matched up with trolls players out of your skill level better or worse than you by alot you should probably get a team or at least 3 friends to play with that can help you improve in the game when playing competitive try not to invite friends that are simply friends and are not good at the game trust me they can lose you many games and possibly even get you demoted valve tries to keep you matched up with people around your skill level if you had a silver 1 lowest rank and a global elite highest rankpremade they will likely be placed against nova or guardian ranks averageish ranks game can be frustrating sometimes but remember teamwork is key getting a random solo queue team that youre playing with to follow your strats will practically win you the game yelling at your teammates or being toxic isnt going to help if you dont feel comfortable or simply want to play the game for fun and not getting ranked there is casual casual is basically where you can just have some fun  if you want to get better read guides on the internet and practice practice and practice deathmatch is good for getting your aim down and community aim maps are good too there are also community servers for multiple gamemodes note while playing csgo you can get drops in the game you can then sell them on the market and they can get you some small change which you could later spend on some cheap skins if youre lucky you could get some crazy skins worth quite a bit but thats very unlikely yes this does mean you can make profit and trade in this game

its an okay game i guess but the only thing that really keeps you engaged is the extremly toxic community they will yell at you for absolutely everything and its hilarious you got 4 kills but couldnt pull off that 5th to ace the enemy team as the last guy wow you really suck at this even i could have done that says the dead guy are you at the top of the leaderboards and die from one mistakejust die from bad luck god youre so bad it amazes me that youre at the top says the guy at the bottom its even more hilarious when you call them out on their hypocrisy they either go into denial or even just ragequit or when a guy at the bottom with no kills 5 rounds in acts like hes a savant at csgo and tells everyone else how much they suck and they will always try to blame hacks always 10outta10 never change <3

global offensive surprised me very positively i only bought the game so i could join friends when they invite me again  but after playing a few rounds on the competitive gamemode i really started to like it been of lot of fun since then and i highly recommend it

if youre someone who enjoys fast paced precision shooters than you will love this game
recommended
great game classic shooter really strays from the modern millitary shooters we have today the community has a large ammount of veteran players that are often rude but the game has to go down in history as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time due to its attention to detail where the bullet lands is an important role in this game and just because you get the jump on someone does not mean youre coming out alive
recommended
fun game to play with friends 
recommended
best game i play it every day

i ing hate this game no other game has provided me with the upmost anger and irritation than this piece of  alas i keep coming back for more due to some sick masochistic spell this game casts over all who dare venture into its depths

recommended
what a game epic
recommended
counterstrike has always held a special place in my heart so it may be hard to speak without bias that being said if you are looking for a competative first person shooter this is your game it is no call of duty where blood distorts your view its no battlefield with explosions all around you it is a highly refined competative first person shooter the phrase easy to learn hard to master could not apply anymore to this game the controls are simple the maps are easy to learn but the tacticts teamwork recoil compensation and economy are something that may take you years to master the game has a huge competative scene with multiple tournaments with prize rewards in the hundreds of thousands every year the difficulty of the game and the rewarding feel of getting an ak47 headshot are something that never go away highly recommend 1010
recommended
this game isnt really like cod bf or even arma but if you can learn how to play this game might end up being your most played game
recommended
i love playing this game
recommended
if your gonna to awp remember to keep calm and take time to aim properly v if your gonna scout just remember jump snipe is effective ^^ if your gonna m4a1s just remember to hold down ur mouse and squat if your gonna ak47 just tap no really > if your gonna compyplease learn to play  study the map before you join competitive  <
recommended
as expected from valve a very well made and balanced game where being skilled rewards you it has a side economy consisting of skins to your weapons and different knives that you use in combat gr8 game vovlo r8 88 m8

its an alright game havnt played it that much maybe a few hours
recommended
 funny angry russians  cooler knifes only costs about 400$  many chickens

if you like competetive gameplay this game is for you if you like good physics this game is for you if you like to kill chickens this game is for you if you like to use p90s this game is not for you
recommended
this is a ok for right now could be a lot better csgo has changed a lot i first off enjoy the game because of the competiveness and the skill that is needed but they are a few problems like hit dections and the rekt9 the new meta of the game run and gun should not even be in the game lets say you have a guy who is good with an ak he misses his headshot because the guy is running with a smg jumping around in theory the guy with the ak should have killed him but no since the spread of bullets when running is like a circle the guy with an ak is died that most often happens in the silvers also not to mention there are a bunch of cheaters in this game i think valve really has to step up there game with the cheaters because they are a lot out there they are ruining the game for people also the smurfs i have found a solution for this the reason why people smurf is because they dont want to play with cheaters it is like a circle if there is a cheater in the higher ranks the guy who is not cheating will want to buy a smurf so he doesnt play with cheaters if valve steps up there game with cheaters then they wont be any smurfs now back with the run and gun the rekt9 is the most over used gun in my opinion you dont even have to aim for the head because you mostly are going to get a headshot with it also the most over used gun in the silvers is the p90 i dont see a lot of p90s the reason why i hate it it is because the moving spread of the p90 you also have 50 bullets basicly you and just spray with it that is my review if there is a update of csgo with the meta change i will update my review
recommended
i love play this game an awesome game

a great list of good things about this game  get called a hacker after a killing them  have expensive knifes and if you have a low priced knife you will be called a noob but if you have a expensive one your good or used your moms credit card  you can get easily unlucky unless you play with friends who all have mics and understand the game actual good things  team cooperation  smart players who can rekt them all and will be with you all the way  helping you feel better when you get rekt  cheap trading cards for badges  you can make enemies and very good friends some friends will just make you play better
recommended
kills a chicken gets 1 point doesnt bother with players and only kills chicken
recommended
very fun but needs skill and patience get some friends to play competitive since not all people in the community will be to your liking 
recommended
if you get ever matchmaked with the russians open up your console and type voice_enable 0 that really helps ranking up or you can talk with the chickens and not rank up
recommended
if you like css i would reccomend getting csgo the game is a much fancier nicer and smoother version of css the matchmaking in my opinion is fairly well balanced the only problems with the matchmaking is purely that people go into groups with much higher stat guys which can sometimes make the game seem unfair the ui is simpler and nicer then css my favorite aspect of the game while sometimes looked down upon is the inventory system yes it has been called tf2 for having skins but they are purely cosmetic and not only that they look absolutely amazing i talk all the time about how i want that amazing skin or how i actualyl preffer a gun just because of its skin their isnt a billion different guns where as hats ya know and most of them are obtainable without even spending a dime stattrack being my favorite makes the game a lot more fun will i get a new skin will i be able to sell the skin and save for a cheap game secondly i enjoy the simplicity of competitive i never quite understood how to do comp in css and always played dm or another type of gamemode csgo makes it easy select competitive or want a different gamemode just select it and wait while waiting doesnt sound the greatest it is very nice get a snack talk plan etc gives time to think through and get friends i rate this game an 810 and would deffinetaly get it

the game is very strange to me the gameplay mechanics the maps the coordination the matchmaking and the fun past times game modesall beautiful but if because of the people who play it the game takes the downfall more and more people hack and smurf and they are not letting the new begginer players even play the game and going 5 minutes without eating sit valve of course wont be able to 100% fix this for because if they did fair players would suffer too so get yourself atleast a 3man premade team b4 u start anything and pray that noone bad i waiting for you on the other team just cause of the bad community its a 610

this is by far one of my favorite games of all time and in my opinion the pinnacle of first person shooters counter strike has always achieved elegance with simplicity the mechanics are seemingly simple but the learning curve is massive and incredibly extensive making this game addictive and enjoyable also being made on the source engine the game is very stable and well optimized in all aspects networking gpucpu usage etc

counter strike want a game where you cant actually play with people at your skill level because that would make it enjoyable no no no you get little children buying as many game keys as possible just to take the easy shots and easy wins so they dont have to face someone near their skill level so if you like being bent over and ed with gabes vitual  get amongst this game you will love it get ed by awps m4s aks you name the gun and valve will apply lube to that barrel and just go to town 1000 hours ive burned into this game since it came out all to get hacked by some kid who cant handle using game sense good game ruined by hacks and micro transactions well done valve well done

this is a very fun game

i am not a great fan of pfs online cs go is my total exception especially because its my money grabber that feeds my steam wallet with some euros enough in time to buy games in special deals still you will find the community in this game to be erratic youll find nice people in one side and complete  bags in the other that think theyre the best players in the game just for you to find out theyre trolling you and cheating hard if you dont have the stomach consider yourself warned play this for fun and be nice to people if you do that the matches tend to be a wonderful experience and better according to the teams mood believe me

this game was cool untill i went to competitive modeafter playing this game you will know all russian swear words full of russians who wont communicate with you and only yell suka suka idi nahhui etc you cant get out of silver once you get in therethere are lots of guys who are smurfsspecially when the sale is onthere are lots of guys who have only 16hrs of cs or even 10hrs  most guys dont have sounddont know how to soundalways going to wrong plant when bomb is planteddont understand anything about this game and wonders how enemy is knifing him from behindcalling everyone who kills them hackers and then attacking teammates because they want to get kicked i find this game fun until you have great team who are trying to win the game not give up on after losing first round 1 annyoing thing is that when you go duo rank with someone you will always get guys who are unranked or dont understand anything about this game in your team and enemy team has 4 premade even with clantag or just very good players imoin my opinion counter strike should make something like this if you have under 50hrs total of csgo you cant go competitive mode if you have under 20hrs of actually playing in game vs real enemys you cant go to competitive mode i love this game but i hate the matchmaking systemim still going to recommend this game because you can actually sometimes laugh how your teammates who are very bad are playing

death is a great teacher failure in counterstrike global offensive is as it always has been for this series the greatest way to learn where you should have gone what you shouldnt have done and how you could have done better counterstrike players spend a lot of time learning  consequently they are always getting better growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years for the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continues pieces of the counterstrike formula are dated at this point but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim counterstrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard but the changes are for the best  the underpass choke point in de_dust for instance has a new escape route even in the face of genre evolution global offensive doesnt care to adapt csgo is so dedicated to counterstrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in global offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters everyone is limited to what they have and can see with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages running and gunning is a useless play style even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill walking crouching or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fire consequently killing in global offensive feels good theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim if players arent watching corners providing covering fire or using smoke grenades and flashbangs theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman the desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better team if youve played counterstrike before global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counterstrike like counterstrike source before it global offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter while doing little to disrupt the core form and function at the same time it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic too theyre particularly useful during demolition matches which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between the new and modified maps in this mode arent as big as classic counterstrike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever the lake map is a standout  theres a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots to separate demolition from defusal players cant buy between rounds instead it takes a cue from the other new mode arms race in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly the better you do the more you have to switch up the way you play and because demolition is so fast youll need to be quick on your feet unlike other game types arms race allows for respawns its the most chaotic and carefree mode in global offensive with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible its a shame there are only two maps in arms race  a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than pc if you have the option playing the pc version is unquestionably the best way to experience counterstrike global offensive mods mouse and keyboard and the usual pconly options are better than the ports plus valve is much better about longterm pc support  it abandoned team fortress 2 on consoles and portal 2s level editor was pc exclusive if you prefer to play on consoles global offensive is the same great game with the following special bits playstation 3 for those who want to play on playstation 3 but dont want to deal with the imprecision of analog sticks counterstrike go supports mouse and keyboard giving it a pretty noticeable edge over the xbox 360 version if youre feeling saucy move is another option although nuance dies with the motion controller move is accurate and your quick reflexes will score kills but the unavoidable instability of holding a remote will give your cursor some seriously unpleasant wobble worse moving the wand quickly can confuse the controller which often and irritatingly misinterprets basic leftright looks as a want to turn around 180 degrees xbox 360 aside from the lack of keyboardmouse input the xbox 360 version of global offensive is functionally identical to that on ps3  the new radial userinterface on both platforms is as elegant as it is on pc because its a hardcore competitive game counterstrike blocks party chat in an effort to combat cheating forcing players with headsets to play with friends or brave the wild west of obscenity that is xbox live the verdict global offensive is definitely a counterstrike sequel  it looks and feels familiar with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players this is a demanding skillbased multiplayer game thats as satisfying now as it ever was but its for a specific kind of player if youre not willing to learn to play different than youre used to look elsewhere otherwise this is a toptier tactics game that will probably share the longtailed legacy of its predecessors

as a recent master race convert i have no words to describe how irrtated i am at myself for never owning a counter strike game before wow no fps can currently touch this in terms of the playing field and skill based competition you are getting owned by someone they are better than you you keep getting killed in the same places stop going there or shoot better use your brain clutch like a king and ensure you have a headset a superb competitive game thanks valve
recommended
to anyone coming from cod and thinking they can dominate in counter strike like you can in cod youre sorely mistaken this game has a much higher skill level and is extremely difficult at first however its so rewarding when you can finally pull off the headshot in only one bullet like everyone else buy this game if you want to see how the first multiplayer fps has evolved
recommended
very addicting always fun to play

csgo best shooter game in the world       valvethank u
recommended
i recommend csgo to veteran players and beginners alike as the game has a balanced community you can meet people who are complete s yet find some that are rather tolerant the graphics are ok for a game that was pretty recent and maps created by the community are also playable if youre aspiring for an competitive environment this is the place for you

a game that requires precise aim and strategy certain consequences will follow if you do not follow the code of conduct good luck & have fun see you on dust2
recommended
great game this game is very fun but if you are a fan of cod this is a very different sort of fps with this fps there is no zooming in unless the gun you have has a special sight there are very kind people on it and you can make so green with the crates too very addictive but when you are not in the mood it is very boring with this game instead of earning weapons with levels like most fps do this you earn money every round and you spend that on your weapons great maps though some can get very boring because it is over chosen cough cough dust ii i would say the only downside is you need to be online there is no single player mode overall great game great price can make a fair amount of money through it and is very addictive

this game what can you say about it is coubter strike one of the best games of all time in my opinion absolutely by far the best fps shooter there ever was i have played many games many of which were fps shooters the classic 007 golden eye for the n64 the original doom quake and so fourth all great games counter strike brings something different its all player vs player just your team vs the other team tactics movement angles reaction mind games strategy teamwork communication economy weapon recoil smokes flashes and nades and more all have an emence amount of importance in this game if some one fails to take into consideration all of that it can cost your team the round its a game that can be played fast its a game that can be played slow always having to think of what the other team might be doing you have to figure out your enemy as soon as possible so you can hold the right angles play better positions change it up but it has to work or its for nothing when it does knowing you outsmarted or at least figured your enemy out for one round as you watched them fall apart as a team is so rewarding and thats just one round more if you are lucky no match is the same your skill is tested every time you jump into one you might have to clutch some rounds for your team the pressure is on you pause a moment in mid doors to collect yourself before you try and retake b site 1v3 your heart will skip a beat or two there will be times you are shaking as you want so badly to clutch for yourself and your team and when you do there is no greater feeling in any game your team will congradulate you and maybe cheer you will be shaking but smilingmaybe a fist pump you just used all of the above in a few seconds time to win the round for your team and possibly save the match this is the game i will always come back to this is the game i will never stop playing as long as people play it get this game

coming from cs16 this game is an amazing step up from the last simply a fun and competitive game lives up the old expectations of any fps gamer all i could wish for is a less trashy community but i guess that could be said for any game and the skins the skins are a copy of tf2s market either the skin is extremely expensive or worth nothing but aside the gameplay is nearly perfect

i do recommend this game but i only have one problem which is the temp cooldown the problem with the temp cooldown is that when i was in a match with one of my friends on competitive he decided to teamkill and our team kicked him and even me so when i returned to the main menu i noticed that i had to wait 7 days until my next competitive match and my friend that was team killing got a temp cool down for 24 hours fixthecooldown

it sure pisses you off but thats a good sign the game is awesome

im not one for first person shooters but this is awesome csgo is much a game of skill as it is teamwork you are playing as either terrorists or counterterrorists with a wide range of weaponry avaliable to both sides the maps are diverse and the gamemodes extremely enjoyable and fun if this review isnt selling the game enough check out wwwyoutubecomimanderzel and watch some of his vids also ive racked up over 30 hours within 2 weeks of buying the game thats how much i love it
recommended
great game really enjoy it
recommended
one of the best of the cs series sure the first cs is the leader of them all but csgo just puts the series onto a whole new level it proves that source can give amazing graphics as well as incredible gameplay and it shows that cs will never die out i think this is an amazing release made by valve and its worth every penny edit oh and to add this review was made before release date of csgo  this is to prove to the people who dont believe me when i say i was in the csgo closed beta
recommended
its ok do not buy keys never ever
recommended
how could one stray away from the a game series that revolutionized the fps genre it isnt very different than any variation of cs however updated weapons maps gear and graphics make the game a lot more diverse that its predecessor the gameplay is beautiful and the animations are great the multiplayer keeps you coming back for more with its numerous different gamemodes not to mention its just as fun offline in my personal opinion i would give the game a 8510 i hope this reveiw was helpful to all of you reading
recommended
easier to play than other counter strikes more weapons better graphics best counter strike title to date
recommended
readlly fun best game i ever played p xd
recommended
your typical point and click game for kids you can also play it to recieve some nerf gun skins and sell it to other kids for real money
recommended
this game is like 16 and source with balanced sprays valve servers and pretty good matchmaking play this if you have nothing to do in your life anymor because you cant master this easily
recommended
yes i recommend this game because you find skins fun has great graphics
recommended
very good game reccomended d
recommended
really foon
recommended
a great cross between 16 and css with constant updates from valve and the in built match making this has the potential to be the fps of choice for 2014 on pc forget cod and bf its time for a cs uprising
recommended
its the most advanced remake of the all time favourite massively multiplayer fps game counter strike the gameplays are fairly imrpoved some character animations are added all the previous maps have been given a graphical facelift users can play in diferrent gaming modes the competitive mode is even more challenging it provides you with a rank based on your skills you can buy skins for your weapons from the workshop afterall this game is an old wine in a new bottle its not a sequel its an updated version of the previous cs updates are not bad though its a revamped way to utilize the magic of cs
recommended
this is one of the best fps i have played it is awesome <3
recommended
very good game csgostar
recommended
i mostly love this game because of the new competitive mode if you want to know more about it read the first paragraph if you want to know about every other game modes read the whole review  with the competitive game mode counter strike became one of the most interesting intensive and thrilling fps game competitive game mode is about to play 5v5 matches with your team where you need tactics skills and knowledge of the game maps and spots there are a maximum of 30 rounds  competitive game the team that wins 16 rounds will win the whole match if your team wins members of the team climb up on a virtual ladder winning more and more matches may get you better ranks by the time and with ranks of course harder enemies in the future matches when you are playing competitive mode every step move and shot matters a fault can easily loose you a round out of the 30 or a better shot or lucky move can get a win for you and your team even it makes pressure on you to prove your skills you have to stay calm to be able to do your best play it with friends make a clan and create one of the best team or just solo queue for the matches you will enjoy the game except when you get bad team mates with zero tactics the second new game mode is arms race still you can select what team you are in but it isnt really matter there are arms race specialized maps unfortunately only a few where you start with an smg and every kill brings you a new weapon you have to be the fastest to fight yourself through every weapon and get a kill with every one of them the last one is a knife golden knife in this game mode if you manage to get the kill with the knife before anyone else you win the match this game mode is fastpaced and excellent for some fun and stress beating the 3rd one is the demolition mode you can play the classic game on smaller maps with only one bomb site combined with the element of arms race what means every round you get frag makes you jump on the next weapon in the next round ofc there is the old game mode called casual where you play the classic maps with huge teams and there is a dm where you can select what weapon you want to play and then go and kill the enemy team members until the time goes down and the round ends i recommend this game for every fps player you can play dm or arms race if you want some brainless shooting casual or demolition for short time playingcasual play ofc or competitive if you have more time to play and not scared for some team work thinking and ranking 
recommended
a very tactical game that offers a good experience for playing with friends and making friends all around the world by far one of the best fps that i ever played
recommended
quite a fun game has its ups and downs but i think its more of a good game than a bad game first of all the game is very tactical and is filled with alot of different ways to play but the most important part in the game is teamwork the game is best played when you have a couple of friends with microphones the competitive system in the game is quite fun matchmaking isnt terrible no netcode problems and really i have nothing bad to say except for the community the community of the game isnt harsh but sometimes you may meet with some people which will be a little y throughout the game and may ruin your whole multiplayer experience overall the game is wonderful and amazing i personally enjoy it and recommend it to those fps game lovers though be wary that the aim in this game is nowhere like any other game you dont have recoil but the ammount of bullet spray may get a little too much when you spray you gun rather than burst firing brilliant game great competition tactical online experience
recommended
a really nice fps for a good price
recommended
what to write as a review for this game well i started playing csgo just a few days ago with my bf and so far i have been called fing idiot r3tard and they even unsuccessfuly tried to kick me out of the server lol i never knew that only macho guys with tiny dcks played this game >< they all seem to think they are pros even though they know for a fact theyre playing withagainst noobs who are trying to learn and improve oh and did i mention they sure as hell cant play with girls what a bunch of cavemen m0rons so yeah i hope you find this helpful
recommended
great community i get called a  and people say im salty every 5 seconds <3 1010
recommended
its an okay game i guess but the only thing that really keeps you engaged is the extremly toxic community they will yell at you for absolutely everything and its hilarious you got 4 kills but couldnt pull off that 5th to ace the enemy team as the last guy wow you really suck at this even i could have done that says the dead guy are you at the top of the leaderboards and die from one mistakejust die from bad luck god youre so bad it amazes me that youre at the top says the guy at the bottom its even more hilarious when you call them out on their hypocrisy they either go into denial or even just ragequit or when a guy at the bottom with no kills 5 rounds in acts like hes a savant at csgo and tells everyone else how much they suck and they will always try to blame hacks always 10outta10 never change <3
recommended
global offensive surprised me very positively i only bought the game so i could join friends when they invite me again  but after playing a few rounds on the competitive gamemode i really started to like it been of lot of fun since then and i highly recommend it

if youre someone who enjoys fast paced precision shooters than you will love this game
recommended
great game classic shooter really strays from the modern millitary shooters we have today the community has a large ammount of veteran players that are often rude but the game has to go down in history as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time due to its attention to detail where the bullet lands is an important role in this game and just because you get the jump on someone does not mean youre coming out alive

could be the only fps that is truley skill based if you want to win you have to play smart know the maps and have wicked good aim and reflexes every kill feels like an achievement  every now and then youll play with people that will irritate the  out of you and play against people that you are convinced are hacking if you lose a match blame your team or the lag or the hackers on the other team  if you win a match the other team will blame their team or the lag they may call someone in your team a hacker oh and the virtual knives in this game cost more than real knives \o_o 1010 cola

a really good game that takes a lot skill to play but sometimes the physics of the game can really get on your nerves for example when you get shot once you become a lot slower than normal and will most probably die there are a lot of good aspects to the game including competitve play which enables you to be ranked against other players and there are good measurements put in place for team killers and people that rage quit overall a rteally good game that i would recommend

counterstrike global offensive or i am not playing
recommended
coming from the battlefield series i cant explain how good it feels to play a game that just works has good balance and netcode i havent had this much fun in shooters since ever

counterstrike global offensive is unboubtfully one of the most superb games i have had the pleasure to play i have dedicated 300 hours as of today and see anouther 300 and then another and another the game has a perfect it depends how lucky you are balancing system and has caused countless people to sacrifice their free time to play this game and its particularly addictive game mode one of my favorite being compititive which as an excellent game mode i strongly reccamend this game seeing as its stolen most of my joy and lively hood and caused more depression then a castration

pros   competitive gameplay  heavily teambased  fun with friends  international contests  betting  addicting skins system cons   you are not always matchmaked with good players  matchmaking system needs some tweaking  player stereotypes  eg  russians  they arent so bad after all  it gets a while to get the hang of the game and get used to the aiming especially if youre new  lacks some kind of reward system for high skilled players playing in high ranks conclusion  get this game play this game get addicted to this game
recommended
aim on the head shoots above aim below shoots above aim at feet headshot

are you a casual or competitive player well either way this game is for you very fun addicting and great to play with friendclan members in my opinion better than call of duty due to its life span and skins system

rugby union fans have been starved for authentic video game representations of their beloved sport for years now with the last truly strong rugby game being rugby 08 sadly rugby 15 is not the game to break the drought in fact its an utter disaster of all the various sports that share the football classification rugby union is one of the trickiest for newcomers to wrap their heads around thanks to a myriad of rules and complexities while scoring points is the same logic as other forms of footballgetting a ball across a try line or kicking a ball between goal postsconverting kickoff to try time involves a number of key set piecesthe team in possession of the ball can run as many phases as they like unless theres an infringement or they kick the ball when tackled the player holding the ball must release it as players from both sides pile in and form a ruck which can only be entered from the side scrums and mauls can be used to drive the ball across the try line or gain precious metres while lineout kicks are essential for gaining ground in short rugby union is a tricky game to learn and developer hb studios deserves kudos for condensing the complexities of the game into a relatively simple arcadestyle control scheme unfortunately for gamers hoping rugby 15 will be the gateway to understanding union theres a lack of a meaningful tutorial or any specific training modes for the various components of the sport instead youll have to learn by way of ten static training screens and ingame control reminders for the most part the controls are all very easy to come to grips with but it almost instantly comes apart after kickoff as i played it became increasingly clear to me that the gameplay stops and starts based on what the player is doing while its nice to be at the centre of the action it makes for boring rugby as both sides stand around waiting for you to act for instance at kickoff your ai teammates only start moving after youve fully completed the dropkick start of play and the kicker stands stuck on the spot for a second or two before being able to move even if you switch players immediately after kicking its impossible to perform cheeky tenmetre startsrestarts that give you the opportunity to gain possession and make easy groundsimilarly there were times when i pulled the ball out of the back of a ruck and just stood there watching the opposing team stand around oblivious to my possession until i took a step forward the best tactics were to deliberately relinquish possession to gain easy metres i found the most successful and repeatable tactic regardless of difficulty level was to perform a boxkick from the back of a ruck to gain ground as long as the kick stayed on the field and outside of the 22metre line where the ai will take a mark its incredibly easy to force a turnoverbasic tackling is as easy as guiding your selected player into the opposing player with the ball or any opposing player for that matter as you never seem to get penalised for tackling players that arent carrying the ball in fact outside of ruck infringements i rarely got penalised for anything forward passes were never noticed or penalised whether performed by me or the opposing team and offside penalties were only awarded about ten percent of the time as for ruck penalties theyre incredibly easy to avoid once the player carrying the ball is tackled you have to push the right stick into a predetermined sweet spot that rushes from red to yellow to green then you can take possession of the ball attempting to take the ball when the meter is red results in an instant penalty yellow is a risky grab that may result in a penalty and is surprisingly easier to get away with in hard difficulty while green is safe to grab except when the referee erroneously pings you from time to time for a legal grab the ruck mechanic is glitchy when in possession of the ball meaning i had to hit the right trigger to release the ball before attempting to play the meter game if i didnt do this rugby 15 stopped registering controller input for a few precious seconds this is a problem that plagues that playstation 3 version of the game more than anything else also outside of rucks given the specific way youre forced to ruck its best not to be in possession of the ball until youre within ten metres of the try line so you dont have to deal with the incredible frustration of losing possession because the game bugs out even on the supposedly hard difficulty its incredibly easy to win back possession in a ruck once you learn the rightstick sweet spot and perfect timing combination by far the biggest problem i had with rugby 15 though was that it rarely felt as though skill or tactics played into scoring tries when running with the ball you can flick the right stick up or down or twirl the stick around completely to sidestep opponents but even that mechanic only seemed to work sporadically for me the game seems to predetermine the outcome of specific plays before the animation occurs resulting in an inability to pass the ball if it decides youre about to be tackled or a lack of a sidestep if that stationary player in front of your guy is destined to take you down similarly partial ai control over the playercontrolled footballer means that sidesteps and fends automatically occur at the games discretion while players will regularly run off on their own accord even if they have the humancontrolled icon above their heads it feels more like rugby roulette than rugby unionwhen you eventually make it to the trialanderrorstyle tryscoring mechanic youll discover that there are two ways to score a try the first gameencouraged option is to click in the left or right stick to score a try this proved to be a risky manoeuvre though as fullspeed players had a tendency to dive over the deadball line resulting in a penalty even the opposing team was guilty of this on one occasion in an uncontested try opportunity the second guaranteed option for scoring a try is to run your player over the try line and wait to be tackled theres no option to get a player beneath a try attempt to stop them touching down the ball and a button for charging down a kick is sorely lacking while theres no sprint option stamina didnt appear to come into play despite its presence in the options menu and pursuing players rarely catch up to a running player even if their stats determine they should be able to there are rare moments where the intended gameplay formula bounces to the top of the heap and local coopcompetitive play improves the rhythm as it helps get around dealing with the atrocious ai local multiplayer has its own specific issues however particularly in regard to the weird system of tracking and switching players during coop its worth noting the game looks decidedly lastgen with dated visuals that can become confusing in certain matches where jersey colours are indistinguishable between friend and foe especially when you consider how frequently players flock in front and behind the offside line the playstation 3 version of rugby 15 is particularly ugly with a lower resolution darker presentation plenty of jaggies and a terrible frame rate to boot combine the unappealing visual presentation with the aforementioned game woes and the ps3 version is unplayable in its current formwhen you eventually make it to the trialanderrorstyle tryscoring mechanic youll discover that there are two ways to score a try the first gameencouraged option is to click in the left or right stick to score a try this proved to be a risky manoeuvre though as fullspeed players had a tendency to dive over the deadball line resulting in a penalty

an unforgiving competitive shooter that could be considered easy to learn but hard to master if you decide to try out csgo for your first time youre sure to diea lotbut that shouldnt stop you from learning from your losses csgo can be a frustrating and infuriating experience but it can be a rewarding one as well in csgo there are a couple different game types that you can choose from the classic casual and competitive matches centered around an attackdefend objective the more forgiving deathmatch in which you can use any guns and respawn regularly and finally the onceunique arms race in which you kill enemies with a given weapon and begin cycling through every weapon in the game one by one until youve gotten a kill with each as a beginner i found its best to start with deathmatch or arms race just to pick up on the mechanics of the game and its gunsbecause despite what it looks like csgo isnt your typical shooter this is a game that requires not only a steady hand and controlled shots but manipulations of the games intricacies just to control the recoil patterns of the guns its a steep learning curve but this can become a fantastic game for those that give it time if theres any advice i can give its to give yourself ample time to learn similar to a moba you wont learn everything this game has to offer overnightit just cant happen take your time figure things out one by one study your highscoring opponents and teammates and above all remember that its just a game and youre there to have fun and if all else fails just buy the zeus to run around electrocuting people

i never used to play cs go because i thought it was just another firstperson shooter ive never been so wrong in my entire life cs go is a tactical shooter its not about charging in and spraying people down the coordination between players and invidiual skill is what makes it such an enjoyable game players have to get those one or two headshots to kill an opponent or else theyll kill you first on a completely unrelated note this is like hat simulator skin simulator you can trade and buy skins to make your guns look cool but skins dont matter in the competitive scene for someone who enjoys firstperson shooter and wants an enjoyable game to play competitively and cooperatively i definitely suggest they check out cs go thanks for reading my review guys ^^ peace > > echo

counter strike global offensive is a challanging tactical first person shooter that doesnt only require skill but also inteligence the competetive multiplayer in this game is according to me the most enjoyable to watch the pros play and play yourself for countless of hours where every match feels like a new challange that you desperately need to beat if you are a person that enjoys shooters that require skill map knowledge intelligence and much more counter strike is a both great and cheap game for you

gameplay insanely realistic trained anti terrorists can not shoot unless they are completely still shotguns can be used as sniper rifles balance of weapons all weapons are very balanced especially the sniper that can 1 hit kill you anywhere but your pinky toe community friendly and forgiving except for the ocassional team of 4 smurfs and a hacker that seems to happen every game as well as the 2 members of your own team whocant speak englishare 7 years old 1110 would commit suicide again seriously though

i thoroughly enjoy csgo mostly the competitive aspect as i dont enjoy the casual gamemodes now although competitive is full of hackerstrollssmurfs it is an incredibly fun and engaging way to play it teaches you how to play and there are many helpful guides online the negatives if you have a team who dont communicate it is a large issue as you cannot give information about the enemy and disucss tactics also smurfers and hackers ruin matches but are vital in the learning curve of csgo as they teach you how to make better decisions and keep your cool as myself coming from mostly lol i didnt struggle to pickup the game and found it as a great way to relax in casual gamemodes or play competitively one large thing i didnt mention earlier is getting banned automatically for example you can become banned from kicking too many teammates which i think is ridiculous but is implemented so a few tips dont kick people unless you really have to and dont afkleave this will save you from some bans it requires you to be proactive with your learning of the game to find tutorials and learn from more experienced players to do things such as strafe shooting and headshotting if you can master these techniques you can do greatly the ranking system is slightly confusing but requires you to win many rounds and games successfuly to rank up it can become annoying but you will eventually rank up tldr great competitive scene easy to learn but hard to master buy this game if youre looking for an fps game that is unique and enjoyable to play with friends 910 1010 if hackers and smurfers were lowered but we all know that isnt possible

although a lot of stupid  antisocial and sometimes maybe cheating people run around in this game and unfortunately you have to play with then sometimes still it makes fun and wont let you go so easily for a long long time so beware of its addiction factor but maybe im one of the people described above dont let the game get to you so hard try to have fun and take it easy thats what i should consider more often

note this review contains a lot of butthurt this game is actually very good the community has nice people in it but there is still a portion of terrible people people ask me why i cant get ranked the answer is simple i get placed with teammates that troll and teamkill recently i played a comp game and this is the first thing i heard oh my god guys is this league of legends in a high pitched  voice at first i found this funny what happened next was not first eight rounds in a nutshell  my teammates call me a little  for telling them where everyone is ie they are at cat  my teammates start to kill each other  1 teammate leaves  the other team is having a blast killing my teammates who are not even trying  i get teamkilled several times the next eight rounds  another teammate leaves not before killing me however  another teammate starts to troll by throwing weapons in the air running around with knife looking at sky after the first half  another teammate kills me he leaves shortly after  another teammate kills me he leaves i am left all alone  i ask the other team to just knife fight me it doesnt go so well  my team i mean me cause i was the only one on my team now loses why do i still recommed this game well except for the  people like them it actually is quite a good game however you really need to play with friends if you play alone all the other people you play with will be  thats the reason they were alone they cant get any friends because they are mentally ill just stupid this is only in competitive however casual is quite nice because no one takes it seriously including myself so most of the time you actually get nice people who are just enjoying the game i would recommend this game if you dont want to play competitive cause its just a  of stupid asshats who think they are cool for  over some persons day

great game never thought this game would pull me away from my call of duty addiction all i ever played was search and destroy on cod but it isnt even close 30 rounds of highly competitive highly tactical and highly addictive gameplay from the originators of search and destroy how does it get any better it doesnt this is the best fps available hands down
recommended
ive played this game for a while and i will give it a 810 the gameplay is addictive and you find yourself putting actual money in for the skins and cases which dont actually affect the gameplay the only bad things about this game is the fact that high level players can easily buy an extra copy of the game and start at the beginning these players are called smurfs and they are extremely skilled players playing with newbs this makes the game kind of unfair because you are supposed to only play against people at or around your level but you just have to deal with it its still a great game with some great competitive fun

recommended
if i get global can i count that i complete that game
recommended
this is awesome  i love csgo and i play that every week  it has very good graphics from another counter strike games  like source  v 12 etc   very good and new weapons and another good for that game has many worlds  like train  season  workout etc   then has many kinds of game  like  casual   game with bots etc   i suggest that game for you because is the most multiplayer game ever  
recommended
it took my money and gave me a red and black assult rifle
recommended
very good games
recommended
such a great game everything is so awesome graphics gameplay everything my competitive wont work but still a great game if you could help me fix the problem please send me a friend request and we can talk about it i would rate it 1010 such a good game
recommended
i dont see the reason for call of duty being more expensive than this golden game
recommended
this game stands out from most other first person shooters as on this teamwork is really the key to success go up thru the ranks as the more time u play the better you get play with your crosshair size shape colour static dinamic loads to chose from all the classic css guns with modern csgo skins  wonderful and highly reccomended
recommended
prepare to never see sunlight ever again i r8 it 88 m8
recommended
this game is very fun to play with friends competetive is definately the funnest part and overall there is a clear reason to why this game is so popular

i looooove smurfs its a good that they can verify their awesomeness by playing with low silvers much skill very good
recommended
its so addictive you will not leave your room i forgot about breakfast and lunch last time and played from 11 pm to 7 am without stopping
recommended
what is a game 110
recommended
my original review was not too nice towards csgo but ive given it some time to get updated and whatnot and let me just say it has improved greatly it has become an excellent modern replacement to css there are servers for all players from noob to elite and theyre populated all day and night graphics options are top shelf and well optimized great job making csgo what it should be valve
recommended
even if your in global elite if you dont have skins youre classified as a scrub and you will be yelled at by angry 9 year olds 1010 would bang
recommended
i love this game
recommended
cool
recommended
the only game i am currently playing and the best one
recommended
makes you feel bad about your gaming skills 1010
recommended
looking for a fun way to make money off of a game you will enjoy playing with your friends well look no further because counter strike gloabal offensive is just the game for you you can get weapon skin drops worth some money but you can also get case drops and open those by buying a key yes you can end up getting a 4 cent skin but there is also a possibility of opening a case and getting a $400 knife its not easy though its all based on luck of the case opening i myself have gotten great skins from case openings but thats not all the gameplay is great i love the competitive and deathmatch modes but this game i give it 1010
recommended
nice game but please create another csgo only for russians cuz they ed up everything 
recommended
love this game
recommended
i think this game is really fun
recommended
most frustrating game evur how can i stop playing this
recommended
csgo is an awesome game its fun to play especially when you play with your friends if someone asks me if he should buy it i say yes
recommended
first hour playing and already got insulted 10\10

score information 910 graphic are awesome 910 voice acting with good accent make it more real 910 many available mode for you to play 910 user interface is good 910 learn other language faster than learning in university 010 for those who dont want this game  in a breeze i highly recommended this game dont give up at first it is hard to master well it is true in any kind of game go practice shooting at training_aim_csgo available in the workshop every pro and newbie come here everyday to practice shooting just like real shooting field 
recommended
>plays with 4 russian pepole >get kicked for not communicate i speak english when they speak russian >cries in corner for 4 weeks cuz my mission is not complete >drink russian vodka >dies from cancer 1010 would learn how to speak russian the best russian simulator 2k69  ign
recommended
i just play with bots xd
recommended
i like that communication is one of the most important thing in this game its fun to set up strategies and tactics to increase your chances to win its a team play game and thats what i like what i dont like is all the cheaters in the match making system and the rank system can be wierd sometimes
recommended
it s a good time consuming game  and a great plae to practice your flickshots

chase chickens shoot chickens 1010

csgo is probably the best shooter out there there are so many aaa shooters out there for example battlefield or call of duty every year there is a new aaa game like this and you have to spend 3060$ for this games for csgo you only have to spend 1015$ and a new counter strike game comes only all 812 years but you shouldnt start playing this game alone tell your friends and play with them so why should you buy the game it is very cheap you can play it with your friends you can earn money with it creating weapon skins bet on pro teams with skins or real money the csgo community is the probably biggest and best community there is out there  thanks for reading i hope you enjoyed my review  sorry for my bad english i am a german student

stephen hawking thinks ai is going to spell the end of mankind in the far future apparently but rest assured ladies and gentlemen play few hours of this game and youll learn that bots cant aim ai is incapable of replicating normal bloody shooting in a fps then we have a very long time before the end of humanity is upon us mrhawking my cat could shoot better than the artificial intelligence in this game
recommended
a fun addition to the counter strike series it keeps the beauty of the original with new graphics
recommended
nice game
recommended
to keep it short i once had a life now i dont and i still dont care because csgo is love and csgo is life and that is all you will ever need great thing its only 1399 euro if you dont count the amount of euros your gonna spend on skins and unboxings ofcourse further you shall find this game harder to learn but at the end worth it so much and it has a more mature comunity than the most ive seen looking at that every matchmaking i play people say good luck have fun and at the end good game thanks for playing and all that good stuff ofcourse there are trolls and people who refuse to talk english but that can be on every game just buy it why are you even reading this still

1010 would fuck again wait no hats

do i enjoy this game yes ive played a ton of cs 16 and css through my youth and i guess i was a bit sour about a new counter strike game i didnt like it in the beginning but i didnt give it a good try my friends forced me into a few matches saying you havent tried it i said okay and i do not regret one single hour of it the low cost and the nearly infinite amounts of hours of replayability its certainly a game worth playing if you yet havent played it its a game everyone can enjoy good or bad player hardcore or soft player its a challenge for everyone with their matchmaking system yes there are quite a few hackers due to the fact the game is so cheap but meh its still the best game i have ever played 
recommended
this is a highly skilled first person shooter with good community
recommended
played for a while very enjoyable game if you are not playing competitive with strangers otherwise full of screams s and trolls
recommended

storypresentation 8 there really is no story just a setting of two teams clashing at each other one being a team of terrorists and the other of counterterrorists based heavily on its previous games counterstrike global its look and feel of the game is graphically enhanced in so many aspects the game and feel makes it so much more intense when youre either trying to plant bombs or defusing or even when youre saving hostages or keeping them it does get slightly repetitive after a while but being it only multiplayer and online the experience is always different and fun even if playing with friends it also has really awesome weapon skins you can get in game but because of that mods arent allowed in this game specially skin mods the only complain i got is the server malfunctions at times its too constant and leaves you unable to play many times gameplay 9 it plays very well the gun control and balance to each one is very well spot on to choose a good one of your own liking team tactics are heavily used in this game specially with the buy weapons feature competitive mode is lots of fun and its very well set up with its ranking feature letting you spot you on where you belong depending on your skill in game even though i only have a gamepad i can tell its highly recommended to use a mousekeyboard to get really good at this game but im only gaming to have fun not to play competively overall 9 although the game can be pretty repetitive at times but its still worth coming back to play over and over again and its much better than most fps out there i have lots of fun in this game and i highly recommend it to anybody into fps

i played call of duty 4 profesionally but the game is kinda dead nowso i wanted to play another fps game to go tournaments make a team set a cool skins in my inventorythe csgo is 1st fps game now world widebut cod4 was epic
recommended
counterstrike global offensive is one of the best fps games ive ever played you will never get bored playing it over and over because everyday you will learn new tricks and tips which will upgrade your skills the best veteran part is the aiming it self i highly recommend to download training maps and train for your aim because its very important to upgrade your aiming skills in order to countinue processing this game basicly the game graphics is pretty nice with low amount of bugs the only issues are random votecalls by players ingame rusty and unfair ranking system overvalued items addiction i rate 1010

this games is realy realy awesome ^^

its a great game that has its downsides  you will 2 out of 3 times get in a team with flaming russians that are premade so you cant kick them  the ranking system is totally ed up win 8 games in a row and then loose 2 and get deranked  you will rage and throw your computer away but after that you will still get your  together only to come back and rage some more
recommended
shot a guy in the nuts with an awp and he instantly died 1010

one of the best games i have played in a long time
recommended
it is truly worth the money this next installment of the notorious counterstrike series takes it to an all new level featuring breaktaking nostalgia and even new maps to conquer along with weapons with different stats and skins your gun will be unique down to the very bone of your trigger finger dont miss out on this great game
recommended
the ultimate competitive shooter steep learning curve and a gigantic amount of fun 16 was a classic source was magnificent and this well lets just say it is a mix between those two update little things that i hate about this game that are still here  overpowered and cost effective pistols  round and bomb timers on competitive valve servers  64 tick on competitive valve servers  flashbangs still suck balls  hand grenades still suck balls  smoke grenades are still overpowered  maps are very constrictive  m249 needs buffcost reduction  shotguns should get some more shot  smgs deserve moresomething  movement is still more fast paced than previous counter strike games 810 unfortunately the game right now is all about the new skins and the new knives wow cool wow
recommended
the best mix out of source and 16
recommended
great game
recommended
210 would play again
recommended
russian accent ideot

i found this game to worth so much more than $15 to me it has become such a great investment both in terms of time and enjoyment 1010
recommended
this game is about many things one of the things is to switch your weapons back and forth thats 70% of the game the other thing that this game is about is spamming the f key thats 15% and the the other 15% is to use psycology tacticts and aiming to kill the enemy team with your team 900100 would spam f again

edit  after much playing time and at least 40 bucks put into the game its safe to say that i have fallen victim to this first person shooters cruel ways i cannot seem to help myself when it comes to unboxing no matter how much i tell myself its a game and how slim the chances are of getting an expensive knife to brag about i still find myself unboxing and unboxing its almost as bad as breaking an addiction to drugs it takes a good year to break the addiction and help from a few friends and by the time you have broken the addiction youre broke and miserable i couldve spent the remaining 10 dollars on my account on another game but next thing you know i find myself unboxing another crate only to earn an item worth five cents to someone who doesnt play csgo a few pixels ingame may not seem that valuable believe me i thought this too but once you start to play this game your credit card info is already being punched into steam and next thing you know youre doing a 20 crate unbox via livestream its so upsetting unless youre one of the lucky few who get something good you vow to yourself that you are going to quit but you are back and playing the next morning i must give credit to gaben for coming up with such a successful idea the fact that a man can make hundreds of millions from a game involving a few skins that dont affect game experience is amazing but once you realize the harsh reality of your purchases and such you start to feel as much misery and regret as a man who skydives from a plane only to find out he forgot his parachute now for the gameplay this game is actually fun if you can get through a week without getting yourself a seven day ban if youre an obedient player who respects teammates and never leaves games early then youre golden however if you happen to misclick and kill a team mate or the power goes out during a game youll most likely find yourself a nice fat competitive cooldown which is just a polite way of saying youre banned yes i know players who dont follow the rules should be delivered corresponding consequences but one can find themselves receiving a ban for some of the most peculiar reasons for example someone can be banned from playing for kicking too many players for starters kicking a player is majority rule so chances are if you decide to kick someone from a game theyre not doing diddly crap to help the team if you get enough of these dimwads kicked you pay the price for it kicking players for a reason is much different than kicking players for the hell of it which the game fails to understand from personal experience i have never gotten a seven day ban but i have known plenty of people who have from ways such as this most bans are well deserved but a few are unjust and unavoidable this game has a 0 tolerance policy towards the latter for a summary of things so far you pay loads of money to earn a few pixels and the ban system can be unjust at times but dont get me wrong  this game is far from bad in fact i would easily recommend it to someone whos into games this game takes time to master and actually involves skill along with strategy unlike many games today which strongly revolve around luck skill plays a major role in this game because without it youll wind up in the lower ranks of the game lastly i would like to talk about the community among the squeakers spoiled brats white kids who think theyre black neonazis and etc there are actually some pretty decent people you can meet if youre looking for a place to make friends this is the exact wrong place to do it however the community makes for an interesting experience which you can find no other place i make it sound bad i know but there are some very intelligent and bright individuals who you can learn a lot from ingame to wrap things up before this review gets so long i publish it and make it a novel i would like to say csgo is an expertly made game used to earn tons of money everyday while most of the review has a negative connotation i would like to say that this game is probably one of the best games you can find on the market today which is a major accomplishment considering all the competiton between nextgen consoles and new technology being released well done gaben well done tldr  while csgo may take your money and create mindblowing rage its still an addicting shooter with a simple concept which has unique perks that no other game has

this is one of the greatest competitive games of all time definetly the best competitive fps this game is an amazing amount of fun if you started playing in sourcein which case you probably own this already or if your a new player like i was first of all it is great to see you and your friends skill develop as you get higher up the ranks and you can sill have a good evenly matched game if you are in the lower ranks second of all the community of this game is pretty much endless and that means there are always new maps coming out and hundreds of custom gamemodes this game really diferentiates from other games on the market right now with its learning curve and skill cap if you dont own this game you are doing yourself a diservice and for 12 or $15 this game is a complete steal for the amount of hours you can put into it

csgo is a broken game with broken mechanics and broken gameplay much like volvos other love baby dota 2 although csgo will forever fail to match the unfathomable depth of trashtier into which dota so neatly fits where you are subject to internet russians clicking on you while hurling abuse and touching themselves at night amidst smurfs and angry eastern europeans one may find themselves wondering why they even bother to sink time into the game am i talking about csgo or dota you ask doesnt even matter dont matter how sht looks it all stinks in the end volvo pls pls 1010 would spend hundreds of pounds on again

recent intel reports suggests the likelihood of isis using csgo as a platform to train talented terrorists scout for new members and conduct trials for recruits they hide under common everyday aliases training 10 hours a day sometimes practising their hacking skills which explains why the servers will never truly be empty and this game will never truly die due to the underground growing population of isis during the process of training those rare skins earned by thousands daily are in turn sold illegally to the world for real cash to fund their terror operations as far as we know isis strategy & actions had been successful in globally offending everyone

this is an amazing 10 out of 10 competitive teambased fps for the pc that has all the emphases on team this game is nonstop action that requirs constant comunication and fast reactions this is no cod or battlefield this is hardcore no jokes the basic idea of the game is  5 on 5 terrorists vs counter terrorist the terroritsts have to plant a bomb on 1 of 2 bombsites the counterterorists need to either kill all the terrorits defuse the bomb or prevent the terrorests from planting the bomb in 2 minites easier said then done stay low move fast shoot first die lastone shot one kill no luck pure skill

pros  good graphics  balanced  good match making system  good trading community  steam workshop support  5 vs 5 combat  1st person shooter cons  people trick the match making system so they play with lower ranked people so they never get out of their tier  people troll and mic spam a lot  no single player  missions coins that you buy will permanently expire whenever valve wants them to so you can no longer play missions conclusion this game is a teambased shooter that has not single player missions it is a multiplayer only game this game has nice graphics that suit the style of the game and also has well made maps some maps are made by the community and so are almost all gun skins gun skins are very well made and are the little bit ion top that makes this game a lot better this game is nicely made and it mainly consists of 5 vs 5 combat with other people the only this that makes this game a little bit worse is the lack of help that is given whenever you report someone for being trolls and things like that overall rating 910

long ago exactly 359 hours ago of gameplay i was called forth by lord gaben he spoke of a world soon to enter our galaxy steam i one of the many chosen lined up row by row shoulder by shoulder inside of his commander room he stood before us wearing a jigsaw mask and said lets play a game before all went black upon the 100 hour mark i finally grasped the concept of the world the inhabitants of the world called it counter strike because the counter terrorist forces are trying all they can to counter the terrorists strike in this world of counter strike theres a raging war between two groups hence global offensive in my journeys i have kept note of everything i have learnt about this bizzar world there are many raging endless wars held in different dimentions with ten people in the battle the heart of the war lies in the sacred grounds of de_dust 2 over thousands of dimentions have been put up to hold every single battle of each ten participants but at times during the teleportation one can suddenly have a heart attack and end up canceling the twenty second count down to start the battle this happened to me too many times but i kept on going lord gaben made clones of himself using his shadow clone ability to monitor each and every battle managing them ever so properly from a birds eye view that feeling of being watched will never leave me nor the other chosen at the beginning of the battle you become able to summon a magical interface that allows you to select anything you want at the cost of money which you earn by completing objectives solve an equasion with the alien locatorlike calculator to plant it in the super secret sites known as a and b to sum it up the counter terrorists are basically aliens who plan to not only eliminate you with their overpriced weapons but to force you to join forces with them after the battle to strenghten their queen alien after 200 hours i noticed that as a terrorist after taking off my old mask and clothes that ive worn since the beginning of time i noticed that my skin was a very light green and underneath my black shades were pitch black eyes dear god at that moment i realised that terrorists were preditors but that didnt stop there one day at the 300 hour mark after hitting nova 2 they came oh gaben dear gaben no they were small blue and wore white robes as they held their mini pea shooters in their tiny arms it was them the smurfs i realised that it was this time of the year again the steam universal trade off where anyone could clone themselves to paricipate in the war of counter strike never have i been so frightened in my entrie life and on the other side of the battlefield were the legendary nip warlords of the game knights of gaben and the antibiotics of everything hell broke loose in this battle and i found myself getting beaten up by the yellow ninjas in pyjamas who resembed the bannanas in pyjamas almost perfectly then it hit me when they became terrorists one of them wrote on the tellekenetic mid 2 b i immediately knew their true identities the murderous bannanas in pyjamas 350 hours over and at this point i decided to open some of the cases i gained from air ships that passed by every morning only the ones nearby and away from everyone else dear gaben i heard from an old man that he became mentally distressed the moment he picked up an ak47 fire serpent factory new from a drop not because of the pure beauty of the gun no but because of the horrific amount of people who u wot m8 thats a gr8 b8 m8 give us ya lighterd him and now at 359 hours of play i realised that there are other people watching on gotv at that moment i knew the deadly and sorroful secret of the world of counter strike its a tv show hosted by gaben and millions of people are watching us right now watching your moves 1010ign waiting for counter strike isolation ready to kick some ct alien  910pc gamer well the could have done better with the drama 99100rock paper scissors just like rock paper scissors only with skyrim 1337 game informer love the romance element goty for sure

this game is ok with friends but randoms just suck there is no teamwork usage just like those who play cod for some reason no one ever buys wards and enemy team always ganks us as they plantdiffuse the bomb there are only 2 sides ct and t side and most maps are always t sided so we get rekt on the ct side plus the queen be saving all the money for her crumpits and tea so she raises the price of the guns on the ct side and we always poor like we in the struggle or something like wtf is up with that the t side got all the newest pairs or jordans and cts stuck with some ratchet walmart brand shoes treyarch better add a welfare system to this game or im not gonna put up with this no more my final verdict on the game is a 1010 could be better

counterstrike global offensive is a first person shooter that demands group strategy and communication in order to win i have played hundreds of hours and keep coming back for more the community can be discriminatory at times however there is always the option of muting a player the game itself updates frequently via steam which can cause delays in matchmaking but it only takes a few minutes my only qualm with csgo is the blatant lack of registry encountered in some matches it does not happen often but when it does it is frustrating overall i have played cs for 5 years and have met some talented playersfriends and wouldnt change it for the world for those of you interested in joining a good cause please visit the no troll group page for information on my anticyberbullying campaign i am the founder good luck and have fun

coming from a long history of 16 and division 1 competitive lan finals i skipped source i returned to counter strike after a long hiatus and am finding the game decent valve has done a great job of capturing the essence of what i loved about 16 and implementing it into their own game although some of the maps have changed some for the better and some for worse inferno mainly overall my experience has been positive and i have had a good time ranking up with my buddies from strokecity elpmeister he nem corn inzayn sponsored by ozbongs liam pain he nat go gym anymor he say diamond direktor he sell pill dumsan dumsan dumman feels berlin he always leav cal earli 4 sum reason i dunno and many more i find the game crispy salty not too greasy csgo is good and a buy  leonards food reviews

recent intel reports suggests the likelihood of isis using csgo as a platform to train talented terrorists scout for new members and conduct trials for recruits they hide under common everyday aliases training 10 hours a day sometimes practising their hacking skills which explains why the servers will never truly be empty and this game will never truly die due to the underground growing population of isis during the process of training those rare skins earned by thousands daily are in turn sold illegally to the world for real cash to fund their terror operations as far as we know isis strategy & actions had been successful in globally offending everyone

lovely game or so it was the game was excellent with amazing an unique game styles compared to cod or bf it was an addicting game until the smurfs hackers and grieferstrolls came about now csgo is a cluster of 1 team filled with idiots and that 1 try hard guy on the team while the other is a fullon hackersmurf sure is it fun to have a smurf on your team but the other team wont what point is there to the game if someone else plays for you overall the game is unique and fun but the s who smurf hack or troll pushes this game down

when i first got this game i was depressed by the overlygod players i even made a previous review saying it was 610 now after a year of not playing i decided reinstalling this game wow i love it 1110 gg valve edit 71914 this game the competitve match making and banned sucks we had a full lobby and just one person out of country and valve couldnt connect us to any match even after half an hour of trying then lets go onto their banning system it is not fair ive been doing great recently like 5 days without a ban i think that the banning system should lower down on the amount of days you get banned  on the amount of days you were good if that makes sense please valve this is such a great competitve game but you have to fix that edit 12614 vac banned csgo i love you i know i got desperate i was desperate to become better than my friends good enough to not be judged unfortunetly i got to greedy i decided to hack you just basic stuff wall hacks i know i got greedy i know youll never love me but i will always love you rip csgopickstarr 121614 1015 est i will always love you dear cs

recommended
it may be fifteen dollars but is a fantastic game for all who love strategic and fps games it is short combat 5v5 and has weapons from awps sniper rifle to negevs heavy fire machine gun and more it also comes with a different combination of grenades and pistols the only downside is that people tend to get serious over nothing but is still tons of fun so if you want to buy it then buy it because it is definitly worth fifteen dollars if you love any valve game or shooter game than this is the game for you
recommended
i have a love hate relationship with this game as do most people p

the best first person shooter ive ever played it has addictive gameplay i would say more but im not even sure if its good its just so addicitve  its the minecraft of first person shooters better yet i even managed to get my money back from buying the game i even got profit the ingame drops can be worth up to 2000 now that there should be enough reason to make anyone buy it its basically free and in some cases they pay you to play the game profit from selling drops it has an economy system great gameplay on loads of maps updated frequently with new maps and operations and workshop support for community maps and even the ability to make your own skins to appear ingame it also has custom game mods such as jailbreak and zombie escape if thats your sort of thing personally i prefer competitive gameplay its not just click play and casually kill people each round is like life or death you win you could get rankedup lose and it could be back to silver i of course not literally this is metaphorically speaking although it could be literal for some players you get cooperative teams where the people dont just shout at you or shoot at you most of the time its esports for everyone overall my favourite game on steam hopefully soon my most played it already would be if it wasnt for garrys mods loading times 1010 ps if theres any spelling mistakes complain to valve not me as there is no spellcheck and i often make mistakes while typing

it have 800 hours on it and are increasing by 90 everyweek i can feel my body decomposing because i havent showered in weeks because of this game 1010 would not shower again

a game tipically the romeo & julet complex two sides who hate each other enough to kill in the end boths side find out that its pointless to fight so they make a game out of killing each other as the generation go by the forget and it turns into the pc vs mac formula where they hate each other because it bacame a thing and they both benfit and the need to keep up apperances if you lucky you can catch them both in the house on sundays

this game is almost as good as bacon and that says alot

if youre looking for source with new graphics then dont buy this if youre looking for cs with a different feel and a more competitive atmosphere whilst maintaining its community then go right ahead
recommended
let me get this started using the 7 non sins 1 the ease of competitive use in this game is amazing having a rank system so that you can be placed with people of a similar skill and getting into a game without a 3rd party service 2    3 the game is constantly updated 4 valve actively supports the professional scene 5 the game is balanced 6 the game is cheap 7 there is no fecal matter smeared around the screen while playing
recommended
such an awesome game
recommended
pre ordered for $1250 valve will never release a game above $20 and half life 3 better not be above $20 hehehe anyway you need to play the game to get better and better although they almost made it like team fortress 2 when they put in items because alot of people started to care about how they look the game is fun but its hard to run it on lan the game is often on sale sometimes as low as $375 its good to see that valve has finally created a new game with the source engine they added new guns  effects new maps its a new counter strike but unlike call of duty you dont have to pay a rubbish $80 the competitive feature on this game is amazing on how youre sort of ranked based on youre skill level but not really because there is always that one guy on youre team smurfs and hackers so chase chickens 1010
recommended
better than cod xd
recommended
i love this game
recommended
i think that 50% of the people who play this game only have three words in there vocabulary noob kick and me
recommended
its running away from people with guns 55
recommended
its a fun game for sure but a little bit easy if you want a real challenge i would recommend battlefield or call of duty

your team has died the enemy team are briskly striding around the map sweat dribbles from your cheek as you carry your battlescarred awp a fellow team player who speaks russian yaps down his mic at you the timer is ticking and the bomb has been planted all 5 of them are camped at b car you can already witness all of them carrying p90s and you thought it was your time to strike you run in vigorously spamming your pistol but noavail you lie dead flat on the ground sighting your awp purloined your team decides to kick you and you have front row seats this game is absolutely fantastic although not for the lightheated the game is set during our modern day period around two rivals counterterrorists terrorists both of them fuel hatred between themselves waging wars of attrition to see who wins the round out of 15 you can also site other game modes casual  for beginners competitive i wouldnt recommend playing it first death match an effective way of ranking up and the two other game modes which people barley care about demolition a competitive clone and arms race who can hack the best to finish first sorry for my bad convincing skills another worth mentioning is the gambling yes thousands are sucked in and come out with nothing but but the right man at the right place can achieve a ultra rare skin called a knife skin a costley 300$ and up for each one will lead the lucky gambler to scream and fall out of his chair in delight waking his mom up at 3 am

some background information counterstrike  global offensive abbreviated as csgo it is the third game in the series after counterstrike and counterstrike  source it is a teambased tactical shooter lets get down to it this is not a game for people who merely wish to rack up immense kills or boast about their threesixty no scope headshot wallbang because this is no cod this is a teambased tactical shooter with many strategies and jargon counterstrike global offensive is not your average fps game sense and skill are very important when it comes to csgo what to expect out of particular opponents and the most likely situations youll be facing is a key part of the game if you wish to rack up kills run and gun and just barge into t spawn guns blazing with no plan this is not the game for you skill is the most important aspect and the most unique aspect of csgo and in any counterstrike game at that you will gun run and be outgunned but the most important part is to rise again and to learn from mistakes how did he get me what did i do wrong someone running around with an m4 and shooting every teammate in the face with a shot to the head does not necessarily mean hacks players can always be better and most of the time will be better than you so you need to learn to be better than them all in all csgo is one of the best games i have played the amount of teamwork and skill here is more than what i have experienced from other team based tactical shooters in short if you are looking for a hard to master easy to play competitive tactical based shooter pick this game up its very much worth it

ahh one of my favorite games i was never in to cs i bought css for the garrys mod content and whenever i tried to play it i would get destroyed even by bots i do admit i was terrible at the game but it really never appealed to me the day that i got csgo i went into it with the same mentallity and opened up a match of office with easy bots instantly i noticed the updated graphics and it looks good to this day i ran around for a bit and fired off a couple shots with my pistol then a bot came to try and ruin my day i fired at him rapidly with my handgun and he actually died if that would of been css my brain would of been merged with the wall and i would of been looking at the bots on my team walk into walls suprised with myself i carried on and made it to the second round alive i opened up the buy menu to find out the mp5 had been replaced rip neva 4get with the mp7 i bought it and looked for some bots to murder i managed to kill 2 of them before getting shot in the back with a shotgun while i groaned at myself for dying and having to wait for the remaining bots to duke it out i noticed that you could take control of the bots and play as them i was very happy with this feature at the time and i am still happy with it now after getting used to the recoil and spray patterns i saw a gametype called competive and i applied to a match of it it was on de_dust2 and i got a couple of kills by luck with my trusty mp7 i was amazed by how noob friendly the game was and how it had matched me with people of similar skill levels after that match i decided to go again and again and again if you are looking to get into a competive shooter that is mostly skill based get this game also it can go for really cheap in sales thanks for reading pyro the p90 exists

well if youre sick of 12 year olds on call of duty and you cant deal with the hard core veterans of battlefield then csgo is not the game for you i am constantly dealing with russian 12 year olds which are like a super version of the common cod 12 year old and you cant understand them and then theres the hardcore pro players who have never seen the light of day they are the best seriously i have never been called a noob so many times in one sentence all in all one of the best fpss ive ever played oh you thought this was a negitive review nah the satisfaction of killing these guys is insanely rewarding
recommended
when my friends tell me they want to buy csgo i always tell them its unlike any other fps out there the amount of practice and hours needed to play the game right is truly overwhelming to new players my friends always say what are you talking about man you just run around shooting people and that mindset is the biggest mistake you can make when trying to learn csgo the things that make this game great and distinguish it from any other fps are also the things that make players who come in thinking they just bought another call of duty quit after their first match saying they wasted their money you will spend the entire time youre playing this game trying to master recoil and spray control gain a prolific knowledge of the maps develop a mind for strategy learn to communicate effectively as a team learn grenade positions learn timing learn callouts learn crosshair placement etc the hardest thing for new players to accept is that there is always someone better than you you must have a humble approach to the game when first starting and be willing to learn from anyone this is the ultimate fps and is worth every penny spent on it but just beware that when you buy csgo youre probably signing up for a lot more than you realized

love the competitive side of this game awesome smoke spots crazy boosts and standing on your friends heads to get an awp kill oh yes the jumping scout spots this game is great unless you get it and go straight to competitive dont do it do not but at the same time it sucks how the community is seen as a bunch of avid gamblers between jackpot cases and betting thats what most people see cs as these days other than that great game 1110 gonna buy again

so after 200hr on csgo i have my first comment ready well it is fast paced which i really love cause you never know where the enemy will be next and fast response is required you have to train hard to become actually better so be prepared if you buy this gamesucces isnt given if you feel the crossahair isnt suitable to you change right away and try others  a map on workshop gives you that with no hassle a good team is necessary if you want to win game because cs is a teamwork gamenot a i go ego on myself i hope for a shot but if you want just fun get your friends in a laugh about fails and so on d and that is basicly it for the good things here but now the matchmaking system is horrible i recently got banned by 4 russians just because i wasnt speaking theyre language i mean wtf and valve responds with its automatically we cantthats crap they could if they wanted to smurfs and cheaters that just think they are awesome for beating up other people and opthey are douches in every wayplay fair cheaters and smurfs play in your league the keys are expensive in regards of the full game5 keys is one csgo copy i think they should be 1 eur at best all together i still can recommend the game cause i think its fun to play with friends laugh at the fails and just have a good time

counterstrike global offensive csgo for short its a sequel for the clasic shooter counterstrikesource and 16  the game its still folowing the same core gameplay like in the other games but csgo has better hitboxes than the other ones and its more polished the game started since 1999 15 and its still played this says allot about the reaplay value of this game the game its skillbased and its way diffrent than cod or battlefield there are no iron sights beside sg 553 and aug witch are still haveing allot of recoil the most famous maps like de_dust2de_nukede_infernocs_officecs_assault are back and even more balanced that they used to be in 16 or source the graphics arent great but this its a good thing because in this game you really need high fps if you want to play good at the ingame competitive mode the textures are preaty outdated but on the other hand shaders and antialiasing make the game look great even tough its runed on a 10 year old engine but masively modified source the game has its own problems like on the valve official servers the tickrate witch its a very important factor in a multipalayer shoooter game its 64 still more than bf4s 32 but still not enough  its perfectly fine if you play casual but on competitive its going to anoy you if you cleary hit a shot with awp or headshot with ak but then you see you actauly didnt do any damage cause the bullet didnt get registred for its price the game its very cheap  11 euro  15 dolars the game its underpriced in my opinion i would give 30$ for it  its amazeinly fun to play with machine guns on deathmatch servers or run and kill chickens on inferno while you should defend the bomb site  the big problem with this game on higher skill matchmakeing its that there are quite allot of cheaters and vac isnt that great this game its great game underpriceda lot of fun you can play it for a long time and you can get your friends to play too since its extremly cheap  you can make money from the ingame economy too but the problems like tickrate the cheaters and the fact that sometimes the hitboxes arent working very rare are detucting from its value the game gets an 88 from me with verdict of a great game perfect to chill out with your friends while screaming away that you just got an ace or an awesome item from cases good luck players

your team has died the enemy team are briskly striding around the map sweat dribbles from your cheek as you carry your battlescarred awp a fellow team player who speaks russian yaps down his mic at you the timer is ticking and the bomb has been planted all 5 of them are camped at b car you can already witness all of them carrying p90s and you thought it was your time to strike you run in vigorously spamming your pistol but noavail you lie dead flat on the ground sighting your awp purloined your team decides to kick you and you have front row seats this game is absolutely fantastic although not for the lightheated the game is set during our modern day period around two rivals counterterrorists terrorists both of them fuel hatred between themselves waging wars of attrition to see who wins the round out of 15 you can also site other game modes casual  for beginners competitive i wouldnt recommend playing it first death match an effective way of ranking up and the two other game modes which people barley care about demolition a competitive clone and arms race who can hack the best to finish first sorry for my bad convincing skills another worth mentioning is the gambling yes thousands are sucked in and come out with nothing but but the right man at the right place can achieve a ultra rare skin called a knife skin a costley 300$ and up for each one will lead the lucky gambler to scream and fall out of his chair in delight waking his mom up at 3 am

a nice game with such a nice russian players that gonna win all the rounds if you wanna spend time on having fun with nice guys in both teams this game is for you in the world of csgo and in the world of silver you gonna have great time shooting headshots and going trigger happy
recommended
a game tipically the romeo & julet complex two sides who hate each other enough to kill in the end boths side find out that its pointless to fight so they make a game out of killing each other as the generation go by the forget and it turns into the pc vs mac formula where they hate each other because it bacame a thing and they both benfit and the need to keep up apperances if you lucky you can catch them both in the house on sundays
recommended
the best game in the world

the game is really hooking really satisfying and as the price is fine it is worth it totally this is also one of gabens most vicious way to secretly take your money without noticing you will once or twice add funds to your wallet then you stop to think about it and realize how much youve spent next moment you find yourself opening yet again a new case and with gaben looking behind your shoulder once again you get nothing from it if you have an addiction of gambling i highly recommend this game
recommended
one of the fastest growing esports around and its not hard to see why pros learning curve forces improvement casual based and competitive based game modes huge community personalise your inventory with weapon skins cons matchmaking is rather broken 64 tick servers many toxic players steep learning curve for some hackers galore in matchmaking beware all in all there are 3rd party clients that can provide a solid competitive experience such as faceit  its a solid game with no real flaws apart from the community why not give it a shot
recommended
1 of the best shootergames out there
recommended
everyone has to smoke mid at least one time in their lives recommended to all 3
recommended
a bit of a mixed review its a great game no doubt if your already ranked in competitive if your new to the game beware of the 2 win 24 hour cooldown until you get 10 wins & the in general cooldown system is a bit off other than those this is a great game
recommended
this is the best first person shooter i have played
recommended
best competitive shooter period smurfs make the rank advancement hard but if you invest time in the game youre going to reach the higher ranks and if you are aware of selfcriticism you can learn a thing or 2 from those s and dont buy keys its just not worth it if you want a knife buy a knife that will be way cheaper than gambling on open cases
recommended
such a great game everything is so awesome graphics gameplay everything my competitive wont work but still a great game if you could help me fix the problem please send me a friend request and we can talk about it i would rate it 1010 such a good game
recommended
1010 would buy $400 knife again

counter strike global offensive review overview counter strike global offensive csgo or go for short is an online tactical and firstperson shooter the aim of the game depends on the game mode game modes consist of modes like demolition and hostage rescue modes in demolition the terrorists t for short have to plant a bomb at one of two sites site a or site b the counterterrorists ct for short have to stop the terrorists by erradicating the enemy team each player starts off with a standard pistol and $800 which they can buy other weapons and gear with as you progress through the game winning or losing you gain more cash to get bigger and better weapons the first to win 16 rounds wins in hostage rescue the terrorists most protect the hostages from the counterterrorists while the counterterrorists must take the hostages to the evac zone marked in green on the minimap if either team erradicates the other they win in casual your rank is not affected by your winsloses other modes like surfing and cas team deathmatch are in here ranks catagory score statement gameplay 9 gameplay is fun and quick however it can get really intense at times making it more fun graphics 7 graphics are a plus for this addition to the counterstrike series it is a very good looking game to play in teamwork 9 teamwork is esential in this game otherwise the game is ruined [table]

recommended
well it seems to be interesting but idk really didnt play dat much
recommended
i learned russian in two weeks 1010
recommended
i tried the game its okay but competetive matchmaking doesnt allow you to play with your friends if they have been randomly chosen to have a better rank than you unless you have 5 friends that you can get to play at the same time if you play the game in europe youll learn fluent russian in one month it would be a nice game to play as a team but when there is one guy shouting in polish two in russian and two in english its kind of hard to play but dont worry once youll learn the russian language the game becomes playable
recommended
before playing csgo   who tf would pay $300 for a virtual knife  after playing csgo   im gonna spend my christmas money on a knife  on a more serious note i really liked the game and have invested many hours into it  38 hrs in the past 2 weeks and i can only play on weekends including fridays so basically ive spent about a third of my weekend if the math adds up this past 2 weeks on csgo  i find it really fun to play id just say if its youre very first time palying csgo on pc dont head straight into competitive i played csgo on the xbox since it was released and was decent at it so i thought it would also apply to pc but i wasnt accustomed to the mouse and keyboard and lost a bunch of games in competitive and after my 10 wins i got placed in silver however i am getting the hang of it now and am pretty much topfragging everygame just got promoted recently and pretty much im aiming to climb to nova during winter break past experiences with this series as said before ive played it csgo on the xbox ive also played the original cs and cscz but ive never touched source before id make a comparison but i was really young when i played this so it wouldnt be very accurate communitywise i havent ran into many toxic players most people are willing to communicate and are pretty nice this game does have its share of 12 year olds and people who like to constantly talk to the fact that you cant concentrate but that is very small i rarely meet any of these bad people id also say that from my point of view the game is pretty balanced between the 2 sides i mean sure the t ak is 1 hit headshot  oh yeah aim for headshots ight be hard at first but youll quickly get the hang of it  while the ct m4 is 2 youve got to remember that cts are usually the ones defending you actually have to get that headshot you can always pick up an ak from a dead t and you switch sides at 15 rounds and unless youre 015 it should even out tldr my overall rating of the game 1010 really enjoyed palying it and will continue to do so
recommended
randomly spray and pray with negev on 3 enemies headshot in 3 row and people calling me hacker 1010 would spray with negev again
recommended
this game is better then sex
recommended
one of the best fps of all time
recommended
lately i am playing al lot of counter strike global offensive sometimes it sucks reallyreally hard but i cant stop playing it i dont no why i am still playing this the game is really popular in our community maybe because even cheap pcs can run it without lags and other problems the graphics are ok but this game isnt about graphics at all its about skill experience tactics and the most importantteamwork this is what makes the game soo difficult too 
recommended
ur my gurd this is like the best freaking game ever i think i might have a gambling addiction but who the  cares
recommended
so im going to keep this short and sweet this game pisses me off so much but it also gives me the most satisfaction from any fps i have ever played 910 cause the people suck
recommended
counterstrike global offensive is one of the best maybe even the best shooter at the moment i used to play call of duty a couple years ago but friends convinced me to play csgo and i dont regret it it offers a good gameplay a decent difficulty and a large playerbase you need good aim movement and the social ability to play in a team the game offers a matchmaking system and different gamemodes to play  competitive matchmaking > queue up alone or with up to 5 people to compete against other players on your rank  deathmatch > grab a gun and kill the enemy if you die you respawn the player with the most points in the end wins  arms race > kill enemys to gain new weapons and finish your streak and the game with a golden knife kill  demolition > a mixture of the bomb scenario and arms race plant or defuse the bomb and gain new weapons by killing enemys  custom serverbrowser > like in every other counterstrike game competitive matchmaking is the way the game is meant to be played two teams compete at each other and play a best of 30 rounds bomb or hostage scenario both teams will play as ct and t during the match counterterrorists  defend the bombside rescue the hostages andor kill the terrorists terrorists  plant the bomb defend the hostages andor kill the counterterrorists within the timelimit whenever you play counterstrike keep in mind that this game is no game for i only care about myself plebs even if you manage to get some good shots and get a round by yourself you usually screw your team and lose more rounds by not playing with your team unfortunately there are many people in this game who play like this either they dont talk get mad once you lose a couple rounds or perhaps even insult you in a language you never heard of before you can get lucky and get decent to even nice teammates but when you queue alone it is like playing russian roulette warning joke inc pro  good gameplay  decent difficulty  serverbrowser  competitive matchmaking  large playerbase con  cheaterssmurfs here and there  harsh learning curve  many unfriendly players i advise you to buy this game if you are interested in a very good fps shooter with very active playerbase i hope this review helped you in any way and would really like to see you ingame

i never knew how many kids slept with mom until i bought this game
recommended
best game available on steam why dont ask just buy pro csgo is just the best shooter in my opinion okay the graphics aint as good as the graphics of some newer titles but cs was never meant to have the best graphics cs is about skill about getting better about training and about inhuman reactions eh nevermind lets just go on without training you wont reach anything in this game and thats why its nice  there is actually some challenge basically its just a competetive shooter for those who want to play a game where you have to aim yourself thats what you use the mouse for and which isnt actually a console game if you dont like that then dont cry  the next cod is almost released now cod xtreme super warfare iii now extra casual contra there is a lot they should be fixing in terms of matchmaking like upgrading their servers to 128 tick etc and no i dont hate you cause youre playing cod we just cant be friends any more d
recommended
i ed this game right in the p[ussy
recommended
as far as fps goes this is the best i had never played the original counter strike or source but heard many good things about it if you are looking for a game which requires solid teamwork rather than solo play then this is for you and the best part is you learn plenty of russian swear words
recommended
this game is pretty damn awesome its purely multiplayer based so if u dont have good internet connection do not get this game if u fall into category 2 have good internet connection i wholeheartedly reccommend this game great graphics gameplay and generally never laggy many different modes to play i personally like the arms race and classic modes and a whole hell of a lot of strategy needed 1st game that i award a 1010 i love this game
recommended
i like to play this game and imagine that the people i play with are my friends it makes me feel less lonely and depressed and gives me something to look forward to when i get home from working in the coal mines

recommended
this game is amazing not ever fps game can match its physics match its teamwork cooperation inorder to win if you dont have teamwork you wont win this makes it a growing game for not only itself but for the community the maps and game in general is voted on and based off the csgo community thoughts that results in less complaints and better gameplay they even have a workshop for you to creat your ideas and submit them this game is absulutly amazing
recommended
ive played bad games and this isnt one of them
recommended
navi but besides that its 1010
recommended
at first i was hesitant about purchasing counterstrike id heard of its lack of ads and didnt know if i could possibly get into it but when i saw it go on sale i decided to grab it and holy balls its worth every penny i started logging hours into casual and got to grips with the hipfiring but i knew i needed a real challenge so i decided to try out competitive 100 percent team based you will lose if you dont communicate with your team which i absolutely adore the only problem i have with the game is the slight smurf and cheating problems that come with all games but its quite rare for me atleast to get into a server with a smurf or cheater for those of you who dont know a smurf is a highly skilled player creating alternate steam accounts to decimate lower ranks in competitive other than that its a truly flawless fps that i highly recommend any pvp fans purchase immediately
recommended
lets start off by saying this game is the best one in the cs series id say that csgo is a remade version of 16 which suits the needs of the current generation  better graphics stuff is fancy there is also this gambling aspect of opening cases and betting skins i really do not know if i like it or not some kids get happy over their new stuff while the other kids are crying after losing their whole skin collection in one click now the game itself theres a new mode called competitive people take this rather seriously you can play it to get higher in rank  in case youve got what it needs to get there which means youll get better opponents when you advance remember that you have to be on the same or higher level as your opponents to get higher you can also play it to realize you belong to the bottom floor but being on the bottom floor is okay right you can only get better note remember this is a team game try to cooperate with your team the best as you can of course csgo also has the classic server browser wherein you can browse the servers search them by tagsmapsplayer countping regular stuff some of these servers also feature funmodes which you can play when you feel like playing csgo but you cba to tryhard most of those servers are noobfriendly this game is updated constantly which means tweaks to guns if some are deemed overpowered or underpowered new skins new operations new maps and more be sure to have your credit card ready when these things happen though
recommended
in this game you can learn russian language from cover to cover
recommended
this is a wonderful and challenging game learning the recoil patterns is really fun also the skins are just so cool id definiatly recommend this for anyone

as you can see the amount of hours of my life wasted here ive lost my social life my money ive invested and hell even my family in this get it if your willing to take the risk

i would say this game is pretty awesome since its more realistic than bf or cod when you shoot somebody in the head with a proper weapon they die unlike in some other games recoil is pretty realistic for each weapon like the ak compare the recoils of cs and cod and u will smell  on which one is up to you also its more community friendly and is good linked with steam with the community market n stuff the idea with adding skin made by people using steam is pretty sweet too in fact i like everything about this game expect that u instantly get called bljat by joining comp 3

if cocaine did cocaine it would be no where near to how addictive this exellectly executed firstpersonshooter is great maps a competetive community and collectables such as ingameskins make this gem even better ive played both ghosts and battlefield 4 and honestly i dont think they have the competitive capabilities replayability or friendly community of this game outside the game there are professional teams that are both incredibly entertaining and extrodinarily insightful so many styles can be exploited in game whether youre defensive and like to let the enemies come to you awp or you like to flashbang your way in then spray a hundred bullets like a true god of war negev theres no wrong way to play the game csgo is one of the games i will be playing into the next decade and well beyond that 1010 would reccommend

cso is a game thatll always make you come back for more  apart from its already renowed gameplay generations have been playing  cs  go brings new features to the franchise  pros  the key to victory is teamplay  rare those days  great matchmaking system new recoil system add depth and more challenge during firefights  every bullet matters great community  till now  vac keep hackers at bay  correct graphic engine made to support the biggest range of pcs while staying pretty  thats why we love source  workshop  thousands of free maps & skins to support cons   please valve  fix the matchmaking cooldown system or at least give us more time to reconnect  we need 5 min  nothing more   some pcs and routers cant restart in the blink of an eye after a power outage  it may make things easier for  quitters  but itll also help a lot of honest players being put on cooldown injustly  otherwise  i recommend this game to anyone who wants a nervous game with an incredible community  thank you for for this great game 
recommended
worth it 3

one of the most competitive games i have ever played while the community is poop garbage and matchmaking is very stupid you should still pick up this game if you have the competitive spirit i dont recommend this game if you arent willing to spend hours learning mechanics and practicing spray patterns using and learning the weapons as well as dealing with the mindbogglingly toxic community  if you want to learn russian and german and you dont want to buy rosetta stone buy this game youll learn them fluently in about 35 months tops
recommended
cool i think i  myself
recommended
do you want to just play the same 3 maps over and over and over again despite there being many more options do you want to sit there for hours corner camping close quarters areas with a sniper rifle that one shots someone even if you only hit their toe do you want to be constantly berated and told how you got rekt by a community with a combined iq of 10 if you answered yes to one or more of these questions then do not hesitate to buy this amazing game lose your mind as well as your shame as you slowly become just another part of the problem

a great addition to the counterstrike series filled with many servers players old and new and the competitiveness of the people is just overwhelming the game welcomes any player beginner or veteran id recommend it to anyone who likes strategic plays positioning and a game takes incredible aiming and reaction speeds to beat your opponents
recommended
this is the best game ive ever played and since i discovered it i dont play other games anymore
recommended
counterstrike russian offensive language is a fpsgame where you kill other players while learning how to speak russian these friendly russian players will teach you how to speak their language really fast their mics are also of the highest quality so dont worry about headaches or bleeding ears if you need your fellow russians to answer you open chat and write  blyat ruskis for instant reaction a hilarious one at that warning your experience may vary
recommended
the gold standard of shooters
recommended
this game right here yes here this game is perfectwhen i first saw iti tought it would be like the other boring cs gamesbut no it changed my mind good graphics good gameplay you got to buy thisreally realistic
recommended
sadly there are no sprays in this game yes this means there is no longer porn all over cs_office i am sorry for your loss
recommended
counterstrike go is great fun while still introducing strong elements of strategy or perhaps it is fun because of the strategy while this game is not for everyone i would definiteley reccomend checking it out espicially with the new refund system valve has introduced csgo is one of the few tactical shooters out there some people might say ghost recon phantoms is tactical because you get bonuss for being near your team or something csgo is tactical because if your team isnt coordinating but the other team is it doesnt matter how good you are you will lose i dont know if it will be this way for you but each game feels crucial in csgo when the other team wins i actully feel a little depressed but when we win i feel amazing i have yet to find something in life than a 1v1 with bomb down 20 seconds left no kit you have to go now
recommended
ya its pretty good i guess

recommended
one of the best fps games ive ever played
recommended
love this game <3
recommended
its an ok game better than cscz in my opinion which i previously played in an old account before switching to csgo you get connected to matches in less than 10 seconds and server quality is overall acceptable the maps weapon balance except awp ak47 and p90 skins etc are all ok what i dont like about csgo is the horrible community especially mic chat its full of raging morons and smurfs who expect that you can do everything if you cant they try to kick you which fails most the time unless youre silver 1 there are too many smurfs in the game and valve still hasnt created a solution for it when in sale the game also becomes full of hackerscheaters which is a massive nuisance unfortunately csgo suffers from many glitches and poor optimization online gameplay is fragile with wifi unlike other games the could not retrieve your inventory bug also annoys me a lot csgo isnt beginnerfriendly although there are many players who arent smurfs many of them are playing cs for at least 5 years or more veteran coin this makes csgo very difficult for new players if worse even impossible to play the tutorial is very half and doesnt even explain the important basics of csgo well final rating 65100
recommended
after playing over 190 hours of this game i suppose id better give a review for it the gameplay of this game is extraordinary  the whole game is like all counterstrike games completely multiplayer meaning that the valve team can spend 100% of their time working on the game and making it run fine instead of faffing around with a singleplayer campaign 5% of players will bother to play past the first level the community however its terrible but if you just realise that this is a $15us game dont really take any offense to the little kids theyre everywhere but more so on call of duty to summarize this games excellent buy it now
recommended
a very good game
recommended
i learned pixel knives are worth more than real ones and a handful of the russian language from this game 1110

you will pour all of your efforts into this game you will not be good to start you cannot run around the map spraying people you will move into your parents basement so you can save on rent so you can buy more sweet skins your life as you know it is over

read the original version here [textuploadercom]  what i said in the previous version of this review was a bit too harsh like ive said before this game is amazing however what breaks the game for many people is valves silly anticheating measures and decisions in addition to their laziness in fixing even the simplest of things besides that weve had no real gameplay update in a very long time  apart from new operations which arent even made by valve again in its core csgo is a masterpiece of a game without a doubt it plays great and it has incredible amounts of depth while only making use of simplistic mechanics it has the potential to be the biggest esports title surpassing the moba genre even with its catering towards both casual and competetive players what the game is suffering from right now however is catering too much towards casual players and not paying attention to competetive playerss wishes and to the competetive community altogether vac hasnt still been improved and despite many complaints it still has questionable features such as banning people in waves more about that and the rest of the anticheating measures in a minute besides that csgo is plagued with small easytofix issues a few brief examples  weapon balancing  characterobject models being smaller than their hitboxes or vice versa see mirage a triplestack or dust ct character models  hitboxes in general jumping ladder and plant hitboxes are waaaaay off see this and this   competetive matchmaking servers being 64 tick instead of 128  hit detection and many more as you can see by the upload dates on the videos these issues have been apparent for almost a year if not more this shouldnt be happening to a very popular game made by a very successful company after plentiful complaints made by the community valve has not yet commented on the issues this highlights another issue  valves inability to listen and communicate there is no excuse to this as this hasnt always been an issue they listened back when csgo was just a shadow of what it is today because the game wasnt selling that is no longer the case i think the reason for valves laziness is the fact that theres nothing that can compete with global offensive right now most of the pc fps players are drawn over to csgo simply because there are not many other games they can play right now dota 2 gets clearly a lot more attention because it has 3 major competetitors as of right now i cant say for sure but it makes a lot of sense moving on i have a friend that is a private cheats developer and has a lot of experience in making them  he doesnt make them because he thinks its not morally wrong or whatever but literally just to make money as these things cost a lot of money  selling private personal cheats pay about 500800 dollars i dont fully agree with his decisions however id like to say that neither of us condone cheating in any way he has helped me in writing of this by giving me a more indepth look at how they work most of the following are based on his answers in a game with a competetive aspect or a competetive environment such as the official matchmaking servers cheating cannot by any means be an issue and should be kept very minimal yes no game is hack or cheatproof it is not possible to make such a system that keeps all the cheaters in check but for a game of this size cheating shouldnt be as big of a problem as it is now vac is terrible  and valve is aware of it and they showcase it by creating ingame anticheat solutions that potentially break the game for legitimate players heres an example one of these anticheat solutions as seen in the above video works by having the server create a trace between a player and other players heads if for whatever reason this trace is not finished or gets abrupted the enemy is not rendered on your computer its especially bad if the other players ping is high as the information received from the server takes longer to reach the client this fix is only mildly effective but it should help prevent wallhacking however it also affects legitimate players like the video showcased redacted it doesnt break wallhacks completely redacted for example if im on cat redacted i could still see a guy on goose redacted but i couldnt see a guy from ct spawn to t spawn anymore another one of these  solutions [imagesakamaisteamusercontentcom]  is unsynchronized weapon spread between the client and the server in the picture above red is what your client sees and blue is what the server sees ever shoot a whole magazine at someone and see all the bullets hitting directly behind them but only get a few hits that happens because of this this was implemented to prevent ragehackers when in reality it doesnt prevent ragehackers ability to continue ragehacking in anyway these arent the only ones there are a dozen more and they only barely hurt the cheaters while hurting the legitimate players just as much these arent solutions these are lazy changes which are called fixes when in reality they dont make the situation any better if vac were any better and could actually detect cheats with a bit more finesse these countermeasures wouldnt be needed at all if esea a third party matchmaking service can have a fairly decent anticheat so can valve now that weve established how poor vac is lets talk about the problems caused by cheating itself in my opinion the worst part about having a game with so many cheaters running rampant and so many cheats available is having to contemplate if someone is cheating or not its absolutely disgusting to be forced to sit in a game for atleast 30 minutes and watch your team get slaughtered every round because of a blatant cheater but its even more terrible to play a game where youre not sure if the other team had some kind of external help its discouraging its not fun to wait for the game to end and get frustrated so that you dont want to play anymore because as ive said before youre essentially playing a gamble when you queue up all you can do is hope that you dont get cheaters in your game leaving is not an option unless you want to get a temporary matchmaking ban having a surrender option available at all times would make this a lot better cheating is ruining competetive matchmaking and valve hasnt taken many steps to remedy that problem if you wish to play competetively your best bet would be third party matchmaking services unfortunately however as bad as all of this may sound most of these issues can be ignored especially if youre not huge into playing competetively the game is still balanced around the fact that both players have the ability to do what the other team is doing because of the sideswitching system at halftime  honestly the only issues besides cheating that youll be in contact with are hitbox and hit registering errors the game is still a lot of fun especially if you have friends you can play with i dont regret any of the 1000 hours ive played this game with my friends because they have all been memorable and very entertaining to say that the game is flawless or the best fps ever made would be silly however all in all buy it regardless of the issues with the game i would its cheap and there is nothing else like it so you dont have much choice anyway just be aware of the fact that theres 0% chance that valve is going to fix any of the issues with the game until theres something to compete with their game

csgo is a fantasy game about a young scottish man in the middleeast your goal is to clear the land of russians and anyone else who is foreign you have a large arsenal of guns also known as the ak47 m4a14 and the awp all other guns require a large ammount of rgn which is very silver the ak47 is a terrorist weapon used by the russians usually missing all shots and screaming ing noob you let my die  the way you respond to this is by holding tab right clicking their name and pressing block communication the awp is a large boltaction rifle used to take out enemies from a far the m4a14 are used by the counterterrorist team and are incredibly accurate all in all a fun game but if there were less russians it would be 1010 my review 69 not enough water

how to be a counter strike pro 1 buy a ridiculously overpriced alienware pc with a stupidly powerful cpu and a gpu from the 1990s 2 buy the most expensive razer keyboard and mouse cos yknow razer is the best brand 3 buy a ridiculously large mouse mat preferably razer 4 set your mouse dpi to the highest it can be and set your ingame sensitivity to the max 5 be totally oblivious to the fact that although your fps counter says you are getting 3000fps you are in fact only seeing 50 because youre using your dads old 19 inch tv screen 6 when in game buy a p90 and run straight down mid 7 see an enemy spin around ridiculously fast and spray wildly because your sensitivity is too high 8 die swear and insult teammates for not covering you 9 repeat from step 6 for added effect play on the lowest graphical settings and repeatedly switch weapons and wiggle your crosshair about because thats what kennys  jw  olofmeister do 1110  would be called a in nub by angry russian kids again

spent almost 100 eur on this game lost over 200 eur on csgolounge spent almost 3000hrs on this game thats about 2 and a half months played nonstop or basicly little over year if you play everyday about 8 hrs learned many different languages like russian polish spanish swedish and better english destroyed many nerves made a lot of frag movies and lost a lot from my social life or basicly 1 year wasted of my life and fair amount of money in skins but i will still play because you can never stop 1010

csgo is strange cross between old school gameplay and new school mechanics its not a mere run and gun game you need to play tactically and slowly for there is a penalty for moving and firing it is somewhat reminiscent of the gameplay in americas army as far as the stopandshoot motion goes additionally it will feel a bit familiar to those who played the original counter strike or tactical ops aot but is far from a carbon copy that could be taken eitherway but for a game that relies on competitive gameplay you will definitely experience it my suggestion is to play amongst friends as my experience has been negatively beguiled by mostly a prepubescent andor immature playerbase eitherway the mute button is your friend in that case and will make for a more enjoyable experience the weapon skin drops ala teamfortress is a nice addition for those collectors out there who may be looking for some incentive to play the game more this game is no unreal tournament or quake 3 but for fans who yearn for an environment of competition then look no further than counterstrike global offensive

counterstrike global offensive is how should i say its sometimes fun sometimes its not well since cssource went a bit down and players are shiftting to this next generation of counterstrike gaming so this game is probably the most intense fps game ive played since there are so many of these god damn hackers in the game it hits you hard with rage madness such nerve rackingness & the struggle in some of the games against them my god they are such a huge pain im starting to wonder if steam supports hackers vac3 is a complete joke overwatch is more of a joke they should put more people on the watch or valve should develop a more sophisticated banningsystem or this game will never be fully enjoyable  competitive is fun with the right players and if all players are using mics and if all are players are doing good response between players on reporting enemy locations then the games are quite enjoyable still so many players dont use mics and or are just deranking on purpose and or just fragging and or trolling thus deranking is inevitable

csgo is a fantasy game about a young scottish man in the middleeast your goal is to clear the land of russians and anyone else who is foreign you have a large arsenal of guns also known as the ak47 m4a14 and the awp all other guns require a large ammount of rgn which is very silver the ak47 is a terrorist weapon used by the russians usually missing all shots and screaming ing noob you let my die  the way you respond to this is by holding tab right clicking their name and pressing block communication the awp is a large boltaction rifle used to take out enemies from a far the m4a14 are used by the counterterrorist team and are incredibly accurate all in all a fun game but if there were less russians it would be 1010 my review 69 not enough water

read the original version here [textuploadercom]  what i said in the previous version of this review was a bit too harsh like ive said before this game is amazing however what breaks the game for many people is valves silly anticheating measures and decisions in addition to their laziness in fixing even the simplest of things besides that weve had no real gameplay update in a very long time  apart from new operations which arent even made by valve again in its core csgo is a masterpiece of a game without a doubt it plays great and it has incredible amounts of depth while only making use of simplistic mechanics it has the potential to be the biggest esports title surpassing the moba genre even with its catering towards both casual and competetive players what the game is suffering from right now however is catering too much towards casual players and not paying attention to competetive playerss wishes and to the competetive community altogether vac hasnt still been improved and despite many complaints it still has questionable features such as banning people in waves more about that and the rest of the anticheating measures in a minute besides that csgo is plagued with small easytofix issues a few brief examples  weapon balancing  characterobject models being smaller than their hitboxes or vice versa see mirage a triplestack or dust ct character models  hitboxes in general jumping ladder and plant hitboxes are waaaaay off see this and this   competetive matchmaking servers being 64 tick instead of 128  hit detection and many more as you can see by the upload dates on the videos these issues have been apparent for almost a year if not more this shouldnt be happening to a very popular game made by a very successful company after plentiful complaints made by the community valve has not yet commented on the issues this highlights another issue  valves inability to listen and communicate there is no excuse to this as this hasnt always been an issue they listened back when csgo was just a shadow of what it is today because the game wasnt selling that is no longer the case i think the reason for valves laziness is the fact that theres nothing that can compete with global offensive right now most of the pc fps players are drawn over to csgo simply because there are not many other games they can play right now dota 2 gets clearly a lot more attention because it has 3 major competetitors as of right now i cant say for sure but it makes a lot of sense moving on i have a friend that is a private cheats developer and has a lot of experience in making them  he doesnt make them because he thinks its not morally wrong or whatever but literally just to make money as these things cost a lot of money  selling private personal cheats pay about 500800 dollars i dont fully agree with his decisions however id like to say that neither of us condone cheating in any way he has helped me in writing of this by giving me a more indepth look at how they work most of the following are based on his answers in a game with a competetive aspect or a competetive environment such as the official matchmaking servers cheating cannot by any means be an issue and should be kept very minimal yes no game is hack or cheatproof it is not possible to make such a system that keeps all the cheaters in check but for a game of this size cheating shouldnt be as big of a problem as it is now vac is terrible  and valve is aware of it and they showcase it by creating ingame anticheat solutions that potentially break the game for legitimate players heres an example one of these anticheat solutions as seen in the above video works by having the server create a trace between a player and other players heads if for whatever reason this trace is not finished or gets abrupted the enemy is not rendered on your computer its especially bad if the other players ping is high as the information received from the server takes longer to reach the client this fix is only mildly effective but it should help prevent wallhacking however it also affects legitimate players like the video showcased redacted it doesnt break wallhacks completely redacted for example if im on cat redacted i could still see a guy on goose redacted but i couldnt see a guy from ct spawn to t spawn anymore another one of these  solutions [imagesakamaisteamusercontentcom]  is unsynchronized weapon spread between the client and the server in the picture above red is what your client sees and blue is what the server sees ever shoot a whole magazine at someone and see all the bullets hitting directly behind them but only get a few hits that happens because of this this was implemented to prevent ragehackers when in reality it doesnt prevent ragehackers ability to continue ragehacking in anyway these arent the only ones there are a dozen more and they only barely hurt the cheaters while hurting the legitimate players just as much these arent solutions these are lazy changes which are called fixes when in reality they dont make the situation any better if vac were any better and could actually detect cheats with a bit more finesse these countermeasures wouldnt be needed at all if esea a third party matchmaking service can have a fairly decent anticheat so can valve now that weve established how poor vac is lets talk about the problems caused by cheating itself in my opinion the worst part about having a game with so many cheaters running rampant and so many cheats available is having to contemplate if someone is cheating or not its absolutely disgusting to be forced to sit in a game for atleast 30 minutes and watch your team get slaughtered every round because of a blatant cheater but its even more terrible to play a game where youre not sure if the other team had some kind of external help its discouraging its not fun to wait for the game to end and get frustrated so that you dont want to play anymore because as ive said before youre essentially playing a gamble when you queue up all you can do is hope that you dont get cheaters in your game leaving is not an option unless you want to get a temporary matchmaking ban having a surrender option available at all times would make this a lot better cheating is ruining competetive matchmaking and valve hasnt taken many steps to remedy that problem if you wish to play competetively your best bet would be third party matchmaking services unfortunately however as bad as all of this may sound most of these issues can be ignored especially if youre not huge into playing competetively the game is still balanced around the fact that both players have the ability to do what the other team is doing because of the sideswitching system at halftime  honestly the only issues besides cheating that youll be in contact with are hitbox and hit registering errors the game is still a lot of fun especially if you have friends you can play with i dont regret any of the 1000 hours ive played this game with my friends because they have all been memorable and very entertaining to say that the game is flawless or the best fps ever made would be silly however all in all buy it regardless of the issues with the game i would its cheap and there is nothing else like it so you dont have much choice anyway just be aware of the fact that theres 0% chance that valve is going to fix any of the issues with the game until theres something to compete with their game

this game is hands down the best fps i have ever played and still playing the game can be run at max settings to look visually stunning on a beefy computer or on a potato of a computer at lowest settings you continually discover more and more things about the game and thats what entices me to play it more it has a wonderful community if you put aside the hackers and griefers and id say 90% of my friends list of currently 260 people is from this game i love it and the counterstrike series and will continue to love it throughout many years i hope get this game and get it now

its a good game after all all the russians should have their own servers though its really hard to communicate when 4 players of our team speaks english and then there is that one russian guy who just speaks russia all the way and nobody understands and you have way too much hatred inside of you russians too valve also should put a little bit more effort into vac cheaters really ruin the game especially in competitive where they just keep on popping up when they should be gone and no i do not keep every player that plays better than me a hacker its fun public servers have a lot to offer comp for some serious gaming or faceitesea

for my english 101 class i had to write a review of something so i ended up reviewing this game and here is my review hope you enjoy a series of counter strike games have been released in the past and with counter strike global offensive it has changed first person shooters with the creativity of the steam community they continue to change and make the game a new experience each time averaging 35 million unique players each month new ideas are displayed about every hour each day this game is meant for people who both like fps and are completely new to them players who are new or kist playing it for fun the casual section of gameplay allows these players to experience the game on a noncompetitive level the casual section breaks down into four sub sections being deathmatch arms race demolition and casual classic deathmatch is the perfect place to play a quick warm up game and allows players to practice using guns that they havent used before arms race is just like gun game from other fps games but sets the guns to 27 and it is a quick paced game and really fun if you play with a lot of friends demo gives the feeling of casual classic but it only has one bomb site and it is hard to plant before the counterterrorist are dead or the terrorist are dead plus it has generally small maps for me this is not the gamemode for me but if you want to play a quick 2025 minute game without people yelling at you then this a good choice to play casual is in my opinion the game type that is most like competitive but again without the ranting and arguing of players when you lose the couple of things that are annoying is unlike comp it only goes to 15 rounds and you dont switch sides this does create a somewhat of an unfair game since some maps are sided towards either ct or t with that being said i think casual is very relaxed and calming without people yelling in the microphone now here is where there is a lot of frustration and annoyance but will always be fun to play even though i personally dont think this is the best in the game i do think it is second and a close best feature of the game there are a lot of takeaways from comp but like any competitive game there are negatives the competitive game type nevers gets old with different operations coming out every threefour months communication is key in this game and with ingame voice there are a lot of negatives but ill get to that on most days youll get into a game with respectable nice people that dont really get mad and yell comp gives every player the rush to want to be the best rank or the best player in the current lobby like all games you can leave midway but in this game it punishes the players to a 157day ban from comp these bans are completely random so it does force people to stay in the game with comp it is a 3090 minute game where it lasts 30 rounds and does switch roles to balance the game unlike most fps csgo doesnt allow players to aim down sights unless it has a scope and this is where i believe luck and skill comes in and it enhances the gameplay players will normally understand if you dont know the callouts on the map and will tend to help some try hard players are not so forgiving another great part that i can think of is valve put in chickens that roam around the maps and during the holidays they will add stuff to the chickens ex last week they put in cheers and balloons so each time you killed them those would come out the chickens can also be used to figure out where the enemies are if one happens to see it killed the way that the game balances the skill of players is the best they will put same skill ranks together and dont really allow high ranks to play with the low ranks with all of the positive ideas there are sadly always negatives csgo community consists of people who do try a little too hard and care too much about the game i have been in games where teammates will constantly yell into the mic just talking trash to each other and it really doesnt help them to do better personally i dislike like the little kids that come into the game swearing and commanding the adults on what to do and i know most of my friends feel the same way they are called squeakers at times players that arent good enough to play the game will try to cheat and try to get an advantage over the other players they will use hacks such as a wallhack or an aimbot there are other programs but i am not familiar with them also players who have been playing for a while and reached a high rank cant compete with their current rank players so they make a new account and face new people these are called smurfs i know that i am missing a lot of things that people find negative about this game but these are my big negatives where all of the creativity in this game comes from is from the workshop and it is so vital to this game i find this the best feature due to all of the stuff that you can make and it can be used in the game the developers allowed players to make their own custom skins for the guns in the game and if it gets voted up by the community then it can be added the to the game and you can make money off of it right now there are skins that cost 450$ but there are a lot of cheap ones the expensive guns are the knives not only can you make skins you can make stickers that can go through the same process to get into the game people can also make their own maps but i have yet to try that feature but i have seen some nice maps valve added crate drops into the game to that contains chances at getting a rare skin for the gun or knife but it can cost 1$ or so for the case and 250$ for the keys i find this gambling system not worth the money so i recommend selling the cases because they do add up each week i ended up with 25$ from drops and bought copies of the game for two of my friends with having only 240 hours invested in the game i have seen people with over 2000 hours so that means that it must be an amazing game for someone to have that much time put into this game

ok first of all im british and i play on counter strike literally every single day playing competitive for stupid amount of hours which i love doing csgo is the topbest favourite fps game that has ever been released since the early years of 16 but the sad moment which lets the whole game down is matchmaking with russianspolish etc im british i dont want to be in a game full of russians that speak russian i want to be in a game that speak clear english cs really needs a filter so you can search for games that are local not in russiapoland 999% of russia play csgo so us uk people wont stand a chance so redicilous all im saying is that cs needs to introduce a matchmaking filter so british players can que and matchmake with other british players so we dont have to struggle playing with russians who dont speak english competitive is a game about communication teamwork not listening to other players speak in a different language leaving you out of the team csgo needs matchmaking filters
recommended
its a great game but if you have played games like call of duty and battlefield you will have some difficulty converting into csgo i have alot of hours but am still only silver 3 thats because of the 2 months i took to learn the maps and recoil patterns of each and almost every gun the ak47 is an amazing rifle on the terrorist side but is very hard to learn the recoil pattern then there are guns like the m4a1s that are much easier to use but do slightly less damage pistols are important to learn if you can win the first 2 rounds of a competitive match your team is much more likely to win the half this is a great game definitley worth the low price of 15$ sometimes even 749 so definitley pick this game up and if you would like you can add me if you would like to play or ask for more tips

currently the best competitive fps indeed  it is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning but with some practice you should get the mechanics of the game the strong point is that valve publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the esport with esport cases team sticker or event cashprize esl one dreamhack valve is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the operationseason pass like operation breakout or operation phoenix so you can play community map in competitive mode  the weak point imo is the community youre a noob ou youre a cheater furthermore there are many cheater when the game is cheap on steam but these low prices are usually followed by many vac ban this game does not look like other games as the call of duty saga this game is for child and noob and they want to make money csgo is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community  gl & hf  thanks volvo d

i bought this game and learned fluent russian soon after for the low price of only 1399$ 1010 would definately recommend
recommended
a great sequel of the one and only shooter game for people that like tactical play and hardcore aiming maps are good and the recoil system requires some good practice even though i think it would have been better to create a game more similar to the game counterstrike source but that is just my personal opinion the only problem in this game is the amount of cheaters and the fact that the game price gets changed to 349 sometimes which means that there will be a huge hacker wave again valve should do something about it or create an anticheat that you can choose to enable for matches on protected servers
recommended
great game really fun to play 910
recommended
csgo relies heavily on teamwork whilst this games mechanics are extremely well done and fun to learn the idea of forcing players to work as a team is its major downfall unless you have 4 other friends to play with more often than not youre going to be matched with trolls griefers andor bad players which becomes extremely frustrating other than that goes on sale all of the time and is a lot of fun if you have the friends or think you can meet some whilst playing then i really cant reccomend it enough nothing beats the tension of this game
recommended
this game is a 1010 on the cheek scale

when i bought this game in early 2013 i didnt think it would become into oneof the most biggest esport games of 20142015 at first i wasnt that keen on the game everything was unbalanced and it was so weird and bad compered to 16 and source then when valve decided to put some efort into polishing this game it turned out to be one if not the best game that they made everyone on steam needs to have this masterpiece of a game 1010

game  good community  the only problem of this game is its community which consists mainly of immature little kids that have not enjoyed any form of education remember those scum kids in kindergarden whose parents would allow them to do anything this game collects all of them into one huge set of idiots with no restraints no respect no manners no common sense and absolutely no intelligence the best way to play this game get a team of friends and mute everybody else otherwise you are going to lose a lot of your brain cells and also all hope in humanity only in 000000001% of the cases you actually get to play with nice people who play for fun who dont rage at you for their own faults who can teamplay and communicate and most importantly whose selfconfidence and ego do not depend on being pro in csgo my final thought on this game rip humanity

this is my favourite game in the cooking mama series unlike the previous games this one goes through various platforms strangely the pc version is the only version thats updated i mean the snes is a pretty big competitor to the pc the game itself counterstrike terrorism x is an addictive rpg game where the player must complete puzzles with hisher teammates i personally think counterstrike a letter to his son about his father done it better most of the community seems to agree this creates a very competitive situation but luckily the community knows its all a game and is made for fun the weapons i usually use are energy sword and rail gun the community on the topic of community it is by far the nicest ive ever played with they know people make mistakes and dont have the ability to fight 5 over players by themselves there is a kick button thats never used for the players personal use so they may not face the penalities of deranking as thats ridicolous and its only a game the graphics made with frostbite the graphics are stunning the verdict 455 shrek forever after is good at what it does my actual review this game is full of people with their heads screwed so far up their asses the community is toxic enough to make the planet extinct its good

its ok

still better than call of duty

csgo is a nearperfect multiplayer shooter unlike the previous versions which were often difficult to get in to this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels it has a large community and a well supported workshop ensuring that this discountpriced game will be around for years to come in short you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster its been around for years and has spawned many imitators the game isnt much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original half life 2 was however valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis is it worth getting if you already own counter strike source yes css was always counter strike shoehorned into the source engine csgo feels far more like a standalone game valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game the best feature must be the competitive play you cannot leave these matches or youll suffer a temporary ban from the feature after 10 wins in this mode youll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level these matches are exciting occasionally scary or frustrating but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game ever there are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join really if i was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice its bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come something that cant be said for the call of duty franchise which is probably its closest rival remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year fragmenting the community plus you can customise your weapon skins in csgo surely thats the most important feature all they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in csgo
recommended
best cs game on the franchise
recommended
quite simply this feels like a reskin of css sure some backend stuff may have changed but to me as a player it feels the same this leaves the game in an awkward sort of limbo between old and new with fancy graphics that if anything make the outdated gameplay stand out more than ever if you really love cs but for some reason cannot play css without improved graphics get this if you are new to the series dont buy it or you will just end up feeling lost hurt and confused

i think it is a terrible game it stole all of its gamemodes from call of duty csgo competitive is just extended search and destroy and valve didnt even bother to rename demolition they must be pretty lazy the aim sucks because the bullets dont go straight to the center but spray all over even with that small difference it is still blatant copy of call of dewty what kind of a game steals everything from call of duty and doesnt implement some of the best features like the intervention sniper rifle as a silver 1 i would just like to show everyone how i quickscope in call of dewty i mean what engine is this game on is it that dated engine quake ran on just look at how good fall of duty looks each year since they revamp the engine from scratch every year basically you want to play call of booty csgo is for people who are casuals cod is for hardcore gamres and takes sooooo much more skill if you dont belieev me message me on steam and we can 1v1 on mw2 rust quickscopes only

great game for the casual or the competetive fps player coming from games like oc quake and uberstrike this game really forces you to improve your reflex time as well as your accuracy i wasnt much for the modern games until i tried this one out i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great fps heres a little procon pros extremely fun and addicting gameplay balenced gameplay good graphics with exellent map designs engaging gameplay great community and team aspect skill cap is extremely high playable on even low grade computers mines 15 ghz cons costs real money if youre a usual f2p gamer then this might detract you from it learning curve is extremely steep youll need to invest time into this game not really a con but for some people they just want a fun game to run around on if thats the case this game is not for you no major fov changes i realize there are a few things you can do to change it but for a quake player like myself it was rough to get used to after playing with 115 fov for a while requires a mic to be completely honest if you want to get good at this game and engage in teamplay you will need a mic  otherwise youll be hardpressed to type out strats and the status of your enemies hackers just like most games out there you will run into these  they are easy to report but be warned they do exist if you get my gist the cons are really just minor things nothing really is so annoying that i would consider stopping playing this game 910 spiegel

csgo is the best competitive fps game i have ever played i believe its difficult enough to be a challenging game for gamers plus its a really nice and enjoyable game it has improved graphics from the other cs games and you can find it for only 1099 there are two bad things about this game one is that the competitive matchmaking can sometimes ruin your game join you with noobs the second one is that a lot of people get addicted with the weapon skins valve items and can spend a lot of money in cases and keys to sum up i recommend this game to everyone whos looking for a good fps to play my rating is 9510

only have 50hours but so far this is the best fps out there it beats cod and battlefield just the community on there brings rewards from its self i would really recommend this to my friends and to everyone if they are into fps plus ive been a counterstike kid since 2005 now its 2014 and the love is still here for the cs community keep the game the way its suppost to be   >5stars< edit its been over 400 hours now and still satified

love this game besides from all the campers this is really fun join a casual competetive and you just start rampaging this game has amazing graphics beautiful soundtrack and amazing weapon sounds although some things are worse then in css wich was the ground for competetive fps gamers it still is amazing play with friends go online do what you want steam market yus made me happy buy whatever you want getawesome cool skins for your guns and be famous 910 some bugs remain some netcode bugs aswell run around corner but still die d but still amazing

the only thing that i can say about this game is fantastic xd

counterstrike started off well counterstrikego is different from css and cscz etc csgo has different guns different maps different spray patterns different everything throw away everything you knew from css because this game is different where the p90 was a standard smg in css in this game its used as a smaller lmg i still do love this game

takes a while to get used to but after a while youll like it awp op but meh 1010 would bang

this game is the fps of the time better than call of duty better than battlefield 3 better than arma iii  the others counterstrike is in the place what a funny strategic and amazing game 
recommended
this game is definitely an improvement on the previous games now its super easy to find a competitive match i found it very hard on css and cs 16 also you dont even have to be in a group of 5 to find oneanother thing which was annoying about the previous ones if that people can lie about their skill group which left the match unbalanced csgo has a ranking system which will put you against people with a similar rank and its a good thing to strive towards reaching that next rank put that together with the custom gun skins they have brought into it it turns into a fun and very replayable game 910
recommended
this game has an amazing topology system versus counter strike source and the fact that it uses a system for item drops sellable in the market is amazing this is one fps that will most likely not be abandoned for along time a story i tell everyone is a took a break from gmod so i went to csgo and went back to garrys mod and i could headshot a pedo bear
recommended
i have played alot of counter strike 16 and the game was just awesome  but after playing this i have to say that this beats most of the multiplayer shooters out there the graphics are greatly improved  there are various play modes  new weapon designs  new voice acting etc  must buy if you love shooters
recommended
best cs game on the franchise

quite simply this feels like a reskin of css sure some backend stuff may have changed but to me as a player it feels the same this leaves the game in an awkward sort of limbo between old and new with fancy graphics that if anything make the outdated gameplay stand out more than ever if you really love cs but for some reason cannot play css without improved graphics get this if you are new to the series dont buy it or you will just end up feeling lost hurt and confused

css was my favourite been playing since the first counter strike this game is awesome i use to play the beta and put in like 300 hours then i stopped playing for a while because all my stats got reset this game is deffinatly worth getting even for $15 most valve games are great 810 great graphics  way better than css and the sounds are improved heaps

this is the best game i have ever played its my favirote game its so skill based and not just a stupid grind like cod and other shooters the aiming is skill base and matches require tactics and team play to win once 1 has mastered the game he can take down a team of 5 all on himself this game has hundreds of hours of play time that will not make you bored one bit unless you lose all the time

i remember when counter strike didnt have idle lobbies so people can collect cases and guns just to sell them i also remember when you wanted to play competitive mode and werent stuck with 14 year old little boys who just like to friendly fire since the game went on sale for 4$ at one point every kid and their little brother has an account now if you are going to play with a group of friends this is a fun way to go if you want to be stuck with a group of random idiots then this is your game

the counterstrike franchise had its highs cs 16 and lows cssource but the newest iteration was damn worth the wait sufficient to say you dont need 16 anymore if you have csgo games 95 out of 100 a must buy

this game is alright i guess it taught me several important life lessons 1 virtual knives are cool and are sure to get the opposite sex to notice you 2 virtual knives are more expensive than real life ones cos they are of higher build quality 3 if your gas cooker is about to explode and you could put it out with a fire extinguisher but you are wearing a posh suit run and save the suit it was bloody expensive you know 4 silver is in fact the least valuable metal in the world 5 russians are lovely people 1010 if you are looking to teach your child important life skills such as sharing working together and collecting knives this game is a must

this is my favourite game in the cooking mama series unlike the previous games this one goes through various platforms strangely the pc version is the only version thats updated i mean the snes is a pretty big competitor to the pc the game itself counterstrike terrorism x is an addictive rpg game where the player must complete puzzles with hisher teammates i personally think counterstrike a letter to his son about his father done it better most of the community seems to agree this creates a very competitive situation but luckily the community knows its all a game and is made for fun the weapons i usually use are energy sword and rail gun the community on the topic of community it is by far the nicest ive ever played with they know people make mistakes and dont have the ability to fight 5 over players by themselves there is a kick button thats never used for the players personal use so they may not face the penalities of deranking as thats ridicolous and its only a game the graphics made with frostbite the graphics are stunning the verdict 455 shrek forever after is good at what it does my actual review this game is full of people with their heads screwed so far up their asses the community is toxic enough to make the planet extinct its good

in the wonderful world of competitive watch your teams get steamrolled by smurfs and just plain old hackers win 5 rounds in a row and then not rank up the next because the great matchmaking puts you up to those conditions lose connection for 5 minutes say goodbye to competitive as youll automatically be issued a cooldown which consist of 30 minutes 2 hours 24 hours and a whole week the cooldowns also decrease after each week of not abandoning great system valve get ranked up then get steamrolled by smurfs the next 3 rounds lose connection the 4th round and then have it count as an abandon and then get deranked that said what a great game 1110 would derank get steamrolled aimbotted wallhacked and lose to high ranked players using an alternate account to play against other players in the silver tiers considered noobs as practice again

too much fun youll have hours of fun experience shooting people this is the game that is really realistic compared to modern fps games the engine in this feels very much like the one used in counterstrike source and thats because it is although its updated its the same engine so there isnt too much to get used to ive played hours of this with my friends and this game runs perfectly smooth on pretty much any computer even with outdated parts the updated classic maps are really nice and the workshop community is amazing theres sooo many custom maps to choose from and id highly recommend this game over any cod 1010 best fps game ive ever owned
recommended
this game is pretty much the best fps on pc ever its actually balanced unlike games cough cough cod the camos are pretty cool but im not going to pay for them hahah lol but the games graphics are really good and the game makes sense theres a lot of modes you can play community made modes and modes made by the devs 910 there is quite a bit of hackzorz

at its core global offensivecounter strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken microsoft mouses the emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around it creates an atmosphere that games like battlefield and call of duty cannot and with no health regeneration each encounter with each enemy is a life threatening situation the game is simply tactful its brilliant when youre alive and even when youre dead the game is still fun to watch other players
recommended
very good game thumbs up from me

just reviewing for a badge

ive played call of duty for around 6 years and i have played the counter strike series for maybe 4 months now csgo has to be the best game ive played in a long time although its harder to play its so much more fun to play than any game ive previously played would highly reccomend to anyone who plays fpss

counterstrike is one of those slightly forgotten industry giants for counterstrike it created the standard for modern military shooters but was quickly changed into less strategic styles and more arcadeish styles for us pc master race people here on steam we have counterstrike as our goto shooter this game has a steep learning curve that means when you play for the first time you will die a lot but instead of whining about your death i suggest the smarter approach analyze what happened how you died why you died and what this means for your future gameplay this is the kind of game that demands you to learn otherwise youll just be six feet under each round with a team wondering why you suck so bad there are many helpful guides both here on steam and on the internet in general just look around now heres the pros and cons to playing counterstrike global offensive instead of the other counterstrike titles remember that some pros and cons can have different meaning and effect for different people also remember this is all just my opinion pros  people are playing by this i mean there are plenty of servers with plenty of people and plenty of games to be had without running into all bot games every single time granted other cs titles still have running servers with people but theres just a larger scale of players in csgo  the mechanics allow for easier learning while i did start with cs source i wasnt very good because i did not understand the game at all and only got to seriously playing and trying to learn with csgo css in comparison to csgo is very bad at teaching the player its core mechanics on its own now thats perfectly fine it was an older iteration and many cs players were already good anyways what im saying is that if you have not played a cs game before or are not good yet csgo would be a better purchase for such a new player  price is cheaper kind of speaks for itself csgo costs $1499 usd while css currently costs $1999 usd which still doesnt make sense to me the original cs is $999 usd currently i believe on steam but it is such an older game that unless youre collecting its much more worth it to pay the extra $5 to get csgo just because in this case newer means higher quality  [edit 31215] more customization in cs 16 there was some customization but it was limited you could choose between different preset sizes for your crosshair and different preset colors you could also make your viewmodel for your weapon left handed meaning the image of your arms and gun on your screen is mirrored to the left side instead of the right in css you could do all this and also toggle a dot for your crosshair however in csgo the range of customizability is greatly increased now you can alter the 3d position of your viewmodel change the gap between the dot of your crosshair and its legs change the thickness of the crosshair and even change the crosshair between 6 different styles with varying properties the first 2 styles are simple default style 0 and default static style 1 which are both this kind of uniquely designed crosshair with the regular default crosshair dynamically moving with your characters movement and the shooting of your gun the last 4 styles are all the custom type crosshair which looks more traditional but can be heavily customized with the previously mentioned settings style 2 is a dynamic crosshair with ghosted strips that expand outwards when you move the crosshair also moves when you shoot style 3 is the same except without the ghosted strips its just the dot and the legs the legs still move style 4 is full static as in nothing moves ever i prefer this one but thats just me style 5 is static except when you shoot it expands and then quickly returns to its original state i like to use this one sometimes because the moving of the legs of the crosshair usually times with the bullets coming out of the gun so for spraying it helps me have a rough idea where im at with my bullets in the clip however for me the movement of it can be distracting but again its all preference another thing you can do for customization purposes is resize and rezoom the radar you can also change the positions of the edges of your hud meaning you can bring it towards the center if you like i make my hud horizontally as close to the center as i can because it lets me see info on my hud just a tad bit faster and without taking my eyes too far off the crosshair anyways i kinda went on wayyyy too long just for customization but my point is ^^^tldr^^^ csgos general customization has much more to it than the older iterations it allows every player to have a very specific set of preferences for their preferred style and i believe that makes it quite a good game compared to many multiplayer shooters where theres little to no customization of such things cons  the players atleast at the lower ranks ive noticed recently that queueing for competitive when not with a fully lobby of friends can kinda suck atleast at the lower ranks the reason being that atleast from what ive experienced youll find a lot of teammates who dont care enough to put their full effort into winning the match which if you understand the ranking system absolutely ruins those of us who want to rank up and take the game seriously in a fun competitive sense so my suggestion for those of you that love the teamwork and cooperation of competitive matches is to acquire 4 people that take the game as seriously as you do and play with them on a regular basis this immediately eliminates the possibility of getting poor teammates because youre already set up with a full 5 man team of people willing to put their full effort in to win honestly thats the best way to enjoy cs in my opinion the servers a huge issue atleast to those of us who prefer a serious competitive environment is the quality of the valvehosted competitive servers us serious players usually enjoy the ranking system that is implemented but it is frustrating when your failure in a round isnt due to any of your own mistakes but rather the flaws of the server and its registration registration is basically a server knowing that when you shoot at a guy and you did everything right the bullet hits him it registers the hit a problem with some valve servers in csgo is that it feels kinda like you have to shoot relatively where you see them instead of right at them the poor registration mainly comes from the servers being in 64 tick which means 64 ticks of information being sent to and from the server every second with split second conflicts that could decide important rounds its pretty important that stuff works the way its suppose to and when it doesnt it sucks 128 tick servers hosted by the community or by leagues like faceit cevo or esea usually fix this issue everything feels a bit tighter and more responsive on 128 tick and you actually feel like you have to shoot right at the guys head to 1 tap him instead of vaguely towards his head area its a huge debate on how to fix this issue though and that argument can be saved for the internet where someones video probably talks about it the sound now i dont mean the sounds themselves theyre fine i mean the directions of them in cs its very important that it is clear to your ears where sounds are coming from because it relays some of the most important information about the enemy to you but a problem with csgos sound is that sometimes right sounds like left or behind sounds like infront or any other combination of nonaccurate direction it needs to be fixed for competitions sake anyways to briefly close i believe csgo is the best option for newer cs players just remember that if your teammates are taking it serious you should to glhf

maybe the only fps where it truly goes down to a game of pure skill and teamwork counterstrike is the most competetiv game in my opinion and csgo is a great sequel to the 16 and source including matchmaking watching other peopls matches and the limitless options of becoming a better player if you are into competetiv games that require individual skill and teamwork you should get counterstrike global offensive hands down

the good great gameplay keeps drawing me back to get better new players might think the game is broken when they miss all their shots but really this game is polished and most of the time whenever someone finds a new glitch valve fixes it very fun to play and addictive valve updates the game constantly and takes feedback from players of the game they update the game around the pro scene too for instance at the $250000 dreamhack winter 2014 a very large percentage of ct rifle kills were with the m4a1s instead of the m4a4 valve changed the price of the m4a1s to be $200 more just like the m4a4 they constantly balance out guns and fix glitches there is a great profesional scene for this game filled with large tournaments and passionate players some players can even play csgo for a job getting money from sponsorships streaming prize money and etc its very fun to watch teams play eachother in tournaments and you can even bet skins on games gotv works fairly well where you can hear casters and see the game go on through spectator mode sometimes grimy things happen in the competitive scene though such as throwing matches for skinsmoney and players caught cheating overall the competitive scene is great there are paid items in this game called weapon skins they show different patterns and colors on your gun and dont give you or other players any advantages when they have them they are generally just fun to look at many weapon skins are made by the community in csgo workshop the people who make the skins that are added into the game are actually paid real money when someone buys their skin few other companies or games do this and its really great for the people spending their tame making custom skins people can also make maps too which can be sometimes added into the game the map creators get paid for their hard work if the map gets added too depending on how good you are at the game you have have a competitive rank this means you will play with people simalar to your skill level when you play competitive you can rank up too this is great because you dont get matched up with some pros when you are new to the game you can easily play with friends in this game which makes the competitive expirience a whole lot better the nuetral you can bet items on csgolounge which can be good or bad some people get addicted and lose all their skins but some people can actually make a profit out of it it can ruin some peoples inventories while make other people rich the bad some people dislike this and some people dont care but smurfing can happen this is when a player buys csgo on an alt account and plays competitively the game will think this is the players first game so they match them up with some inexperienced players this smurf can destroy the other team singlehandedly and sometimes it can ruin the experience if you are new to the game sometimes these smurfs can mess around not taking it seriously they can mess with your game not try and ruin the experience for the team the smurf is on not a great community most people you meet in this game are s if you solo play mm you can be kicked easily sometimes a group of 4 will kick the 5th unkown player in the first round just to play with the people they queued with only and a bot you can even get competitive cooldowns from this sometimes people on your team are just  so they can sometimes teamkill you if you irratate them in any reason people can also just troll by not even trying the whole match they can purposely stand in front of you to annoy you the whole game tell the enimies your teams positions through chat or more theres no way to stop them if they have a friend with them because the friend will vote no when you try to kick the troll overwatch is a great idea but not set up well it can take a while to ban a while for a player to be banned after they are reported which means the grieferhacker can run rampant in the community for a week or two before being banned cheaters everywhere in higher level games some hacks are detected by vac but not all most games at very high skill levels have a hacker and like i saidm it takes a week or two for them to be banned then they can just make a new account and buy a new copy of the game it can get annoying scammers everywhere when you post a trade on csgolounge you will most likely be added by a bot who tells you to see his screenshot which is actually a virus if you click on it you will most likely lose all of your steam items there are many ways to be scammed such as saying your skin is factory new while its field tested and more valve is cracking down on scamming though so hopefully this wont be as big of a problem in the future overall this is a great game and you need to buy it asap worth every penny i would even buy it if it was $60 its great to play with friends and its fun to play by yourself its a game where you challenge yourself to get better its the only video game that feels like a sport there are some cons but the pros outweigh them buy this now

recommended
as a veteran player having played since beta 54 thats the original beta in 2000 i have to say theyve done a great job at updating this game and still giving it the classic counter strike feel the competitive matchmaking is well done and generally keeps teams balanced even with a wide array of ranks on each team the new modes are great and definitely show that the devs are listening to their community if you like fast action round based strategic scenario game play then you should give csgo a shot
recommended
really great game double thumbs up d
recommended

i played my first match of casual csgo and straight away realised this is alot like garrys mod so i tried to noclip and was shot i then play my first competitive match and wondered why everyone had gold stars and aks so i went into paint and drew one to use as my profile picture then finally i was walking around office slighty more experienced at the game in genral learning grenade tactics and peaking ect i then came to realise that i had killed quite alot of people that round and began to be called a hackersmurf which obviously wasnt true considering i have 1 account and at the time about 5 hours game time so thats somthing to keep in mind note to self eveyone when they rage call others hackers and finally chickens i knifed one got hungry went downstairs made chicken sandwhich came back upstairs 30 minute ban 1010 would knife again

people yelled at me and said i was the downfall of our team i now suffer from low selfesteem 1010
recommended
i hate this game
recommended
i remember when counter strike didnt have idle lobbies so people can collect cases and guns just to sell them i also remember when you wanted to play competitive mode and werent stuck with 14 year old little boys who just like to friendly fire since the game went on sale for 4$ at one point every kid and their little brother has an account now if you are going to play with a group of friends this is a fun way to go if you want to be stuck with a group of random idiots then this is your game
recommended
the counterstrike franchise had its highs cs 16 and lows cssource but the newest iteration was damn worth the wait sufficient to say you dont need 16 anymore if you have csgo games 95 out of 100 a must buy
recommended
if your not global elite dont talk to anybody unless its your mom to buy you a karambit
recommended
tried to play arms race but you still run on feet 310
recommended
probably the best counterstrike game ive played so far but i still love cscz better and its singleplayer campaign deleted scenes kinda sad to see there is no singleplayer for csgo
recommended

counterstrike go brings a new element into the cs series that being the competitive aspect of it as well as other different forms of game types for the most part the entire game play of csgo is played around the competitive aspect of it competitive allows for a locked in game where you must verse your opponents in a 5v5 format the matches allow for progression in ranks and intensified game play csgo also contains the animated community market that sells skins for guns and knives unlike previous installments of cs csgo has its redefined graphics of classic cs maps which gives a brand new breath to the cs series and for that i congratulate them the shooting and the animation of the players is very vivid and realistic connection issues at times may harden the game play of the competitive side of it and trollers and smurfs linger behind much of the game but regardless of that csgo stands out with its new features

first things off half the screenshots are from the beta from 2012 so keep in mind the game looks a little better now than it used to with updated weapon models character models etc excellent multiplayer shooter a good successor to the old cs games of which i havent played a lot really but if you dont enjoy the classic defuse  hostage modes which have each been tweaked and changed for the better in my opinion you can always play the easy to pick up more casual style team deathmatch demolition and arms race modes too its great casually and competitively and the new matchmaking system means that you will always be put into a game with people of your skill level in competitive modes this is determined by the new ranking system that they also added which levels up on a number of factors but mainly how many competitive games you have won vs how many you lost the classic maps have been updated as well as some community maps being available for limited amounts of time in frequent operations that require the onetime purchase of a pass to have the maps available for you and anyone you wish to invite to your lobbies  games until the end of the operation can be compared somewhat to call of duty map packs there have also been recent updates including the return of two ctexclusive silenced weapons from the previous games and lots and lots of cosmetic weapon skins and stickers which can be placed on weapons both from valve and more recently the community workshop which can either be found in random drops during gameplay or by unboxing tf2style loot crates where you can also find rarer versions of the reskins called stattrak weapons which count the number of kills you perform with that weapon physically on the model tldr a good competitive and casual fps that is a wellexecuted update to the old cs games adding lots of new content and is constantly being updated on a slightly unrelated note the weapon skins utilise a fairly indepth wear and tear simulation process indepth enough that almost every gun is unique in its wear and tear which is very interesting and gets bonus points from me

this game is freakin amazing the tactical combat in this game is outstanding and its so immersive it feels like more of a simulator than a game obviously thats not a bad thing thanks to the sophisticated style of the game you rarely come across trolls and other people that destroy the gameplay the one thing i will say is that there are alot of accusations like he is a hacker or he is a noob this is fairly rare but even when it does happen the game is still good buy this game it will be one of the best games you get

some people didnt like my previous review for it being too serious let me write a new one in the theme of operation bloodhound this was inspired by thewarowl go check his videos out you play as an old joe who knows how to shoot expensive guns you learn how to buy weapons out of midair and create a succesful life in a bright summery weather town in south africa because you own a gun shop and south african firearms are  for some reason until youre hired by one of two people sebastien hennequet a deranged counterterrorist in the fbi more evil than most terrorists that wants to murder chase turner of the phoenix connexion for some reason except for the fact that the phoenix is all russian due to thier radio command mp3s and chase is not nice job sebastien or valeria jenner an englishman working for a russian terrorist orginization focused on not being led by corrupt government you know how they stop corrupt governments by bombing nuclear power plants in germany holding hostages in america and being overall idiots so this is a good game with a storyline involving a bunch of idiots i have to wonder where the  is spetznaz during all this

quick summary about counter strike the game isnt easy it requires eyemuscle synergy knowledge quick thinking ability all these can be achieved with a lot of practice its a team game if you are a solo player or those that blame the team for everything bad that happens you wont have fun playing and you wont be that good at the game that youd be if youd play with your teammates and not against them game is fun especially because it has countless games modes if you make your own team make strategies play together be good at the game and have fun that is the main reason why i keep playing this game after 9 years counter strike is a game where you have two opposing sides one wants to employ wickedness  known as terrorist sidet and other  wants to employ justice known as counter terrorist sidect there are many different game modes but these two are those that are played competitively in a professional scale bomb scenario the ts must plant a c4 explosive at one of the two designated bombsites in the map while the cts must prevent the c4 from being planted if planted cts must do their best to defuse the c4 and prevent it from exploding as it would break the game cts cant pick up the bomb and run away with it once a t drops it only a t picks it up again hostage scenario cts must rescue hostages that ts are keeping prisoners  there are 2 hostages every game that spawn randomly in designed places of the map cts just have to rescue one to win the round but they can rescue both counter strike is a fps where you dont play against a machine a programmed robot that has a set solutions to your specific actions you are playing against a rational organic enemy this is what makes this game so good because you never know what can happen you must memorize techniques guns spray patterns smokesflashesetc throws spots and many more in order to achieve victory for a casual viewer it might seem boring sometimes due to the slow points but for the player those slow points  are the most painful nerve wracking exciting aspects of the game that builds up tension until your mind fills up with constant thoughts of trying to outsmart outskill your enemies in the end all that preparation all that planning the team work the calls  it all falls apart every single round lets say that the bomb has been planted anything can happen from now on every action you do will influence the end of the round and most likely of the game that moment when you dont have anything planned you are improvising you are making milliseconds decisions that ability to make quick decisions to do not to think  is what makes you a good player how i get that ability you ask its simple that automation comes from practice you are a product of your past experiences in order to act without thinking you have to do the same thing over and over again get into similar situations do them again and again that will make you become automatic keeping yourself calm in delicate situations will increase the percentage of success the economics of this game are really worth mentioning i wont go too deep into them but they are really well calculated and thought as is the 5 player team size and the time limit of each round and there are many more aspects are really crucial the game implemented skins for the weapons some time ago at first i thought it was a materialist ideia but then i woke up to reality and understood that skins have made the community bigger and more active csgo has become an esport and it has a good percentage of being in the 2020 olympics  just as starcraft 2 and league of legends yes csgo is considered a legit sport by usa what i find great csgo has been growing  and now it is on the top shining

11310 amazing game but theres a few problems 1 its not casual and competitive mode its competitive and more competitive 2 it should be called counter of strike black awps 3 demolition mode only has one side trying to blow things up was disappointed 4 theres a game mode called arms race but you actually run on your feet but in all seriousness csgo is awesome its somewhat easy to pick up but very difficult to master it is a competitive 5 on 5 shooter and as such you shpould take that into consideration if you go to buy it if you do decide to bu this game its highly suggested that you have a headset as listening to sound is necessary as is being able to communicate with teammates you need to practice this game to be able to enjoy it

this game is amazing one of the best fps with strats doesnt rely on running and spraying takes more skill and focus more than worth the $15 and on sales it hits down to 350 definitley pick this game up

amazing i am at a loss for words really somehow even after the onslaught of cod games even after the brown and bloom torm even after the battlefield craze after the fps saturation epidemic of the last decade counterstrike remains the best game of them all why because they did everything the right way where other developers are forced to peddle required dlc to players taking $10 here and another $15 there counterstrike has always maintained the spirit of you bought the game you own the game in a way that we rarely see anymore while there are optional additions to the game they are in no way required to play the game in the best way possible no dlc guns that break the balance no exclusive content for special people who throw money at the game the game runs smooth this is rather sad that we have to think about this even today there are many games which fail to balance their performance versus features and theres a reason nobody plays those games six months after release just as counterstrike source redefined smooth online gameplay csgo is a mirror image of the original with extra shine and polish the graphics are certainly not cryengine 3 level but they are effective at presenting a unique style with excellent framerate and stability the game is balanced sure the awp is powerful and the ak is pretty overpowered at times but for just about any given match there are hardly any times where you will feel no power over your death some people are simply better than you are and they will kill you repeatedly and thats ok that is far more preferrable than having a n00b drop an airstrike on you with no way to prevent your own death the awp that the enemy has is just the same as the one you can buy each round so use it and get better with it so should you buy the game of course there is no other fps game which can hold a flame to the addictive fun and gratifying nature of counterstrike and this itteration of the series is no exception there are countless community servers to use if matchmakingcompetitive gameplay is not your style and the mods are glorious this game will be around for a while and trust me when i say your money will be well spent

once of the best competitive shooter games ever made highly recommend to anyone who likes any kind of competitive shooter everything about this game is spot on and has been on sale for great prices some more of my thoughts its pretty good now with the recent vac waves im lelem [2 ranks away from highest rank in game] httpiimgurcomvsnhygsjpg  if i am putting in 100% effort and as of the past week there was almost no hackers in all of the games i played its great the high level competitive scene is amazing too the pro teams and community imo is great there is some toxicity but you dont see it as much in the higher levels to be honest and at least in the us most of the time players are either just playing around or supportive and trying to be a good teammateplayer east coast also for the most part youll just be playing people in your region not many russians at all most likely if youre us based the game does have its flaws though but its definitely the best competitive shooter on pc if youve never played cs before yeah youre probably gonna suck in the beginning youll get better over time by simply playing a lot learning the game mechanics and also i suggest watching pros play also at higher levels in matchmaking you dont need to queue with people you know for teamwork usually at higher levels people can work as a team and solo queuing works fine so perhaps to get around one of the flaws of the game make a new account and buy a copy of the game for a new account and just play the living hell out of it until you feel as you are fairly competent with the game and how it works and how to win games then play on your main account some other things to note is how easy it is to just get into matchmaking right off the bat and how smooth and seamless it usually is its great even if you dont want to play competitively and just want to have some fun but in my experience you get the best experience by finding yourself a sweetspot in the middle somewhere where your opponents are not too good but they arent too bad either the devs are pretty good with updates and keeping the game fresh but at the same time there are some things that should have been fixed and implemented into the game ages ago and there is a small problem with the devs just doing updates that allow them to get more money music kits different skins stickers and such overall the game is pretty good and can be really fun and enjoyable if you know how to make it so it does have flaws but a lot of them can be fixed honestly just make it more like dota 2 and one last thing i want to say is that i think your experience will be greater with two important factors for the most part atleast how much effort and time you put into the game and how good you become at the game if you can become a good player understand tactics and mechanics and how to play and apply these well you will in general succeed and you will enjoy the game let me know if you have questions i consider myself pretty knowledgeable on the game and am fairly good if i feel like putting forth the effort

my opinion separately counter strike global offensive this is the best game in their traditions but it is not completed many elements it concerns matchmaking and anticheat the game loses all meaning when the enemy or allie use thirdparty software to simplify the game aim bot trigger bot wall hack sound esp seed trigger and other aimhelping software i think for honest players it is the main problem and the game becomes unbearable this problem should be solved by improving report system and fixing the overwatch bypasses that hackers use to not get banned in general in spite of all the nuances of the game is very dynamic and fun especially when playing with friends recommended

1 csgo is one from the best competetivecoop game ever 2game modes the two most populars are bomb site scenario competetive and casual competetive have good thing and bad i will try to explain why you can play with 4 friends in 5vs5 finding a game is very fast and very easy they are a lot of maps for bombsite scenario and hostage for the bombsite one the most popular are miragedust 2 inferno cache and sometimes overpass for the hostage one the most popular are militia and office most of time you are playing vs your ranks in 300615 im mnd most of time i was playing against mg1 mnd mge < dont know why it is censored the rounds take 2 minutes in a battle 10 sec in buying zone so 200010  2min 10 sec per round in competetive mode you have 30 rounds in total and you can win in couple ways winning 16 rounds enemy has surrender or winning 1515 which can give you a half of a winning most of time ranks are balanced but in silvers and global are most cheaters but you can get out of silver and in global you can play proparly without cheaters too because valve is still uptading vac valve anti cheat system which bans cheaters okey now bad things the smurfs are destroying the game and you dont have fun loosing 160 the bans for the competetive should be longer or if somebody is leaving or griefing all time just permamently ban the player it is very hard to spot a cheat such as bhop or teleportationyes it is possible now things about csgo good a lot of game modes that you can play you can get a lot of fun in this game game is not hard to understand you can run it on potato you get a lot of skins that you can buytrade or drop and use them most of weapons are balanced bad if you are vac banned you can make another account and cheat longer some maps are unbalanced sometimes vac error is for nothing the end

ultimate money maker of the 21st century okay lets get serious now this is my second csglobal offensive review and i am redoing it to explain my current experience with counterstrike global offensive just like every other valve game csgo is a great way to earn money that you dont even need to work for there are ingame items that are worth more than the game itself and some worth more than the valve complete bundle yes and thanks to the steam community marketplace you can sell all of these at whatever price you want but it is seriously recommended you stick with what its worth no one wants an xm1014  blue spruce fieldtested for $400 they would rather buy an awp  asiimov fieldtested for $57 but yeah just the other day i got a chroma 2 case at the end of a deathmatch match and im too lazy and too broke to buy a chroma 2 key so i sold it for $128 i got $111 in return valve needs tax right but there are 3 ways to earn money through this game and you will soon get a full refund price no kidding ways to get money 1 drops ingame items that are randomly gifted to players at the end of a match 2 creativity creating ingame items that you can publish on steam workshop 3 tournaments and mlg pro just being a good player and participating in tournaments is fine i would go with 1 as it is really easy but i cant stop using 2 its addicting to publish content anyway i hope you though this review was helpful now go  yourself and earn money worthit

i was top codmw3 player and when i switched to csgo i recived rank dmg after 200 hours teamplay is the most important thing in this game of course aiming skills too  but i played a lot of other games like league of legends in this game you need good communication with team because when you got them positions you can pwn them easily if you want buy csgo its cheap game  where  teamplay and communication is the first improtant thing aiming skills needed too you can practice to achieve better aiming you got many tutorials on steam workshop how to be better in this game if you are new player in this game you should read about spray patterns and recoil in this game its also funny game when you play modes like hide and seek or just normal match playing competive matches is balanced but in low ranks like silver and gold novas there is a lot of smurfs some times there is many cheaters in 1 month but next month they got banned so you need just to wait when i started playing csgo it was very amazing game in my life i recomend this game 1010 would bang very good game but play on low settings you can achieve more because of fps and have advantage on players game on 60 fps is ok but there is big diffrence betwen 120fps and 300fps good game valve

i do not recommend this game but i do the devs do not care about what the people want only what to add to the game or changing pointless sounds they do not focus on what actually needs to be fixed like the hitboxes ect there was literally no point what so ever to change the ladder bomb exposion  bomb timer it seems that they only listen to what the pros want or how to add new cases or knifes just to get more money in the long run at the start of the vac reshuffle the game actually felt playable for the first time in a long time but now every game i play on matchmakingor most games have cheaters in them or someone wall hacking and telling thier teammates where we are or the that 80% of the games ive played has had at least two people with new accounts its mind boggling to think that i have almost two thousand hours on this game and havent stopped playing even after all of the bs that has happend during the 3 years ive been playing this game but dont get me wrong im sure it is hard to keep up with all of the opinions that people have been saying they need to fix until something happens big with this game i will continue to be completely unhappy with the developers decisions also the game its self

as a player with huge heart for quake 3 arena i used to hate counterstrike without really trying to play it i just saw that people really camp a lot there and something like running or strafing isnt a real option there but the the summer sales on steam hit me right into my head and i decided to give cs go a try ive tried the cs 16 and source too but as it is now ppl mostly play csgo so i sticked to that i spend quite a lot of time on this game i dont think im bad guess some of my aim and call for fast thinking from quake was left in me  conclusion csgo is a nice fps game maybe too good graphics for me cause sometimes its really hard to see the enemy or to determine if its a friend or an enemy d anyway as long as its a team game i recommend playing it with friends because random ppl not always know what teamplay does mean have fun

well it could be a good game but there is something really messed up here the game crashes a lot sometimes most of them at the start of the competitive matches and if you cant connect back in time you get pentality i got 7 days of pentality now because the power went out and my pc restarted i cant really understand why cant they do at least something that checks that you left a match with error message or you even offline from steam suddenly all my pentalities except one was all the games fault any we payed for this game and sometimes i dont even had a hud or crosshair once it loaded me in the sky a didnt let me in i could watch the whole warmup but after that it ended and told me that i failed to connect the match in time but i was there all the time

cs was the game that started everything it also started a thing called esports and csgo will continue what cs started csgo is a skillbased shooter its not like cod where you just point & click here its different the spray paterns of the guns make them harder to controll unless you can manage to controll it if your new to cs its not going to be easy you would need to practice a lot and my rating is 1110 well obviously hackers abd bugs are there but its been amazing what the developers have done for the game <3 viva la go
recommended
this game requires no team based effort i wasted over $300 on this game through microtransactions this game turned me into a fat loney white child please buy this game if you want to be like me

this game requires a lot of practice for begginers im not saying im not a beginner cs go is an extremely high tickrated game which has been made extremely well i suggest everyone into fps should buy this and other kinds of gamers should at least think of buying one of my favourite games 1010

its basically hide & seek with guns loser dies

i must say this is one of the few games i like to rage on 1010

this game takes place in a situation of a terrorist side or a counter terrorist side you will either plant the bomb and kill the remaining counter terrorists terrorist side or you will kill the reamaining terrorists and defuse the bomb if planted counter terrorist side this game really depends on if you like tactics learning the basics and of course shooting  you will rank up by winning competitive matches by winning 10 comps you will resieve your rank skill level really this is an amazing game and i would definately buy it for the cheap $15 good luck and have fun 
recommended
defenetly worth the price tag if you want something more competetive than for example call of duty this is the game for you but i would not compare counter strike to battlefield nor call of duty since they have a completly different game style

hello my name is a lube product and you should listen to me counter strike global offensive is the bestest game i ever played for atleast 150 hours i did just get it 3 weeks ago and ever since ive been playing it over and over everytime i just cant stop i lost 100 brain cells for playing this game and there are many reasons why awesome skins that can we earned thru dropsmarkettradingopening cases opening cases depends on your luck and out of everything in csgo cases a knife is best thing to get i have never earned a knife i spended ateast 100$ in cases for knifes but my luck is  then cow  theyre diffrent kinds of skins special rarerarecommonnormal also diffrent colors you can earn sick money for some skins and items on your csgo inventory the rip off that i think is the keys 249 each without casecases are separated earn them diffrently if you are a vegas gumbler you will waste atleast thousand of dollars in this game there are also types of gamemodes deathmatchcasualcompetitive etc including community servers dont confused your little head with this game with call of duty also you can buy stickers

counterstrike global offensive source engine game the latest in counterstrike game series following counterstrike source new weapons physics graphics and so on well why dont i review it like i reviewed halflife because i dont like it i expected more from a 2013 game but i saw nothing new in csgo except for new weapons and sounds physics mechanics shaders  everything was taken from the other source games left 4 dead 2 for example i do not recommend this game for everyone who likes either both cs 16 and css or one of them this game will disappoint you after 15 minutes of playing  its just more casual easier to play you wont use new weapons you wont get impressed by graphics you wont get any pleasure because of campers all the way through so should you buy the game if youll delete it almost instantly i dont think so but for casual gamers this game is just what theyve been looking for lots of action easy shooting very comfortable spread and recoil gungame mode deathmatch and such kills matter deaths dont just like in call of duty i dont think id recommend it but its up to you to decide

as a former big time call of duty playerstreamer i found this game very easy the players that occupy this game dont even come close to the skill level required to frag a game like cod at a competitive level if youve played cod at a semicompetitive level i would highly recommend this game youll get easy frags and there are plenty of lulz to be had from the butthurt kids thatll rage at you over the ingame voip

it is an okay game and could be lots of fun but the real problem is the haters of noobs if you are new to the game most are just haters and not friendly this game takes time to learn to play and most are not willing to teach you much the same as in dota 2 if you are lucky to find someone willing to teach you then the haters harass them also and want to know why you are doing it sorry but this is true and if you are one one the haters remember you where once new to the game and not all learn at the same rate try to be more kind to your fellow gamer and help them out

this game is utter  there is no tactic involved there is no option to set up weapon sets weapons has to be bought over and over again in each match the community is a bunch of butthurt children who insult and votekick people if they are not going to do and play how they want it conclusion this game might be interesting for some 1216 years old teens but is not fun for somebody who is about 18 and more in to tactical games i cant recommend this game at all sorry

growth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if youre a call of duty player youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years for the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continues pieces of the counterstrike formula are dated at this point but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim counterstrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard but the changes are for the best  the underpass choke point in de_dust for instance has a new escape route even in the face of genre evolution global offensive doesnt care to adapt csgo is so dedicated to counterstrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in global offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters everyone is limited to what they have and can see with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages running and gunning is a useless play style even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill walking crouching or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fire consequently killing in global offensive feels good theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim if players arent watching corners providing covering fire or using smoke grenades and flashbangs theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman the desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better team if youve played counterstrike before global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counterstrike like counterstrike source before it global offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter while doing little to disrupt the core form and function at the same time it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort

tldr  counterstrike  global offensive will ruin your life so you like rpg games sometimes maybe a good ol beat em up well shut your mouth cause once you get into competitive csgo youll never play another game again youll make friends that the second you get online invite you to play go why cause theyre also addicted its been only 10 months of me playing and ive bought it twice and have over 1k hours combined between my two accounts seriously dont play this game obnoxious acting aside csgo is the best way of showing how valve still can manage games cause they really made someone else make this game in a great way csgo is a game where people will hate love and worship you all depending on how well you do in game it takes skill devotion and a lot of anger sheds tear valve added a microtransaction system that all in all is great as it doesnt effect anything in game theyre just skins thanks to places like rglobaloffensive csgo news is fast and quickly fixed youll read about people complaining about the cz so valve nerfed it and now people want it buffed again the community is okay for a fps but the professional side has never been emphasized so much before you get incentives for watching tournaments and betting on who will win causing you to research and begin to love teams cloud9  remeber the above statement it isnt wrong csgo ruined my outlook on other games for the better i now look for more team based games instead of run and gun cods released every other year this review is getting to the point where i should score the game though 1010 would ruin life again

this game is fun it has a few good game modes to keep you happy along with the community servers and the custom server mods and maps just like counterstrike source and 16 as well like source and 16 people manage to take this game too seriously at times so lets hope you know how to handle those types of people

not your typical hack and slash game uncomparable to the call of duty franchise without team work theres is a fine margin for success a player must be constantly aware of his enviroment understanding the locations of surrounding vantage points and flank routes one must also have the ability to listen for footsteps and with that information you can deduce an enemies locationglobal offensive also offers a wide variety of weapon skins allowing you to customize your weapons for a more pleasurable experienceso far i have yet to meet a hacker and csgo remains suspensful and exciting at every turn of the corner ps whatever you do dont peak an awp

i give this game a 810 pros yet another counterstrike game which delivers in every aspect of competitive and fun gameplay the transition between one cs game to this one may be difficult for some because it does differ but if youre a cs veteran and fan like me you owe it to yourself to buy this game if youre familiar with the cs games then you probably already know that cs is a blast to play with friends cs games take skill and practice and therefor its really fun and exciting to improve your skill and display it online in the competitve scene there is no other fps that matches the satisfaction of managing to pull off a 1v5 clutch or get an ace in the compititive game mode and this is where the game shines and will keep me coming back for more like recent cs games this is also a fps game with a long lifespan and great replayability global offensive gives us a big graphical improvement compared to the older cs games and adds a few new features into the mix popular custom community game modes from the recent cs games like gun game and deathmatch have been implemented popular in csgo as official game modes which i think is a great addition theyve added a few new weapons and gadgets a bunch of different and interesting tweaks on the original cs maps and theyve also added an official competitive game mode too here you get assigned a rank based on your skill and performances competitive mode is where this game truly stands out from other cs games but here is where most of the cons of the game lay cons firstly competitve and other official game mode servers are strictly locked to 64 tick servers this will be something that many will find very hard to get used to and personally i think its down right crap since every other cs game has 128 tick servers i dont understand valves dicision here do they want to earn more money do they care either way this is a problem that valve has to address especially for all the competitive players who really notice the difference secondly the vac system now this my freinds is the real issue with this game and in the perfect world this wouldnt have to be an issue but as we know theres always that kid who doesnt give a  and decides to turn on some of his hackscheats like the infamous wall hack aim bot or trigger bot now one should not have to want to play the game but at the same time not want to becuase theres a 50 50 procent chance to end up against a hacker in competitive matchmaking the vac system relies on player reports and people reviewing other peoples gameplay sounds good right well no the system bans in waves instead of on the spot some people can go weeks with hacks without getting banned all in all this is a great game and i would possibly give it a higher rating if they manage to address some of these issues but i definately would recommend this game to newcomers out there and the veterans

welcome to the next gen of shooters its a point and click shooter in which you only use one weapon awp and play on one map dust 2 the sarcastic comment is for a lot of reasons first of all camping is a big issue yes it is the players choice to do so but there should be some way to retain this from happening its seems most players afk on some rounds until they can buy the awp and then just sit there for 20 ing minutes im not exactly sure why people even bother using keyboards when playing this game secondly the aiming system is dreadful who ever though of this clearly wasnt sober let me explain the game states that you are playing as sas a highly trained group of marines that supposedly have been trained with firearms although when it comes to shooting a target two meters in front of you you can only hit it twice out of a whole mag also you are un able to use iron sights why although it has its moments very rarelywhen it is enjoyable 1110 would get shouted at by angry russians again

the valve anticheat system vac because nobody likes playing with cheaters playing games should be fun in order to ensure the best possible online multiplayer experience valve developed a stateoftheart anticheat system that automatically detects and permanently bans any player using cheats or hacks on a vac secured server what this means to you as a player is that you dont have to worry about annoying cheaters getting an unfair advantage and disrupting your game the valve anticheat system is only enabled on servers with the secured shield logo and only valve has the ability to vac ban a user while server admins may choose to ban players from playing on their specific servers they do not have the ability to vac ban players the vac system is automated and contacting steam support to report cheaters isnt necessary valve has a zerotolerance policy for cheating and will not lift vac bans under any circumstances

have to say this csgo is a great game a lot better than cod and bf i used to play a lot of team deadmatch and arms race since then i tried playing competitive how i describe it rage simulator since 2012 really read this if you are someone who enjoys life and never tryhard on games never play comp just never cuz the effect will eventually be you getting kicked by so called pros or you will get headshotted a lot and called out for noob and stuff so screw comp i may sound like a noob right now and its true im noob and i dont give a f note im not trying to offend all those cs players who play in pro leagues and stuff and the ones who are good at it

if you want a thoroughly bad experience filled with angry russian 12year olds who only know how to say   mother noob  & your not to mention an abundance of hackers and griefers then buy this game if you want poor gameplay that punishes movement with a great deal of rng in terms of what hits no matter how you aim even when standing still just poor hit registration in general then buy this game some fun to be had when playing with friends but getting in a cue with less than 4 people is just horrible getting shiny ranks is some validation that your time spent playing this abysmal piece of garbage has not been wasted but not enough if you buy it for any more than 4 you have been fooled

what can i say counter stike global offensive is one if the best fps i have ever played and yes i have play call of duty but this game is really simple its also helps your skill with reflexes and iq its easy to learn and when you do it you will see how fun it is although i think they should fix matchmaking so people who actually like the game dont get matched with quitters laggers trolls or just in general bad players aka noobs also some of the servers are a bit laggy but its all good by the time im done with this game i would have racked up 1000 hours  first game to do that overall rating 1010

well this game has some pluses & minuses im going to mention below pluses  very competitive & challenging online game for shooter lovers  big variety of weapons  got lots of weapon skins which you can tradesell  additional missions which gives you rewards after completion minuses  only few weapons have aimingzooming availability  damage system is bad you can empty whole magazine to an opponent on the chest & he still may stay alive  graphics aint that good for 2012  very strict rules in competitive mode especially leaving the match penalty it gonna give you cooldown even if you get disconnected from the game due to error & you cant fix it in 3 minutes cooldowns may be from 30 minutes to 7 days all in all i dont see other alternatives of this game in this genre & despite all its minuses i mentioned above it still remains one of the most played game in my list

counterstrike global offensive is a fps where you join either with the copsarmy or a terrioist and take out the opposite team its a basic cops vs robbers but the objective for the terrioists is to plant a bomb in a certain bombsite while avoiding or killing the counterterroists there is also another game type where the terrioists take some hostages and the counterterrioists must resuce the hostage and return them to the hostage zone there is 5 different modes excluding community servers there is deathmatch where u spawn randomly on a certain map and u can choose any weapon u want in my opinion its a great way for the beginners to get started in csgo next is arms race which is similar to deathmatch but u get a new gun every time u get a kill and when u got a kill with every gun u have to kill someone with a knife which is kinda hard another type is demolition which u get a new gun every kill u get but u must wait until the next round if u get more than 1 kill u are awarded with grenades casual is known as the most played mode which is technically the `actual` game which u must use the money u earn from kills and rounds to buy guns finally the most important one competetive where it is a 5v5 game however unlike casual where u can see the enemy on the map and even watch them u cannot see where ur enemy is unless u hear footsteps or gunshots it is important u cooperate with ur teammates if u wanna win cause thats the most important thing in csgo teamwork as of now there have been hackers who aim hack and shoot through walls when u cant do that normally many people have reported this but valve has done nothing about it but make updates for their guns when they clearly know theres hackers and thousands of people hate it i would give this game 10 out of 10 but since there is hackers and smurfs who pay another 15 or 7 bucks just to kill newcomers when its not fair i give this game 7 out of 10 the reason being is hackers and smurfs take 2 away and the servers take 1 away what i mean is that csgo servers randomly go bad making most people on the server have a high ping

only bad servers in official matchmaking 64 tickrate though 128 is possible and official leagues run with them a lot of cheaters and hackers around with a million of fake accounts due to valves failing anticheat system and their cheap offers for this game after ban waves as a result youll have to play vs hackers or lagging players from eastern europe or russia in official matchmaking on bad servers another minus are the lack of good maps only a few have be proofen to be playablefair weapon skins are ugly and most of the time the skins are only new textures on old guns stickers which are placeable on your guns fulfill this hellokittystrike if you have played cs titles before you have to be disappointed this has nothing to do with counterstrike anymore but if you prefer to play a casual cod clone you might be happy though

if this is a fps game claiming to be the leading competitive game in the genre you should have the following  proper netcode and hitboxes especially in hit registration area if i shoot the enemy four times and see four separate blood stains on the wall behind him i expect him to get four hits if im not suffering from bad pinglaglost packets this is not how it happens on csgo you can never be sure about how much damage you have dealt and how much will it take to finish him off because your hits dont register 5stack competitive mode in this age of online gaming i would expect to play with my team against various teams around the globe which makes competitive really competitive getting thrown in with four  who swear in their native language and do random team damage trolling in general against a 5stack is not fun and i dont think it wont be fun for them either decent community switching between this and red orchestra 2 is like having cancer beating cancer and getting it back again if your community mostly consists of 1216 year old players who think they are the best because they get sum awsum killz and refusing any kind of friendly advice or criticism or even formed tactics for the round you cant claim to be a competitive game a competitive fps game requires serious and especially strict moderation if its based on random matchmaking no griefing should be allowed leaving before game ends should lead to permanent ban after a couple of times instead of overwatch which is recruiting everyone with 150 wins and nova i rank a professional or semiprofessional team should be established without moderation the game easily turns into wild west these are some but not all reasons im uninstalling cs for the second time from my computer i hope never being bored enough to get back into it i know that these points have been discussed thousands of times and my addition wont really change anything but i had to write this after 700 hours

this game is a nice tactical shooter metagame is really big it takes a long time to get into if youve never played a cs type game before but its pretty fun once you get to the 30 hour mark and start playing competetive you have to be pretty rich to afford this game in the long run though because of all the broken keyboards when playing matchmaking with randoms and opening cases will drain your paypal account faster than you can say stattrak butterfly knife  fade

get screamed at simulator 2014 1010 would cry in a corner again
recommended
counter strike go has to be the best fps game i have ever played the game beats others as you have to learn each map individually and work as a team if you want to win however there is one problem to get skins you open cases and once you open a case there is no going back one case leads to another 10 which lead to another 15 and so on i would definitely rerecommend this game to fps players who are looking for a great competitive game

just check my hours my 6 month old boy is now 3  work turned into the dole 2 years ago i own a $400 knife tho i now have no life  but its a ing epic game
recommended
why can i review the game when i dont have it in my library best gaming community to date
recommended
to all who want this game i give some words of advice if you have a busy life packed with many things to achieve or accomplish i would not recommend getting this game this game even though one of my all time favorites will suck all of the time you want to do other things with straight out of your life however if you are ok with this welcome to the party this game is filled with cheap one shot deaths p90 rushes aim and wall hacks smurfs griefers trigger and chat spammers oblivious quitting newbies impossible lifewasting achievements and team harassment and cussing through every second of the game if you want a shiny new knife dont count on recieving one without spending at least $50 as for guns you are kitted with stock policebrutality weapons that can be traded for guns with more style or better patterns new gun skins range from 4 cents to more than 100 dollars top those epic guns off with some one time placement stickers and your changes mean nothing at all unless you have a knife or gun worth more than $5 on the bright side this game is very thrilling and timeworthy on the good days you need to anticipate the opposing teams actions and work with your team in any match you play if you set up a competitive queue with a well built team of friends that you can work with and understand their play style the game becomes an excellent source of entertainment where you can show off your skills as a team being a game of competitive electronic sports you play a game that professional team gamers play giving you the same qualities and giving you the opportunity to relate to what they do in life allinall what is better than traveling the world busting baddies and defusing bombs

counter strike global offensive is like that dog you wanted you have fun and you enjoy it but there comes the bad parts such as the barking or yelling complaining and this new case system its the lottery you never win there are alot of good things such as creative gamemodes the strive to be good and someday be as good as fr0est and enable console in your options and do the command cl_right hand 1 or 0 its when you have the weapon in your left hand instead of your right it helps me never ever spray running forward with the ak please valve nerf

the csgo workshop community constantly amazes us with weapon finishes and stickers of increasingly high quality we have currently shipped over 70 weapon submissions made by the community and all together csgo weapon finish creators have earned over $3 million with each finish earning over $40000 on average since shipping the first community case weve gathered and responded to a variety of contributor questions common questions include how do i get my submission in a case and what can i do better to get my work noticed these are useful questions to answer for all contributors so weve outlined our answers in the form of contributor tips below tips for contributors submit only high quality designs that were made by you the entirety of the submission must be your creation no clip art it must be original content and if the work is the result of collaboration then every contributor must be listed in the contributor revenue share the designs that you submit must be of high quality in execution showing your process is a great way to stand out and demonstrate the quality and originality of your work for weapon finishes consider making finishes for weapons that have few high quality submissions some weapons dont have a lot of high quality finishes submitted for them duel berettas and negev for example making high quality original finishes for those weapons is great way to stand out and increase you chances of making it into a case keep in mind each item in a case gets an equal share of the revenue vary the techniques themes and finish types and try to experiment with new ones when putting together cases and capsules we look for items that vary in technique and theme technique is the type of artwork that is used graphic patterns and hand painted designs are examples of different techniques example for themes would be finishes that look scifi or military if you are making finishes for a particular weapon you may want to make one with a technique or theme that is underrepresented or hasnt been attempted yet certain types of finishes are also underrepresented in the workshop in particular finishes that allow for flexibility in the way a pattern is applied to a weapon these offer players a chance to get a unique version of a weapon finish dont fixate on bold designs cases and capsules also contain designs that vary in saturation and contrast currently on the workshop we see many high contrast highly saturated designs these designs can be identified from a distance but equally important are designs that are subtle enough to only be noticed when held as different players have different preferences when it comes to broadcasting their weapon finish choice try making designs that vary in saturation and contrast sometimes making a subtle design is actually harder than a bold one dont forget about popularity getting your finish upvoted and noticed is a great way to demonstrate desirability and collect feedback that will help you iterate on it one of the factors we use to gauge community interest is the popularity of a submission hopefully this information is helpful when you are making decisions on what to work on we look forward to seeing even more amazing work from the csgo community

the best game  no other words to explain 
recommended
been playing cs for years and although i hated this game at first it has grown on me and has turned out to be pretty awesome still needs some work but it has a bright future best fps game period cod and bf players go home
recommended
its a darn fun game but there are some kinks that need to be worked out in it for example when i change a map i crash
recommended
you can reload and defuse a bomb at the same time 1010
recommended
cs go is a fedorable game the only problem i have with it is that there is not enough fedoras actually there is none which is a disgrace us gentlemen deserve to atleast have fedoras in the game but over all i would give this game 9fedoras10
recommended
it is great to play with friends but i dont have any so
recommended
very interesting and quite challenging game i recommend this game for people with good accuracy in fps games
recommended
i havent played cs since 14 when steam first became mandatory to play which i boycotted back then anyway i bought this on summer sale last year 2013 and only recently started playing i really like it and definately recommend this especially when its on sale its pretty much the same old cs but with enhanced graphics and new maps also there are new playmodes which are nice playing with bots to train is also very easy and perhaps even recommended to get used to the weapons and maps the only bad thing i would have to say is like on every team based game your team makes a huge difference if you happen to be against better team you just lose not that loosing is bad mind you i see a lot of players quitting when they realize the team has no chance trying to keep up a good killdeath ratio perhaps all in all a very good legendary game that you should definately try
recommended
the best game in the world
recommended
its a good game takes a lot of skill not just your average run and gun shooter game has a nice competitive system although matchmaking can get upsetting at times at the early stages valve never really cared about the hackers until a later date id say 95% of cheats are no longer working so the game is pretty safe for now 1010 id play it alot
recommended
this is a game that needs skill  not recomended to cod players 
recommended
very good shooting game
recommended
game is so fun and i cant stop playing but i ing hate this  man
recommended
totally skill based shooter the only thing that is op is teamwork skill and positioning
recommended
really enjoy playing this game with friends
recommended
the fps everybody who played call of duty wanted
recommended
really nice and fun game
recommended
good game buy it
recommended
awesome game not having played 16 but a bit of source mostly casually and messing around with friends i think i can still safely say the game has retained what made the earlier titles so fun and addictive playing csgo till 530 in the morning yay  good for your marks d at least it was on a saturday haha and it has a nie skill curve which most games dont have unfortunately i basically started playing fps games with bf3 and i got more hours into it if you are new to cs and the maps you will get totally owned at first but dont worry play deathmatch and some classic casual and it gets better as you play dont forget to play competitive too though as it is way more fun and the matchmaking system allows for a semifair approach for newer players except being matched with complete  every once in a while the leroy jenkins type of ppl that run into b on dust2 as the first guy  with the bomb  and get shot  overall the game allows for loads of fun though ad interested in playing it more seriously you should easily get a few thousand hours into it 250 hours for me and not planning on stopping anytime soon 
recommended
the only downside of this game is the amount of hackers in the midhigher level play of the competitive ladder other than that this is the most fun i have had playing a counterstrike since the early 16 days if you love counterstrike i would recommend jumping into this one
recommended
people dont care if you are good in this game they just care if you manage to get a 1000 dollar knife
recommended
top
recommended
if you have the money to buy weapon skins you will dodge bullets
recommended
love the game completely one of the most involved team required competitive games ive ever played im going to have to stop playing soon the kicking is stupid people ask me to kick them because they have to leave and i vote to kick and i got a 7 day ban from competitive play that is  that makes me very mad because im doing what my friendspeople ask and i get a ban and it is stupid 1 day ban for leaving a competitive match i completely understand voting to kick somebody and getting banned for 1 week is outrageous this needs to be solved many of my friends have quit playing due to this reason im nearing that stage please fix this
recommended
great with a team of friends just dont solo queue unless you want to lose brain cells by getting matched up with toxic players and people who go 016 because they dont know what the word communication means
recommended
as cs 16 player i got used to this game aswell 9510 also knows as weapon simulator for gabe newell

i would cut my balls for this game

it is an awesome game but you can easily get banned on comp so you really have to be careful about that if you are a new player start with casual and move your way up to comp this is not like every other fps this game you have to study the recoil and make good habits with your mouse if you want to spray if you chose not to spray you can always single click for powerful damage overall this is a pretty fun and awesome game and i would sugest it for people and their friends if they really want a fun fps

would i recommend csgo depends obviously its a very well known title that almost everyone knows but its a very competitive game and i wouldnt recommend it to someone who likes more casual games but however theres still a lot of quirky game modes like jail escape and surfing but then again some other valve games tf2 for one which is free have some of those already if you are a guy who likes a challenge and wants a competitive skill based game i would really recommend csgo its got a lot of replay ability especially if youve got some friends to play with
recommended
cool p

the great cs saga continues with csgo a good upgrade from 16 with maps being a little bit tweaked with in a goal to balance maps to be less oneteamsided it is different from cs 16 some people still prefer 16 by the way but its not similar a tiny bit to any other modern multiplayershooters like call of duty series and ghost reconphantoms csgo is a game that requires the most skill of all multiplayer modern shooters and teamplay can be as hard as it is fun sometimes and that is what makes this game so good its not just about shooting people its a lot more about movement planning patience and timing one thing i do have a problem with however is not a big deal not a thing that happens all that often is a certain hand grenade scenario whenever you run and you get hit directly by opponents hand grenade he flashbang smoke decoy you actually get blocked by the grenade and it distracts you from moving for a precious 0510 sec there is some argument for it to stay that way i reckon if you get hit in real life like that you wouldnt just go on like nothing happened but the whole thing feels glitchy its a thing that should be fixed

its right in the middle of source and 16 in terms of gameplay and feel and now with addicting skin collectables
recommended
just buy it
recommended
very good game recommend everyone to buy and play it 1010
recommended
csgo is a competitive fps with a highskill ceiling and rewarding play the amount of time and fun you can get out of this game for the price is extremely worth it
recommended
main point of game is to be the biggest swag of all time and best trader doesnt matter if you hit  the only important thing is how much $$$ u spends for skins and how many poeple u scammed and dont forget more knifes more swag pros microtransaction u can spend thousands $$$ for virtual knife fair and clear to understand rank system really fair matchmaking system u will learn new languages because your teammates dont speak english u meet really nice people usually about 12 15 years old which always know how to play operations its something like dlc but after some time volvo delete all content from it and u mast buy it again realistic weapon animations best bots ai of all time awp one shot one kill quick scope so when u ever plays cod game u will be there home great camp sim incoming nerf of all weapons hack are easy to find in incoming update volvo implements them into workshop cons some people doesnt care about skins and trading they talks something about playing game and winning obviously they dont know what theyre talking about just report them for griefing no spraylogos i miss days when connecting to server means download tons of gay porn from there no user skin my old material wallhack for css now doesnt work its too expensive not enought hackers no hats needs more chickens must have game final verdict dragonloreawp10

after having 500 hours on counter strike source i thought id try the sequel im not going to lie but the first few matches playing csgo i didnt enjoy it at all but i gave it another chance and i knew what i was missing this is the best tactical fps shooter i have played there is a huge learning curve on this game espeically if you are going from counter strike source or 16 to this however once youve got round 10 hours playtime youll find yourself progressively getting better if you have friends  get them on board to play competitive game modes are almost always won by communicating with your team if you dont have friends  it doesnt matter  competitive matchmaking puts you up against other players with the same skill level as you the same with your teammates you dont have to play this game competitively you can quickly hop into a casual game which doesnt affect your rank or one of the community based servers which are just as fun it has something for everyone  if you get tired of the original game modes then there are loads of mods to choose from the community servers espically the zombie mod servers which is what got me into counter strike in the first place 1010

day one eh its alright kinda weird few weeks in learning the mechanics thinking some are broken few months now you start to feel like very other game is sloppy  broken  needs the mechanics hits a thousand hours  most idle but god damn this game will consume you while hate it the glory of victory is too great and you can never get the same rush as you do in this more often than not this game requires skill over luck which is great still has its issues i understand the desert eagles accuracy as in the older games it was ungodly but what it does need is a damage buff as it does effectively shoot sniper bullets so it should be slightly weeker than a scout  ssg 08 has the scopeaccuracy and slight damage advantage whilst the deagle could be fired faster at close range and is cheaper also crouch accuracy isnt as good as it was early csgo they should buff that slightly as you can be crouching perfect shot 64 tick server and it will be off at anything past mid range i highly recommend this game but at the same time the amount of  you become aware of will make it irritable to play this game and any other shooter basically partaketh the fruit best shooter but once you get good look into better than valves free servers

probably my favourite game except for when you go away for a week you pretty much lose all your skills and have to regain them but it has a great community as long as you dont play in a team because if you do they talk  and call you gay and  but its a really fun game to play especially when u just block them so they cant say shot kill someone with a p90  youre a fuc noob noob weapon kill someone with a p90 through a smoke  youre a fuc hacker kill someone with a awp  youre a fuc noob noob weapon kill someone with a awp through a door  youre a fuc hacker in a 1 vs 5 you die  youre a fuc noob in a 1 vs 5 you win  youre a fuc hacker kill someone with a headshot  hacker get headshoted by someone  owned and get teabagged kill someone with a grenade  luck get killed by someone with a grenade  ahahahaha get teamkilled by someone  get out of the way you fuc idiot accidentally teamkill someone  youre a fuc idiot blocked by someone  dies accidentally blocks someone  get out the way you fuc idiot decide to save  youre a fuc coward decide not to save  save you fuc idiot kill someone while defending the bomb  you fuc camper kill someone while defending the hostages  you fuc camper someone dies  the deceased one starts to rage your team lose the round  your team starts to rage your team is losing 102  someone rages quit go to the balcony in italy  you fuc hacker worst guy receives a drop  are you fuc serious warm up  everybody tries to spawn kill score is 51 in your favor  this is a t map score is 15 againts you  this is a ct map lose the first 2 rounds  someone asks to get kicked last round  everybody buys negev your team is loosinh and you are in last  someone vote kicks you win a match  all enemy team rages lose a match  yout team rages someones internet crashes  30 minutes ban your internet crashes  7 days ban 1010 best rage simulator out there

just started playing and trading love it already
recommended
very fun and entertaining game i like being called a  and noob by global elites i also like wasting money on buying skins and cases i reccomend you buy this if you dont have it
recommended
one of valves biggest hits counter strike used to be fun only when playing lan or with friends now playing it online is like never before atleast in my opinion skins are awesome in this game and the fact that you can actually buy and sell them with real steam wallet money makes those skins very collectable plus new mods in the game but to be honest the best new added feature to the game is the chickens gotta love em xd
recommended
good game if u liek counter strikez u should buy it also surfing is cool and the competitive mode too but when valve adds 128 tick servers eventually it will be even better 8510
recommended
counter strike a game where youll easily spend hours on casual matchmaking just to git gud enough to take on people in competitive where youll get absolutely demoralised by the sheer god like accuracy and bullet placement of people from countries you cant even say without putting on an accent and turning your lips upside down if you want to learn lifes greatest lesson play counter strike that lesson is that no matter how good you think you are an awp will drain your lifeforce faster than a one way ticket to an amsterdam brothel with an access all areas pass to the red light district 210  ign i mean the sheer lack of any real console friendly interface and community blew our minds well make sure that we never play any other fps again unless we are paid to do so in other news call of duty advanced warfare  game of the millenium we think so
recommended
45 too many russians in competitive though
recommended
always loved how out of all the fps games i stayed with this one its simple yet very complicated especially dealing with each guns recoil this game has been nothing but everlasting fun and the competitve matches are so intense and filled with excitement i dont think this game can ever become boring to me and to see it still coming with new content like maps and gun skins is amazing if you got money to throw deffinitely try this game for it is highly recommended and you will deffinitely worth your money

counter strike has been an epic franchise since my mid teenage years i have played presteam presource source and now csgo this game excels as all the others and brings more the feel of 16 that source lacked the recoil can be unforgiving so skill is required to control it its hard for other games to compare to csgo the quality of hitboxes and the fast intense maps provided you know the routes and are not wandering around aimlessly make this an instantly gratifying game despite the scandles in the professional scene this game is excellent and hard to not recommend to any age group
recommended
good game very competitive
recommended
this game is very fun and addictive it also supports my gambling addiction by dropping cases which cost ing 250 dollars to open only to get a gun that is worth 50 cents 710 is my finnal score overall i would reccomend if you can handle not waisting away 30 dollars on the community market the game would of been better without items
recommended
while this addition to the counter strike franchise is very different from all of the others it excels in many aspects as with any valve game the community is taken seriously and even a major aspect of the game weapon skins is powered by the community i find it to be a more relaxing game compared to the previous ones although sometimes i get a bit nervous just from playing competitive
recommended
this game is great it is a challenge and unlike cod you actually need to spend time on it to become skilled if youre tired of mindless shooting in cod this is the game for you
recommended
i like the part where the heads go boom im 12

csgo is a very hard and rewarding fps it has many things to put into play like the opposing teams money will they eco or save if you already dont know what they mean then by playing a few games youll find out there is a casual mode but competitive is where csgos heart is at its where ive spent most of my time and i pretty sure that i have became addicted to it playing 393 hours in the last two weeks while tests and school were still on for me if you came from cod it is a very different game and dont expect to have your hand held or fart around like many do in cod it is a better experence if your whole team is either friends or have mics also you can get skins for your guns aka camos at some low prices and even make some of the money back when you either upgrade your skin or just get rid of them all together you wount get good easily but overtime you will get to a good level one thing to be weary of opening cases is addicting you and alot more likely to beable to just buy the skin then get it from a case i just get mine off the steam market and it works just fine for me

great game
recommended
the game has much new weapons better graphics new or old game modes and more it didnt lose the typical csstyle which makes it good although there is two things one there is no spray paint sadly the one im talking about you can post the picture on the wall using spray paint two most of the weapons i used before in cs 16 like desert eagle which they nerfed it alot for those who havent played the cs 16 or source yet then this game is for you but if you played the previous counterstrike games before you might feel abit of sway decision in this one but overall it really captured the essence of 16 in my opinion rated 9510

very good game the ranking system could work differently tho

a rather competitive game a good game for competitive players

excellent economy and great gameplay dont be intimidated when you first start the economy is based around skins and looks because of that participation is not madatory to be the best player you can be this is a must have fps and it takes genuine skill to be good at it some lack the skill necesary and it is easy to learn the best parts about this game are the learning and progression as you play it more often it consumes you and you just want more from a glance the economy seems pointless why invest time in somthing that wont change gameplay it is another form of progression that this game is centered around each time i play i feel that ive gotten better clear downsides you might be used to fast progression and it takes time to get good at this game that is really all of the downsides i can clearly see i recomend this game to anybody with appreciation for fps games games with economies and games with genuine progression
recommended
this game is great defintly recomend it if you like fps shooters

great game but there is too much money involvet

csgo is a very good fps game with high quality and balanced wepon shooting the other versions are more difficult to get in compepetive but csgo matches people with your level and i think it is very good
recommended
csgo is the most recent entry to the counter strike series if youre not famillar with this series its an online tactical first person shooter developed by the good old people at valve with hidden path entertainment helping with this entry it comes with much improved graphics compared to previous entries you must be precise and tactical with your movements the most satisfying thing about this game is mastering the huge learning curve it comes with and be warned this game is difficult compared to other shooters on the market but once you become a master at pulling off clean headshots with ease mastering each each weapon trust me youll be satisfied plus the game has workshop support various skins for each weapons new versions of classic counter strike maps dust office etc new game modes are introduced whilst classic game modes return and at a fair price you could do alot worse definite must buy

you dont get better at this game you only get slightly less worse 1110 would let valve take my money again

for all the hours on the game that i have its a game where it will suck you in until you get bored of it i dont like the game because there are too many players that do all the things that people do in cod and for that fact i would recommend the game if you are a hardcore devoted pc gamer that has the time to put into it if you simply dont have the time dont play it dont trust me im out everybody

counterstrike global offensive csgo has to one of the best multiplayer shooters i have played its fun it requires skill and alot of team work to win even though i always get put in games with russians but thats not the point the point is that this is not cod you cant just charge at the enemy and expect to win you have to think of a plan first then if that plan fails it usually ends up with a plan b or every man for their self however i have 1 major problem with this game the in weapon skins we should not have to play loads more real money just so our guns look cool because we already paid for the damn game surely they could have made some in game money so that we dont waist our money we caould spend on more important things and if they really want to keep their money grabbing ways maybe they should make it so you can also buy the ingame currency as well as earning it because in my honest opinon this ruined valves reputation for me now when i mention the ingame currency most you are most likely thinking but then everyonne will just buy the same skin as eachother then so no i didnt mean like you can buy guns seperatly i meant that its still just cases and keys but with ingame currency instead of my real money wow i only wonder how many spelling mistakes there was in that oh wells this game gets a 810 from me because its very addictive i just dont like having to pay real money just so i can get nice skins
recommended
you have seizures cant aim straight for  mouse is your enemy or maybe youre blind this game is for you this is the only game where you spray down the enemy by aiming not at him sniper rifles are the exception of course you have these nasty onetapheadshots but who cares all you have to do is to put your crosshair below your enemy and move it leftright and youre be gonna called a god sounds good right theres more  ever wished that using terrain to your advantage could save your life now its possible a single wooden step can cover you from a grenade lying 05 m from you oh and did i mention chickens counterrealism global addiction
recommended
one word amazing
recommended
when i play dota 2  cs go i wont stop cs go is complete game
recommended
very fun and addicting to play it will be hard if you are new to the game so start off playing in casual before getting onto competitive it sucks when you have crappy teamates though

looks better than source  more guns what more do you need if there was ads it would be near impossible to put down 
recommended
i grew up playing counter strike 16condition zero and sourcei used to play those games every single day with my friends and i remember those days with joy because those were the good old days when we would gather up and lose track of timethe single most important factor of the games succes is the competitivnesseverybody from the neighbourhood wanted to be the bestand this is why it became one of the most popular and most played franchise counter strike  global offensive was considered by many at releasenot a worthy successor of the cs franchisethe graphicsthe movementthe weapons even the maps were brought up as reasons of the game actually being inferior to the old onesbut as time passed people got used to the game and learned that change is sometimes good i feel like the game really offers a lot for its priceits a modern fps with key characteristics of the cs gamesthe game does not forget its predecessors the constant patching and updates that are coming from valve are making the game better and better and i personally think that it has surprassed the quality of the previous games by quite a margin csgo unfortunately has been launched in the era of the moba and cod vs battlefieldthe game has too much of a competition now to ever reach the level of popularity that this franchise had neverthelessthe game is solid and if you are a cs fanyou will enjoy it for sure

really fun dont play this unless you got money for skins lennyfac3

csgo is a great game with great 5v5 competitive mode where everything is super intense especially when your whole team is expecting you to clutch the match while your up against 345 more people the only bad thing abot csgo for me is that it crashes sometimes causing me to get banned for 7 days from competitive mode which is really the thing i like best you also get kicked for absolutely no reason on comps which is completely funny when you just start swearing and calling them retards in your head overall a great game to play and a mustbuy
recommended
ive played this game for a total of 2 minutes and can say that is without a doubt the worst game i have ever licked in my life this monstrosity is overall just an adventure about two ing gay dogs who walk around and are just a bunch of inappropriate people in general this game is not for kids because the dogs sometimes dont even say their pleases and thank yous what the heck valve i thought you were a family based company man i ing hate this game so much this is a game about dogs
recommended
its a point and click adventure

counterstrike global offensive is a simple game  its nothing like call of duty series or other fps games  no assaults  no air supports  no flags  nothing  this game is based on cs 16 which is the most popular game ever inherited all the guns from 16 and has few items added to it plus it has amazing guns  you could actually feel the art on your hand in this game  totally worth buying and playing 1010
recommended
great game great fun and not a pay to win awesome

i r8 88 not too many b8ers

this game is very good and you will enjoy every second you play if you dont discover the csgo market buy and selling knives cuns and anything with a big price tag will get you spending all your money on it

great game for any fps fan even if you dont like fps games buy it because youll have a great time
recommended
if youre a first person shooter lover buy this play it love it
recommended
counterstrike global offensive is the latest installment in the counterstrike series nothing much has changed in this installment other than updated graphics veterans to the series are going to love counterstrike global offensive but newcomers sadly i cannot guarantee that you will like this game even if you know you like the game the very difficult learning curve might get to you before you even have a chance to completely enjoy the game but its worth giving the game a shot to some its too old school and it lacks features the new flashy modern first person shooters have ads aim down sights sprint etc but in my opinion this one of the greatest fps out on the market what most fps lack is a sense of competitve nature sure you can make bets and cmon bro 1v1 me bro ill smash you people but in my opinion its not enough if you love competitve gaming particually in fps then theres another point to counterstrike there are so many things that make counterstrike global offensive a worthy game in your steam game library for me to list so do me a favor do the counterstrike community a favor and pick up this game for around $1500 au dont know how much in other currencies im sure you can do the math >< youre getting a good deal operations which are like free dlc updates but have limited time on playing the maps that are released in the operation skins which are probably the most infectious disease in a game second to the infamous team fortress 2 hats and overall just fun u2late approves d notes sorry if there are grammar and spelling mistakes i typed this up without checking for errors sorry grammar nazis p like this up if you found it useful so others can see have fun
recommended
seriously  buy it  mind blowing
recommended
1010 would bang

one of the simplest and best shooters out there

one of the best fps games ever

thats game very very nice  buy it all

its the best counterstrike i have ever seen 
recommended
people have more money spent on skins than on cancer research this game is cancer
recommended
gave friend a crate unboxed a 2750 skin then unfriended me
recommended
this game is very difficult  but in the end this game is very beautiful 
recommended
this game is probably the best fps i have ever played the combination of teamwork and individual skill makes this game highly competitive this game highly outplays fps that involves little skill and no teamwork great job valve
recommended
1010 game love it
recommended
great game
recommended
the best online multiplayer fps in world from the best online multiplayer fps series in the world it has a great community great support valve actually ask what the people want and put it into the game it is extremely cheap for a aaa fps and it constantly goes on ridiculous steam sales and valve dont release a new game in the series every year like cod or battlefield meaning you buy it once and keep playing it for years look at css it kept growing and was played constantly for 8 years the graphics wont blow you away but they are still very nice meaning the main advantage to this is that it can be played on basically any modern computer at a stable framerate you can play it casually where you can just muck around and have fun and you can also play competitively and use complex tactics and stratigies making for a great teamwork experience so basically go buy this game now
recommended
great game <3
recommended
its a really good game i personally enjoy it a lot more than css or cs 16 because of the new physics and weapons there are some stuff that you could add or remove though
recommended
a trading simulator in which knives are worth more than actual knives  1110 will buy knife again
recommended
once you get into the game get a few good skins youll be stuck to the game there is lots of annoying 9 year olds though 810
recommended
it is in youre interest to not download this game it will take productive hours away from your life that you will never be able to get back again its too late for me  save yourself before its too late i could have learnt a language travelled the world found a purpose in life in the hours i have played this epic online game in all seriousness  do not download

best competivie shooter ever
recommended
this game is alot of fun when you master the weapons and tactics i would recommend playing with friends because russian people never seem to help you  blyat
recommended
valve is at it again blowing our fcking minds and remaining amongst some of the most respected developpers in the gaming community there is a genuine reason that one annoying friend is constantly playing it the controls are tight the guns are much easier to use but still largely skillbased except for the awp still op  that ruins the game for everyone else but i guess thats part of makes cs cs great for both old veterans and newcomers alike 910  amazing
recommended
shut up n take my money
recommended
great game
recommended
super duper competitive but fun it was alright 810 ign

very good game

what can i say ive played all the other counter strike games and this one matches those games perfectly with new graphics and the ability to spend hundreds even thousands of dollars
recommended
counter strike s my first fps game and ts new of the game i liked t
recommended
a world thats dominated by many fps games each with their own unique gameplay and style what sets csgo apart from the others well csgo is extremely detailed with every aspects of the game this includes gameplay which branches out on to sounds shadows and visuals balancing out the map layouts and economy of the weapons and the weapon mechanics are even accurate as it could ever be the recoils hitmarks and damage also not only the gameplay is amazing but cleverly valve took a big step into introducing skins skins are the main reason why people are now more interested in this game there is a plethora of skins in this game arranged in 7 subgroups  common consumer grade  uncommon industrial grade  rare milspec  mythical restricted  legendary classified  ancient covert  exeedingly rare melee weapons in each of these categories it is also in another subgroups of its quality such as  battlescarred  wellworn  fieldtested  minimal wear  factory new overall csgo stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety at the end what matters is not if csgo is innovative or more of the same than css cod bf but what counts is if its fun

the enemy was just better than you deal with it

counterstrike global offensive is the fourth in the series of the counter strike fps games but is it worth the money what is counterstrike counterstrike is a fps game based around 2 main gamemodes bomb defusual and hostage rescue in bomb defusual there are two teams consisting of 5 players each the terrorists and the counterterrorists players who die will not respawn till the next round the terrorists have to plant a bomb on one of the two bomb sites or kill the entire enemy team to win and the counterterrorists need to either kill the enemy team before they plant the bomb or defuse the bomb before it explodes in hostage rescue there are again the same two teams consisting of 5 players each however there are no bombs to be planted here instead the terrorists need to defend the hostages the counterterrorists are trying to free graphics the graphics in counterstrike global offensive are a big improvement over the ones in counterstrike source however are still a few years out of date as the source engine can only handle so much weapons countersrike global offensive is a big improvement from the old counterstrike source guns in countersrike source there were very few competitive weapons however in counterstrike global offensive there seems to be a bigger variety of ballenced fun to use weapons both casually and competetively gamemodes counterstrike global offensive adds two new gamemodes to the mix arms race and demolition arms race is counterstrikes version of the highly popular gun game it is a freeforall gamemode where getting a kill ranks you up to the next weapon to win you need be the first to go through all the guns and get a final kill with the golden knife demolition is a twist on the original bomb defusual the terrorists need to plant a bomb in a building whilst the counter terrorists need to either stop them from planting it or defuse the bomb before it goes off however theres a twist much like arms race you need to get a kill to rank up to the next weapons getting more than one kill will grant you extra grenades for the next round the team that wins the most rounds wins competetive counterstrike global offensive is a massively competetive game adding skill emblems that and a seperate matchmaking system just for competetive the skill emblems are reanks that increase the more competetive wins you get they also determine who you get put with in the competetive matchmaking there sadly only a few maps for competetive play and lots are in favour of one of the teams these are my opinions on a few of the maps dust 2 is fairly t sided inferno is ct sided nuke is ct sided train is ct sided aztec is ct sided etc camos and cases the case system is a new addition to the game there are crates that you can find by playing the game trade for or buy off the market there require a key to open which cost around 2 and when opened give you a random camo the camos are purely cosmetic items that are reskins of the original arsenal the value of the camo may vary depending on the gun the camo is for the quality tier of the camo the look of the camo itself and how rare of a drop it is verdict counterstrike global offensive is a huge improvement over the already great counterstrike source that adds lots of new content such as gamemodes weapons maps and the new case system and is a huge bargain at the low price of 1499$ 1399 and 1199 8510
recommended
absolutley amazing game i may only have 4 hours into it but that doesnt mean that i dont like the game the game is a very competitive game you must have patience and skill in order to play this game

counterstrike is my all time favorite game i have spent countless hours in competitive play and enjoy the hell out of the systems in place its unlike any other mp game out there and has not been matched in the fps genre developers are dedicated to the community albiet on their own pace you can play for hours and hours and still not perfect the game it is a living breathing game that continued to develop and grow both in the community and the game itself so much has changed since the late 90s in video games but there are those few exceptions that last through out the various shifts in video games counterstrike is one of them

coming back after a long hiatus from the cs 1315 days i started playing source occasionally after finding some cool people and servers that made the game fun again i was pulled back into cs and those long gaming sessions then i noticed there was a newer version called go i didnt really know what to expect from csgo but i had to give it a try at first it felt very different and i was put off by that it felt like i was lost in the maps and that id never figure them out because of headshot after headshot i was dying almost instantly so i started playing deathmatch for a few rounds now and then just to get a feel for the guns and see if id get a loot drop mainly i stuck to source eventually i started getting pretty good at deathmatch i made a few friends and found some regular community servers i enjoyed from there the game really began to grow on me now im enjoying the competitive mode overall the game no longer feels all that different from source the movement and pace is faster the maps are all familiar but nicely revamped and the graphics are really good but at the heart of it csgo is still very much the cs that we all know and love going back to source now that im used to go feels very dated and slow this was a needed update and one im thankful for csgo is an excellent version of our favorite game if youre still playing source on a regular basis you really should consider checking out go and not just one or two rounds give the game a good shot at winning you over like me i think youll find that its the best version yet
recommended
awesome waste of time
recommended
this is a good game >
recommended
this game is easily my favorite game right now the amount of teamwork needed to do well is really astounding and its really fun id recommend this game to anyone
recommended
i always play another fps like cod or battlefield instead of cs i just try this game and its very addictive because the competitive part and the stress when we play 1 vs 3 or something like that we can get item drops and thats awesome because we can sell them and make some money to buy more games its a never ending circle if you like fps you need try this and see how much fun you can get
recommended
good game  well balanced competetive game nut one thing i want to valve to fix  crashing  gettin 7 days of cooldown isnt cool when you crash while joining back to the competetive game plz valve fix crashing becaus i like this game
recommended
like i dont even know what to say probily one of my favorite games of all time
recommended
this should be the standard for shooters call of duty and battlefield are good games but they will never be as good as counterstrike this game gives you adrenaline when you are in a clutch gives you the satisfaction of one tapping with the ak and the sound when you dink with the m4 this can never be matched
recommended
worth it
recommended
lived and played long enough to be called a smurf 1010 good game
recommended
i never played counterstrike before csgo was the first cs i ever played and i love it great gameplay good graphics simple tasks and lots of missions the thing i love the most about this game is that you can actually earn cool skins you should definitely buy it
recommended
awesome game try not to get addicted to the case openings 
recommended
unbalanced please fix the following items   awp
recommended
i would recommend this game its easy to run and it is a heck ton of fun
recommended
there are little chickens that run around the map and dress up for holidays 010 needs animal diversity
recommended
1010 would play again
recommended
ive learned fluid russian from this game i also learned that a silver elite master can be paired up with silver is while the other team is paired up with navi i also learned that there are people who you drop a 50 bomb on in the entire game that turn out to be nova 3swheres my global elite  anyways 1010 ign
recommended
i am globally offended by the playerbase true to its name 1010 this game is the fire that keeps russians warm in their cold cold winters as your burning rage against them is their fuel it trains them to take other countries that do not belong to them and completely ruins your opinion on weird backwards letter language causing it to become a rageinducing monologue of pain this game is so overwhelmed by russians the word cika or whatever will forever ring in my ears due to prolonged explosure to them enjoy shooting guns at russians and practicing recoil control for 200 hours before being able to hit one as every bullet seems to blow into a different direction until you know the 80 patterns which go all over the place trained military hardcore badasses cannot control a little pea shooter and to end this review i will just say do not even attempt this game comrad only fun thing is getting russians angry enough to kill you twice and get them banned for a week and hear them whine about reporting and banning you which will happen anyways whether you annoy them or not
recommended
counter strike global offense is a great game unlike most fps games global offense requires strategy it makes you talk to your teammates this game makes you think hmmmsould i go to a or b thats my opinion though
recommended
counetr strike is a bit hard to get into but when you step foot into the battlefield the game seems to just get better may be better if they made beginner lobbies but oh well start to walk before you can crawl
recommended
nice game
recommended
i really enjoy the game its a clasy simple but complex in the same time 
recommended
poo is good when its in your mouth
recommended
great game a must have for any fps fan
recommended
endless hours of fun
recommended
you learn how to play the stocks and gamble 1419
recommended
great game would r8 88
recommended
this game is everything in the world to me
recommended
i highly recommend this game its a very skillbased game skill blended with gamesense common sense and lack of stupidity will take you far practice aiming in deathmatch or gungame then hop into competetive mode to see how you rank against all the other players out there aim for headshots theyll change the game use grenades effectively theyll win rounds or blow up your teamates with real recoil that takes learning and skill to combat a wide variety of weapons for your personal tastes and grenades that have the ability to provide huge advantages or losses you wont find anything better for an online multiplayer game that challenges you with a great compatibility for custom content on the workshop and excellent support for those who design the popular content you cant go wrong whether its minigames surfing or bunnyhopping that you prefer the workshop has it all and probably dozens of other things ive never even imagined possible
recommended
so ive really liked playing this game in the short amount of time ive had it but if you do get this game you must know this game is full of tryhards and sometimes even hackers hur dur big surprise it is the most lovehate relationship on the planet youll keep coming back to the game because its fun then get  on by some tryhard or a hacker dont get me wrong its a very fun game with some nice people to play with but the amount of stupidity is just so high if you enjoy yelling at teammates over the mic as you get insta domed by a smurf tryhard this game is for you
recommended
i bought cs go for joy soon realized it was just a ploy because the russians and polish soon arrived ed everything up and the game dived dived deep into hell but dont worry i still have my p90 avail
recommended
oh my god i love this game so ing much except from the bans _
recommended
very good shooting game i would rate it 1010 toast
recommended
i have almost reached 100 hours of intense gameplay and im still hooked welll worth the money
recommended
very good game
recommended
great game but valve need to sort out there anticheat
recommended
one of the best fps in pc gaming good gameplay with great community backing
recommended
its been 15 years and this game is still amazing although flashier games exist cs survives and thrives i strongly recommend this to any fps player
recommended
steam should be installed just for this game
recommended
one of the possibly the best first person shooter out there its not full of unneccessary animations that youll find in other titles the professional scene is outstanding not as big as other titles like call of duty which alledgedly has pro players also known as a bunch of teens who trash talk in a game filled with aim assist valve never dissapoints even with some nooks that need improvement such as the tick rate it is a title that delivers the graphics are good it is one of the most skill based games and do not try to get good at this game by donating to get some powerful characters gunfights action tactics strategy anything that you would see in a war this game delivers i would give this a good rating as the developers still have to do some work to satisfy some there is a bit of work needed to perfect this game and that bit is a point that i will be taking off of my rating 910 would recommend go out and get it now if you do not like it than you do not have the brain for a skilldemanding game unlike other developers that have their games die out in a few months some even weeks the community for counter strike global offensive keeps rising valve do not need to release a stupid sequel like some other publishers and developers do they know how to satisfy the player and they do not need so many dlcs that cost as much as the game i have gone past my point i think you can tell i am in love with it id like to thank my brother for making me switch to this from the scum that is call of duty
recommended
this game makes all the kids happy
recommended
this game is the best
recommended
when can we trade hats
recommended
dont buy if your not in for the long haul  this game is addictive
recommended
great game just awesome now before you take out your wallet theres a few things you should know first this is not like your typical fps for example you cannot aim down the sights on any weapon except the sniper rifles and the two weapons with the acog scopes but its not a big deal to get your accuracy you crouch witch makes you crossair smaller witch lets you pick off enimies easily second both the sniper scopes and the acogs blur when you move around but standing still will make the sight as clear as can be for the acogs its isnt a big deal but with the snipers its a huge difference there is also an inventory so you can trade different weapon skins knifes stickers and more overall great game worth every penny
recommended
gay as f$ 010  scrubs bestgame10  me

this game plays so well the ingame matchmaking system is pretty good despite what others might say the graphics in this game are better than in css enough to be a nice difference but not enough to blind you the buy menu in this game is a vast improvement over the previous ones where memorizing hotkeys were necessary the workshop and the combination of the operations makes for a game that doesnt get old 1010
recommended
this game is simply amazing  from 2004 to 20112012 it has changed alot there are lots of interesting skins this game has improved alot i love this game and it is worth buying 1010 love it

csgo is the perfect child of 16 but 1000 times better engine and graphics the different game modes are awsome demolition small maps and quick games couldt be excetuted better competetive filled with idiots downing your rank quickly  the only way to get a better rank is to play with atleast 4 friends and try to take care of the one tard that doesnt lissen or speak casual good ol cs 16 in a new body deathmatch long rounds with respawn on the normal maps you get to buy your own kit and try out or play with different tactics all and all its an awsome game 100% woth the money 9510  a new must have on steam
recommended
started from 15 went to 16 and now playing csgo no regrets even though there are cheaters rare that you encounter any the game is ing awesome 1010  would play again

cs always was good shooting game and people who like that type of games will like counter strike global offensive
recommended
great game 910 the only problem i have with it is when your internet goes out and you were in a competitive match then u go back and your banned from competitive for 30 minutes  7 days is the range of a ban length and i was banned from competitive for 7 days because i lost internet and couldnt do anything about it
recommended
love this game  
recommended
dust2 awps and kalashnikovs aside this game is utterly fantastic and you should play it the gunplay is fun and the variety of weaponry gamemodes and tactics at your disposal  coupled with the ludicrous amount of skins and stickers available  makes it all the better tldr this game is zozey approved
recommended
one of the best game ever its just that stuffs are freaking expensive 
recommended
very good game just a tip never play with random team in ranked game
recommended
just use the awp

recommended
the best shooter out there
recommended
very good skillteambased game nice community and good gameplay everytimeagoodtime
recommended
very good fun and pesonaly favorite fps i like the fact that you can play different modes from sneaking to gund blazing and it requires startegy
recommended
this game offers modes for the casual player and the competitve gamer it is very easy to get into the game as one can master the guns without playing competitive mode by several game modes namely arms race deathmatch and casual classic the high skill floor is high but it is a very good game overall the servers though valve please change them back please
recommended
like teamwork like strategy ya like shooting at  good me 2 tscts
recommended
the number of first person shooters out on consoles and pc are numerous and they tend to come out every year if youre into run and gun type of shooters where a microphone really isnt necessary by all means keep playing those games however csgo is a very addicting team based shooter however unrealistic it is it is a classic shooter that reminds people of their childhood gunning away on 16 or source if you have friends who play this game might as well buy it and start talking in jargon that makes everyone give you strange looks and just a tip if you have anger issues please for the love of god never solo queue in mm please
recommended
plays deathmatch wow er stop using this gun play the game right ok kills him again wow er you have no skill use the knife stop using the auto sniper you cant ing play this game you ing er  sucker i bet you suck  in real life er
recommended
fun but meowzor is horrible
recommended
very nice game 
recommended
great game may be repetative but it certainly doesnt get stale
recommended
the enjoyment of the game comes from being able to many things that are not accesible in other fps and strategy games counter strike global offensive is one of my personel favorties becaus eof the amazing fps action and the strategy behind the plan of attack there is a lack to the game though but it shouldnt affect how you play the competitive matchmaking the people who play competitive arent always what youd expect in sych an amazing game but those types of people are always going to be there
recommended
great game 1010
recommended
buy game get to dmg stay on dmg forever 1010

recommended
considering i spend all my money on cases and stickers and have no time for other things i would say this game is good
recommended
the one and only competitive shooter out there the one and only rage introducing shooter out there the one and only shooter where you can interact with verious kind of cheaters in case your blood preasure is too low play a view rounds on the very well optimized servers  against any people from everywhere around the world play it rage quit play again repeat 1010 would buy again warning this game can cause a major lost on braincells anger hate and autoaggressive disorder play with caution or leave it

recommended
highly recommend this game can be either fast or slow paced depending on what mode you play competitive mm is abit of a mess at the moment but it can only improve
recommended
better than cod
recommended
this game is great the graphics are nice and the gameplay is fun and its easy to understand the maps are creative and nice
recommended
fun stuff with a caveat this game is pay2win  if you dont open the buy menu and pay for your weapons youre likely to lose
recommended
best competitive shooter hands down
recommended
showing cod fanboys a real fps since the dawn of the genre csgo provides a real challenge and never ceases to be fun if you enjoy a life without knowing what the sun looks like buy this liferuining bargain
recommended
whoow  thats a great shooer game
recommended
64 tick matchmaking stick to it for now go buy some cases and get addicted to putting your money in this game its worth it
recommended
no aiming down the sights  game would not reccomend 010

cs  go is a competative first person shooter which takes skill and time to master
recommended
buying ingame skins for 100euros playing 4v5 mm constantly because someones bedtime passed and has to leave guaranteed it happens 2mins into the game russians what else could you wish for also who needs a life anyway 1010 would chicken
recommended
ed over my life the reason i have no gf and sit in my room all day but it was worth it i have my epic skins <3
recommended
a great game a true first person shooter requiring skill knowledge and practice a true legend of the counter strike series id give it 100% reccommendation and would gladly pay full aaa price for the hours of fun and frustration this game has
recommended
it was ok
recommended
for those who are sons of the halflife generation counterstrike as it always was but with very good graphics and physics
recommended
this game is very very very very god i am godspeed in this game tec9 is god speed in this game safari mesh is the only good skin i am god here
recommended
good for trickshots 1110 ign
recommended
for anyone into tactical fps in a team setting then cs go competitive is right for you games can be challenging tense but you have to remember its just a game and that youre really playing to enjoy it win or lose overall great game
recommended
this is a very fun game if you enjoy competative strategic and untimately time consuming games play this
recommended
if you are a tryhard cod player this game is for you
recommended
good game you want to spend money because some of the gun skins are straight out amazing and remember dont bet it is so tricky 55 game worth the buy
recommended
if you enjoy conventional fps games and the way they work and you expect this game to behave in the same way you will probably rage quit within the first 1030 minutes of playing you have to be willing to learn how counterstrike differs from other fps games and you have to be willing to explore new tactics the weapons in counterstrike global offensive all have their own unique spray pattern recoil pattern which rises above the reticle while spraying an automatic weapon if you dont learn these spray patterns you will keep aiming at players but you will miss every shot over the enemies head also the ingame purchases are not paytowin rather they allow users to equip weapons based on pure ascetics alone also the weapon skins can be very rare and go for hundreds to thousands of dollars in the market when you start playing you will have to play to learn and improve after some time making mistakes and gettingowned you will see improvement and at some point you can start playing in the competitive game mode which has a penalty for leaving overall i really enjoy this game the community is better than i expected and is superior compared to the community of cod or battlefield at the competitive level mic spamming becomes nonexistent except in extreme situations and if you confront a player with a knife it is most likely that they will also pull out their knife to engage you in a knife fight otherwise its dishonorable it takes some time getting used to but its great once you can appreciate the acquired tasted that comes with counterstrike global offensive
recommended
nice game d
recommended
great game
recommended
very great game but i dont like the people in it their kinda mean and thingswhen you see a 12 years old they all start callin him bad words wich is like really annoying but overall best game ever really should buy it if you dont have it

recommended
this game is so good irecommend this for fps gamers
recommended
favorite and most realistic fps recommend 2 anyone p u can play minigames jailbreak surf hostage rescue and search and destroy
recommended
this game is pretty nice its not as hard to learn as css was probably because its meant for ing consoles other than that its pretty nice

counterstrike global offensive doesnt need any introduction counterstrike is one of the most popular franchises on pc global offensive brought a new look to it literally graphics were tweaked to battle against the other modernized fps games who were already on the market or coming near to release the classic and old maps from the previous counterstrikes are polished to match the game quality and are actually still enjoyable you still have the feeling you are playing counterstrike even if the characters voices were completely changed in the terms of gameplay nothing much has changed besides the hudui global offensive like the previous ones is a competitive tactical shooter the new incendiary grenade on this game gives it a nice touch but it can lead you to a terrible loss of framerate if you have a weak computer as well as smokes and flashbangs sometimes what we can really call new is the ability to find official matches to play on the official csgo servers the matchmaking system brings a new life to the game when it comes to play with friends or just make your way to the top rankings by winning official ranked matches csgo allows you to make a specific lobby for any mode and map you wish to play and the best part with friends in every previous cs games i sometimes had the feeling that i would have to be very lucky to find not only a server that i was exactly looking for and with slots enough to play with my friends in the same team the csgo matchmaking eliminates this hassle and makes everything faster and easier i still dislike not being able to tell the game how many players you are looking for for example 2vs2 3vs3 4vs4 and so on you can still join player created dedicted servers just like you did in the previous counterstrikes so dont worry  the ability to watch other players matches friends or not with a 30 second delay was a nice play by the developers you can now safely play a match without worrying about spectators helping someone on the opposite side team and above all it allows you to watch some popular clans and pro players battle each other which is always enjoyable to watch like tournaments happening in that moment which then leads to one of the biggest problems on every multiplayer game cheaters csgo came with an idea to make the most skilled and trusted players in the community to spectate a suspect player to determine if he is cheating or not called overwatch i must say this is absolutely brilliant giving the fact that this system doesnt allow you to know the suspect true nicknames or steam account nor the rest of the players in that match to finish this review i would like to point out a very nice addon in the game which is players created content in the game csgo allows you to create your own maps weapon skins and so on and lets other players download and use it directly in their game you can then comment or vote that creation there are weapon skins that are paid to get and doesnt give you any advantage its just fashionable but sometimes the animations are so cool or the colours are so awesome that valve decides to put them in loot boxes with very rare and low drop percentage so if you get one of these you can either use it and brag about it sell to other players or trade for anything you want with other players conclusion if you enjoyed the counterstrike franchise or love a competitive skilledoriented fps i recommend you give csgo a try if you have the recommended system requirements if youre looking for an easy simple fps game dont buy this game 810
recommended
awesome game recommended for those hardcore fps gamers

this is a real fun game for both older and younger d

this is the game that is fair no mather how long you have been playing no buying to level up or unfair atvatadges just fair gaming and fun the bad thing is there are a lot of people smurfing they play on high ranks and get really good then make a secondary account to go play and just ruin the game for the one with lower rank this is a real problem all along the lines of cheating and is making online matchmaking a real hell

i have really enjoyed this game  its one of the best games that i have played allthough there are some bugs after major updates valve always fix these best of all they listen to the comunity map changes have been put in place because we wanted it there is a massive comunity surrounding this game  because it is an esport there are international competions held regulary and it offers great youtube content aswell as amazing twitch live streams the gameplay itself is epic i play competetive and it is so tense the small teams and limited time make it a fast paced action packed game if you play with a group of friends or even random people who have microphones it can become very tactical there are a few bugs with the matchmaking system and the lowbudget servers can glitch and not register your hits which can be fustrating at times i would give this game a 910
recommended
this is one of those games that can really take your time really good great selection of weapons and just everything is great about this game but make sure you have an extra keyboard incase you break one
recommended
99% of the time youll meet some mic talking people they are gonna be russian

counter strike global offensive would be perfect for competetive gamers if it didnt have bad matchmaking and punishments worse than death penalty let me explain if you create lobby it might just for no reason give you 24hour matchmaking ban propably just for fun i dont know and if next day when you finally get to play the game what you have paid for your pc crashes or disconnects for no reason you have 3 minutes to get back in action or see you in week thats 7 days and it is impossible to turn on pc connect to steam start csgo and connect back to the server in just 3 minutes now i cant play for week and have to wait another week so the punishment goes back to 24hour no fun ban good luck with that fkin valve and their no fun policy
recommended
spent all my life savings on skins now i live on the street with no job or shelter however now that i have realized my mistakes i am saving up money so i could afford a knife skin theyre sooo pretty   would become a bum again for more skins 1010
recommended
the best fps i have ever played in competitive mode its 5 v 5 play style brings about emmense teamwork and planning both for the current round and rounds to come because of the in game economy each weapon is unique and is useful in certain situations and against certain weapons these two things make the counter strike series worth playing
recommended
great game

this game is awesome you will play it forever especially because collecting skins is so addicting

really fun game if you have friends to play it with or else it gets boring d

although i currently am playing for 5 hours this game is good but my first few hours with it i almost got frustrated with it spawn camp is a  if those that got spawn camp u know what i mean still i am kinda sad ther is not much guns to go with but even so there is a  ton of ways u can do ur sessions unless u like a single gun then mostlikely u would stick to the gun for most or all of ur matches still i would rate this game 1010

very good game

counter strike global offensive is the latest installment of the counter strike series and in my opinion the best the ranking system is one of my favorite features from csgo it gives you the ability to play other players in your skill group you are given a skill group after playing ten matches ranging from silver 1 the worst of the worst all the way to global elite aka pros having the ranking system also gives me drive to get better and learn techniques for understanding the game better a downside is that the default mm valve servers are only 64 tick which can lead to your bullets not hitting your target when shooting but this can be solved by paying for the esea 128 tick servers which are far superior the problem i find most frustrating is the cheaters now i am not the kind of guy that will call cheats if someone gets a 1click with an ak47 but i still find that i run into cheaters on a weekly basis once again though esea has little to no cheaters with there anticheat software so if you are willing to pay a small amount towards esea you will find that you will have a much more enjoyable expirience chris rating  910

this game is awesome you will play it forever especially because collecting skins is so addicting
recommended
hours of fun both in and out of game
recommended
first time when i was hearing about counter strike i dont like the game  when i buy the cs global ofensive i realize that the game is not so ugly and not that hard hvae cool stuf like weapons skins cool maps now i pla cs go every day its a very good game
recommended
dont get better than this
recommended
total awesomesauce
recommended
its an ok time and money consuming game i myself is a sucker for skins not just in csgo ive been a big fan since first cs but it dont track that far back since steam was not used for playing cs in old times its a good game to learn team tactics aslong as you have a team to runpractise with but be aware of cheaters and scammers cause alot of themand i still have alot of issues with hackers ruining the game for everyone else on the server would be nice if someone like valve made and implemented a new anticheat like the one in titanfall where if you cheat you can only play with cheaters and they have to buy a new game every time they are caught cheating if they want to play in the future would also be nice if they banned the computer id instead of the ip cause to many can go around the ip would also be nice with a anticheat that picks up on programs that are started and stopped during gameplay so its easier to take the more experienced cheaters aswell it gets around 710 since it dont have the tilt function in upper body to look out from corners prone lack of cooking the greande your still forced into bottlenecks on most maps weapon change is to quick and it still annoys the hell out of me that they have a heavy as h awpawm that is made for stopping big truckscars by shooting thrue the engine block would be better to add a lighter sniper rifle since the name is cs
recommended
it`s a little bit similar to cod mw3 but it`s better than cs 16 recommended
recommended
pew pew pew pew wtf hacker omfg wtf wtf omfgggggg this game in other words better than cod d
recommended
cs go stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longvity and variety valve has not only updated the eshooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries this is counterstrike whatever the format you choose to play it on and there isnt a higher recommendation than that

this game honestly changed my life before playing i didnt know where to go what to do what do you do in the morning do you have to brush twice a day how often do you wash your clothes how much fabric softener is enough so many questions and i was so lost there were so many questions about life yet no answers just when i was thinking about ending it all i saw a post on a forum about this game that cost a little less than $5 i figured why not after only 30 minutes of playing this game i had answers they werent answers to questions i asked but there were answers in no time i had answers to questions like is rushing mid with negev a good strat should you always buy a decoy is walking necessary or can you full yolo all the time most important of all i knew i could run faster with a knife this not only helped me in game but in the real world as well i got back into running and started jogging around my neighbourhood with a knife to maximize speed fast forward a few years and i was at my peak and winning awards everything went better than expected sincerely usain bolt 6x olympics gold 100m & 200m runner

recommended
really awesome game you should get this games i recommend this game really much it has alot of modes in the game but the most fun is competitive which is a little bit challanging than the other modes like deathmatch demolition and so on i give this game a 910 it has an awesome gameplay and if u have played counter strike source then i still totally recommend this
recommended
amazing huge skill slope though
recommended
a fellow speaker of my language threatened to 360noscope my dear old nan 1010 edit 29092014 i only recently became interested in this game again i would actually recommend it this time after having fun on the competitive mode whereas shortly after my last review i completely forgot about the game however you can easily get banned my first couple were from shooting my friends i deserved to get banned and it didnt last very long however my third ban lasted a day and it was because my game couldnt reconnect to a server even though my connection was fine all i am saying is if you buy this game just for competitive mode remember that you may get banned temporarily for pretty dumb reasons the longest of these bans lasts a week that being said 2010 would get banned again
recommended
great game if your reading this buy it awesome game
recommended
much harder than 16 and previous cs games csgo is a unique online pvp shooter which tests reflexes patience and teamwork the online community can be very random some players will kick you just bacuse they want to and they can it is suggestible that you play with at least 1 person that you know in your team cus his vote will prevent the said above the game is very natural and in most cases i find my self that when i play out of fun i get more wins than when i try to win forcefully it is quite important that if you want to be a successful player you should buy a fine wired mouse and learn how to clock it to 1000hz httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0_hzipkt72m otherwise you will be very unprecise because this game requires very sensitive and responsive mouse compared to older games i play this game with r7 250 graphic card and i can say that similar graphic cards in same rank run this game really good on 1080p resolution i suggest newer graphic cards of course apart from matchmaking 5 on 5 clan war classic game the csgo features many modes that previous cs games had it contains almost all of the old maps and even more new very interesting and well designed maps hackers are a common but also a very rare problem csgo as a game that i play every day gives me the pleasure of enjoying an esport game which doesnt consume a lot of time and is a very unique and thrilling experience that can not be replaced by any other game
recommended
this game is probably going to take over my life one way or another you either die a scrub or gain enough skill to get called a hacker

great controls awesome guns fun stages wicked achievements play with friends im hooked the only let down as with a lot of these types of games are the hackers

it may lack some of the community niceties beloved maps assault anyone and little features of past games but global offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful polished and better looking counterstrike for whoever wants it even if the community doesnt meet the golden standard of 16 and source csgo will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons

recommended
one of the best fps in pc gaming good gameplay with great community backing
recommended
its been 15 years and this game is still amazing although flashier games exist cs survives and thrives i strongly recommend this to any fps player
recommended
steam should be installed just for this game
recommended
one of the possibly the best first person shooter out there its not full of unneccessary animations that youll find in other titles the professional scene is outstanding not as big as other titles like call of duty which alledgedly has pro players also known as a bunch of teens who trash talk in a game filled with aim assist valve never dissapoints even with some nooks that need improvement such as the tick rate it is a title that delivers the graphics are good it is one of the most skill based games and do not try to get good at this game by donating to get some powerful characters gunfights action tactics strategy anything that you would see in a war this game delivers i would give this a good rating as the developers still have to do some work to satisfy some there is a bit of work needed to perfect this game and that bit is a point that i will be taking off of my rating 910 would recommend go out and get it now if you do not like it than you do not have the brain for a skilldemanding game unlike other developers that have their games die out in a few months some even weeks the community for counter strike global offensive keeps rising valve do not need to release a stupid sequel like some other publishers and developers do they know how to satisfy the player and they do not need so many dlcs that cost as much as the game i have gone past my point i think you can tell i am in love with it id like to thank my brother for making me switch to this from the scum that is call of duty
recommended
my opinion on cs go when i looked at counter strike gos page i was not that intrested it looked alot like cod i had alot of bad happen to me things like hackers cheaters people that troll and a hacker resetted all my stats and more so looking at this game i wasnt really intrested but when steam decided to put it down to $6 i think from $15 i then wanted to get it not doing any homework on this game i guess you could say i yolo ed so i got it and wow its awesome love the consept torrists t plant the bomb counter torrists ct have to defuse it seems simple but fun if you like tf2 then i highly recomend getting this game because like tf2 you can get your own weapons and rare ones too its so content when you got your first rare weapon and you want to check it out right away i love this game my rating 810 could do with a controler setting could do with a match making option so i dont get pwned by pros
recommended
insanely fun definitely worth the very low price  slightly difficult to get into but much easier to get used to than the older cs games
recommended
do not buy this game if you have a bad internet my internet has cut out a couple of times during comprtitive and im banned for a wekk unfair banning especially when most people hack and reporting them does nothing
recommended
a really good game ive spent a few hundred hours of my life on this game and would do it again but hours is not the only thing ive spent on this game no ive dropped money into this game to get keys to open cases in the hope that maybe just maybe lord gaben might give me a karambit or a m9 bayonet
recommended
its pretty darn awesome really also it goes about 75% off in every sale dont ask me why though
recommended
this game is fun
recommended
one of the best fps games
recommended
great game so much better than source
recommended
absolutely amazing 1010 very intense too
recommended
i highly reccomend this game for the price you pay you can also make your money back from camos stickers knives etc i recently got a skin worth about 560 correct of 82614 from the operation breakout dlc but all in all its a fun game to take seriously or run around with tazers killing chickens
recommended
i use to be swimming in female genitalia but now that i discovered csgo my  is bone dry must get 1010 only one motto to live by in csgo you either die a noob or live long enough to be called a cheater ps everyones dad works for valve and can get you banned some serious 
recommended
this game unlike most fps games now actually requires skill and coordination to win you and your team have to work together to acheive a common objective in a series of fun maps that encourage both close and long range firefights i would highly recommend this game to everyone who is willing to pay for it
recommended
after the implementation of the skins this game is freaking addicting
recommended
great game needs a patch to fix the map loading bug though why you do dis valve 
recommended
this game is just plain addictive it lives up to every expectation it promises you and even more within two days i had already racked up 11 hours pros great strategy teamwork really is needed realistic sounds makes you feel like you really are part of a firefight cons valve seems to be trying to scam money out of you all the time luckily its only for cosmetics
recommended
best game to play
recommended
what if this is all a dream about a dream in someones head when that person is in a dream of an other person thinking of things like how he is the dream of an other person what if the dream became to real and wasnt a dream anymore but the one that wasnt a dream ecame a dream and now its all in limbo an upside down limbo
recommended
theres a lot i could say about csgo currently with the new updates and all if youre not one for change stick to css or 16 as right now csgo now has a market system which many older players find horrible i personally like it because its optional yes valve will try to force it on you with crate drops and collections yet the base game is of course amazing theyve added in a fair number of new weapons for example the ppbizon replaces the mp5 and the m4a4 and the m4a1s stock weapon replaces the regular m4a1 maverick scopes on augs and sigs have been updated and grenades can be thrown underhand also aiming with respect to movement has changed recoil patterns are now slightly random looking past all of the changes and adapting would be for the best seeing as how right now this is the most played version of the series old players will find their way on their own and eventually either keep playing casually on a nonvalve server or they can use the classic competitive gamemode to participate in a pickup game or they can get their friends and participate in a scrim which is really fun new players are able to of course play casually and try to pick up on the game as its easier than ever with official servers and i think old and new players alike are able to enjoy the skins in the game just dont open too many crates if you play other gameshave other hobbies all in all this version of counterstrike may not be the best in the series in my opinion it is because i am used to the changes from source and 16 its really up for the player to decide whether if they want to play this or not its still great and even better with friends but if youre still a regular on a server on css or 16 you may want to just stay there however if you see this game for halfoff or even 75% off like in the winter sale last year i highly recommend it one more thing if you dont fps i really wouldnt buy this
recommended
this game is a very good fps i like how there is ranks and such
recommended
has a doge sticker for your gun 1010 would shrek again
recommended
a muchrefined first person shooter which recieves frequent balancing updates while easier to get into than other competitive games such as dota 2 the community can still be harsh if you underperform in the competitive mode which comes with a decent but notyetperfect ranking system it features a few game modes appealing to all skill levels and custom made privately run servers as well as officially run valve servers all in all i have very much enjoyed my time playing the game and definitely got my moneys worth preordering it as an added bonus it features a very active community market where you can sell and buy weapon skins and stickers if you play your cards right you can easily make back the money you spent on this game especially if you buy it during a sale in steam wallet funds
recommended
ive been accepted for the faze clan 2k12
recommended
this is imo one of the best fps ever to be made
recommended
this game is awesome nothing else 1010 would definitely bang
recommended
i have mixed feelings about the various versions of cs go is no different i reluctantly give it a thumbs up its currently my favorite version of the game reasoning tldr this game has been out for so long and yet somehow valve has missed so many things that just dont make sense and have introduced changes that dont make sense and im not even sure why or how they introduced them and these are all problems they can and should fix 1  the x year badges this is just the first thing that comes to mind and its really quite trivial which is exactly why i must say what were all thinking  you whoever at valve did this really you s hand out 10 year badges to a bunch of 14 year olds for being in top teir leagues while ignoring the real gamers that made the game what it is today this is how you repay us not to mention were all grown up which means ya know  were the ones with real money to spend i want my 16 year badge you silly tricks  2  skins cost money now not that i ever cared for them anyway but seriously valve guys who implemented this and all the other trading  that ruined tf2  why would i want to draw attention to myself with that ing bright lazer 80s pink  stick running around like some 14 year old hacking troll warlord tain with nothing better to do seriously though if i ever come within proximity of any of you grimey dlc model fanboys who have infiltrated valve like aids in the 80s talking about how you felt you needed to implement something to improve the games realism ill just point you to a picture of your new hot pink guns promptly followed by this picture of a pretty little cartel piece probably used to slaughter innocent children httpimagesdangerousmindsnetuploadsafilessilverpinkgunjpg and you wonder why people dontwontcant take competitive cs seriously heck according to vavles current business logicmodel  why not just make another version of the game called csmexican drug lords so all the s with pink and gold guns can flash eachother in peace i seriously want to know the answer  3  nearly a decade later  matchmaking still doesnt provide high quality matches suggestions i have come talk to me seriously why do you think altpug and esea are so successful  4  the overall cs community is more fragmented than ever thanks to valve and theres really no good way for private parties to hit the round table and offer these kids some real meaningful competition because valves got everybody so fragmented by its ignorant rash implementation of new features and game mechanics or removal thereof that arent approved by the overall community these days its all a crapshoot between 16ers sourcers god help you and last but definitely not least the csgoers some poeple prefer it this way for other good reasons i do too in some cases but not to the extent they are now  its spiraled out of control  5  registration still blows if you have never compared prebeta7cs on the hl1 engine vs current csgo on a lan then go do it now and ask valve the same question wtf  6  realism vs fun how to infiltrate a game dev shop & ruin their game step by step this is the perfect title of a book that someone needs to write about the mad scientists over at valve and how they magically began implementing stupid  like riot shields inexplicable mysterious netcode with fragmented and conflicting documentation cardboard boxes that you can only shoot through at certain angles strafe jumping and realistic recoil that actually isnt realistic at all i can only imagine this is how their internal dialogue went year 2000 noob dev hey guys nice job nerfing the awp those ing noobs i hear cod is raking in cash because they offer players loadouts gabe no i want to write hl2 noob dev hl is old news we need dlc crosses fingers while secretly plotting to try and implement this at a later date in tf2 with full blown success shortly after tf2 community involvement & competitive play all but vanishes a couple of years pass the original cs 10 devs have all moved on the new valve creative team endures many a long meeting over bags of flamin hot cheetos and pastb blue ribbon  the companies life blood of creative & strategy decision making obviously year 2003 noob dev the community is making their own version of our game why dont we have a loadout menu yet i want to keep my job nobody cares about experience its graphics and hard core dlc bro lazy senior dev sweating unexpectedly yeah you do that young grashopper i will mentor you proceeds with viewing porn later that week noob dev ok whats next bullet drop lazy seniuor dev  is this the meeting for cs or is this bf4 i cant remember noob dev theyre stealing our sales with origin downloader man get with the program noob marketing team member 1337 steam cod sales underperformed due to xbox mlg league we need to do something noob dev quickly to the dlc machine frantically smashes dlc autogenerate button repeatedly for days on end year 2014 keep your fingers crossed gabe newell god damn it what the  are you idiots doing to our game devs & marketing noobs blank deer stare gabe newell cant you see im ing busy ing hot es in my lamborghini why you ing up my legacy noobs noob dev but the game needs more dlc to keep up with trends gabe newell  slaps noob dev and fires him we didnt make counterstrike so successful you fool the community did what have you done to our gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaames cool gamers go gabe save the world man fired dev old cs sucks i gave it methanphetamines and made it into the beautiful peacock it is today facepalm cs was the most fun video game ever not americas ing army fatal1ty was made on a game exactly like the old cs not the new one because it was more fun steps down from soapbox im not certain that all of valves employees and developers are to blame but i can tell you when  really started to change for the worse it was probably shortly after noobs began crying fowl on the forums that the awp was too powerful beta 7 is where youll find direct evidence of valves sudden shift in mindset before the community had time to react they began a conquest to make anything and everything more realistic which was good in some senses  fixing the wall strafe bug and eventually after many years strafe jumping however their fixes also introduced more complex problems such as rate hacking weve all noticed that this mindset of making it more realistic has grown like a cancer over the years for many games and cs was one of the first to be infected by it ironically the mindset that created amazing games looks like it fled to the left for dead team god i hope they arent the same devs im complaining about anyway moving along  other bugs im just going to keep listing here december 28 2013 half the players in my match just now found using the steam matchmaking system just got replaced randomly by chinese players matchmaking and online match finding for cs sucks in general youll likely get paired up against someone overaseas and then have this happen i hope this introduces a mature discussion and hopefully will bring back some of the positive aspect of the game that we all miss of all the cs versions id say csgo is the best right now it has the best graphics and registration combo and more importantly because nobody plays beta 52 which hasnt been updated with anything good since its release go figure

clasic sequel of cs 16 and source reminds me about cod modern warfare online but with lower pc requirements still graphics are amazing
recommended
this game is a legend keep gaming shooters 
recommended
definitely much more better than css and certainly not worse than classic 16 ps haters gonna hate yep
recommended
this game is a 1010 game the only way to win is through means of communication which include a social aspect of the game aim is an important aspect of this game too if youre a terrible shot just dont play competitive
recommended
currently my favourite game on steam i know that some fps games get old and that they are not for everyone but this one i have yet to get bored of playing playing countless hours of competitive with friends is where the majority of the fun is to be had this game in general has a good community even casual can be fun the operations that release always have new and interesting changes to the game that do not just include the maps that come with them i would highly recommend this game to anyone to play even just casually the game can be a great experience pros insanely fun with friends to play competitive matchmaking or casually this game has made me a better player at everything i play so it can for you too lots of community created games maps weapon skins stickers etc some even added to the game by valve the game matches you at your skill level for competitive matchmaking so you always play against people of around equal skill the item drop system in the game allows players to receive weapon skins or cases that you can use or open the steam market is a great tool for this game as a lot of the in game items cases stickers skins knives are listed there for you to buy and sell cons there can be at times quite a lot of hackers that want to ruin the experience of others especially in competitive matchmaking the game can be frustrating at times if you do not do well during games or play with people that dont care about othersdont communicate good luck with case openings you have a pretty low chance to get anything good personally though i have gotten pretty lucky so anything is possible the game can require a lot of effort if you play competitively so know what you are getting into
recommended
great game it will pay for itself by selling drops from games
recommended
amazing fps its not an average pew pew pew shoot the russianarab woah killstreak giant op rocket pppcccchoooowowwww its actually good
recommended
its nice p
recommended
counter strike global offensive is a skill based tactical shooter and it does it well with the market place and the growing community and skill based matchmaking youre always in for a challenging fight for the cheap price of 1499 cad its worth it and a steal when on sale if youre looking for a skilled based shooter this is it
recommended
cs go is a really good teamtactics fps game and you can play it for hours but there also is alot of unmature people on it and alot of cursing much more than tf2 for example also youre gonna learn that people dont really likes russianss in this game
recommended
i really like this game its pretty balanced but there is to much cheaters now days
recommended
really good game 55
recommended
dis game is coo
recommended
do you like first person shooters do you like competitive gameplay buy this game its a lot of fun
recommended
got a p90 worth 95$ accidentally sold it for 95 cents 1010 would recomend
recommended
casual bad competitive good
recommended
one of the many multiplayer games ive played that have become one of my favorites i havent enjoyed many fps games that create the excitement that csgo has given me it gives you the three things a manwoman likes excitement strategy and swag i rate this game at 9510 for the reason of toxic players causing games to be unfun like many multiplayer games but still overall the game is great a must try 
recommended
true gaem for real guyz
recommended
awesome the maps r wonderful its one of the best fps
recommended
buy this game if you wish to have no real life
recommended
best rip off of cod ever lol
recommended
great game not as good as css but far more approachable at this point
recommended
you willl not be disapointed great game
recommended
its a great game i see nothing i dont like about it
recommended
fantastic game to play with friends gets pretty intense but very fun love the skins and gameplay but there arent a lot of gun variety some guns are used more often and are way more overpowered than other guns other than that i would definitely reccomend this game
recommended
i wouldnt reccomend playing this game because im better than you thanks
recommended
personally my favourite game althought it lacks no scopes and hard scopes and soft scopes and other varieties of scopes i cannot stop playing this game if you feel like your time is not valuable buy this game
recommended
very immersive experience great visual effects and graphics stunning performance when it comes to highly actionpacked moments the game has no stutters whatsoever and always runs smoothly neat variety of gamemodes to choose from along with competitive matches which represent a great feature of the game itself they are complex yet very understandable which is good only slight drawback is the community or at least a big part of it many people unfortunately even in competitive matches do not show any interest in the game itself by cheating and hacking or simply by throwing the match and dragging the whole team down overall very well made game all it takes to master it is practice everything else is already taken care of
recommended
i got banned for 360 quickscoping some people 1110 must buy
recommended
i started chasing a chicken then got yelled at by a 12 year old because my guns skin wasnt as expensive as his 1010

first ever counterstrike game i evered played and i think its better then call of duty and battlefield
recommended
great game
recommended
this game has really changed from css counter strike source the details and weapons have improved new weapon skins and some customization people dont just run around and get killed you have to work as a team your team will actually talk to you most of the time and make out a plan make sure you learn csgo talk though if people start telling you where to go and you dont know where that is then youre going to fail but overall the game is really fun feel free to join our clan voice over sound ddd

such a great community especially in the casual matches everyone is so nice and very respectful
