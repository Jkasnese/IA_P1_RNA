if csgo was a girl id date her and  her a lot then after that get frusterated because of things she does that doesnt make sense but still be with her then wed have sex again when were in bed id be killin it ontop but when shes ontop i just absolutely hate it as she dominates me after that wed get into a fight about who was better that round and wed always end the fight at a negative note the next day id start talking to her again and the cycle goes on and on csgo is the equivalent to an abusive relationship 1010 would recommend just because being ontop feels pretty good in this game

i first came to cs from tf2 and a couple other single player games being recommended it by a few of my online friends i expected a badly made generic shooter filled with gimmicks to keep the player interested and a pay to win sort of system i recieved an absolutely amazing game with lots of depth and an insane amount of skill and strategy involved at first i found the amount of effort skill and stategy you have to put into player positioning and things of that nature was just astounding and unlike any other game i had seen before i took a massive liking to this type of game and started playing more and more at first you will have difficulty understanding these things but putting more time and effort into the game will show results quickly i just wanted to do a review of this game as i believe csgo is truly great and unlike any other game out there thanks for reading envy

i purchased this game on release day and played it for about three hours it was absolute crap and i uninstalled it fast forward almost one year and my friend recommended i try it again well ive got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from its release version the game is basically 16 with improved graphics and mechanics while it still needs work in many areas the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $1499 if youre a long time cs player like me beta 1 and dont have this game yet add me to your friends list and well reminisce about the old days and maybe ill throw a copy your way

counterstrike global offensive is probably the most balanced fps game in all existence i personally started playing counter strike when source had been out for 23 years or so ive always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat and the fact that the game is all skill there are no unlockables the only things you can earn by playing are stats and skins a pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer thats new to the series other than his skill great engine great servers balanced gameplay smooth gameplay excellently constructed maps stays true to the franchise cheap no unlockables except skins ingame purchases with real money counterstrike global offensive is the best competition style first person shooter valve has ever made so far theres nothing else to the game than multiplayer and the braindead bots this is a must have for all pc gamers if you dont already have the game pick it up now or get it on the christmas sale in a couple of weeks 9510

this modern version of one of the best competitive games of all times does a good job in introducing new players to this highly tactical and skillbased gaming experience if you are a veteran of the old days  csgo might disappoint you it sure looks nice but lacks the precision that made cs 16 so damn good its still a very good counterstrike thoughit may lack some of the community niceties beloved maps and little features of past games but global offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful polished and better looking counterstrike for whoever wants it even if the community doesnt meet the golden standard of 16 and source csgo will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weaponsbrilliant oldschool shooter has convinced us that counterstrike franchise is in no way to be retired or forgottenat the end what matters is not if csgo is innovative or more of the same than cs source what counts is if its fun and csgo couldnt be better in this regard

ill start off by saying that i havent played csgo all that much yet but here are some of my first impressions of the game the actual gameplay is flawless and it offers more than enough customization options to ensure your comfortability with the controls there is also a huge abundance of guns maps and unique game types to pick from im sure a lot of people are discouraged by the extremely high skill cap but i feel that the games increased difficulty relative to other firstperson shooters makes it much more rewarding it is way more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of it  i typically dont pay any attention to the chatvoice communication in multiplayer games such as this but i quietly observed it from time to time for the sake of this review i can tell you that just like in many other games the community can be pretty toxic towards new players and just in general ignore the rage and youll be fine p csgo has a workshop with loads of community made maps that introduce unique gamemodes and styles it goes without saying that this adds hours maybe even days to the replayability and allows you as the player to better customize the way you play and enjoy the game overall its an awesome game and i only wish i had picked it up sooner if you can handle the somewhat toxic community and the high skill cap counterstrike global offensive is the perfect firstperson shooter and i recommend it 
recommended
im probably going to get ripped by veterans due to my low playtime but i felt like csgo deserved a proper review lets hop right into it shall we originally designed as a halflife mod more than a decade ago counterstrike has endured because of its wellbalanced competitive gameplay that requires skill to succeed counterstrike global offensive is a revamped version of the classic firstperson shooter offering some tweaked modes on the same maps that helped define the series those unfamiliar with counterstrike will find the game more a cerebral experience instead of the run n gun arcadestyle action popularized by recent iterations of call of duty in global offensive there is no regenerating health no cinematic storyline no experience points to level up your soldier and no unlockable kits or perks the deterrent for dying is having to sit out and watch as the rest of the match unfolds while this may sound disappointing to those weaned on more contemporary shooters global offensive comparatively pareddown experience is no less thrilling the games focus on teamwork and tactics gives the game a distinctive feel as you choose between four online game types as part of a terrorist or counterterrorist faction classic casual and classic competitive are teambased modes played in multiple rounds the goal in each is to either eliminate the opposition or be the first team to complete a maprelated objective depending on the map and your faction youll either rescue or defend four hostages or either plant or defuse bombs at two specific sites while the goals in both classic casual and classic competitive are the same the differences between the two are primarily in terms of scope a classic competitive game consists of 30 rounds instead of 10 enables friendly fire and has you earning money for kills planting bombs and so forth thats used to purchase armor and defuse kits the casual variant gives you armor and defuse kits automatically the other two modes consist of arms race and demolition arms race which has been adopted by both call of duty black ops and battlefield 3s close quarters expansion consists of a single round where everyone begins with the same weapon each kill automatically changes your weapon until you receive the golden knife the first person that lands the killing blow with the knife wins the round this is the only mode where respawns are possible offering a nice change of pace from the standard modes demolition is a mashup of arms race and classic taking the fixed weapon progression from arms race and including two multiround matches that have you trying to plant or defuse a bomb in a bank safe house and other locales what makes counterstrike global offensive appealing is that it plays differently from its competition tired of jumping assassins in other games jumping here will penalize your accuracy sick of seeing more praying and spraying than in a baptism ceremony then youll appreciate that those who use short controlled bursts while aiming will be more successful if there is one knock on the game its that it offers the same maps as earlier versions of the series giving veterans a huge advantage over new players to offset this the developers included an option to play against bots offline so you can practice each mode and map this will give you a fighting chance against real players but expect to die early and often until you hone your skills and familiarize yourself with the map layouts or course the most important aspect of any multiplayer game is how much you want to play after a session ends this is where global offensive excels possessing the same addictive quality that helped make the previous games a longterm success story shooter fans looking to diversify their library or prove their mettle against a talented pool of players shouldnt hesitate to pull the trigger highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

hey i am going to make a review of the game counter strike global offensive my experice  i have played cs for 2k hours  watchedfollowed the scene for a long time and now some history as well i hope you learn something and maybe even buy csgo after youve read my review  counter strike is an fps game where the only thing that matters is skill aim  gamesense  communication its the opposite of a pay to win game it is true that u can spend how ever much money you want on skins but that will not make you as a player better in game mm  the matchmaking in csgo is good you will get matched up with close to equaly skilled player it is 64 tick servers something that alot of people complain about but most other fps shooters have 16 or 32 tick servers ex cod the biggest problem with mm imo is cheaters as you rank up you will face more and more cheaters valve is working on vac as it has been 4 ban waves a cheat is being detected by vac making everybody using the cheat vac banned very close together skins  skins dont add any value to your character and there is no way to make your character better in any way so it really doesnt matter if you buy them it is going to stick out a big more which makes it easier for enemies to spot but that probably wont make that much of a difference in game so know you think that everything is bad with skins no skins help fund major csgo tournaments 250000 dollar tournaments that are supported by valve they are also very fun to play around with trading and betting with you can make huge profits and huge losses but as i said you dont have to buy them the pro scene  the pro scene is very entertaining to watch and has imo the best layout there are 3 majors every yearmost likely going to be more as time progresses there are also the normal tournaments every once in a while 14 weeks apart usually the pro scene is growing very fast an we will see a 1 million dollar leugue hosted by esl and esea this year misc  there is more to cs than what meets the eye all the strats smokesflashesmolos etc but there is also the surfingbhoping etc side to the game there are servers where you can do lots of other game modes if you get bored playing the normal game which you probably wont as it is very addicting final thoughts  cs is a great game for a low price which will run on your pc its very addicting and fun there is also frequent sales in the steam store i hope you join the cs community gl and hf

its hard to argue that this game is probably the best cs release since 16 some will disagree might argue source is a better game and they will have their own valid points in my opinion this game is a true sequel it brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of cs the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play it mates the old with the new the expectations that a fps be somewhat realistic if not fun to play its a modern game it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later csgo is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series shooting movement sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again weapons now have a purpose  theres a reason to buy the 57 and p250 as well as the mp5 replacement mp7 team play is just as important as the economy once you lose it theres no coming back its a demanding skills based thats as satisfying as any cs title has been pros  updated maps visuals & sounds  emphasis on team play  valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers  extensive customisability & player drops  more realistic player and game behaviour  csgo workshop  pro players  active development and regular updates  listens to community  lowend modern pc requirements for top quality & top resolution cons  gungame isnt the same as css  because of different skills & tactics css players will feel like its a familiar but new game skills are transferrable one way not so much the other when you play css after csgo it will feel and sound like youre playing underwater  sound still seems like an afterthought  you will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something thats playable and looks good ratings graphics 8510 far improved on previous models but theres still room for improvement sound 810 feels like an afterthought if theres one complaint i have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isnt good enough gameplay 9510 excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayability overall 8510 its a great game and could easily be 95 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality its a modern twist on an old classic footnote i lost my way with cs after css and i turned to a variety of other games battlefield 1942214223 tom clancy rainbow 6 americas army 23pg before then i was an avid player of cs and i would play up to 100 hours per month when i played cs 10 years ago i always asked why cant this game be a little more realistic why cant they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air i cant really emphasise how happy i am that a lot of what shouldnt happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals sound and game play has been improved in the first month of playing i managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and ive started contributing back to the community with maps

maybe the only fps where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill no  perks or kill streaks no autoturrets no air strikes if you want to win in counterstrike you have to learn the maps play smart and have fast reflexes since you work for each and every kill its much more satisfying than other current gen shooters its a real shame that the console version isnt closer to the pc version though they could have given cod a run for their $

csgo is a game which was once designed around teambased attacks and defenses something which has since been replaced by weapon reskins and recoil patterns pros very easy to hop into a casual game and enjoy a quick game very easy to join a competitive game and work with a team of nearly equal skilllevels in a longer game with higher tensions new game modes to choose from wide variety of powerful weapons at your disposal betting scene numerous competitive leagues and teams for highly skilled players cons difficult to master weapons and recoil patterns luck plays a considerable role in fights learn a plethora of new insults from teammates conclusion for 15$ its worth every penny

counterstrike global offensive source engine game the latest in counterstrike game series following counterstrike source new weapons physics graphics and so on well why dont i review it like i reviewed halflife because i dont like it i expected more from a 2013 game but i saw nothing new in csgo except for new weapons and sounds physics mechanics shaders  everything was taken from the other source games left 4 dead 2 for example i do not recommend this game for everyone who likes either both cs 16 and css or one of them this game will disappoint you after 15 minutes of playing  its just more casual easier to play you wont use new weapons you wont get impressed by graphics you wont get any pleasure because of campers all the way through so should you buy the game if youll delete it almost instantly i dont think so but for casual gamers this game is just what theyve been looking for lots of action easy shooting very comfortable spread and recoil gungame mode deathmatch and such kills matter deaths dont just like in call of duty i dont think id recommend it but its up to you to decide

it is an okay game and could be lots of fun but the real problem is the haters of noobs if you are new to the game most are just haters and not friendly this game takes time to learn to play and most are not willing to teach you much the same as in dota 2 if you are lucky to find someone willing to teach you then the haters harass them also and want to know why you are doing it sorry but this is true and if you are one one the haters remember you where once new to the game and not all learn at the same rate try to be more kind to your fellow gamer and help them out

welcome to the next gen of shooters its a point and click shooter in which you only use one weapon awp and play on one map dust 2 the sarcastic comment is for a lot of reasons first of all camping is a big issue yes it is the players choice to do so but there should be some way to retain this from happening its seems most players afk on some rounds until they can buy the awp and then just sit there for 20 ing minutes im not exactly sure why people even bother using keyboards when playing this game secondly the aiming system is dreadful who ever though of this clearly wasnt sober let me explain the game states that you are playing as sas a highly trained group of marines that supposedly have been trained with firearms although when it comes to shooting a target two meters in front of you you can only hit it twice out of a whole mag also you are un able to use iron sights why although it has its moments very rarelywhen it is enjoyable 1110 would get shouted at by angry russians again

the valve anticheat system vac because nobody likes playing with cheaters playing games should be fun in order to ensure the best possible online multiplayer experience valve developed a stateoftheart anticheat system that automatically detects and permanently bans any player using cheats or hacks on a vac secured server what this means to you as a player is that you dont have to worry about annoying cheaters getting an unfair advantage and disrupting your game the valve anticheat system is only enabled on servers with the secured shield logo and only valve has the ability to vac ban a user while server admins may choose to ban players from playing on their specific servers they do not have the ability to vac ban players the vac system is automated and contacting steam support to report cheaters isnt necessary valve has a zerotolerance policy for cheating and will not lift vac bans under any circumstances

have to say this csgo is a great game a lot better than cod and bf i used to play a lot of team deadmatch and arms race since then i tried playing competitive how i describe it rage simulator since 2012 really read this if you are someone who enjoys life and never tryhard on games never play comp just never cuz the effect will eventually be you getting kicked by so called pros or you will get headshotted a lot and called out for noob and stuff so screw comp i may sound like a noob right now and its true im noob and i dont give a f note im not trying to offend all those cs players who play in pro leagues and stuff and the ones who are good at it

if you want a thoroughly bad experience filled with angry russian 12year olds who only know how to say   mother noob  & your not to mention an abundance of hackers and griefers then buy this game if you want poor gameplay that punishes movement with a great deal of rng in terms of what hits no matter how you aim even when standing still just poor hit registration in general then buy this game some fun to be had when playing with friends but getting in a cue with less than 4 people is just horrible getting shiny ranks is some validation that your time spent playing this abysmal piece of garbage has not been wasted but not enough if you buy it for any more than 4 you have been fooled

if this is a fps game claiming to be the leading competitive game in the genre you should have the following  proper netcode and hitboxes especially in hit registration area if i shoot the enemy four times and see four separate blood stains on the wall behind him i expect him to get four hits if im not suffering from bad pinglaglost packets this is not how it happens on csgo you can never be sure about how much damage you have dealt and how much will it take to finish him off because your hits dont register 5stack competitive mode in this age of online gaming i would expect to play with my team against various teams around the globe which makes competitive really competitive getting thrown in with four  who swear in their native language and do random team damage trolling in general against a 5stack is not fun and i dont think it wont be fun for them either decent community switching between this and red orchestra 2 is like having cancer beating cancer and getting it back again if your community mostly consists of 1216 year old players who think they are the best because they get sum awsum killz and refusing any kind of friendly advice or criticism or even formed tactics for the round you cant claim to be a competitive game a competitive fps game requires serious and especially strict moderation if its based on random matchmaking no griefing should be allowed leaving before game ends should lead to permanent ban after a couple of times instead of overwatch which is recruiting everyone with 150 wins and nova i rank a professional or semiprofessional team should be established without moderation the game easily turns into wild west these are some but not all reasons im uninstalling cs for the second time from my computer i hope never being bored enough to get back into it i know that these points have been discussed thousands of times and my addition wont really change anything but i had to write this after 700 hours
