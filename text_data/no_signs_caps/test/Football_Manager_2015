this game is very good its much better than the previous years it seems a lot more technical and your decisions as a manager have more effect on your team and the game in general i love the idea of being able to edit your manager stats attacking defence ect its really good and its nice to be able to view them and use them in training if anyone needs a question answered id be happy to help  overall ill give the game 910  reason being is that its only the beta version but i cant see there being much changed for the full version in a few days time 7th november thank you for yet another great game

only complaint for fm15 is ridiculous prices for players tried to buy shaquri from bayer and they wanted 67 million no way is he worth that 1520 max then tried to buy kovacic from inter and they wanted 51 and lucas leiva this is ruining the game with stupid prices hope they can sort this out

love this game not much difference from last year and my cons are that im liverpool beat bayern munich 41 had like 20 shots  beat chelsea 21 had 15 shots played crystal palce my striker missed two sitters this stiker has finshing of like 19 losted 31 there striker score hatrick with finshing of like 13 makes sence i had 25 shots they had 5  4 on target

i have loved this game series for years and preordered the new one and even though i would reccomend it it is slightly bizarre loads of goals loads of injuries loads of yellowred cards and sometimes you go on losing streaks that are unrealistic and absolutely impossible to get out of i finally managed to get ahead in a game and one of my players was sent off so i lost it sort of seems like they want to make it as difficult as possible they just need to tone it all down a little bit and it should be fine i mean one player i was against scored 4 in the first half i mean liverpol are bad the moment but i think it is slightly unrealistic for abel hernandez to get 4 against me in the capital one cup in less tha 45 minutes never mind i can focus on the league oh wait it is impossible to win in it im sure it will improve once the beta period is over
recommended
based on beta  played all games since day 1 and most have had there issues but then its very hard to wipe out all problems with such a variation of methods nothing i would class as gaming breaking occured and any issues with 3d engine can generally be ignored or altered tactics wise to suit easily the best and most comprehensive version thus far much improvement to gui scouting etc and requires more patience when lower league think all the changes are for the better and enjoying new challenge of working out all the new nuances and mechanics
recommended
i will recommend that you buy this game dont listen to all this negative recommendations
recommended
this game is very fun to play it still has a few bugs but hell its still in beta full game release is 7th of november be sure to get it if you havent already because this game is sick
recommended
the game is just awesome really good job from sport interactive i suggest it 100% careful with crash i had crash but sega helped me  buy this  <3
recommended
the beautiful game just ot a make over after playing the series for a number of years now i was expecting the same thing yet it seems so much improved on things i didnt even know needed improving 1 example is the competitions menu it shows where you are in the league and cups the staff are more helpful and i like the introduction to tunnel interviews the 3d graphics now involve motion capture in them and look much improved 1 thing that is really noticeable is tweaking a system example my false 9 striker was not getting any goals but i was winning games i change him to poacher and he gets bucket loads if you love football and you love the idea of managing your fave team get this its a no brainer
recommended
so far so good lots of new features to play with couple of downsides so far though new layout seems more cluttered than before stock skin is horrible on the eyes hoping someone makes a nice clean skin like fm2014 was easy on the eyes playing as a club with red as a primary colour if very difficlut to do as are some of the other colours not so bad with white
recommended
well in my opinion this is by far the best football manager to date the graphics on the 3d match are really good the gameplay seems alot smoother goalkeepers actually make really good saves ive seen alot of people moaning about the beta version what you all need to understand is the whole point of this is so any problems that do occor you let them no they fix it and to be fair there are a few faults 1 theres way to many injuries within pre season 2 theres been to many times when the ball is in the box and the strikers or defence dont really do anything about it too many realistic goalscoring chances missed 3 ridiculous transfer fees i no in fm14 it was the same but it seems unless you have 40 million to spend on one half decent player then you aint getting a half decent player theres a few more things but i reckon the developers will fix all this before the game is actually released so im not worried its well worth the money and if your a die hard football manager player then once this little things are fixed youll love it
recommended
i love the series but this one is a mess so far there are some good new features in the game like the new scouting system  makes the game experience even more realistic i played with carlisle utd  a low profile team in england second devision which relegated from 1st devision last season the initial goal was promotion  the board set a budget of 0 transfer funds and 45k wages for additional players i believe this goal is almost impossible to achieve even for the most hardcore players i loaned 8 players for free from teams in the premier league and signed few free agents but even with them my team couldnt match most teams in 2nd dev i am still recommanding the game because i believe si will fix all issues
recommended
good game  honestly i still prefer the layoutinterface from 2014 but i probs just need to get used to it crashed on me twice over 3 hours mac which is extremely annoying as i have to replay games won 3 the first time it crashed played the games again and drew 2 lost 1 as a result my macbook nearly went out the window get it sorted also faaaaaar too many injuries  most of them being 3weeks 4 games into the season and half my team were injured although this is only the beta there are loads of changes that have to be made and hopefully they are fixed when the full game is released if it stays the same way chances are i wont have a laptop to play it on for very long
recommended
although the most challenging of the series so far more because of the new adaption to the layout and the scouting methods for me its a big improvement on user interface but the harsh amount of injuries it makes progression a longer task where you have to put mild detail into the smaller things instead of throwing it to your below par am i suggest it if you put a good amount of time into the later games but for a newbie 1314 would be a safer choice in the way of enjoyment of the game and winning things
recommended
its good
recommended
just as good as every other there is no better game out there
recommended
injuries are broken other than that its good 
recommended
pros new ui while it may take some getting used to its superior to the old one scourting much better and more realistic than the old system also great new scouting reports stadium view with banners chatting with players board journalists etc improved new tactics creator much better both vissually and technically cons need some patching goalkeepers seems to be completely useless even the top ones plus their reactions in 3d game engines reminds me of kidengarden kids tring to goalkeep they make me wanna go to 2d games again the new generic logos for the non lincenced leagues are bad guess well have to wait for workshop to fix edit after all the patching the game is much better the goalkeeper works much much better

my first football manager game i love fifa series and decided to try fm15 wasnt disappointed great game
recommended
this game is a pure simulation for all football fans i recommend it
recommended
i feel fm 15 to be exceptional i believe the match engine to be very modern and that the new user interface is revolutionaryi played the beta which i found brilliantbut there were some probs but im glad to say they have been fixed for the full game i was falling away from fm for a bit dispite play each of the last 5 but fm15 has brought me right back to why i fell in love with football manager
recommended
very much similar to previous iterationsbut thats exactly what we are looking for
recommended
i feel this is the best football manager out of all the old ones it is much more fun with plenty of things to do to improve your team and many difficult decisions you have to make to become successful therefore i recommend all of you to buy it if you are interested in football but the negative side of this game is that it does not have enough online players willing to play online it is more fun if you play it with friends on a side note if you want to join me in football manager you can add me im almost always on steam

i bought this game expecting to be hired by a real football club however im still waiting this is slower than amazon
recommended
look no game can be perfect yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine but for a simulator such as this fm is frankly amazing overall i have to say that football manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all football fanatics if you are a past fm player and have been dissapointed with past versions i honestly beg you to revisit your perspective and try out fm15 please it is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money 910
recommended
nice game nice interface pretty accurate database i always thought that it was a scissors paper rock game and i should just fine the thing to win all games but its not the thing you do on the bench really affects the players on the field the 3d is indeed pretty bad but for me it doesnt matter because i use 2d if i wanted a graphical football game i would have chosen fifa instead the initial version was full of bugs but now with the latest updates it feels good
recommended
calling football manager the best management sim out there is always a redundant statement true as it is its peerless excellence has chased any significant rivals away but the biggest task is tempting players away from their carefully built career in the previous game sports interactive know that its games biggest competition remains itself and as you may tell your team at halftime they must guard against complacency fm15s changes tend to contribute to gentle improvement rather than startling disruption but should do enough to tempt you into starting that managerial journey all over again
recommended
infinitely better than fifa also i have no life any longer

it is a great game to play and the menus look better it is worth the money

recommended
still the best football simulator game after i missed the 2014 series this 2015 series is a much improvement from 2013 series the most improved part is 1 higher complexity in handling players contracts and negotiation with other clubs as well as 2 the improved tactical variety players role etc while this could be a little bit cumbersome for those who new to this series i believe the builtin tutorial will be very useful
recommended
great game veteran player of football manager series and i feel this game lives up to the football manager reputation i got it at christmas time so missed reported bugs that now mainly seem to be fixed as ever match engine can be tweaked to make it better but overall football manager 2015 will provide many hours of fun
recommended
not funny game and its cost so much p

all the functions in the main menu are complex and up to date but as this is not a fifa recognised gamethe teams have wrong names and logosthe game play is worse than two cpu controlled teams playing each other in fifa 06 on a nintendo ds i would recommend total football manager 2005 by ea sports insteadmay not be available on the steam store

one of the worst game of the series too many matches finish with defeat despite your dominance you cant help it no matter what you do cant keep your players if youre playing with a lower reputation team you let your player leave other players are like how can you let him go  you dont let your player leave other players are like you shouldve let him go how can you do this to him  injuries are ridicilous match engine is a joke dont buy this crap i wanted to have some fun had brain haemorrhage instead they ruined this one i actually want my money back

im everton fc i have bought the game expecting it to be better than last year the most fustrating parts about last years game was the poor quality of crossing and almost no through balls behind the defence from the midfield to striker this year the crossing has improved a lot and works well however this is the only way i can score and it is getting boring ive tried pump ball into box which only affects the defenders and makes them hoof it this game just cant seem to make through passes for the striker dissapointing

as jesus or god or somebody once said the football manager is my shepherd i shall not be in want he makes me feign injury in green pitches he leads me beside vociferous supporters he restores my morale he guides me in paths of tactical righteousness for his names sake even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of relegation i will fear no referee for you are with me your well fitted suit and your piercingly strong jawline they comfort me amen

 below is my original review but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended because even after patching the game and matchengine is unrealistic how could the programmers not realise this i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14 this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say though it does have its problems id definitely recommend this to fans of the series lets go through the pros and cons pros  i like the new ui i think its improved on previous titles with things like scoutingtransfers in more logical places  it runs smoother you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match instead it takes less than 2 seconds this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time  i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons  weirdly takes longer to save than fm14 over a minute and a half for me  the games are too high scoring and this needs to be patched for realism purposes i just had 5 games that were 63 63 53 00 lol and 63 again a bit silly  goalkeepers are pretty bad hence the high scores  it feels like its harder to play a possession game but that might be just because im leicester its a fun game im definitely glad i bought it good for fans of the series if patched it could be brilliant they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in but they dont seem to have

first match ribery gets injured the rest of the players are on vacation so i cant play the next match because i only have 10 players restart first match ribery gets injured this game will improve or people will not buy fm 16 update march 2015 a key first team player was sold without my approval before i played the first training match update a key first team player was sent on  permanent holiday without my approval should in real life be fairly easy to buy the entire norwegian national team with real madrids budget in this game you cant even buy norways 3 best players combined but its not all bad some of the data collected on players are fair the layouts of representation possible player qualities are ok in real life grorud would never fill a stadium and they would near holding draw vs rbk tippeligaen and 1 division may be equal in skill but lower level teams suck hard the player helland must have been coded wrong in this game instead of dribbleing and shooting at the goal this game depicts him as a total not intelligent at all person number of injuries for my team does not feel realistic 3 critical injuries just before and iin first training match is far too many in real life the player malec is a huge player 2 meter and one would notice him as much taller than the rest of the players on the football pitch the stadium at kristiansund is possibly corretly filled with people but the stadion i real life would be silent

i have a total of  500 hours in football manager 2013 and 2014 and thus i consider myself a fan of the series unfortunately tho fm 2015 is a big step back personally i miss the sliders and tweakings you could do in fm2013 but that is just my opinion what is not just an opinion is the horrible match engine there is basically two options which each have their different negatives 2d engine your team will score and conceed like  its totally normal that a game between bvb and bayern munich would end up 47 or something crazy like that 3d engine players are just stupid as f almost every tackle is a sliding tackle people will just consider hey lets not pick up that ball that is only 5 metres away from me because my mate that is 30 metres away is already going for it overall the ai in 3d mode is just rubbish goalkeepers do not know how to get out of the box even when they are set to sweeper keeper attack if they somehow get out on occasion tho they will just do stupid runs for the ball near the corner flag which result in very easy long shot goals for the opposition sorry si but you failed hope there is a patch some day i will certainly not be buying fm 2016 if anything stays like that

i enjoyed playing this game only with a friend as it introduced a competative side to be the most succesful manager the game has improved alot over the years but the 3d animations on the pitch still looks like garbage players skate around the pitch goalies make poor attempts to save the ball and overall it just looks horrible im still keeping my fingers crossed for a football manager game that has a great looking 3d match view

i finally gave in and gave this years well last years version a go thinking the problems couldnt be as bad as everyone says 7 matches in and im ready to delete the game and give up completely on the series which is a complete shadow of what it used to be 7th match of the season 4 injuries in 1 match all 3 of my strikers out injured afterwards 2 for 56 weeks and 1 for 34 months im a part time team who cant afford to buy anything and now my save is basically ruined because injury manager 2015 said screw you from the reviews this will happen time and time again si you used to be great i could throw hundreds of hours each year at every new version but somehow for the last 34 years youve made the match engine less realistic and less enjoyable to play and you seemingly have no interest in rsolving any of the issues because youre working on flashy new additions to the next game which amoutns down to dumbing it down even more making the match engine even more unrealistic but adding in more useless media interaction that does nothing to your gameplay
