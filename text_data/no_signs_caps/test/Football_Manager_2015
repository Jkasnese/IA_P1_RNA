this game is very good its much better than the previous years it seems a lot more technical and your decisions as a manager have more effect on your team and the game in general i love the idea of being able to edit your manager stats attacking defence ect its really good and its nice to be able to view them and use them in training if anyone needs a question answered id be happy to help  overall ill give the game 910  reason being is that its only the beta version but i cant see there being much changed for the full version in a few days time 7th november thank you for yet another great game

only complaint for fm15 is ridiculous prices for players tried to buy shaquri from bayer and they wanted 67 million no way is he worth that 1520 max then tried to buy kovacic from inter and they wanted 51 and lucas leiva this is ruining the game with stupid prices hope they can sort this out
recommended
love this game not much difference from last year and my cons are that im liverpool beat bayern munich 41 had like 20 shots  beat chelsea 21 had 15 shots played crystal palce my striker missed two sitters this stiker has finshing of like 19 losted 31 there striker score hatrick with finshing of like 13 makes sence i had 25 shots they had 5  4 on target

i have loved this game series for years and preordered the new one and even though i would reccomend it it is slightly bizarre loads of goals loads of injuries loads of yellowred cards and sometimes you go on losing streaks that are unrealistic and absolutely impossible to get out of i finally managed to get ahead in a game and one of my players was sent off so i lost it sort of seems like they want to make it as difficult as possible they just need to tone it all down a little bit and it should be fine i mean one player i was against scored 4 in the first half i mean liverpol are bad the moment but i think it is slightly unrealistic for abel hernandez to get 4 against me in the capital one cup in less tha 45 minutes never mind i can focus on the league oh wait it is impossible to win in it im sure it will improve once the beta period is over
recommended
based on beta  played all games since day 1 and most have had there issues but then its very hard to wipe out all problems with such a variation of methods nothing i would class as gaming breaking occured and any issues with 3d engine can generally be ignored or altered tactics wise to suit easily the best and most comprehensive version thus far much improvement to gui scouting etc and requires more patience when lower league think all the changes are for the better and enjoying new challenge of working out all the new nuances and mechanics
recommended
i will recommend that you buy this game dont listen to all this negative recommendations
recommended
this game is very fun to play it still has a few bugs but hell its still in beta full game release is 7th of november be sure to get it if you havent already because this game is sick
recommended
the game is just awesome really good job from sport interactive i suggest it 100% careful with crash i had crash but sega helped me  buy this  <3
recommended
the beautiful game just ot a make over after playing the series for a number of years now i was expecting the same thing yet it seems so much improved on things i didnt even know needed improving 1 example is the competitions menu it shows where you are in the league and cups the staff are more helpful and i like the introduction to tunnel interviews the 3d graphics now involve motion capture in them and look much improved 1 thing that is really noticeable is tweaking a system example my false 9 striker was not getting any goals but i was winning games i change him to poacher and he gets bucket loads if you love football and you love the idea of managing your fave team get this its a no brainer
recommended
so far so good lots of new features to play with couple of downsides so far though new layout seems more cluttered than before stock skin is horrible on the eyes hoping someone makes a nice clean skin like fm2014 was easy on the eyes playing as a club with red as a primary colour if very difficlut to do as are some of the other colours not so bad with white
recommended
well in my opinion this is by far the best football manager to date the graphics on the 3d match are really good the gameplay seems alot smoother goalkeepers actually make really good saves ive seen alot of people moaning about the beta version what you all need to understand is the whole point of this is so any problems that do occor you let them no they fix it and to be fair there are a few faults 1 theres way to many injuries within pre season 2 theres been to many times when the ball is in the box and the strikers or defence dont really do anything about it too many realistic goalscoring chances missed 3 ridiculous transfer fees i no in fm14 it was the same but it seems unless you have 40 million to spend on one half decent player then you aint getting a half decent player theres a few more things but i reckon the developers will fix all this before the game is actually released so im not worried its well worth the money and if your a die hard football manager player then once this little things are fixed youll love it
recommended
i love the series but this one is a mess so far there are some good new features in the game like the new scouting system  makes the game experience even more realistic i played with carlisle utd  a low profile team in england second devision which relegated from 1st devision last season the initial goal was promotion  the board set a budget of 0 transfer funds and 45k wages for additional players i believe this goal is almost impossible to achieve even for the most hardcore players i loaned 8 players for free from teams in the premier league and signed few free agents but even with them my team couldnt match most teams in 2nd dev i am still recommanding the game because i believe si will fix all issues
recommended
good game  honestly i still prefer the layoutinterface from 2014 but i probs just need to get used to it crashed on me twice over 3 hours mac which is extremely annoying as i have to replay games won 3 the first time it crashed played the games again and drew 2 lost 1 as a result my macbook nearly went out the window get it sorted also faaaaaar too many injuries  most of them being 3weeks 4 games into the season and half my team were injured although this is only the beta there are loads of changes that have to be made and hopefully they are fixed when the full game is released if it stays the same way chances are i wont have a laptop to play it on for very long
recommended
although the most challenging of the series so far more because of the new adaption to the layout and the scouting methods for me its a big improvement on user interface but the harsh amount of injuries it makes progression a longer task where you have to put mild detail into the smaller things instead of throwing it to your below par am i suggest it if you put a good amount of time into the later games but for a newbie 1314 would be a safer choice in the way of enjoyment of the game and winning things
recommended
its good
recommended
just as good as every other there is no better game out there
recommended
injuries are broken other than that its good 
recommended
pros new ui while it may take some getting used to its superior to the old one scourting much better and more realistic than the old system also great new scouting reports stadium view with banners chatting with players board journalists etc improved new tactics creator much better both vissually and technically cons need some patching goalkeepers seems to be completely useless even the top ones plus their reactions in 3d game engines reminds me of kidengarden kids tring to goalkeep they make me wanna go to 2d games again the new generic logos for the non lincenced leagues are bad guess well have to wait for workshop to fix edit after all the patching the game is much better the goalkeeper works much much better
recommended
my first football manager game i love fifa series and decided to try fm15 wasnt disappointed great game
recommended
this game is a pure simulation for all football fans i recommend it
recommended
i feel fm 15 to be exceptional i believe the match engine to be very modern and that the new user interface is revolutionaryi played the beta which i found brilliantbut there were some probs but im glad to say they have been fixed for the full game i was falling away from fm for a bit dispite play each of the last 5 but fm15 has brought me right back to why i fell in love with football manager
recommended
very much similar to previous iterationsbut thats exactly what we are looking for
recommended
i feel this is the best football manager out of all the old ones it is much more fun with plenty of things to do to improve your team and many difficult decisions you have to make to become successful therefore i recommend all of you to buy it if you are interested in football but the negative side of this game is that it does not have enough online players willing to play online it is more fun if you play it with friends on a side note if you want to join me in football manager you can add me im almost always on steam
recommended
addictive

football manager                                                    thanks fm

i bought this game expecting to be hired by a real football club however im still waiting this is slower than amazon
recommended
look no game can be perfect yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine but for a simulator such as this fm is frankly amazing overall i have to say that football manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all football fanatics if you are a past fm player and have been dissapointed with past versions i honestly beg you to revisit your perspective and try out fm15 please it is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money 910
recommended
nice game nice interface pretty accurate database i always thought that it was a scissors paper rock game and i should just fine the thing to win all games but its not the thing you do on the bench really affects the players on the field the 3d is indeed pretty bad but for me it doesnt matter because i use 2d if i wanted a graphical football game i would have chosen fifa instead the initial version was full of bugs but now with the latest updates it feels good
recommended
calling football manager the best management sim out there is always a redundant statement true as it is its peerless excellence has chased any significant rivals away but the biggest task is tempting players away from their carefully built career in the previous game sports interactive know that its games biggest competition remains itself and as you may tell your team at halftime they must guard against complacency fm15s changes tend to contribute to gentle improvement rather than startling disruption but should do enough to tempt you into starting that managerial journey all over again
recommended
infinitely better than fifa also i have no life any longer
recommended
it is a great game to play and the menus look better it is worth the money

this game is great but the player interactions are broken
recommended
great game
recommended
one of the best football manager games on steam
recommended
been playing the game for a long time now probably the best game that makes you spend your whole day your 10 minutes turn in to 2 hours of playing
recommended
holy ing injuries this game constantly has me sweating over whos getting hurt next my first play through i fell into debt because i was over spending trying to make sure depth was covered due to injury honestly i know injuries are a part of the game but  me this is crazy its still fm and i still enjoy fm a lot but is there some ing way we can tone down the injuries
recommended
one of the best football manager games on steam
recommended
fun and worth
recommended
still the best football simulator game after i missed the 2014 series this 2015 series is a much improvement from 2013 series the most improved part is 1 higher complexity in handling players contracts and negotiation with other clubs as well as 2 the improved tactical variety players role etc while this could be a little bit cumbersome for those who new to this series i believe the builtin tutorial will be very useful
recommended
great game veteran player of football manager series and i feel this game lives up to the football manager reputation i got it at christmas time so missed reported bugs that now mainly seem to be fixed as ever match engine can be tweaked to make it better but overall football manager 2015 will provide many hours of fun
recommended
another wonderful addition to the football manager franchise im an avid fan of the game and truely love this version dont be put off by all the negative comments if you enjoyed playing any of the previous versions buy this one and just quite simpily expect more details brilliant purcahase hours of funswearing at your players may i also reccomend the dvd released along side this game it was a fantastic insight i wont spoil it for you though

recommended
ive bought this game two days ago and before that ive read lots of reviews there was one review that came to me after two days of playing it could have been an update not a new game and it really should except for design an few minor new features everything is excatly the same as it was in fm2014 i will always reccomend this game it is still the best simulation of this kind but if they sell it as a new game they should make more then a few minor changes for me fm2015 is very expensive update
recommended
first season caused lot of injuries but after 1st season injuries gone its balanced and enjoable
recommended
very addicting game love every minute of it if you love football you will love this game although this years version takes some getting used to i definitely rate it higher than fm14
recommended
1010 this game has ruined more of my hours than anything else have been playing football manager games even before steam  absolutely sucks you in the best part is when the players you scouted and picked up in game for cheap become super stars in real life 
recommended
for all the people on here complaining about goal bugs etc they have almost all been fixed this is clearly the best football manager yet much more in depth and yes there are a few flaws but if youd care to name me one decent videogame without a few flaws id be much abliged to hear if you are a fan of football management sims get this game its as simple as that 
recommended
good game like all year 
recommended
i have played this for a whole now last time i played fm was fm12 i really like the fact they have two different game modes  if you want to cheat you dont have to add a third party application in this time with viruses etc its a great thing to have a thing available that the public wants it should be free and not a payed add on if you like fm i can warmly recommend this game it tuns smoothly i think its easier to play than earlier verions the ingame graphics are much better even on the laptop im playing with
recommended
very good game best of the fm games shame about the premier league not having the licensed badges but this can be added using steam workshopgame is more fun when playing online together rather than single player my opinion would definitely recommend
recommended
too realistic played as liverpool steven gerrard slipped so much ok now really im been a fan for football manager but not a big one i normaly pick it up soon after it was released i like always start with a team at the lowest divison and build up to get to the top when i did that i did another mode and choose a random team it was west ham united so far ive played both alot and experience only one problem that it quite a lot of injuries it was normal and still is im not really an expert on this but i dont care about it i found it very fun and play it more than often now
recommended
the best football manager yet just expect regular injury crises
recommended
bugged game won premier league with arsenal 1010
recommended
this is a true greate game
recommended
football manager 2015 is a great game for anyone who loves football soccer and this simulation game has been great
recommended
it has beautiful match engiene some glitches but overall its fun to play the scorelines do seem to be unrealistic at times but i love how everything has unfolded beautifully in 2015 you have that thrill playing against the rivals and getting new big name player id love it to be bit harder and have some more tactical and traning settings
recommended
certainly one of the more difficult games in the series but easy enough to master after a while ive always been a fan of the championship managerfootball manager games and i cant see that changing any time soon
recommended
i love this game the people who keep saying its bad dont know how to play the game properly its one of the best in years for me
recommended
every year i cant seem to stop playing football manager
recommended
best one yet 5 stars
recommended
i hate this game
recommended
first football manager that i have ever played so i cant really tell if previous games were much betterworse i havent had any bad experiences with the game the game runs smooth no crashes or other errorrelated situations also the diversity and possibilities within the game are good in my opinion i am playing an online mode with a friend of mine which makes the game even more fun never thought i could be so addicted to this game but wowits pretty addictive if i say so
recommended
yeah its good buy it
recommended
i cant enable in game community to access the in game editor can someone help
recommended
core experience remains the same but an upgraded match engine and a few new features make this a worthwhile addition much like its predecessor fm2015 is an evolution of the series rather than a revolution this is both a bad and a good thing the main differences between 2014 are mainly numerous small things that i will not mention here i will mention the two things that stand out to me however 1 match engine this has been in my opinion greatly improved matches seem to flow better there are far more moves goals scored seem mutch more varied and over all it makes it harder to predict the outcome of a move something i found i could do with previous match engines due to having seen the same move over and over again overall i think this is the best 3d match engine they have released 2 layout for some reason they have decided to completly change the layout and all the menus etc this is still pssing me off as the changes seem illogical and now takes me much longer to go to screens than before i can see no reason for the change apart from for changes sake it doesnt make things easier or quicker or more intuitive and generally just slows things down as it can take awhile to dig into sub menu after sub menu to look for the page you want for existing fm2014 fans this may not have enough of a change to warrant a full price purchase but for players of older versions or new players i think the updated match engine do warrant the game for consideration overall i do recommend the game as overall i find the fm series to be excellent however note there are not a massive amount of changes compared to the last release
recommended
with last update i am beging to love the game with proper graphics it almost like fifa 13 graphics in terms of game play but still need improvement the best aspect of this is the scounting aspect you need to get this games in order to experience what i am talking about
recommended
ive been playing this game for 5 years and ill always say  yes to football manager and no to other soccer management simulation games this game have the largest player and stuffs database salaries and characteristics are close to real and the diversity of tactical changes makes us to think in a new way with each new step developers doing football manager more interesting and better the only disadvantage was and still is the graphics of 3d matches but its not the games main component there is no limit to perfection as they say my mark is 9 out of 10
recommended
i ing hate this game
recommended
it is a fun game to play you should get it it is worth the money i have never played at football maneger before but i will be sure to continue
recommended
more of what made the past games great
recommended
this is probably the best football manager simulation in the market the game is deep and also quite difficult if you are brave enough to manage lower tier clubs si seem to ix the bugs and there are no game breaking bugs which i have encountered for the football fanatics out there this game is highly recommended

recommended
great for any football fan who loves the more tactical approach to football football manager offers great detail without scaring you off by being overcomplicated also there is great choice in game as you can choose to take a lower league or nonleague club and rise to european glory or start at the top and try to retain your position there a great buy
recommended
any true football fan out there would love this game anyone who thinks fifa is realistic will think again after playing this it is not better or worse than fifa because they are such different games fifa for fun with friends or playing with realistic graphics wins every time football manager however is all about sitting on your own for hours and hours working away and taking a side to the top by managing in a realistic and hugely entertaining manner
recommended
best football managment game out there only negative is that at start of season 1 the money youget is vlowglitch or intetional 99910

recommended
really enjoying the game right now i like starting with a lower league team and rising them up to the top league im currently playing as stoke after being offered a job there because i promoted york city to the championship loads of possibilities my only issue is that there should be some fmc features in the normal fm mode apart from that good game
recommended
okay i only have 11 hours but i will keep this very simple for you 1 the game is really fun a lot of scoring and cool new animations xd but yes but this game is filled of injuries i just had 3 injuries in one game my replacement for the injured player got injured someone will be out for 45 monmths in the first 5 minutes he injured for another 9 yesars damn
recommended
not just a game its a lifestyle
recommended
if you love football get it if you dont but like management sims get it if you like neither just get it already stop reading reviews its awesome
recommended
best football manager so far and i play it for more than 10 years
recommended
takes over your life
recommended
a great game that deserve all the plaudits a rather addictive games that keep you going on and on for more tactially exciting and intriguing at the same time looking forward to the upcoming fm 2016 addition
recommended
the best manager simulation ive played so fari dont know why theres a lot of people dont recommend this gamethis game is awesome     maybe because i buy it while on sale xd

football manager puts your favorite clubs fate into your hands will you get them promoted will you get them relegated will you win the league will you win the european cup these are all questions you must decide before taking hold of your club i took charge of ac milan and was able to win the league 4 times the domestic cup 3 times and the champions league 2 times in 4 years the modding community is great because you can do everything from recreating you favorite childhood players from changing the skin of your game fm is a great addicting game for any passionate fan of the beutiful game and must be respected as such because fm is life
recommended
my review is based on whether its worth upgrading from fm14 i was waiting for fm15 to come out on sale and when it had been patched enough to get rid of most tof the bugs i can never see the point in buying a game at full price when its still buggy especially when its only an update played the free weekend and based on that short time there are some improvements in areas such as layout and graphics the only slightly annoying thing i came across was when i had a friendly cancelled against a chinese side and i could only pick a replacement friendly from minor chinese sides not anywhere else as i could in fm14 in the time that i played i didnt have any injury problems but didnt get enough games in to test that properly still a few quirks in match play but no worse than fm14 though unfortunately no better either personally apart from the updated squads i didnt think it was worth upgrading from fm14 and have decided to wait until fm16 comes out on sale and fully patched of course ive still given this a recommend as if you havent got fm14 then its still a good game and highly adictive
recommended
pretty good game as usual very addictive definitely recommend a

a lot of people over the years have hated certain new installments of football manager however for an addict who has been playing since the first cm came out everything is as beautiful as it should be every year  unless you play with the 3d graphics on which is absolutely horrid but then again you can never go wrong with 2d of course there are some bugs during matches and some inequities but when youre a manager you know that life aint fair keep on managing till you cry blood when you score with your underdog team against one of the big guys of football and have that mental  when your months of tactical work pays in the end the best  that has been changed are the ui scouting and the tactics panel i absolutely love the new circular star things over the players in the tactics screen im an fm addict so whatever you give me i will play but those of you who feel the same about it will surely love and play this game anyway we need that fix yo
recommended
brilliant game yes injuries are mainly constant but players normally only out for around a week topspeople make it sound like months new patch also has resolved concerns on the bad situation invlolve the defencegoalkeeper highly recommend
recommended
really enjoying this game although there was lots of injuries when i first started i feel like the game is a harder and focuses more on man management for example if your player is unhappy about their contract or the amount of games hes played then he can disrupt the squad unless you sort the problem out overall im enjoying the game my highlight so far has been managing man utd and being 30 down at half time against newcastle at st jamess park before switching to an attacking tactic i created and bringing on james wilson who scored a hattrick in an incredible 43 comeback that included two stoppage time goals
recommended
review after update 1503 the game goes much nicer then the first one after this update match engine improvement many bugs been solved though some not fixed yet but its expected since its still on beta cant wait the full release on november 7 i hope by that time most of the remaining bugs or maybe all the bugs are fixed i love the side bar panel on this year version sure need time to get used to it but for me its more simple and nice to see they put much more detail on feature on this year version too like team talk etc many improvement from last year version that i cant write it all but for me its worth to buy it though its still on beta and even more worth to buy after the 1503 update almost 100 hours playtime on two weeks for me that mean this is a game that worth to be in your library if you like to become a football manager
recommended
this game is a must have i hate soccer in real life its so boring to watch and i think its one of the worst sports however this game is amazing that it makes me like soccer and makes me want to get into it the realistism of this game from simple stuff like player moral to the more complicated things if only ea sports could do as good of a job as this company does this is way better then football manger 2014 fyi
recommended
addictive really addictive really really addictive

tunnel interviews d nothing more needs to be said currently ill review further after sleep and sustinence
recommended
still the best football game available on pc for those who want an indepth football experience with an almost endless varity of opinions and possibilities it is a must for any football fan 1010
recommended
the sidebar is welcome generally the screen layouts have been much improved however the match engine feels like a bit of a backward step although i understand that its early days for the motioncapture route their taking the one thing that drives me mad the most is the sound of ball being kicked a noise happens every time a player kicks the ball even if its a mere tap a foot a head of them this is most fustrating during intrasquad friendlies when there is no crowd noise to ease the pain
recommended
i was really looking forward to playing football manager 2015 on pc as ive always experienced only hanheld version the difference in accuracy and particulars between the two is immediatly noticeable there are two main modalities a simplified one closer to handheld versions and a fullsimulation one suggested to expert fm gamers according to me the game in both modalitites is quite difficult furthermore im really concerned with the fact that i cant find a suitable tactic for my team managers functions are completely outstanding as the give you a wide range of possibilities and in genereal they seem to be close to reality in general the game is really entartaining and amazing with nice 3d graphis that enhance the whole simulation effect in general the game is very nice
recommended
hooked already great game and love most of the changes
recommended
so far this such a great game just downloaded and it is entirely better then any previous versions hands down one of the best football simulations to date
recommended
every year is ing better best football simulator in the history of humankind hahaha

good game but takes 3 minutes at least to save the game please fix that

loving the beta cant wait for full game on the 7th

nice game  after not playing this game since 2008

first of i have to say that i love the fm series with over 180 hours in fm2012 near 200 in fm2013 and near 400 hours in fm14 i started the game as manchester united and played my first season being crowned champions i believe i have an idea about the game so here are some pros and cons pros the interface takes a while to get use to is great better game engine animations and such new ways to transfer players talking them into it etc scouting makes sense game created youngsters are good potential view is better at scouting cons its hard to sell players talking to the chairmen got harder wonderkids level up in a long time update 2 since the game came out i changed the review 910

love the game new to the manager series computer and they help you understand everything and give you tips

loving the beta love the new interface better scouting and training system animation is better except the part where players seem to be skating i dont care worth every penny for the fans of the series if you are new to the seriesgenre then you may wish to wait out the bug fixing phases
recommended
it has many bug on macbook pro osx 1010 yosemite ex every quality of match graphic isnt smooth please deverlop for osx 1010

bought this game yesterday and is playing through the betavery nice interface much better than fm2014 looking very nice cant tell enough as i have only played it for 90 minutes but it looks brilliant as usual
recommended
personally i like the game  finally i can move from fm13
recommended
i rate 88 but seriously though this is a great game for the past two years ive spent way too many hours on football manager games and i reckon this wont be any different yeah there are some problems yeah it could be better in some ways but hey its a brilliant game other than these miniscual problems i fully recommened it to anyone intrested in football as its a game with so much depth you wouldnt beleive pros  detaildepth the database is used by real clubs its accurate addictive you just dont get bored challenging its much more challenging than in recent years interactions its nice to see much more options in interviews 3d match engine yeah its got its problems explained below but its still good new ui design the new user interface is so much easier to navigate give it a couple of hours and youll never want o go back cons  3d match engine the only reason its a problem is if your tactics arent good enough it makes the players make stupid mistakes and can be quite unrealisitic and frustrating but if it was 2d it wouldnt be as bad just because you cant see the mistakes as much just get your tactics right match engine so hard to defend so easy to score expect lots of high scoring games for no reason crashes this has happened 34 times since i got it on the 2910 happens at any time hope it gets sorted soon just set it to save every fortnight and youll be fine so overall another great game which i much prefer over the recent games and fully recommend
recommended
absoutely love the new interface only thing i dont like is that there is a large emphasis on scouting this year much much more so than last years edition
recommended
well after fm 14 i didnt think that m going to buy another fm but i decided to give it another chance and i m proud of my decision even in beta its a better game than fm 14 interface is nice and clean with a lot of information scouting is really good and match engine is really smooth with motion capture even in beta this game is the best fm game ever

while presenting an extremely innovative and immersive experience of the football management appeal it leaves gamers who are unfamiliar or rookie to the sport in the dark though the game is of high appeal to those who are well versed in the world of english football one could easily advise those who are unfamiliar to steer away this game is not for novices this isnt to say that this lack of equality is a detraction from the game itself  quite the opposite  for those seasoned in english football the game provides a beautiful experience for the hotseat of game management and requires extremely detailed choices for all aspects of the job in order to ensure success both on the field and off
recommended
this game is highly reccommended by me 100% buy the game has had a huge improvement from 2014 and the game has come a long way since it first started 1 huge feature that they have improved is the way your team listen your advice and it can actually make a difference in your new features making it a more realistic manager simulator the wide range of players and team availabe and giving you a chance to choose how much of an experienced manager you are this is a must buy to big football manager fans and dont be dragged into it being a copy of last years version to me it is a huge improvement from 2014 must buy
recommended
this is a really good game ive found it really enjoyable this year the user interface looks really good and ive found myself using sections i wouldnt of touched if not for the sidebar the 3d match engine as always is good but i think fellow fmers expect too much of it this is a football management game and not a football player game so the match engine is not my priority nor should it be sis 910
recommended
best football management game theres is simple as that
recommended
its awesome as long as si fixes the known bugs then it will be legendary hope they keep proactive and updates often
recommended
this is the best fm ive ever played some wonderkids really can make a difference despite of their young age the game machine is getting better
recommended
great game gfx best ever new look is good takes some getting used to but easy to figure out
recommended
its still the classic football manager but the new interface just inst quite as intuiative as the old some good new features but a few bad perhaps i need time to get used to it but i have had to look some things up to work out how to do them there is definate room for improvement not too sure about the role you play as a coach either but that might develop
recommended
i dont know about the negative comments out here but mine is fine and perfectly run smooth i love the new match animation you now can be satisfied when you have player with high technique in your team love it
recommended
buy this game hire roy keane as assistant manager this game have done something completely new to the series it has managed to perfectly capture the personality of roy keane im so amazed at how everything this game makes him say or do matches reality 100% the brutality of his tactical advices his ability to motivate his nononsense way of dealing with reporters also hes a mental coach so theres the fitful juxtaposition roy keane mental in every advice tab ive not had any bugs and everything is running smoothly great game
recommended
i purchased this game two days ago while it was in the beta version and then today clicked to play and had to wait for a download which i assume would be the fully updated game and i have found it is exactly the same as the beta version i am talking about things like the team badges prem leauge in the beta version they are made up and have seen videos on youtube of people playing fm2015 with the teams having the real and correct badges can anyone tell me how this is and where i am going wrongi have looked for another update for the game with no luck the spanish teams have their real crests but most other countries do not so i feel steam have robbed me as i cannot find a way to contact them
recommended
match engine not as good asprevious needs major surgery if it is to succeed
recommended
great as always
recommended
keepers seem to be really slow at reacting and bad back passes are a reoccurring theme but overall a solid game
recommended
the only things i dont like is the skin its very dark i dont like to see the player profile with all that green atributes its not visual apealing and the new scout system seems a little messy in fm 2014 the scouts spent a reasonable time in a task before moving to another in this version they will keep searching until you say oposite if i give 5 tasks to my scout he will only do one he doesnt automaticaly starts another task when he doenst find any nice players besides this the game is awsome as allways it was money well spent
recommended
really dont understand these complaints about high scoring and bad goals id had the game since the beta came out and suffered no such issues ive started a man utd file a spurs file a norwich file and an online southampton file and my only complaint is unrealistic league positions like burnley being 2nd by december or chelsea being 18th for the 1st 2 months of the season ive lost 40 to blackburn in my online file but i can say that was due to me throwing together players who werent tired from a mid week game maybe im one of the rare lucky experiences but the concept of football manager is to build a team with your tactics and your players you cant just make a tactic and throw players together without them playing together for a couple of months regularly chopping and changing disrupts the chemistry of the team thats why there is a bar to determine how comfortable your team is with all tactics and formations i agree that defending can be non existent at times but again you just need the correct player and team instructions to put this right
recommended
the game is quite good some new features but why you change things without a reason just to change something what i dont like 1 tactics screen these drop down boxes really bad idea chaos 2 new skin and colors fm2014 had a good skin and colors improved from version fm2013 if something is good dont change it just to add something new 3 i dont use 3d engine but it looks fine however players still swim or fly on a pitch animations still really poor to si if you could change these tact screen and add a new skin and normal colors would be great one more thing si i think that after all these years you could get more licences hyyy if ea can whats the problem still worth to buy
recommended
good game love the series and this game has been very enjoyable to all those talking about highscore lines its football in football there are all kinds of scorelines if your a fan buy it of course it has its issues but si do patch the games its a well supported game
recommended
great
recommended
new ui is very good seems that there is a lot of matches with too many goals too easy to score and concede
recommended
it all comes together after years of being a wierd disjointed experience
recommended
well its obviously much improved from last year fm edition improved gui which need sometime to navigate through much improved scouting etc that was exciting but of course it can still improve for the upcoming weeks
recommended
decent sports sim game does have the drawbacks of quiet a steep price for what youre getting due to a certian amount of repetitivness all in all a fun game though and if youre into football and want something different to fifa 15 a decent buy
recommended
keepers seem to be really slow at reacting and bad back passes are a reoccurring theme but overall a solid game

i was always a bit nervous about the releasing of a new version of this game ive played all of these since 2010 but the last two versions of the game were pretty disappointing always best soccerfootball management games on the market though and im pretty happy to say that this year the game is good also at the current update it have a nicer design is more realistic they have improved the player market still more work should be done on this and the game is faster to sim i always liked sim games but i think the better game by si was ehm 2007 this because it was funny great still best hockey simmanagement game on the market and really fast i dont really understand why they give you all the rosters teams and championships of the world if you cannot select more than 1015 of them with the rest of the world that remain silence no players no offer for your players what i really miss is an option to fast simulate championships as ehm 2007 give you as an option i prefer to lost a little and also more of info but be able to sim a world however this year the game as improved much in this sense you still have to be able to play on a nice system but im currently sim all the default teams excepts from asia with a small database and the game seems smooth i dont know if can be worth to add asia and mods for new championships as the game suffer from a great deterioration of sims speed if you play with more of 120000 players 140000 are still good really recommended
recommended
over 200 hours into fm 2015 and more than 1000 of hours in its predecessors i find myself surrounded by over 50 football shirts of obscure teams i managed on the game my degree has been delayed for two years now but i am 17 matches unbeaten in new caledonia
recommended
at the time of posting fm 15 has very few bugs after a poor release and is now at the point where anyone who was holding off on getting it should pick it up
recommended
good game defending is a bit wonky and ai offers and agrees to player swaps way more than in reality
recommended
great improvement on graphic this year
recommended
great game
recommended
better then 2014 thats for sure
recommended
its awesome
recommended
the graphics look solid and the gameplay is so smooth but only bad thing is set pieces because i use manu and i conceded 24 set pieces from 26 goals that i conceded but apart of that everything alright9
recommended
i like the game itd be nice if steam could take a long walk of a short cliff though as its ruddy obstructive and annoying when it stops me playing stupid software
recommended
good game plays well there arent too many injuries as some have suggested nor is it too difficult with a well devised tactic and a solid training plan success is very possible having said that there is now a bug that prevents the loading of the game at all steam yet again is proving to be an utter abortion of an application why on earth im compelled to use this third party trash to load my game is completely beyond me
recommended
great game i played so far the new design is refreshing giving a new hole experience on this amazing saga of conquests
recommended
great game
recommended
this version of football manager is much more realistic in terms of the match engine people have been saying that scorelines are very large and unrealistic but that has not happened with me i concede about a goal a match and that is normal i do not see huge scorelines even in other leagues there are occassional blowouts like 62 or 50 but tht happens in real football matches too i mean so far this season real madrid beat deportivo 82 and sunderland lost to southampton 80 so these blowouts are normal and happen every season the scouting ystem is way better than in fm 14 and the whole face of fm 15 is revamped and looks so much better the only complaint i have is sometimes it is hard to fing things like how to demote a player to my u21s or how to search for staff other than that its a complete and fun game to play 810
recommended
cant seem to get started again after beta version but was good upto that point
recommended
its football manager
recommended
this game is a must buy
recommended
overall the best fm gameplay ever  im hooked on to this fm15
recommended
not sure there are bug or not but average booked 4yellow card per match wth btw overall still is a good game
recommended
sound game if your a fan of the fm series then your sure to like this game the game continues to progress each year although there is only slight change it does make a much more beneficial outcome
recommended
the fixes have been excellent and fm 15 is a fantastic game

awesome game im a big fan of it

great game if this is what you are into football club simulator basically at its core when you get into it you keep wanting to see what happens after the next match wish i had more time to play
recommended
i would heavily reccomend this years version of football manager in my opinon it is quite a bit better than last years version the bugs in the match engine have been fixed and it plays better than ever the new ui is nice and slick very useable and saves me a lot of time the biggest improvement is the scouting system though its much more dynamic and genuinley interesting compared to before
recommended
i recommend this game i love football maneger and this one its one of the best some bugs of course but nothing to worry about with
recommended
while no significant changes since fm2014 its a worthy improvement especially with the new ui some of the earlier issues have been addressed by the latest updates but still the defensive  crossing aspect of the game engine seems rather flawed also the motivational man management of the squad can be rather annoying to deal with its just a matter of learning the best responses to the relevant question scouting has been much improved in terms of realism over recent incarnations of the franchise worth buying but not an essential purchase 710
recommended
overall very decent good upgrade to 13 although the game time sideline chat feels like it doesnt have much affect easy to explore good menu design and new report page with strengths and weaknesses comes in handy
recommended
a must for true football passionees  passionate people 
recommended
would defonately recommend to the fellow football fan
recommended
ive played football manager for years and its always slightly tweeked from the previous edition however fm15 is totally different love that you can shout at your players mid half and the choice of what you can say is good buying and selling players is harder but it is easier to win matches cos you have more control of your tactics ill give it 8510
recommended
database accurate and very fun game
recommended
really fun and good reallity 
recommended
same as 2014 but with a 5 instead
recommended
it is ok i played a little
recommended
a bit overload of goald but apart from that amazing game an definate upgrade from last year
recommended
glorious
recommended
pros  the ui improvement  the scouting is more challenging and not auto reveal skills much more like real life  the game engine improved cons  i play it too much 910
recommended
just buy it simple as best game ever one downside is since i started playing fm when i got fm 12 i have been put on the missing presumed dead list rip social life
recommended
great  thats a perfect game 
recommended
unrealistic balotelli scored 2 against me fix please
recommended
not funny game and its cost so much p
not recommended
all the functions in the main menu are complex and up to date but as this is not a fifa recognised gamethe teams have wrong names and logosthe game play is worse than two cpu controlled teams playing each other in fifa 06 on a nintendo ds i would recommend total football manager 2005 by ea sports insteadmay not be available on the steam store
not recommended
i am playing the series since 1997 so i have a clear view of the game proggression through the years although i just bought my copy i can say that there are some really interesting changes like scouting reports the new 3d etc its a great game as you always expect from si sure there are some things that can be fixed with patches but i have to admit i am also worried about the injuries in my first game month my team already has 6 injuries and all of them are 6 weeks if that is some kind of bug and not just bad reallistic luck then i am sure it will be fixed in the next few weeks with a patch or update
recommended
i love this game i would also recommend to anybody that likes to play the game as relalisticly as possible to google mods for this game there are alot of mods that are not on steam workshop that are very easy to put in and it helped my gaming experence fm15 > fm14 all the way
recommended
new patch urgently change the match engine to make the game playable
recommended
i see all these negative reviews about fm 2015 and i strongly disagree with most of them first of all yeah there are a decent amount of injuries during a season i played quite a few seasons and after looking the average amount of injuries that occure both ingame and in real i must say it has been made quite realistic the amount of injuries i got a season appear to be just below the average in real so i must say this is quite good the amount of own goals has been a big complaint aswell but compare it with the amount the average top team of each league gets it is just a bit more than in real that is mainly because in real they dont count everything a own goal that has been last touched by a defending player while fm 2015 does i could go on for a while with ruining peoples their complaints but in general this version of fm is better than all of the previous ones the menu is amazing now and the possibilities are endless
recommended
good game better then 14 more tactiacally involved buy players want too much money and clubs want to much money for a player
recommended
they should actually try to make a good 3d so we could watch the games instead of just reading the comments or watching balls vs balls p and the injuries  anyway i enjoy 90% of the time playing it so its cool 
recommended
ive already bought the game but when i go onto steam i cant load the game up does anyone know what i can do
recommended
good information
recommended
its annoying that it gives away some bad goals rarely though but apart from that fm15 is a great game
recommended
bought this game after the december update and regarding the problems many other customers have complained about below i have to say after four full months of the first season i havnt had any problems with crazy amounts of injuries and the match engine is not producing crazy results its not a perfect game i think if the developers spent more time and effort on it then the game could be what it should be in the year 2015 after the 23 years of product development time theyve had since i first played cm on my amiga 500 back in the day not to get to long winded  in my opinion its the best version ive played yet but it should have been this good in 2001 pros  steam workshop fast gaming experience relative to previous versions lots of options not neccessarily overly complicated match engine is capable of the beautiful game at times and does manage to elicit strong emotions in me did i mention steam workshop cons  gks sometimes go mindless for a few seconds in match engine leading to fantasy breaking silly goals this happens maybe once every three games having to always watch the kick offs and final whistle highlights in match engine even if nothing interesting happens about once a game in the match engine a pointless highlight will show and last too long even though nothing interesting is happening
recommended
same game as the last couple of years its a little better with the newest patch but a lot of things still dont matter  the teamspeeches dont seem to do anything or you get negative results from it even though the game says you should say that to them  clubs controlled by the game buy up all of the best players and then dont even let them play making it very diffecult for you to create a team that can win big prices the players how go to those clubs and the after a year are put on the transferlist dont want to move to your club because they are playing at a better club even though they didnt play a single match  scouting uses a system where you can see what percentage your knowledge of a player 0100% is but there is no option in the scoutingmenu to say scout to a 100% and even then at 100% sometimes the players potential still isnt completly scouted  when asking the board to raise the salarycap for staff members it gets raised by 200 euros which isnt nearly enough to get any improvements  whenever one of your players get injured during a match its never the games fault it never gives itself a red or even a yellow card but you get red cards constantly  still cant reload my save during matches its an offline singleplayer game if i want to reload my save during a match who cares these are the main problems and yet its still very addictive the best football management game out there and i cant stop playing
recommended
me likes nice tweaks and updates from previous titles nothing groundbreaking perhaps but solid update and in my opinion worth the yearly upgrade
recommended
when i try to load my saved game it just comes up with cannot load saved game
recommended
ive owned cmfm since the early nineties and would reccomend this edition its a big improvement on last years edition match engine is better than its been for a while football manager classic has also improved and is a welcome break from the full fat edition a bit like the cm of old that was fast paced biggest con is still the media press conferences been in the game for a while now and they are complete crap
recommended
ooohh guys i havent seen enough of 3d match and playing to criticize injuries but tactical window is really awfull i am playing fm for three years and learned a lot of hints that use but i cannot cast overall team picture first of all it regarding player roles team in tactics window looks like a heap of scrap i failed to set up player roles through it new image of correspondece skills and position needs to measure with a scale it very uninformative second tactics windows on a match on my 15 display i see only part of player skills when try to find him optimal role its very very uncomfortably dear developers please fix it on the next patch but early will be better reccomendation is advance curse of fm that before third path  game is really different to play good luck we trust in you

football manager needs strong rivals just like a serious football team while the fm isnt the most innovative and most impressive game around its still the best football management title 810 would recommend
recommended
buy the game its deep its deeper its the deepest football simulator ever
recommended
i found the 2015 version to be so much better than the previous years get it
recommended
multiplayer works flawlessly in my experience playing with 3 friends everything outside of the match engine is significantly improved over last year the match engine is worse than ever with odd goalkeepers lots of injuries and extremely glitchy gameplay when playing online its really funny to see how awful the stadiums celebrations and general gameplay is and its still a great rpg in single player its considerably more frustrating but it makes for some funny stories and there isnt a better alternative if you want a realistic footballsoccer simulation this isnt it its not even close however you really arent going to do any better and you will still get over 500 hours out of it if its your kind of thing
recommended
everyone that is giving this game bad reviews is clearly just rubbish at it ive been a hardcore football manager player for years and this is by far the best yet mastered it hope all these with rubbish reviews get better at the game before leaving bad reviews 
recommended
quite different from the earlier versions and will take some time to adapt some new fixes but all in all it feels more or less just like an updated version of fm14 with transfers etc would still recommand unless you have higher expectations to the game
recommended
no problems with the game really good setup and layout
recommended
started with football manager 2013 just out of curiosity one of the top played games on steam being a soccer management game lolwut since then ive been hooked though this series continues to be the best management simulation game ive ever experienced and this year only gets better match engine and tactics are far better than in 2014 from what ive experienced so far and its a great game overall like always
recommended
first off i want to say that i was in two minds about getting this game reviews from the fans didnt seem very positive and as this game has a great community and fan following i was quite shocked the main criticism has been the frequency of injuries from what i have seen this is not even true if anything ive seen fewer injuries than in previous versions i have been looking closely to see this so called injury problem yet ive never seen more than two key players being injuried at one time and not even for very long its overall a great and addicting game and my favourite yet if im honest however the match engine although improved is quite poor and freak goalkeeper mistakes dont seem all that freak anymore as they occur quite a few times each season however im pretty sure the match engine isnt much to go by the commentary sometimes says completely different things to what the match engine shows  eg player shoots really wide but the commenary claims it was almost in this isnt much of a problem in all honesty and if you had commentary on only you wouldnt ever notice the new menu layout is really good in my opinion and finding what i want to do is now much easier and quicker making me actually pay more attention to tactics training and scouting which i have often ignored to a large extent in previous games overall id say this game is great and the series is still going strong so glad i got this game i would advise you buy it too
recommended
top game in the world  1111
recommended
its one of the best football games hands down
recommended
overall fm15 is a good game different from fm14 providing different tactics and new ways of training there are also some improvements regarding press conferences they are shorter compared to fm14 and the question variety is greater touchline team talks was also a good addition and the overall general layout is technically easier than fm14 saying that though if you are an experienced fm player be prepared to take a while to get used some minor details such as making a player avaliable to the under 21 squad is under the development tab instead of a squad tab the 3d match engine is slightly better however sometimes the goalkeepers do not behave like real goalkeepers in the 3d match engine not diving sometimes the keeper slides across on his two feet to save a shot instead of diving other than that it is an improvement however the game by default does not have badges or logos or many player faces you have to download that yourself the tactics are technically more straight foward if your new to fm you may find them easier compare to previous fms however if you are experienced it will take a while getting used to the changes to conclude i would reccomend the game however it is not a big improvement to 14 and it may perhaps be better to wait for 16 or wait for more updates however if you do decide to buy it it is still worth it
recommended
absolutely baffled by some of the negative comments about the game ive not played fm since fm 12 so maybe the minor improvements over the years impress me more than most i agree that the training is a liitle poor and needs work and i have only played 15 hours but overall ive found the game very good its not outstanding like the earlier versions but it is always going to be difficult to develop it so far forward without ruining the gaming or changing it beyond recognition so far i havent had any major issues with injuries and the match engine is fine with no silly mistakes and goals from all over the pitch if youve not played fm for a while like myself then buy it but it appears if you have been buying it year in year out then maybe you need to take a break away from the keyboard get some fresh air a bit of sun and come back to it in a year or two oh and some places sell the game for 20 which isnt a lot really

i hate the issue of syc cloud for my save game i have been playing on 2 computers and i never get syn for my save file and do not tell me about setting that click on that little check box i have done hate this problemmmmmmmmmm

there really is no game on the market that puts you more into the situation of being someone you are not of giving you the role of a manager of involving you in the day to day trials and minutia of that job and aside from that this years version though weirdly under publicised for some reason is a comparatively huge leap forward for the franchise and i would reccommend it to anyone  even if you have zero interest in football hell im not even a fan of football myself  its just that the tactical depth of this game is unsurpassed by anything else out there most importantly for fans of the series the overhaul on the match engine this time has really made games a joy to watch touchline instructions following advice from your assistant are vastly more intuitive the tactics editor is finally streamlined and comprehensive and the old tooltips system has been replaced by a novel and extremely usefull  help system it isnt without small faults the random training injuries this year can seem extreme your best player can be out for a season for being injured whilst picking his nose i know footballers are pansies but come on experienced players will find that it takes some adjusting to familiarise yourself with where everything is despite all the help and information now made available some of the player interactions whilst they certainly make things more interesting just arent that likely  getting totally raged on by one of your players simply because he does not play in every single game can snowball into him deliberately infecting the rest of the team and the board sacking you and again i find this a little extreme also the new ability to use social media doesnt work quite the way it should and is heavilly biased toward google despite its many tiny flaws this years version is far better than any that have gone before the negative reviews from long term fans are in my opinion written by people who do not like change regardless of what you think about the series this is the best fm game there is 90%

i have only played this game a little bit but its ok

enjoying the new layout although its taking a little longer than i expected to adjust the game does seem to be a bit harder than 2013 and 2014 which is good

its a great game im really enjoying it only down side that i find extremely annoying is how difficult it is to buy top class players the value of some is shocking for example im chelsea into the third season with around 77 mil to spend i attempt to buy suarez he is valued at 22 million i offer 50 mil and oscar for him there reply is they want 200 mil lol this has happened with every world class player i attempt to buy even ross barkley cost me near 60 mil put apart from that its an enjoyable game and very addictive buy it in the sales
recommended
i bought this game a little while after its release and have to say i had some issue initiallyi think its very very different from earlier games and that was an initial turn off but now iam abit more into it i think its wonderfulas addictive and fluid as ever time to change my underwear as before 
recommended
good games
recommended
such an addictive game once you get in to it great fun getting a low team into the top league
recommended
i absolutely love this game
recommended
great game
recommended
i havent played since fm13 and im happy so far very addictive nice layout and easy setup having a lot of trouble in the transfer market so far but its still only the first season on it so im hoping to figure that out would recommend 
recommended
the game definitely has some issues but it is still your bog standard footy manager and i am enjoying it
recommended
great great game best football manager i have had and i have had 5
recommended
i saw rather a lot of negative reviews for this complaining not enough has changed or been added from previous additions this is the issue with sports games we predominantly pay for the transfer window update and a new skin but with the return of the side bar better player interactions and the weight of your decisions being more important than ever  football manager 2015 is just as addictive before and im sure i will sink many more hours into this until 2016 version is released with updated transfers and a new skin ultimately this is the best thing to sink hours into and with no alternative and its much better than fifa for management sims this is as good as it gets
recommended
its better than 2014 version
recommended
reading all the negative reviews of the game i thought id come and give my two cents ive played fm since the 2005 edition and fm15 is my favourite iteration yet the game makes you feel now more than ever like youre in charge of a football team that is composed of individuals not spreadsheets here are the pros and cons ive found so far pros player management has been revamped this year and players behave more realistically than ever you cannot sign a player on a key player wage not play him and expect him to be satisfied if you drop him for no reason additionally other players in the squad may side with him and make your position untenable resulting in you getting sacked for losing the dressing room or on the contrary complain about you treating him too kindly if you give in to his demands players going to the press will also get picked up a lot more and you will be facing insistent and often annoying questions on how youre handling the player in question this leads me to the next pro improvements to media handling anyone who complains about the increase in media occasions from fm14 must not know that you can give over control of media handling to your assistant handling the media is a key part of any managerial job and i appreciate the fact that si have tried to make it feel as real as ever having a pesky journo run after me in the tunnel after a  performance i found myself snapping at him which shows how effective adding these rather small features has been at enhancing the experience of managing a football club the match engine is a lot prettier than earlier versions the interface while it takes some getting used to is great and feels a lot crispier than earlier versions small decisions like splitting staff and player searches into the staff and scouting categories make the game easier to navigate scouting has been vastly improved and it is now easier than ever to make the scouts suit your needs rather than them giving you reports you dont want to see the option to have them scout leagues for specific player types such as a replacement for an ageing first team player or a promising youngster also add to the organic feel of the game cons although the match engine has been tweaked since the release it still needs a bit of work crossing and long shots by players who given their attributes really have no business hitting 30 yard screamers 5 times a season still exist although theyre being worked on injuries seem to happen in waves where youll spend 6 months injury free and then have 5 players get long term injuries in the same week its frustrating but again the last patch did introduce changes to injury probabilities it just needs to be tweaked a bit although i enjoy the new interface the tactics screen absolutely sucks and needs to be changed in future patches the star for the players comfort in that position and circle around it to indicate suitability compared to the rest of the squad in particular is hideous if its that difficult to describe in writing then it shouldnt be a feature those are the major gripes i have on the game the losing against promoted teams when youre on a 5 game win streak may be frustrating but if you look at real life football thats often what happens teams who perform well against strong opposition may get complacent and slip up against minnows the fact of the matter is that if you love football no game out there will allow you to experience the beautiful game quite like fm15 does the changes arent perfect but theyre there and si has patched issues that the playerbase found with the game and say what you will about them theyre passionate about football and really care about their game which game dew do you know who would go and get written permission from a 15 year old wonderkids parents just so they could put him in the game and let players see how he turns out the game is far from perfect but ive put dozens of hours into it so far and have enjoyed every second of it i cant review fm classic as i dont touch it but the fully simulated experience is as close to managing a football club as youll ever get without going into the profession yourself 910
recommended
very addictive ignore stereo types
recommended
its ok  it can sometimes make you happybut alot of times really really angryi would reccomend it but the most id pay 4 it would be 25$
recommended
really addictive with several improvements than last version good work si
recommended
this game in a word is addictive i find myself losing hours to this spreadsheet simulator which to all my better judgement seems to be a random number generator which calculates football scores completely detatched from the rest of the tactical managerial business behind the scenes and yet there is a chance that the tweaks you make to the team that lost 21 last time away to brentford would transform the team into chelsea beaters and take you to the fa cup final and win glory for your beloved team and that emotional empathy this game creates is as close to the real thing as watching a real football match on the tv superb
recommended
this game is awful in my opinion unless you buy all of the dlcs waste of 30 dont make the same mistake i did
recommended
football manager needs strong rivals just like a serious football team while the fm isnt the most innovative and most impressive game around its still the best football management title 810 would recommend
recommended
i cant even have a possession more than 60% with a possession base tactics and why is that
recommended
best football manager experience you will ever get worth every bit of your money
recommended
i got a newgen player called prince mohamed that is all
recommended
buy luis suarez for chelsea for 110m scores against liverpool at the kop end and celebrates in front of the liverpool fans brilliant
recommended
nice game for i am playing
recommended
football manager 2015 is extremely addictive one of those games you can play for hours and still have fun and is very easy to work with even if youre a beginner id suggest this game for those who enjoy football as a sport of just watching it
recommended
no need to say anything

enough of the bad review and thumbs down this game absolutely briliant since many people talk about buggies or  i have to tell you that was wrong the dev really made a great patch no more injuries really bad defending keepercentre back etc theres a great tactic made by people who appreciate this game i used his tactic got ucl trophy league champions three peatetc that means this game not  you just need patience 1010 best fm game ever
recommended
thank you sports interactive for supplying with my latest yearly dosage of stress and sleep deprivation my goalkeeper could not catch ebola in sierra leone and my midfielders do as good a job of controlling the ball as the world health organisation controlling the spread of it same thing as every year but will still play it because i am hopelessly addicted and socially frustrated 2110
recommended
football manager 2015 does feel like a siginificant improvement from 2014 which respectively wasnt that much different from 2013 or 2012 they added more animations when in game which is cool but i still dont understand how on my save messi has not won the ballondor for 4 years he isnt like he is in real life which is strange whatever still good you should buy it probably or dont like i care
recommended
oh god i don have a life now i am doom stuck to this game
recommended
where do i begin i have been trough it all lately inevitable injuries to key players constant leaking goalies the ridiculous crossing goalies 74 defeats to nonleague teams that i should have stomped on and of course some disasterous defending by my players ai but still i come back to it again and again hitting my head against the same bloody brick wall day after another and for some reason it has worked i have had couple of saves which have gone fantastically so far the ai still is kinda  but way better than at launch new additions such the sidebar and more indepth scoutin have taken a another small step towards realism and i feel like the abnoxious pre and after game journalist mlestations are easier to handle so i am going to give it a recommendation for what it is but please make the game properly and dont leave it all for beta testers to get trough i had one save on the beta and it was abnoxious and almost unplayable it might have ruined the game for some players before it even came out
recommended
there just werent enough changes for me one thing i wouldve liked to have seen is the ability to practise set pieces on the last fm i used to concede from corners a lot i wouldve liked the opportunity to set up a defence vs attack scenario and seen how it played out and then tweaked my instructions based on that apart from the skin and the tracksuit manager element from what i can see from the beta is that nothing much has changed i appreciate that you dont want to mess with the format too much but there is scant reason to get excited about this update
recommended
better and easier to use ui better match engine with more realistic movement more tactic and role choice
recommended
fm at its best
recommended
as always a briliant game never fails to impress at all
recommended
told my family pets and friends that i would not be renewing their contracts got fired needs patching 1510
recommended
enjoy it a lot much better than fm 14 all problem has been fixed
recommended
wellin my history of gaming i was playin all the fm serieseven the championship onesso farthis one is the best sure it has some glitchesbut what game doesnt really anywaysi only have 17 hours played so far but im going onthe best thing is the 3d enginegame looks more realisticits more fun to watchit works really wellso far didnt had any isues like other people wrotesecond thing i like are the tacticswellyou cant really expect fireworks with any team just at the startsure maybe with the best teams like fc bayern or realbarcelonabut f you are persistant with your tactic and the board also ofcthen you will see some good stuff at the end well im not gona talk to much nowi will be writing again when i reach 100 hours of playin itbut so far thumbs up worth every penny
recommended
its horrors arent to be taken lightly the obsession the addiction the wasted months the sleepless nights as you strategically weigh up transfers and tactics and finally that tearstrewn crackofdawn moment when you realise you just cant take it anymore your finger trembling over the mouse as you finally click delete football manager is nothing more than page upon page of statistical data offset with the occasional virtual match that you cant actually control but to the many fans of the sport it inspires an infatuation unrivalled in the world of video games a feeling of power and control not unlike that of the civilization series but on a more realistic and micromanaged scale you take charge as head manager of your favourite football team and through player and staff purchases regular training plenty of tactical planning and the occasional bit of luck you can guide them to fulfilling victory  or frustrating loss unlike its playable football counterpart in the fifa series developer sports interactive has year after year ensured that its latest iteration is always a significant overhaul of the previous edition bringing back compulsive fans not just with updated rosters but through key feature changes and additions this years fm2015 release has a host of updated features aside from the updated 3d match engine graphics on game day the true highlight is the option to choose between being a tracksuit manager and a tactical manager the two often overlapping in previous editions here the choice between getting deeply involved in either the training or strategies is an important factor not just in the gameplay but in how players and staff react to you as a leader the only real problem with this truetolife recreation is that accuracy is occasionally taken too far such as in the unfocused but essential meetings regular chats with your staff and press are required to place your team at the forefront of this moneycontrolled world but it often comes at the expense of entertainment its true that realism should be the goal but a balance is necessary especially when repetition starts to set in fm15 doesnt break new ground but it does build on a decadesold formula to ensure your life will soon be dominated by a delusionfilled virtual world of fictional players fake matches and simulated football management
recommended
i purchased this last night and had only a brief time to play around with it after reading all the negative reviews from users i was a bit hesitant but from what ive read si patches the games well i decided to purchase and jumped into classic mode with chelsea right way this is the first fm i have purchased i was expecting all these injury bugs and high scores and after my first game i thought here we go as i won 50 i played 5 games and tried to sign 2 players in my brief time scores for the 5 games are as follows 50 w 30 w 03 l 31 w 01 l as far as i can tell the scores dont look out of whack 1 player rejected me the other player failed his medical kinda cool as for injuries yes there were some injuries but a lot of them were knocks and nothing really major i had a couple of major injuries but by major i mean they missed 11days to 2weeks time and were back in my first squad thats the point of building a solid squad and having backups that can step in same as real football id say its on par with fifa 2015 in terms of injuries and score lines i set my tactics and i quick picked my squad each game so that i could just get through i will play a new season upcoming just wanted to get the feeling for the game anyway since im not a veteran to fm i cant say if this is an upgrade or downgrade to previous iterations but i can say that ive stopped playing certain games madden cod because of their repetition and non improving of game play awful sentence i know so i can see both sides of the coin for now i enjoy this game and hope to continue to enjoy it the real names  face packs  logo packs  kit packs that other users have created definitely help also having any league and any team available unlike fifa is a joy hope to put in plenty of more hours
recommended
awesome game never fails to impove year in year out
recommended
i would recomend to anyone would love football
recommended
great game very addictive played the football game for a while now and they only seem to get beeter each time
recommended
great scout system
recommended
i am a big fan of the fm franchise and this game is just as good as the others
recommended
its good
recommended
first time ive been addicted to football manager since it changed from champ man
recommended
some good additions little change but they produce a decent game every year was buggy at the start but im have no issue now
recommended
the game was great if you play 20142013 its fm2015 basically the interface change roughly like it by the side but i got a question is it grey and black because its in beta hahah
recommended
the best version yet many great new additions the tactical side is more realistic and you need to make sure you get everything done properly from fitness especially in preseason to training and motiation to tactics or youll struggle to win i have completed my first season and did the double the best new addition though is australias ffa cup
recommended
only minor changes from last years game match engine definitly needs fixing as defending is nonexistantoverall though i would still say this is the best football management sim out there
recommended
currently slightly buggycrashy but it is still in beta and have upmost faith it will work perfectly within a couple of patches once again a great game with extra features a definite upgrade from fm 14
recommended
steam is the worst platform ive ever come across on the internet its criminal that eidos make you use it ive paid for a game but for some reason am not allowed to use it completely useless
not recommended
love it
recommended
love football manager and this game is mint but wont let me buy add ons so they need to sort that out then this game is 1010
recommended
great game so far
recommended

top game
recommended
footballs not just about scoring goals  its about winning alan shearer the moment when i become the best manager in the world with my beloved team  priceless <3 after 700h pros  lighter engine  significantly fewer crash dumps  managers profile  rest cons  sidebar  so stupid muddled management options  crimean national team a great shame for the sisega subjective rate a but still this is my beloved game series except baldurs gate <3
recommended
just as good but need to work out how to get onto transfer list as cant seem to find it
recommended
it is footballl management game very rarely are there bugs in the game new ui is good and some cool features added to this game enjoy football want to try your hand at management try this it is worth the investment
recommended
i love this years football manager everything is ok for me i have no problems with injuries or matchday engine dont know why other people have problem with it
recommended
i personally have found football manager 2015 to be a much better game than 2014 on the whole positives more realistic gameplay the footballers dont repeatedly try to shoot from impossible angles the game flows better and feels much more like a real game of football negatives certain bugs on linux hotkeys and window switching issues the game feels a lot easier than 2014 ive started as southampton and went unbeaten for 2 months not impossible but this did include competition like arsenal and liverpool who i beat 41 and 42 respectively i would reccommend this game definitely it is very fun and well worth 30 while it feels slightly unfinished it feels like it will be perfected next major patch though
recommended
yes the game has a better flow about it this year
recommended
great game
recommended
love this game so far engine may be a little bit buggy at the moment but i expect them to fix that definitely recommend picking it up
recommended
pretty good game
recommended
it is really good
recommended
good game to play with friends hours of fun for the football fanatic
recommended
i need help about my orders about transfer budget i bought with credit card but i dont know how to load it please help me
recommended
this game has stole my life
recommended
very good update to a good game
recommended
the ui takes a lot of getting used to even if youre a veteran fm player even the best players in the world seem to struggle to play properly for some reason i dont believe they really went above and beyond with fm15 but it is still an addition to the franchise its decent but not leaps and bounds above fm14 if you are just getting into the series pick it up if you already own fm14 and want a new challenge its pretty good for that too i would recommend it
recommended
i bought the beta version and i dont have the codehelp
recommended
great game love it <3
recommended
ive bought it and played it on beta for about 10 hours and now it wont let me load it any ideas before i launch the ing computer thru thewindow

recommended
very good but i want to play it
recommended
football manager 15 at its best
recommended
i have been a long time player of the championship mananerfootball manager series since the very first game was released and over the last coupld of years i have slowly waned from enjoying the games but this year something has reignited the bug in me again and i am loving the grind of taking my teams to glory i would love to explain what it is in the game that has got me back in love but i cant i think it is just the little tweaks to certain areas that have done it for me
recommended
great game tooo many people crying on here on how its a bad game some have valid reasons but others are just being sore losers
recommended
probably one of the best games ive played in awhile fm14 tho
recommended
like the games
recommended
i have made rochdale afc a big club now and its been awesome the game deserve 1010
recommended
i spent a whole damn half an hour sitting in menus with my friend doing absoutely nothing because there was no tutorial or anything we just sat in menus for 30 minutes doing nothing wanting to play some freaking football apparently football is too much of a complicated sport for people to play on the computer this game should be called menu simulator
not recommended
this is the worst game i have ever played in my life i highly recommend that you do not buy this game
not recommended
possibly one of the worst games i have ever played biggest load of  going i wanted to manage bristol rovers but i got ing afc telford which must stand for absolute ing  telford i got it for free but i would pay a single ing penny i wouldnt even give it to some one as a joke  joke might as well be corrupt like fifa
not recommended
cool game bruh
recommended
not as good as fm2014 but still a good game
recommended
one of the worst game of the series too many matches finish with defeat despite your dominance you cant help it no matter what you do cant keep your players if youre playing with a lower reputation team you let your player leave other players are like how can you let him go  you dont let your player leave other players are like you shouldve let him go how can you do this to him  injuries are ridicilous match engine is a joke dont buy this crap i wanted to have some fun had brain haemorrhage instead they ruined this one i actually want my money back
not recommended
this is the worst fm of all time i think the designers should burn in hell
not recommended
great game its a must buy for all football fans
recommended
it gets better every year very addictive
recommended
absolutely in love with this game this is the first football manager i have played and i have no regrets 100% worth the 3499 ive played the gameplay is great i love how the game is set out like i said its the first football manager ive played and it was so easily to learn where everything was and how to use it i uise an apple mac to play this addicting game and i must say it is extremely quick ive had no major problems at all downloaded super fast i believe it only took a few minutes to actually instal which is awesome as i couldnt wait to get stuck in however i only have one incy wincy problem which annoys me a little i dont know if its just me but it seems after the first season it gets rather difficult to achieve expectations and not get sacked like i said i dont know if that is just me i mught just be bad at this game but im not too sure i started my first season with portsmouth and got promoted to league 1 but the next season they expected me to be promted again to the championship and gave me around 14m to spend realistically i thought this was impossible i was right so the next season after that they only gave me 250k so that really wasnt near enough the budget i had in mind i ended up resigning and joined middlesbrough for a season i completely flopped and only got a mid table finish predicted promotion i got the sack unsuprisingly and then joined cardiff they also expected promotion which i failed so now im on my second season with cardiff and ive tried so many different tactics and none of them seem to work im obnly around 10games in but im doing so bad my team is by far the best in the championship yet it doesnt seem to perform but still like i said i dont know if its just me or not finally this is probably the best game ive ever invested in as well as fifa even through it gets frustrating at times you still come back ever day and play a few more games very sorry for rambling on but i hope you all find this helpful if you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to buy this game just like me then get it you wont regret it
recommended
one of the best football management sims out there actually challenging to get a team to work properly together a proper simulation game also i love it how si still improve the game how they listen to peoples complaints about bugs on their forums and actively seek to improve their game not all companies would fully support their games for a whole year
recommended
1010 broked my pc after this d
recommended
great game its improved alot
recommended
while this game brings the level of detail to new levels it still begs the same of question of when have you won when are you at the end and thus you always end up walking away when you realise there is no natural conclussion
recommended
this game is like more complicated than the real management of football and also more enjoyable although i havent managed any real team yet 
recommended
love this games worldclass
recommended
so i have played fm15 after previously having the 2013 and 2008 versions when i got my self on the 2013fm i saw a lot of changes between it and 2008 the 2015 hardly brought any changes at all there are maybe 2 or 3 new speches in team talk some more advanced conversations with players which are actualy harder to talk to and overal the personal chat has been developed yes theres also a 3d game play shown rather than 2d which actualy does not add anything to a manager expirience and in my opinion is nice but unnecesary there are few minor bugs with the game theres also a fair play requirements to get into european competitons but other than that theres not a lot of new suprises this is still my favourite football manager game but other than few little changes updated squads and competition rules this game is preety much the old 2013 manager to me its still a good game worth a buy if your upgrading your football manager 610 just because i expected a bit more new features 1010 if this is going to be your first one or much older than 2013
recommended
not sure what all the negative feedback is about i think this is a good addition to an aready great series the new player attribute style is alot better than the old everything greyed out of before the ability to have your team captain help you with player morale issues etc the match engine has been fine with me and ive logged 54 hours so far
recommended
love this game will steal your life
recommended
how do i get the real badges and faces

takes a while to get used to but still a good game

i dont understand why so many negative reviews i havent found anything bad this is my first ever time playing any football manager and i found it farely easy to understand the only problem is when they take corners theyt stand there for about 510 seconds but then they go back to normal but then its fine for ages great game
recommended
another great edition of the most complete management game for both on the pitch tactics and off the pitch man management steam workshop just makes this so much better buy play love
recommended
just one more game just one more contract renewal just one more scout report prepare for just one more after the previous just one more highly addictive very user friendly interface a good guide for newcomers while playing and a great in depth gaming experience from choosing and making tactics for set pieces individual sideline orders in game contract renewals contracts talks team meetings and talks and even individual promises if players believe they are not getting enough game time or believe they need rewarding with a new contract a must play game for any simulator and football genre fan
recommended
not the best verion of fm but certainly not the worst yes there are bugs and irritations but still playable
recommended
great d
recommended
thoroughly enjoyable and easy to get stuck into great game for me
recommended
waited til christmas to get it cheaper dont see what the fuss is about the game works fine and the ui is more intuitive i played cm through to fm for over 10 years although ive been skipping a few since it became fm all those who complained about injuries and letting it soft goals are just not playing it right i managed to clear all injuries several times to a point where my backuprotational players were complaining that they werent playing enough games as for gameplay i havent experienced any atrocious situations that a lot of reviews described set your tactics and preparations right get good coaches manage your players motivation and ration your training you shouldnt encounter silly problems
recommended
if people are terrible at this game they shouldnt be allowed to write reviews for it which is what 90% of the negative reviews seem to be great game so immersive and a real challenge when starting at the lower leagues 1010
recommended
its like fifa but take away you controlling the players and you actually have to think on how to win games 1010
recommended
great new features too add to the classic fm game
recommended
better than previous editions enjoy
recommended
most indepth manager game i bought this game reading all the bad reviews and not expecting much but it really is an improvement if you love managing your team then this game is for you

i would 100% recormend this game to anyone that likes gamemodes like career mode on fifa 15 but football manager goes into fare more depth and more teams and player even though the graphic arnt great the game makes it back with many fetures that they offer this year it is made easyer to navigate the menu the best new feature is when setting up a new carear you change your past history from a no body to a exworld class player
recommended
people should learn the game before crying about it if the way you used to do things dont work maybe its time to do it differently instead of crying about it i like it im happy with it new scouting system is awesome
recommended
really not enjoying it so far way too many injuries my players went on international breaks and at least 8 of them came back injured and some of the ratings seem pretty ridiculous to me nemanja matic is rated the same if not lower as john obi mikel

i have to disagree with the majority of reviews i have played the franchise for years also and i am loving this edition may be it is because i have just brought it and it has been updated but everything including the match engine have been drastically improved the injurys are nothing out of the ordanary and i am playing with arsenal goals per game are very realistic and i have had only 2 big wins out of 10 games yet i have lost only 1 friendly and the charity sheild against city which ended 20 what ever the other reviews said negitivly about this game i have seen none of so far and to think i almost took note of what people where saying and almost never brought it and i am so glad i did cdkeys sold it for 2091 and it was well worth it already didnt think i liked the dark skin and i was disappointed that it was the only one but after trying a few of the custom light skins i soon went back and love the original dark skin now my one critic so far is the pitchs look slighly blocky and not smooth enough

ive only put in about 20 hours not much considering its the fm series in the beta so far but i just feel that i have to counter these complaints about the game engine being worse for the first time since fm09 i feel that the game engine has improved from last year im not experiencing these random results at all and the goals that are scored are can almost everytime be traced to a tactical flaw or strength as opposed to fm14 where that percentage wouldve been about 50 im not experiencing this whole thing with vast amounts of goals being scoredconceded either nor the comeback issue people have been reporting i feel like these issues sound like typical beta issues remember it is a beta youve been playing that will be resolved quickly but will see either way im good corners have been improved where tactics and player attributes actually make a difference for once and it is now finally possible to score on free kicks and longshots again it was of course possible before  but not even the best players in the world would even be close to a realistically decent conversion rate
recommended
quite a few glitches but thats because im playing the alpha version looks like its going to be another succesful instalment to the series

awesome game as always football manager 15 is the best fm so far  keep it up d any old fm fan should get this 
recommended
this game is more loading screen than game
not recommended
this game deserves the nobel prize well it should deserves a big awards of some sort the main reason is because of its compelling nature no one will be able to hop off the fm15 train once they have set foot in as a big football fan it is an honour that i get to play and experience one of the most intricated and dedicated football simulation ever so please if you are ever wondering what to do on a wet and stormy tuesday night the best solution is to immerse yourself into what is known as fm15

recommended
yes i do recommned this game yes it needs a lot of work and got back to the old style as not big fan of the side bar it is a pain to buy players offered arsenal 150m for gibbs and they said know im like whaaattttttt apprently its not a good offer dw i wasnt gonna spend that much i was just annoyed because 36mil wasnt good enough so pretty much taking the  match engine is fast but very poor at same time its they just improve what they got and stop adding new fetures in an till its compleatly right i think si will go down if they dont make it bettter
recommended
why is every single injury in this game for me a sports hernia out for 45 weeks i am 4 seasons in on a save and in the bpl and i have had no injurys that lasted for more than 3 months but at any given time my goalkeeper and at least 2 of my first team players are out with a sports hernia other than that good game

its good everyone complaining that its the same game thats the case every year i dont know why some people want or expect an entirely different game personally i would be upset if they drastically changed things pros new and improved graphics and animations requires real tactical planning simply throwing top players out there without careful strategic planning will result in losses improved more streamlined interface except for the tactics screen for some reason they made it worse and you have to click more stuff improved scouting and player potential system improved training options its m f ing football manager cons tactics screen is worse now some early bugs will be fixed in the coming months most likely too many goals are scored from set pieces some wonky things with the match engine players kick balls directly in to players in front of them way too often and the ball will pingpong off of players randomly too much in the box

latest release of football manager have to say have really been enjoying it well adapted to let you to control as much or as little of the team as required new developments such as having areas that you are a appraised on as a manager are minor tweaks to the game on the surface but all put together they make some major changes also the game play when watching seems more realistic and believable than previous versions

very good game tbh but such a complex tactics still using other tactics than my own heheh
recommended
im everton fc i have bought the game expecting it to be better than last year the most fustrating parts about last years game was the poor quality of crossing and almost no through balls behind the defence from the midfield to striker this year the crossing has improved a lot and works well however this is the only way i can score and it is getting boring ive tried pump ball into box which only affects the defenders and makes them hoof it this game just cant seem to make through passes for the striker dissapointing

this game is amazing and i know for a fact i am never going to play any other game for a long long time ui the new ui is great even though it comes down to personal preference many people dont like the new sidebar but i persoanlly think its pretty good the whole ui is also a lot cleaner ai the ai is pretty realistic even though clubs sometimes make unrealistic demands of players while they could just say that they arent interested in selling the player other then that i dont really have any problems with this also some people dont like the scouting of players but this is just meant to be realistic you are always free to play football manager classic which doesnt include a lot of the time consuming features such as team talks and continuous scouting match engine when people say the match engine is horrible they do have a point horrible horrible goalkeepers defenders not knowing how to defend strikers dribbling right through defenders and these are only a few of the bad stuff this normally wouldnt be a problem but the match result is determined by the match engine as the game continues so goalkeepers make stupid mistakes like not responding quick enough and so you lose because of that this for me is pretty much the only bad thing about fm15 even though this is like one of the most important parts multiplayer now i dont think anyone else thinks this but i think fms multiplayer is horrible the season goes on without you when some people are on and its just messed up and complicated i havent played multiplayer much but this is just my experience from multiplayer conclusion this is a great game i dont know if people who are already fans of the series need to buy this one but people just starting with the series should definitely get this i really hope this helped
recommended
the graphics is great it more realistic than fm 2014 the engine is great a lot of cool stuff and great look but it still like older fm and not quite change a lot there are still bugs the most thing that make me hated is the shots in a match my team scored 18 but 9 on target and 3 goals when they shot 10 6 on target and 5 goal and the second thing is injury why is injury happened a lot and crazy like 67 months 35 months 67 weeks but this game is still cool i really like this game if you like football and like manage football club i recommend you to play this for me this game is 7510

day 3 i am sitting here with my curtains closed my eyes is bloodstrained i begin to channel my inner rage after that throughball miss i shout out in the room dammit suarez and bang my fist in the table so my cola spills all over the table this game is 1010 really this game will consume your time you might aswell say goodbye to the world as you know it you wont be seeing your loved ones in a looooong time
recommended
what is going on i started 2 new games and in both stoke are unbeatable now correct me if im wrong but there not a top 6 club never mind top 3  and what can i say about the defending it is a disgrace my central defenders are probably top goalscorers with all the own goals and top of the asists would be my keeper all in all a great game but still needs alot of work and theres only 4 days tto go  sort it out si
recommended
this was the first fm that i bought but im really happy that i did it its an amazing game i love this franchise and i hope the 16 would be even better
recommended
so frustating i dont know whats wrong i feel like i lost my ability to play this game i am noob all over again been playing since 2001  my team keep shooting didnt score the enemy 1 bullet to the heart and of course i lost the game  my wing back keep dribbling until byline wont cross and if he do the crosses hit enemy foot and goes corner kick frustating  my goalie is dumb enemies goalie is all neuer unbeatable i need or we all need major fixes please

generally its a good game but there is way too many unrealistic results in the game for an example i played a game where i was man utd against spurs and i won it 107 i also think that there is scoring way too many goals by crosses and rebound goals but i also think that they have improved the game there is a lot more features in football manager 15 for an example i think that it is great that i can see my own manager skills and i also think that the jobinterviews has gotten a lot better and more realistic but there is still too many unrealistic things in the match simulator that i really hope they will improve from a scale from 110 ill give it 6 
recommended
excellent as per there are small bugs to fix and changes to be made but there always are at this stage of release i always find the finished article is when they release the large update after the january transfer window regardless definitely worth a purchase
recommended
ive put the beta version on my laptop but now ive purchased the actual game on disc but after i install the game it still says this is the beta version on the bottom left of screen  so does this mean my disc hasnt installed or how do i play the disc version
recommended
contrary to a lot of view i recommend fm15 although i am new to the game itself i am an avid football fan so here a quick whats good and whats bad in my opinion please remember im new to fm and will say what i like from my point of view regardless of whether it has been in the fm franchise in the past or if it was better on old versions whats good modern menu system which is easy to navigate lot of reposibilites which make gameplay feel realistic ability to assign assistant manager to roles like dealing with training etc in game graphics are exceptable however dont accept fifa or pes standard games have felt realistic and in game tactics make a massive difference whats bad  i really could not get to grips with the scouting system on both of my two careers so far i have created a scouting assignment in which no players have been scouted or suggested to me nothing at all maybe im the one at fault but that is not my fault as the game didnt explain it properly to me i have yet to make a single signing yet due to not being able to find an adequate player who meets my scout report  i have started 2 careers and in both the same transfers were happening southampton bought jo from cam and naughton from tottenham and also sold clyne to spurs in both careers as well as man u buying vertonghen and khedira going to chelsea i found it annoying because i wanted to see a variation and to be interested in the other signings rather than seeing the same deals happen this maybe like something i havent downloaded or something not sure tbh i expected players to have faces and also the top division clubs from the bpl to have the official badges but they dont overall i would recommend this game because of the potential of reach 3 digits of game time i will always continue to play this game and am definitely happy to have bought it
recommended
ive played most the football managers over the years and to be fair this is a big step up from fm14 which was awful i have actually got into this fm and enjoyed every minute of it i like the new press and scouting features and can see a difference with the game engine even if its small for everybody saying its awful just remeber its still a new release and comparing with last year its pretty descent i havent had the trouble of to many goals from crosses to me this game is enjoyable and fun

recommended
i started a season with man utd and i have constantly been picking up injuries ive not once had anywhere near a full strength team and falcao even got injured for 6 months it seems im picking up two injuries a game other than that the game is very good the scouting in particular has been greatly improved on previous versions of fm it almost seemed too easy to find amazing players and judge who was going to be the next big thing now a lot less players appear when searching for transfers meaning youll have to send your scouts out to other leagues and teams to gather information theyve also added the option to scout an individual player for serveral months with more indepth scouting reports if youre already big into fm and have played previous versions i think its a big enough update from 14 to be worth purchasing and for those whove never played it the way that si have arranged their tabs and generally neatened up and simplified the layout of the game makes fm 15 the most accesible for a while

football manager 2015 is good improvement over its last version visual improvements are particularly very good game engine has improved which is expected new interface is very useful once you get accostom to it another thing that is improved is player interaction players are more and more interactive about transfer related issues like selling young player or if player wants to leave he make whole dressing room unhappy all in all they have improved the game but i was expecting more from fm on commentarytraining improvements this time so bit disappointed in that sense all in all latest fm version is always better than last one
recommended
i play the beta version one week now and i am really excited to play the full version soonfrom 199798 i play championship manager as it was called back on dayevery year i buy this game every single year and i can tell that game improve a lot but the last few years no major changes in match engine and the truth is that i didnt found any difference from these last few years and i was little disapointedbtw fm live was awesomeirelevant this year match engine is great you can actually make your tactics work and so far i dont see any weakness in game playopponents match smarter and most important you can make your dream tactics work without having in mind that because match engine is weak cant support certain ways of game styleonly one thing i ask for next fm to comeadd training development that you can actually work in certain game plays during the game like way your players want to move and combinationsthat would be the ultimate manager game evercheers

still astonishingly addictive and now the match enigne performed reasonably and as expected update i would recommend this game at the current state yeay the match engine is more polished and work as intended the ai of long shooter minded has been reduced thank you sports interactive good job what i wrote on 15 nov however the match engine is a real culprit how come i can play tikitaka feet to feet football in this fm 2015 iteration would like to recommend this game if the match engine and the artificial halfintelligence is upgraded into proper ai 1forcing me to use crossing and old kick n rush strategy to win the game which means my full back either left or right have create minimum 4 assist up until quaterhalf of the season i do love winning a game but obviously by playing beautiful football like arsenal real madrid barcelona and bayern did not a kick n rush oldish football 2 when my striker or inside forward is moving to channel rather than he passes to the team mates who has better chance to score he fires the ball and you know way above the woodwork simply dumb even when i set to shoot less often it is still often occur move into channel > shoot rather than pass > bye not a single goal my arsenal usualy have 2030 shots per game with only 58 on goal and rate of conversion below 10% 3fm 2013 match engine is better than 2015 simply said

update has been added below  november 24 2014 stay away from the game many issues which were solved years ago have come back  too many goals from corners  too many goals from crosses  way too many injuries my last game 1yellowred card and 3 serious injuries one ing game  stupid mistakes from goalkeepers yes the passing issue is still there  very bad user interface in the tactic area it was much better in fm 2014  same tranfer ai issues we saw within fm 2006 or 2007 ai is buying players for too much money ai teams demand too much money for young talents 3040 mio  instant goals from the oppostions dominate the game score a goal and watch how yout opponent scores 20 seconds later  leading 2  0 often leads to a sudden rush of the opponent which results in a 2  3 good things new scouting area is an improvement i like the bar on the left but this has already been in the game years ago it was removed now it is back i made this experiences with a team playing against relegation in the first geman league maybe the fm feels better if you play with a team like barcelona in total not worth the money for me it feels like they published a reskinnend version of fm2006 better wait for some patches and watch the community  update 02122014 si has released 2 updates from what i experience now the game has improved and im currently enjoying it big improvement  stupid mistakes from goalkeepers yes the passing issue is still there have not seen this any more big improvement  leading 2  0 often leads to a sudden rush of the opponent which results in a 2  3 the rush is still present but normally the ai will score ones and then youll be able to make it 31 or maybe 32 big improvement  too many goals from crosses in my opinion the amount of goals after crosses has come to a normal level but i have also worked on my tactic improved  too many goals from corners its has been improved but i still seem to concede many goals after corners this could also be an issue of my tactic slightly improved  very bad user interface in the tactic area it was much better in fm 2014 player roles are back on the tactic screen but still a bit complicated no change  way too many injuries i still got many injuries sometimes it is very annoying but the good thing is that most of the injuries are not serious it seems like there is a higher chance to get serious injuries during the season breaks within the season i am often faced with injuries during matches but so are normally only minor things max 34 weeks could be balanced a bit no change  same tranfer ai issues we saw within fm 2006 or 2007 ai is buying players for too much money ai teams demand too much money for young talents 3040 mio ai is releasing too many players for free this is my biggest complain with the game the transferai is still stupid apart from the huge amount of money the top aiteams are spending you will also be able to find very good player for free for example bayern is releasing xherdan shaqiri for free in real life they are demanding 25 million euro this means that you will be able to upgrade your team from a mid class club to a european topteam wihtin a couple of seasons way too easy this was already an issue of previous fm games conclusion i have improved my tactic to handle the match engine issues after the updates i was able to set my wing backs from defend to support duties without getting rushed by the ai good thing because you dont feel so helpless anymore and this gives you the opportunity to try more things thank god that the issue with leads of 2  0 is gone that was very annoying overall i have started enjoying the fm scouting is really fun now and makes more sence the transfer ai should be improved with the next updates same procedure as every yearbut im sure the issue with too many good free player will not be solved also likey every other year in fm history so i can now recommend the gamebut never preorder it

 below is my original review but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended because even after patching the game and matchengine is unrealistic how could the programmers not realise this i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14 this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say though it does have its problems id definitely recommend this to fans of the series lets go through the pros and cons pros  i like the new ui i think its improved on previous titles with things like scoutingtransfers in more logical places  it runs smoother you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match instead it takes less than 2 seconds this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time  i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons  weirdly takes longer to save than fm14 over a minute and a half for me  the games are too high scoring and this needs to be patched for realism purposes i just had 5 games that were 63 63 53 00 lol and 63 again a bit silly  goalkeepers are pretty bad hence the high scores  it feels like its harder to play a possession game but that might be just because im leicester its a fun game im definitely glad i bought it good for fans of the series if patched it could be brilliant they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in but they dont seem to have

before buying it i heard people saying it was a bad game and i could better buy fm14 but i didnt listen to them and bought fm15 thank god i didnt listen the game is very good graphics gameplay everything sometimes the injuries and big losses can make you angry but i learned after years of playing fm10 that you just have to go on even when its not going well with your club and manager career first seasons i ended 5th with feyenoord rotterdam not very well as i say it myself still won the national cup second and third season i did the right job and became champions two times also winning the cup again was very nice to make a summary of it keep playing even when its not going well and enjoy the game its very good

updated after the big patch original review my first and only game review i was that  off is below i was negative ill hold my hands up now though and admit that while still not perfect the game is playable seems to be fair better balanced and without most of the big game breaking faults ive done about 8 seasons now mostly offline so forgive the lack of played hours its a decent game its not the best i still prefer fm12 and cm0102 in terms of hours played but its matured to be a decent entry cheers devs cheers tactical genius people for the mutley tweak formation cheers to you for reading i recommend the game original review im a big fan of fm games been playing since 0102 and have enjoyed many hundreds of hours of game time ive been playing fm2015 since release mostly offline i have a lot more hours than probably shown and i have more than one account this is the first time ive ever reviewed a game im doing so because its just so broken i feel i have to for every person saying the game is broken theres another saying its because of bad tactics etc well for me its just a rage inducing festival of disappointment yes theres going to be bugs yes theres going to be the odd quirk but when you reload a save and replay the same fixture a dozen times using different squads and tactics and still concede an own goal in the 90th minute after conceding an 85th minute wonder strike something is up nothing i do seems to make a difference to the evidently preplanned scoreline you could edit in the best players in the world and theyd still lose 21 to sheffield flippin wednesday everytime on my save i can live with the slightly mad bits of the game players demanding to leave then moaning when theyre transfer listed or your only expensive purchase always getting a long term injury in first half of his second match for example but when you get the impression that youre merely following a preordained set of results theres kind of no point its a terrible shame and although i expect itll all be fixed eventually its the one game i feel absolutely cheated by 30 can get you a fair bit in the steam store do think very carefully before spending it on a game that actually makes you for the first time ever angry at playing if you find otherwise if you find it to be brilliant good on you i know the developers are active in the forums trying to sort stuff out which deserves some credit but theyve got their work cut out of that much i am certain

first match ribery gets injured the rest of the players are on vacation so i cant play the next match because i only have 10 players restart first match ribery gets injured this game will improve or people will not buy fm 16 update march 2015 a key first team player was sold without my approval before i played the first training match update a key first team player was sent on  permanent holiday without my approval should in real life be fairly easy to buy the entire norwegian national team with real madrids budget in this game you cant even buy norways 3 best players combined but its not all bad some of the data collected on players are fair the layouts of representation possible player qualities are ok in real life grorud would never fill a stadium and they would near holding draw vs rbk tippeligaen and 1 division may be equal in skill but lower level teams suck hard the player helland must have been coded wrong in this game instead of dribbleing and shooting at the goal this game depicts him as a total not intelligent at all person number of injuries for my team does not feel realistic 3 critical injuries just before and iin first training match is far too many in real life the player malec is a huge player 2 meter and one would notice him as much taller than the rest of the players on the football pitch the stadium at kristiansund is possibly corretly filled with people but the stadion i real life would be silent

its that time of year again where sports interactive release their next installment to the football manager series and without question it is the best one yet theyve completely overhauled the ui to make it much more simplistic when nagivating and searching for vital information about your squad and club one of the biggest features to football manager 2015 is the tracksuit & suit manager this adds a roleplaying element to the game which allows you to choose your stats this will affect your team mentally and physically depending on which of the two you prefer or perhaps you want to be a mixture of both which is fine as well as minor improvements to media tactics etc theyve also improved the 3d match engine to make it more realistic with over two thousand new animations using reallife player movement capture technology it now feels like youre closer to the reallife game more than ever my verdict is this game is fantastic and if you love past football manager games im sure youll really enjoy your time with this one

i have a total of  500 hours in football manager 2013 and 2014 and thus i consider myself a fan of the series unfortunately tho fm 2015 is a big step back personally i miss the sliders and tweakings you could do in fm2013 but that is just my opinion what is not just an opinion is the horrible match engine there is basically two options which each have their different negatives 2d engine your team will score and conceed like  its totally normal that a game between bvb and bayern munich would end up 47 or something crazy like that 3d engine players are just stupid as f almost every tackle is a sliding tackle people will just consider hey lets not pick up that ball that is only 5 metres away from me because my mate that is 30 metres away is already going for it overall the ai in 3d mode is just rubbish goalkeepers do not know how to get out of the box even when they are set to sweeper keeper attack if they somehow get out on occasion tho they will just do stupid runs for the ball near the corner flag which result in very easy long shot goals for the opposition sorry si but you failed hope there is a patch some day i will certainly not be buying fm 2016 if anything stays like that

i enjoyed playing this game only with a friend as it introduced a competative side to be the most succesful manager the game has improved alot over the years but the 3d animations on the pitch still looks like garbage players skate around the pitch goalies make poor attempts to save the ball and overall it just looks horrible im still keeping my fingers crossed for a football manager game that has a great looking 3d match view

ive only been playing fm since 2012 and the main issue for me is the match engine i bought fm14 and that was horrible the match engine was stupid because the players would dance around everywhere and your defence had no chance you could buy the best players and they still would struggle i had my doubts about buying fm15 after that but when i seen it on sale i though i would give it ago and i found it much better alot has improved there is still some work to do on the match engine it is now more realistic i guess but still stumble around abit but its better than ive seen it before the defence seems much better its hard to get around depending on the strengh on your defence so i was happy with that as for the interface in game i was happy with that also its now much easier to get around and you have all information on your homescreen im hoping they have took steps forward for their next game fm16 and i will buy it because they seem to be going in the right direction at least for the newcomers you will really enjoy this game if you like the idea of managing your team hiring staff negotiating contracts pushing your team to the top it will give you hours of endless fun for the regulars well you know how it is you can lose track of the time when you sit on this game but it has improved from the last game so that is something and i would reccomend buying it even if you had a bad experience with the last 1 like me its worth it although my main motivation for buying it was the sale price i dont think i would of bought it at full price as fm16 is not far away good game overall

still world leading soccerfootballmanager game out there however in my opinion the lack of competition in this market makes the fm crew more lazy and instead of evolving the game adding features and so on they choose to make it more user friendly for each year mainstreaming it as much as possible to get more people in to it i havent read other reviews but for me fm 2014 was bigger and better more integration with players and other managers still a great game tho with the game engine getting tho marginally better each year i guess whats annoy me is that they most likely allready have the features for fm 2018 but are saving them until they have to make bigger changes cause of competition

i finally gave in and gave this years well last years version a go thinking the problems couldnt be as bad as everyone says 7 matches in and im ready to delete the game and give up completely on the series which is a complete shadow of what it used to be 7th match of the season 4 injuries in 1 match all 3 of my strikers out injured afterwards 2 for 56 weeks and 1 for 34 months im a part time team who cant afford to buy anything and now my save is basically ruined because injury manager 2015 said screw you from the reviews this will happen time and time again si you used to be great i could throw hundreds of hours each year at every new version but somehow for the last 34 years youve made the match engine less realistic and less enjoyable to play and you seemingly have no interest in rsolving any of the issues because youre working on flashy new additions to the next game which amoutns down to dumbing it down even more making the match engine even more unrealistic but adding in more useless media interaction that does nothing to your gameplay

well there i was looking to enjoy the nexr edition off fm oh dear who on earth made this one must be someone that has never seen a game of football in their life  1 goalkeepers from other teams play like gordan banks my goalkeeper is making all kinds of blunders 2 i agree some games even if you have 70 percent possession you can still lose to a counter attack however not every game there is too many times that you have 40 shots with no goal and the other team have 1 shot 1 goal  highlights still look like we have a graphics engine from the days of manic miner  i went to buy a player at man united and asked the board they said that they agree however cant afford lol really also some teams are way overated like liverpool and others programmer must have a liverpool shirt on steven im dead gerrard beat walcott in a race for the ball wtf

completely worth the money i have spent on it when the preorder became available i brought it since the beta i have had many saves for many people football manager isnt just a game but a way of life i started in the beta as watford manager my favourite club i played this save through the beta and in this time won the triple the prem fa cup and capital one then i moved on to a journey man save my manager had sunday league experience with no coaching badges and over the 15 year period i managed 7 clubs in 6 different leagues winning 7 pieces of silver ware then i am currently playing as stevenage manager with the aim to make the club selfsufficient with currently being in 2026 and one every competition i have been in in the last 4 years would be 5 but thanks to arsenal i lost the fa cup moving onto the game going from fm14 where i have over 760 hours the ui was very different seeing the task bar moving from the top to the side was very weird but unlike first thought takes up less room as well as makes tasks easier personally i dont use skins but with the community out there finding a perfect skin is easy with badges and kits i always mod the game in this particular side although when i first loaded the game i was happy to see nearly every league had the kits and badges except for germany and the english premier league due to licenses the match engine is extremely better than the previous years and this makes the game so much better with the fm community the badges kits and more is available to combat the license issues with finding regens and making them world class you can easily create bonds with the players overall i have over 1150 hours playing this beautiful game and i have extremely enjoyed the game and will continue to enjoy fm15 for many of the players they will agree football manager is a way of life this game is completely worth its price from regen hunting where you look for good young players to develop to just straight up winning games if you love football this game is for you

just like the rest of the fms they just keep getting a tad better each year only thing is for a yearly update and just a mild upgrade im not sure why it costs so much after all these years of cm and fm i might finally start doing an everyother year purchase just so im a bit more impressed and not spending so much on mild upgrades
