this is truly the definitive version of gtav it works so much better than when i tried it about a year and a half ago looks like they included lots of fashion updates in this release but expect it to take a while to unlock all the looks i must say i hate the story the characters and the liberal use of the nep word but i play online and dont have to deal with the losers on the cover or their script nep that

ive been meaning to write a review for gta for a while but i was unable to decide if my review was going to be for the sp or the online or a mix of both i mean i could talk about how the story was super fun the split between the different characters offered varied and interesting views on different issues or how modifying cars online and racing around pulling drivebys on unsuspecting people only to rage later when someone does the exact same thing to you is massively hilarious tonight i decided on a different path with a little help from a friend yo essy shout out dawg what gta is really about when you get right down to it and where youll find the most fun possible is if you go onliine find a server with a modder it isnt hard pretty much every server is infested with them like your average nightclub is infested with testosteronefuelled mindless sleaze machines if youre lucky and if the modder doesnt spend 30 minutes blowing you and everyone else up instantly over and over for some kind of perverse fun you might chance upon a modder who decides to do what one did for me tonight i paint you a scene of a lush forest a beautiful countryside slope filled with all that nature has to offer suddenly the redleather booted stripper army descends  everywhere guns in hands they are ruthless killing machines rockets fly and stripper bodies are flung through the air all is blood and pain you get into your insurgent unsure of what sick twist your life has taken your only goal survival but no your companion says he wishes to talk to a lone stripper to pursue peace so you pull up and watch as that brave brave man exits the vehicle and walks up to her suddenly theres a fist fight that redleather donned temptress is smashing your buddy all over the front of your insurgent whilst you grip your steering wheel and cry tears of pure blood why is the world so cruel what manner of evil had you discovered all you can think of in this moment is saving your sweet dear friend you slam your foot down on the gas and run that sleazy ho over bam she scoots a mile backwards into a tree her body surely broken high fiving your buddy you watch as he gets into the car your eyes widen in horror as you watch the broken stripper body stir back to life that demented hellspawn begins twisting herself back to her feet the redleather hiding her spilled blood as she gets up and starts running towards your car shoot her terminator you think as your buddy gets into the heavy mounted machine gun and opens fire its useless she runs away taking bullets into her back and leatherclad  as if theyre mere raindrops so full of horror are you that you cant even bring yourself to make a joke about the stripper taking loads instead you slam on the gas once more and chase her through the forest not satisfied until you run her over three more times stopping on the last to spin your wheels ontop of her back the only sure way to kill the termistripper menace great game 1010 would witness a stripper armageddon again screenshots available in my library

i usually dont write serious reviews but i will for this its a good game and will provide lots of long hours of entertainment i do really like it but im not going to talk about that you know all the good stuff so ill just tell you the bad stuff r seems to have gone a bit overboard on banning people if you mod at all you will most likely be banned if you dont mod you might still be banned if someone shoots money at you or frames you for modding youll probably be banned although it was publicly announced by r that sp modding was perfectly fine you will in fact still be banned this is because the main way of modding the game is through a dll file called scripthookv which basically allows any foreign code to be implemented into the game that puts other peoples security at risk r should have made the game more modfriendly to begin with the beautiful environment that r created is indeed beautiful but it isnt very destructive you might be going 100mph offroad and hit a sapling the size of a baseball bat and your car hit it as if it were a wall car customization is not what i thought it would be i owned midnight club los angeles and liked the car customization in that game gta v is nothing like that i suggest you watch some youtube videos on customization before buying things are pretty expensive im talking about online offline is easy to make money it takes time to be able to afford high end cars and apartments if you nolife a game then this is fine but if you just play every now and then it gets annoying never being able to afford the expensive things there are shark cards where you can pay real money for ingame money i dont really like this but i guess its better than paid dlcupdates i dont like the physics they arent realistic and its impossible to drift that gets on my nerves

saw trevors  in 1080p 60fps 1010 would watch again
recommended
fantastic i owned the game on xbox one and 360 and i thought it would be a waste of money to get on pc regardless i preordered it and took a risk i would never turn back i dont have the best pc gtx 750ti amd fx 6300 and 8gb ram and etc it runs beautifully i have it all set to high running a smooth 60 fps with textures set to normal i set everything to very high and leave textures on normal and i get between 45 to 59 fps never drops below fantastic game looks so amazing on pc and i would recommend to anyone it was well worth the wait and the added preorder money doesnt go unnoticed only thing i dont like is how we use our social club names not steam and i have my social club name as an old gamertag and i have to wait a year in between changes and it doesnt say how long i have left to wait doesnt affect the game in any way whatsoever fantastic

lots of funn

recommended
i didnt know until grand theft auto v that you can actually fail a game benchmark apparently you can 1110
recommended
what can i say its gta v on the pc and its better than its ever been i imagine most people have played this game at least a bit on the consoles by now so you know what youre getting into its the console version with a few extra features running at 60 fps and looking great while doing it little improvements go a long way on the graphical front everything has received a noticeable bump up from consoles and the system requirements are totally reasonable me and my friends have agreed that probably the biggest standout feature when it comes to graphics is the enhanced draw distance it sounds silly but it really does wonders when you see it in action the pc version comes with two main exclusive features the rockstar editor is an ingame recording and editing tool that gives you everything you could possibly need to film pretty much anything you want you have complete control over vehicles npcs time of day weather etc all while filming one downside is that you need to play through the story and some side missions to unlock every available npc for use in your film but definitely the thing that i love the most about the pc version is the custom radio station fill your station up with as many or as few songs as youd like and then its as simple as switching to it ingame while in a car and youve got a radio station filled with music of your choice in the options menu you can choose between having your songs play in sequence on shuffle or on shuffle with radio ads so it fits into gta i chose shuffle because i find the ads to be a little too long and a little too frequent on the custom radio station compared to the others by now you know everything else that gta v brings to the table considering its age so i thought it best to mention more pcexclusive features in this review recommended for sure
recommended
so far my favourite mission is  gta 5 has stopped responding
recommended
no bowling with roman 010 would not play ever again
recommended
killed a jew didnt get sued 1010 would nazi again

gta v is what you would except from the title highly detailed world great story cars and just about everything gta online has many issues though
recommended
it is gta 5 just buy it best game ever 
recommended
awsome game
recommended
this review took me almost 2 years to write and was delayed 3 times
recommended
game itself is awesome and contains a nice story to follow but once you step into the online world of gta youll regret buying it cause your fun will be destroyed by modders flying around and spawning  load of items around worth to be waiting for fivem multiplayer to be released to finally have a decent roleplay server
recommended
no bowling in this game 1010
recommended
 graphicslighting are definitely improved from the console versions fk you to the people who said it looked like ps3  i personally had no problems with the game launching try to update drivers if you are experiencing problems  smooth 60 fps is 1010  director mode is bae  buy this if you love gta 1010 42069 100100
recommended
after a long wait and many delays grand theft auto v has finally arrived onto steam its a great game that you can mess around on wreak havoc break laws obey laws buy stuff shoot stuff blow stuff up drive stuff fly stuff play with friends and many many many more features the graphics are amazing and i especially like the motion blur added to the pc version those with low fps 20  30 will be glad that motion blur is a thing the gameplay is fantastic i cant recommend another game as good as this one the controls feel right the movement feels right everything feels right the texturing is very detailed and so are the many small things in this game not a single thing is left unpolished in all of san andreas why are you still reading this review go buy the game already its worth the $60
recommended
love the game so far but my only issue is that my i5 4690k cant handle the game  might have to upgrade to the i7 4790k not looking forward to that but oh well this game is amazing on pc d edit cpu heavy game please advise
recommended

recommended
love gta v 1010 good graphics amazing storyline shame about the hackers online though example i spawn in in my apartment just getting drunk for a 5 star challenge and suddenly all players killed by what looked like a tank shell amazing gg rockstar gg indeed
recommended
this may be the second or third time you would buy this game my advice do it
recommended
was skeptical considering the price and never really played this series but this game was so worth it the realistic nonstop action was one of the things that got me addicted and i have enjoyed every second of it the story itself could be a movie if you are unsure about buying it due to the cost either wait a year for it to go on sale or just go for it you wont regret it ps make sure your comp can handle it first
recommended
i dont like this game anymore
recommended
grand theft auto v what els is thare to say about it hate the game well i dont care thanks rock star for 1 of the best games out thare
recommended
i highly recommend this game all the people who dont recommend this game just say its too expensive its worth the price online is super fun though there are some hackers but most of them are nice story mode is fun too if you dont have internet access all in all the graphics are great and its a well made game 1010 would sell my knife and buy again
recommended

likes   very good graphics  easy to play  rockstar act quick on banning cheaters  you can do almost everything sports killing etc  very good community system dislikes   too bad many players got banned from using mods dont worry r will fixed this in time  many pkers  no missions updates for too long i played the same missions over and over  new updates comes with overprices  many cheaters and rpexp hackers  sometimes the server crashed and separate you from your teammates after 600hrs of playing i should say to you about this if you really wants to buy it think again my friend it aint worth it until r do something with new missions hackers overprices updates and unstable server
recommended
this game is awesome great graphics not laggy and the multiplayer option is the best part
recommended
this game is purposefully mispelt brillant i still have caps turned on due to me activating the special ability for each character with the caps button
recommended
this games offers alot of replayability and really good graphics and it is also in my opinion the best open world game that is currently released
recommended
the best game

bloody blazin brilliant

why did i play gta v on pc i guess it was the graphicsor theahh i dont know that thingthat fpsyou see it on the console you alway get 30fps on the console ya know from thatthat gameplay experience be a pc gamer for once pc master race so i build a pc start it put my feet up and thought ill be a pc gamer like all the other pc gamer my pc it would be like the pc every hardcore pc gamer has we play highend games and sit in the room all daywell you know how it is i rated this game 1010 best port ever cheaper than console best gameplay experience still keep the nextgen wastedbusted sound if rockstar games can bring back the oldgen wastedbusted sound i would jump from joy
recommended
this game take from me the life
recommended
brilliant game good port to pc
recommended
step one buy gta 5 step two install gta 5 step three think about your life while your waiting for your game to install step four say goodbye to your life as you startup gta5 for the first time
recommended
i played gta v first on console so this review wont really be about the singleplayer story rather the pc improvements and other areas that fail ill have three sections one for improvements over the console version pros and cons improvements over the console gtav  better graphics obviously antialiasing looks a lot nicer no more pixelated car edges since there doesnt seem to be any on xbox 360  semimod support ill talk about that later in cons  a more mature playerbasecommunity you rarely find little kids screaming in their mics pros  decent story compared to gta ivs  multiplayer is fun with friends  online racing  tons of vehicles take gta ivs carshelicopters multiply them by three and add planes and tankstanks well one tank but still tanks  car customization was added back to gta  its relatively easy to get money  heists were finally added  r didnt bundle the game with microsoft live and made their own system intertwined with the social club cons  it seems to me that players who can buy shark cards can just afford everything in the game immediately microtransactions should have never been added  it is super frustrating to be a new player and have very wealthy higher ranked players chase you around in a tank or hydra and constantly kill you  modding r allows it in singleplayer but no cosmetic mods in multiplayer this makes absolutely no sense as some people require fov mods or they get sick so r either add a large fov slider or expect some angry customers  banning people for using mods in multiplayers  currently there is no multiplayer stocks system up the website is always down the verdict if you dont plan on modding the game and dont get angry at trolls and have friends i would say go for it personally though i bought the game largely because of the mods
recommended
this game is great and if you have it on one of the other consoles its definately worth the change
recommended
buy for single player briliant story full of content detailed to the extreme beautiful then you go online aweful community you will blow up boring karin karuma heist team mates nothing matters side note i would like to have online and single player have different review areas

hackers everywhere

imo well optimized running 4060 fps with a gtx 650 1gb gameplay was really fun for the first 100 hours then got kinda boring but still finding new fun things to do story is well made played it almost twice now
recommended
absoloutley addictive makes 3 hours feel like 20 min
recommended
im going to play this game for like my all life
recommended
love the game 1010

post edit i finnsihed the story mode when i did this reveiw i had around 17 hours and here is what i think after beating the game at around 4050 hours when this game first came out the game was extremely hype hungry and people were making ridiculous claims about their experiences with gta5so far from my experience is it was all overexaggerated hypei mean people were too sensational with the gta5 release and i can see that now after playing the game for a couple of hours and eventually beating the game pros graphics are ok but at times the settings can be a bit confusing feels like im actually playing in a replicated los angeles geography in this game is very impressive animations and cut scenes to and from each character is a really cool feature to look at it gives the game a sort of quality that isnt to be expected in a average video game completely unique and gives the game edge storyline so far is good felt like i was watching a series of tony soprano episodes with michael gave me a street compton gangster fantasy with franklin and topped it off with a psocopathic meth headdealer with trevor more possibilities to do with jobs and earning moneyincreasing stats and just engaging in other activities that you would have done in san adreas hearing the radio reminded me of older gta games how they used satire in a very creative sense however they tried carrying that on to other parts within the game and it got to a point to where it was very annyoing infact it looks like a rip off from what the developers of saints row did weed trip scenes of killing aliens and clowns so take that as both a pro and con cons few controls are  my issue was the aircraft controls so if you dont like the numb pad then do keybindings post edit its more than just flight controls many other controls are just flat out horrible rockstar did a really bad job with the mouse and keyboard control schemenot completely bad but very questionable control schemes performance is not so greatlet me itterate that the performance can be complete looks like lower end to mid grade pcs will not get to have so much fun with the game performancehell i imagine higher end hardware to have some hiccupsso far not really a good port from rockstar you pay 60 dollars for this game and rockstar pushes microtransactions that is the biggest con on this list very money grubbing and i really dislike that while i do recomend the game i still have to say that no it isnt worth 60 dollars if you havnt bought the game yet then you might aswell save your money and wait until it goes on saleeven though i give the game a 710 i feel as if im being slightly generous because i would rather rate the game around a 6 but im cutting rockstar some slack since the storyline is pretty goodthe map and the dynamic of a open world is pretty impressivedramatic improvments over the predecessor gta4 but for a game that costed 265 million dollars to develop and took an adittional 3 years to port to pc i expected much more from rockstarwhoever is making the decision behind this company has been doing a really bad ing job
recommended
definitely not as good as ign said but still dece

its been a long time coming but grand theft auto vs pc debut is a triumphthe rockstar editor is endlessly entertaining the online heists are with friends some of the most fun you can have in a multiplayer game the singleplayer story is an exhilarating series of increasingly absurd missions and it all takes place in one of the richest densest most atmospheric game worlds ever built the performance is amazing even for lowend computer can still run this at 30 fps on low the graphic are pheonmenal was delays worth it yes it was 100100 best game ever and always will be every gta series by far this has won the oscar award wait did i just say oscar award yeah i just did buy it now

you know gta always the best and this gta 5 just makes it better

recommended
great game too bad there are a lot of hackers in online mode
recommended
you more or less know what to expect when buying this game its gta the hackers arent a problem tbh most of them just go on rampages killing police or just teleport around dropping money just go in passive if you meet an aggressive one and join a large crew if you can so you can play with the crew as people there tend to not kill eachothers as frequently btw hackers are nice who doesnt like free cash
recommended
super great game still with 20fps and huge lags its super much fun

much violence many s very gta v wow

i dont get why people were  off the summer sale if you want it cheaper go to  they have gta 5 for like $50 i get that it said 25% off and they just added a shark card but thats better than just paying $6999 with only the game id rather buy it with the shark card for $6989 anyways also the new update did not ruin my fps im getting 3165 fps on very high settings which is really good for me 30 fps is great for me its playable this game is magnificent and so fun with friends or family if you do not have the game i suggest you get it

103000 too many hackerst though

singleplayer  amazing story  singleplayer mods  lovely open world sandbox well get to that later multiplayer  12 year olds death threats  hackers  shark cards  about as sandboxy as having your  welded to the inside of your  crack whilst eating a 7 year old fermented dog turd and sniffing lines of powdered uranium and listening to justin bieber do a cover of bohemian rhapsody with one direction as backup singers all in all its ok
recommended
if you dont have this then you should die
recommended
i can review this game without actually owning it because steam revoked it from my library while i was playing and told me i have to buy it again for 40 if i want to continue playing the game is very good though
recommended
 better controls than gta 4 check  better optimized for pc than gta 4 was check  awesome and crazy heists check  super fun online gameplay check  finally on pc check  returning to san andreas hell yeah if you love the gta series then this game is fanservice for you

why this game has almost perfect score because r gives you new free dlcs without charging your real money a really nice level system up to 8000 levels the modes ehhh no comments because they are too awesome why its not so perfect because cheaters are still out there and they dont affraid to use them because theres no vac ban you only get ban by r for a limit time r should give them a vac ban so this game can be perfect
recommended
1010 amazing port great perfomance great gameplay & in other words a master piece
recommended
playing on normal graphics causes fps drop while playing on high graphics fixes the fps drop good job on this one rockstar
recommended
such an amazing game even if you just plan to play online with friends i hope we get more dlcs ones that include some more hiests and such the story is something you dont need to rush it will always be there to do as for the online banning people are getting mad about if you wanted to edit your game and get the ban thats on you rockstar doesnt allow modding now im sure this might change in the future but for now just accept it gave it a 9 10 because the first few updates seem to bug crash my game each time 910

sads  that i cant play thisbecause idk waht is dis black screen trouble  but its a yes recc for meand this game is kewl i meani enjoy it everytiem i watch le fqiing vids sads that my laptops arentt strong enough to play this

one of the best games released on pc to date optimisation for pc is superb as for all the people who are writing negative reviews they have no one to blame but themselves for the bans i have seen only a handfull of hackers but they dont bother me all of the kids will be caught in the end fantastic game and well deserved 96100

single player  story mode 910 its the funnest gta game yet for me theres sooo much to do & the game looks great with a nice attention to details multiplayer  online 010 if you dont have an armored kuruma or a tank you will die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die  the community is so bad making it worse than the league of legends & dota 2 ones combined everysingle person you meet online will be an  trying to kill you the missions load for a long time & they load each time you exit or join theres also a lot of players who ruin heists or are greedy enough to ask for a lot of money in the end justdo not play online its not worth it unless you meet decent friends to play with in a private lobby

do you want to play team deathmatch it has it do you like racing it has it do you like flight sims it has it do you like tennisgolfdarts it has it do you like driving over pedestrians and blowing up other vehicles just causing general chaos you can seriously this game has everything you could want in a game i havent even touched the story mode yet and not even sure i intend to the freedom to go do what you want online is amazing if you want to log on and do missions to make cash you can if you just want to drive around in sweet looking cars rob a store and then evade the cops yeah thats pretty fun too a really cool aspect of the game are heists the heists are very similar to payday2 each person has a job to do planning is done and theres a huge score at the end leading up to it are setup stages that make you some cash as well theres also a survival mode that is really fun as well survive 10 waves and you make 30 grand pretty sweet especially if you like wanton destruction sticky bombs are fun no seriously theyre so awesome nothing says enjoyment like casually driving down the road and nonchalantly tossing a sticky bomb on the bus watching the driver freak out and drive away frantically into a crowd of traffic or if youre lucky enough pedestrians blow that thing up and let the chase begin you can place bounties on other players which adds for quite a fun time if you can manage to evade the bounty you get to keep the cash placed on your head i was a huge fan of saints row the third its one of my favorite games ever gta v shares some similarities but blows it away in every comparison and is definitely now one of my favorite games ever if not my favorite i didnt really have any intention on getting the game until i watched some of it on twitch my fear was that it would be just another  console port its far from that its a great thing to see that r took the time to work on the pc version and get things right fortunately i had some gift cards that i used to knock the price tag down all said 5 wanted stars out of 5 after playing it for 80 hours i can say its still well worth the 70$ price tag

i do recommend this game but the way that modding the game is handled by rockstar is stupid and oversensitive theyll ban you from multiplayer because you want the fov to be higher in first person be warned that all they seem to care about is selling their ingame money for notingame money also if rockstar cant connect to steam tough luck youll have to wait until it can to play at all

as you might have already heard this brand new 2 year old game is just fantastic  great story although a bit short if you ask me with loads of mission variety  shooting driving flying diving boating parachuting stealth you name it gta v has it also there are a ton of cutscenes that have great dialogue writing voice acting and are always entertaining and fun to watch  great main characters never mind what crazy people say trevor is the man hes pretty much the only gta character that acts like a psycho both in cutscenes and ingame you know when youre making him murder innocent people with a rocket launcher as you do michael is pretty great too a lot of his missions are wacky in a sitcomsoap opera mashup kinda way franklin is a bit too average in my opinion but he has his moments and a puppy  amazing graphics never knew 360 and ps3 games looked so damn good   this game is so full of small teeny tiny details for example when youre playing in third person and you pull out your phone it shows it in the bottom right corner of your screen and while youre navigating the phone menu you can see the tiny phone screen in your characters hand actually displaying the same stuff you see on your bottom right and when your character receives a call and answers it the phone lights up his face as he puts it up to his ear its small details like these that make gta vs version of los santos come alive  car sounds sit in gtas version of a lamborghini or ferrari switch to first person view and enjoy the engine sounds  danger zone fortunate son danger zone carry on wayward son danger zone gimme all your lovin danger zone1  runs fine on average poor mans gaming hardware  660ti i7 920 @3ghz 8gb of ram can squeeze close to an average of 60 fps with everything turned up to highvery high if you turn the grass down to normal if not lock your fps to 30 turn up the grass and enjoy your ps4 game that is of course if you dont get struck by the stuttering bug which they may or may not fix who knows or you know if your game doesnt start these problems are plaguing a lot of people so keep that in mind before throwing money at rockstar online is a thing im not a big fan of online games unless they are proper mmos this game is not an mmo but i wouldnt recommend playing gta online alone as in with random people cause it just might bore you to death it may not really be a perfect game by any standards but it gave me everything i wanted out of it and more its just a fantastic open world game and instantly one of my favorite games ever  1010

do i really have to explain this well ok i have never been a hardcore gta fan multiplayer samp was always the best part about it gta v singleplayer the story is not interesting a slightest bit the 3 character approach is kind of cool though but you can definitely have a lot of fun playing through it the 100% checklist adds additional motivation to do everything if you are a completionist like myself gta online its not as good as samp is  no custom gamemodes scripting etc  a ton of things to do but the loading times are killing it after each mission you will be sitting for 30 seconds staring at los santos from above not knowing whether the game is still loading or its just stuck official mod support  steam workshop support  for gta v and gta online would make this instantly better but alas rockstar social club while it is easy to set up and not to worry about it later a steam integration would have worked better especially for online in conclusion its a great game for a gta game but it is not something spectacular

edit the problems appear to be already fixed for me on the first day^^ well that was fast singleplayer  graphic could actually be better but still all over the place considering that the world is so big  realistic characters they are not normal persons for sure but it never feels like rockstar is forcing the characters to develop their behaviour  very interesting stories which are very well integrated into the gameplay and the environment during the missions the player has to interact with the world a lot but i never feels much scripted like in other games also the gameplay has a lot of variety  a smoothly and naturally acting world that takes place at the east coast of the usa  great humour although the game can be quiet brutal or radical at some point see trevors behaviour ^^  it actually made me laugh a lot of times and surprised me with creative ideas for missions etc  a lot of radio stations presenting nearly all kind of music directions  a lot of things to do apart the missions even just the tennis mini game is better than some other games out there ^^  revised wanted system the police and the whole system now work better although you could also argument that the car chases now take too long and that the police shoots too good but even then i still find the new system better than in older gtas  new skills and such for your character basically you can have some sort of bullet time for shooting but also for driving  last thing makes driving so much easier for people like me who shoot better than they drive ^^  more content such as cloths cars etc than ever before  way friendlier placed save points  a lot of settings to modify the controls etc  however i would like to have the older weapon circle system the new one seems to be not that optimal for pc

i never thought i would say this but dont buy this game until they fix it i remember reading a question and answer session with rockstar where they confirmed that they will allow mods with gta 5 would this not be considered false advertising as they said that it would support it officially then they take it away definition false advertising  false advertising or deceptive advertising is the use of false or misleading statements in advertising and misrepresentation of the product at hand which may negatively affect many stakeholders especially consumers many people only bought gta 5 pc for the mods me being one of them i already own the game on consoles and bought it for the mods on pc many people building whole new pcs to play it on pc now they take away mods idea rockstar offline mode  allows players to make offline sessions and mod them as they see fit in this mode the player would be identified as having modified content in their game and be allowed to play in this lobby owner of lobby can set starting cash for players joiningdefault 0 and would be able to ban people from their servers none of the cash earned in this would be put into gtaonline just into gtaoffline any modders found joining gtaonline would be bannedcheaters pool this would also allow people to make role play sessions and whatever else they wanted to make you can obviously tell who has modified data in their game so would this not solve the problems at hand and one last thing let us mod single player we are going to do it anyway so by banning us for it is complete bs

launch issues as expected seems okayish optimized otherwise on first glance you need nearly double the final installation size to unpack the game at least currently so ensure you have around 120130 gigs of free space instead of 70 make sure your user name doesnt contain any special characters for everybody getting the launcher b e x 6 4 crash  launcher stopped working try to disable your graphics card in device manager start the game then kill it now the launcher remains open detecting that the game aborted and it now doesnt crash when you reenable the graphics card then simply press retry on the now functioning launcher and you should be able to enjoy the game the servers for online play seem to have the usual launch issues though recommended but keep the above issues in mind at least if you intend to play in the next few days

i love this game and ive waited for the pc version ever since it was released i think it was well worth the wait which is why im recommending this game however i do not support rockstar and their current decison to ban everyone for the use of mods even in single player im aware that a large portion of people who bought the game intending to mod the hell out of it but instead are just getting banned in my opinion this doesnt ruin the game because i enjoy the game the way it is but mods make every game 10x better and i can only think to myself damn rockstaryou ed up in terms of the game itself its almost everything ive wanted in a game optimization this time around compared to gta iv is a lot better im amazed how well this game performs on both my desktop and my midrange gaming laptop at max settings when looking at the graphics im amazed by every single aspect it has to offer minor details such as puddles when it rains the glow and light pollution given off by the city at night from a distance etc this game has so many little features that didnt need to be added that make the game an even more immersive experience when looking at the story even though im about 35% in as of writing this review i actually enjoy it while i prefer all the opportunites mulitplayer has to offer with its minigames character creation and ability to play with friends i still find myself enjoying the storyline and being hooked on it i admit the first hour was a bit boring but when it started to pick up it picked up and got damn good its not often i find myself wanting to pay attention and keep playing the campaign in a freeroaming game as of the current rockstar modding banhammer controversy if you want the game simply to mod the hell out of it dont get it otherwise youre just going to be  off and hate a great game because the developers are being shitelords if youre looking for a game with possible modding potential in the future or dont care and want to experience the game as it is which offers a great storyline as well as one of the best multiplayer experiences get it empty your wallet let it all out you wont regret it boner10

quick summary another triplea open world hit from rockstar games purchase verdict yes points of interest surprisingly still playable on semilow end computers im running at around 30 fps on a laptop with an intel i54200u cpu integrated graphics and 8 gb ram of course lowest settings but still looks decent massive amounts of cosmetic customizations from clothes to cars to much more plenty of ways to earn money and experience in the game including races death matches heists golf and more hours worth of ingame movies tv shows and music radio mirror park anyone hilarious and witty dialogue descriptions and more play headtohead or cooperatively in online play very active modding community for offline play  recent mass amount of hacking and modding in online play can ruin experience 
recommended
very good game if you can run it xd

great game the campaign has a good story and utilises the free roaming aspects of the game the online is a great feature with friends although playing with strangers can get a little repetitive with overpowered players constantly killing you the pc graphics arent great although still look pretty awesome on the settings im playing on although im basically on high for everything apart from textures which i have on medium the gameplay is incredibly similar to max payne 3 its basically the same game but without the flashy cutscenes and with a different story i like the way the cutscenes arent prerendered as this helps optimise them for your graphics settings overall really good game pc version is a lot better than my xbox 360 version

grand theft auto v is a game which takes place in the fictional pacific oceanic city of los santos and has two primary game modes storyline and online ill give a review for each type as the two are profoundly different and impossible to review as a collective gamethey even have two different titles gta v and gtaogrand theft auto online grand theft auto v gameplay there are three main playable characters in grand theft auto v michael trevor and franklin michael is a former bank robber from the east coast whos got a sweetheart deal with the fibgta speak for fbi trevor is a sleazy trailer park criminal and michaels best friend from south los santos franklin is an exstreet gangster the storyline switches between the three and you get to play as each one in segmented instances as the story progresses and tends to lean between the three in alternating levels of importancemeaning when trevor becomes more valid to the story than the other 2 youll play as him etc  however it is possible to switch between character after you encounter them allowing you to have one as a main and only play as the others when the story requires it it is a new type of gta gameplay and frankly i enjoy it but i dont enjoy it as much as i did with san andreas in san andreas you were stuck with playing an african american street gangster true but you could change and customize him as you pleased making him fat thin muscular weak swagalicious clothes or a bum you had options in gta v you dont get the same level of personalization in the storyline and instead have 3 generic unchangable characters to choose from that would be a problem for me but gta online fixes that right and proper which is why i dont mind it in the slightest if i were to give grand theft auto vstoryline a score id give it 8 stars out of 10 above is all of the positive but what about the negative grand theft auto v has the problem as every gta v game has and that is that the storyline is always the same generic issue its people doing crime to get money because money is great thats it the story is paper thin and irritatingly simplistic grand theft auto online grand theft auto takes everything that storyline has and personalizes it you get to create and name your own character and you then get lumped into a game session that can each house 30 players max each everything is 100% public even the voice chatitll either be deathly silent or itll be an ear deafening cacoffiny of people talkingyelling at eachother at least its easy to leavejoin other sessions to find one more suitable for your preferences storyline the story behind gta online starts right after you make your character you fly into los santos on an airplane and meet with one of the main characters from the storyline who takes you through a tutorial to show you the ropes after that youre essentially on your own and are cut loose to make your own way in the world will you be a racer a bankrobber a sports nut or simply a psychopath who kills everyone in your path it is entirely up to you to make your own story gta online just gives you the means its your job to make it work gameplay gameplay in gtao is much the same as in gtav but its much more brutal if youre simply driving down through the street you might suddenly find yourself exploding for no reason and dead instantly only to realize that youd driven over another players sticky bomb and they had remotely detonated it when you were close gta online is a merciless dangerous place far more dangerous than the single player because almost every player wants to kill you especially if you get a bounty put on you then everyone wants a piece of your  there is a way to fix this though and thats in the form of the passive mode after you die or during a game you might decide that youve had enough of pvp and dont want to be killed by other players you can activate the passive mode after doing so you get a ghostly appearance and can no longer take any kind of damage from other players even the vehicle you enter will get a ghostly appearance and will be impervious to any player interaction youll even drive straight through other players the game mechanics is separated into 3 different obtainable currencies reputation pointsrp gtavs answer to experience points like in every other mmo style game out there you gain rpexperience until you get a certain amount which then levels you up gta$ the games actual monetary currency this is by far thee most important thing in the game as it allows you to buy cars apartments planes helicopters foodfor health ammoarmorweapons and everything generally required to increase your utility and ability to adapt to any situation the game will throw at you it is the only one of the 3 currencies able to be bought for real life money but it is exceedingly expensive gta$8000000 costs us$100 job pointsjp the least important obtainable currency it is not really a currency but more a means to choosing a winner in player vs player scenarios say two people kill the same amount of enemies but one maybe has a higher accuracy ratingfewer deaths than the other that person will get more jp for the mission than the other and thereby win eventhough they both killed the same amount of peoplecrossed the finish line at the same time this currency resets to 0 after each job cons the community can be extremely horrible full of angry russians and asians who cant speak a lick of english or mlg420blasturmomm9 worshipping  whom are also abound trolls are everywhere and are extremely obstructive and irritating hacking is a risk there are still hacks that are unfixed such as infinite money and invulnerability people are getting banned but not fast enough and its a growing issue bugsglitches you get stuck a lot and the only fix for this is to force exit the game through the task manager and restart the game this has happened to me 3 times in a week once when entering my garage from outside once when entering my apartment from outside and once after finishing a versus mission sometimes if the internet is lagging a bit someone might become invulnerable while being able to kill you because the damage doesnt register for them loading screens are crazy this is an issue i hope they fix soon there is a loading screen literally no matter what you do even if you join a lobby for a mission and then leave right after you dont just go back to where you stood before no you have to go through a second loading screen and these loading screens take longer if you go into the steam overlay meaning you are forced to sit there and wait for minutes at a time to actually play instead of being able to sit and chat with friends in between universal stuffstuff that applies to both graphics are extremely demanding if you dont have a top of the line pc expect everything to have to be on mediummedium is gta vs name for lowest  and still have some problems with lag physics are way better in this game and driving bikescars is far more realistic this can be both a positive and negative experience driving in heavy rain is extremely difficult and takes a lot of practice to get right i find it a positive thing but ive heard a lot of complaints that its actually too real all this considered i still recommend the game as it is despite the occassional issue an extremely fun game and more than worth the price tag if you enjoy the gta franchise this one is a must have  leagues better than gta iv

the advantages the game is beautiful pictures single player different from the original to get a sense of excitement is very different from the original a good content writing games and the voice of a character in the game is made out well the city of los santos the citys up to you to customize it with a mission to rob the rich and exciting disadvantages there are some scenes of the game to show the error time is moving much single player mode also do not communicate well about what the various vehicles

besides from all these negative reviews about modding grand theft auto 5 is an excellent game originally a tps can now be played as a fps game although this game originated for consoles before it still handles very well for what there using but besides from all this here are its top 5 pros and cons i played this game on xbox360 before pc top 5 pros 1  it is a sandbox styled game focusing on making you move around the map with the open world environment 2  the game for most is very beautiful and stunning for a game that did not originate from pc 3  the game is smooth and quite easy to get use to 4  there are a lot of things to do 5  you can create things ranging from races to death matches or if you want create a gta5 movie top 5 cons 1  as i heard a lot of people whine about is that it is very picky towards the mods you can have 2  optimized but not to every everyones standards 3  can be buggy and glitchy but hey it just came out 4  good amount of connection problems towards other players 5  the community before people would lend a hand to others but now its more of a open world pvp ground the game though for pc is still pretty young and rockstar has more than just this game to worry about and with the fact that everyone is always hating or being rude to rockstar im surprised they did not give up yet good job r after all that here is what i would give it 8  10 recommended for people that have a good computer as you wouldnt be disappointed thank you for your time here is my social club rockstars social area httpsocialclubrockstargamescommemberliveforlime

re reviewed with 170 hours played as always great efforts in visuals and audioi loved the quality of the story & voice acting but i was annoyed that we still play dumb protagonists that get told what to do by government agents yet again depsite taking on merrywhether a sht tonne of cops gangsters & street randoms we still have to put up with distressful family members whom dont appreciate sht and we still have to follow the story rockstars way because they dont create alternate story arcs which i wish they would do eg in iv i wanted to support faustin and kill dimitri now that i have completed the story twice  allowing me to try the alternatives to the heist a option b option and seeing alternative cutscenes based on who i was controlling i am starting to see past the graphicsaudioand map size the main things that bugged me during my enjoyment of the story mode are really showing and once again they are the things that bugged me in previous titles gta relies heavily on scripts and whilst this was excusable on last gen its not in my opinion now examples of scripts instead of active ai coding or car physics is traffic trolling there are so many cars that spawn in front of you and are scripted to meet you head onside on its the same scripting in a mission in which you are chasing an npc in a vehicle and they are scripted to always be in front of you causing some very weird animation & speed up if you catch them up  the lazlow mission is a fine example of this cars in vinewood hills often appear in a driveway and pull out in front of you so fast that its simply not a random occurrence its been scripted the speed they come out of the driveway and grip to turn is so high due to the nature of the car trying to meet you head on you can see this when on coming traffic seems to divebomb at you resulting in many npcs vehicles going off their designated line to hit you sometimes its so bad they will drive over to the wrong side of the road to hit you this is a police chase script then there are the police once again programmed with mega grip top speed and acceleration under certain circumstances when a police car is in chase mode behind you they have mega speed and a weird speed boost ram option no matter the speed top or cruising they get to ram you hard its a nice feature but its scripted its not an ai doing it you can break this script by turning swerving sharply and the police ai looses that script and you can quite often see it become a normal car with loss of grip sliding off out of control as the mega speed grip script it had has goneit regains it again soon enough when it gets back to chasing behind you again after it has magically caught up the tyres being shot out is another script that i hate again the car receiving that burst tyre is scripted to turn the wheel overriding any control you or the npc has rathe than physics causing your car to loose partial control due to your gripfrictionbalance being altered at speed due to a loss of a tyre the very same turning is seen in drunkbong stoned mode the script is so bad that even at legal city driving speed 3040mph in the uk the tyre lost still scripts the car top widely turn your wheel which wouldnt happen because the speed travelling doesnt upset the car balance when a tyre is blownit would simply grind to a slow halt tyres being shot out in police chases are often scripted it seems to be the police helicopters that trigger this in so many cases i have evaded ground forces and am using the hillsidesmountains to lose the air support as i lose the chopper and it goes into old a pensioner eyesight mode my tyres get shot as the police rifles are quite distinct in volume and sound effect you know you heard it this i passed off as lucky shots for the first few times but then it started to happen underground i would evade police air support by using the swere system in the citythe best way to get rid of 6 stars btw again as i enter the tunnel and the police physically cant shoot at me i hear the gun shot and tyres gosometimes i have lost two tyresyou cant blame latency here as this is sp mode this is either scriptingor police can shoot through objects such as rock and stone lets talk about wanted system still in 2015 gta v has the same wanted system that it had in iii as in its all designed around you and the police ignoring the fact that the city is full of people the wanted system targets you specifically the worst and most obvious case of this is using a suppressor not only does this ignore the entire stealth statistic you have maxed out it ignores the fact that suppressed gunshots are impossible to identify from rangeto the observer a bulletgunshot is not heard only the sound of the projectile hitting something is in close proximity you may hear the odd noise the gunshot makes as the blast is absorbed by the suppressorand the average citizen wouldnt know what that is with this in mind the you vs the police mode kicks in and your treated to a 1 star despite using a suppressor out of sight of civilian or police line of sight why did rockstar not bother to script ranged suppressor shots to be reported as suspected gunfire which in turn triggers the same script that using 911 police option does this option makes a police car turn up in your zone in a passive mode until it sees a crime another thing that bothers me is the npcs lock on mode when shooting at youits cheap its done because they dont have to code much obvious examples of this are the noose members hanging of the noose suvyou can ram the suv and spin it out of control but the gunshot aim still hits youanother example os when a police heli is going down the noose member in the back can still hit you despite the heli going down at speed making a perfect shot to hit you impossible i get why they do this its all about time vs moneyim sure that there are guys within rockstar that dreamwish they could improve this stuff but their higher ups dont allow them to also gta always sells in mass and the game doesnt really have any competition that would force them to improve what i have mentioned here these things break immersion even worse when your not absorbed by the story these are the things i wish to mod if a tool created allows methese minor details are whats left over when sandbox mode comes to pass story mode donelweft to do what you want mode and because the above i mentioned is lackingand or never changes the game becomes really dull and my reliance on mods kicks in which isnt all bad but it is a shame that only some previous gen mods get brought in as new ideas for the next gta rather than most of the good ones excluding the goofy script mods

grand theft auto is the best and fastest selling game of all time that is actual fact this game has broken world records for a reason those parts aside let me give you my experience with the game i played the original gta v on xbox 360 the day it came out and followed up playing gta online when it was released later both games might as well be two seperate games are fantastic the story mode is rich with excellent dialogue and amazing characters you never know what you will hear next or what might happen this is a game of satire if satire is something you are not a fan of or hate crude and vulgur humor this game will never sit well with you if you are okay with satire prepare for it to be cranked up to 11 as this is the biggest amount of satirical humor you can find no one is safe from rockstars plethora of jokes and jabs the actual game play itself is beyond solid compared to the original gta iv made on the same engine 7 years ago this game stands tall the driving is a tiny bit arcady but it is much more realistic and responsive than the sluggish and oil slicked tires of gta iv driving shooting is much more solid as well targets snap to much more fluidly with more precise control on where you wish to aim as opposed to gta ivs snap and  dragging of the reticule back to the center of mass flying is also solid and even much better than it has ever been before vehicles feel like they have weight to them while flying and take realistic damage specific parts of vehicles or aircraft can be targeted to cause precision damage such as shooting off the rotors of helicopters or taking out the engine of a jet speaking of flying there is turbulence now that is reduced by your flying skill which gives incentive to level it as well as enjoy the more responsive flying style planes can even stall if they fly straight up customization in this game is huge each character can wear a vast array of clothing and haircut or tattoo options and every vehicle can be customized with unique colors compared to gta iv its laughable how drastic the difference in gta iv you couldnt even customize cars you could get their color changed but it would be randomized what color you got so you had to repeat the process needless and there was nothing else thats it gta v has options a plenty from performance enchancing to many cosmetic changes as well as protective such as armor and bulletproof tires overall single player for gta v is an amazing experience and with the new first person mode replaying the campaign and just using fpm is an entirely different experience gta online is vast environment with so much content that i cant even cover everything i want to say about it here if you are truly interested in gta online go check out my guide duo vandals ultimate guide to gta online on the guide section and give it a rating if you enjoyed it ive been playing gta online to this day since 2013 and its the best online experience you can have

this game is quite self explanatory it doesnt need a review the gta series has given players the freedom they desire the ability to do just whatever you like storywise gtasa was better but the fact that v has three main characters more than makes up for this one hour of gta accidentally smashed a cat got rammed by a policecar car randomly exploded tried to fly a chopper upside down failed blew up my friends after exiting the strip club one stole my car nearly finished the final heist n00b dies and s it all also  endless references to real life counterparts with a hilarious touch just to avoid copyright issues  genious trio of main characters  level of detail is over 9000  car tuning is back cons gta online  grand theft loading a classic everyone should own endless fun with comrads and a polished singleplayer storyline

this game is a masterpiece dont mind all the coneheads crying because they used alterations online to all the  crying about being banned its simple do not use mods online you can easily remove the mods the same way you easily installed them if you think a company as big as rockstar and with as much talent is going to let you use custom content in the world they have created for you to play in you are sadly mistaken and obvously paid the consequences to say you no longer recommend a game because you went online with alterations is childish this game is great the graphics are great and so is the gameplay people wonder why rockstar is so hesitant to release for pc and when they do this type of  happens i use mods but im not a conehead who would try to use them onliine and get an unfair advantage i simply remove them and play online and when i want to mod it up again i readd them i bought this game 3 times 360 xbox one and pc the pc version is the best

this game truly is the ultimate version the way i see it far more superior than its console versions x360one & ps34 graphics are gorgeous the city is beautifull the story is excellent wildlife is fantastic as well as blaine county and trevor is crazy as hell but of course there are a few flaws such as the need to add more bars and strip clubs or the ability to enter bars such as tequilala or the other minor strip clubs around los santos period also would be nice if firstperson could be improved a bit oh and its been so many gtas allready and not a single one has added the ability to simply sit down on the benches out in the city and just watch people mind their own business except gta iv but with mods only and i think thats it great game r i love it
recommended
i love rockstar for gta online we need more innovation and heists

tldr the best gta game so far the only not so great aspect of gta v is the design of the city some parts feel very bland and forgettable but this is still not nearly as bad of a problem as it was in gta iv version of liberty city i would say gta iii and san andreas are still the best in the series in this regard with vice city and gta v being right behind them i guess when you let developers use mechanics like gps navigation they get lazy and do not give their best to make every corner of the city unforgettable like they once did nearly everything else is in my opinion spot on well you can escape from police a bit too easy but on the other hand if escaping was to hard this would probably soon become very annoying and interfere with you have fun unlike gta iv gta v does not take it self too seriously as a result the humour is back the main and side characters and their different personalities come together perfectly and the missions are once again wacky imaginative fun and just the right amount over the top weapons and vehicles are fun to use and from the technical side of things the game runs fine and looks very good voice acting and animations are great also i have no real complaints on the soundtrack although kdst vrock and chatterbox still remain my favorite radio stations overall as i already said the best gta game so far
recommended
after learning the free hugs trick from pewdiepie i find myself doing almost every time most of it with trevor playing like if trevor had mild mental retardation this game is ing awesome it allows you to play it like its your own game and by that i mean creating your own rules and such gta online well its good but its full of griefers who take advantage of moving their ps3x360ps4xone characters into pc which makes them virtually invincible with their armored cars highly resistant armor and ultra advanced guns and making them thik they are the kings of the game while in reality theyre being   killing newcomes who dont have a console and expected the game for pc since 2014 and want to have some fun with friends who are in the same situation and as for the server stability mor or less i have some lag while playing with friends but it rarely happens so the pc servers may have to be fixed somehow aside from that big problem with online ill give it a 1010 buy this game you wont regret it specially if someday it gets 10 or 20% of discount because do believe me it will happen

gta v gameplay and performance review the pc version rules ever since grand theft auto vs initial release back in september 2013 for the playstation 3 and xbox 360 pc gamers have been eagerly waiting for rockstar games to bring its title to the pc 18 months later and the longawaited game has finally been released unfortunately while rockstar games is known for releasing some topnotch titles its track record with porting its games to pc hasnt been stellar when grand theft auto iv came out for the pc platform back in 2008 about eight months after the console version it was criticized as a poor port at the time suffering from performance issues and requiring users to be signed in to windows live to save their progress it frustrated many users in many ways that its console counterparts did not though the pc version has some superior aspects as well the same can be said about grand theft auto v to some extent but well get to that later on in the review read the rest of the review over at hot hardware httphothardwarecomreviewsgrandtheftautovgameplayandperformancereviewisthepcversionthedefinitiveone

here are a few things that are unique to gta v 1 it combines the vast open wilderness of gta san andreas with the physics engine and visuals of gta iv while greatly improving on both 2 it is optimized well enough to run on my laptop with 3540 fps something i couldnt believe when i saw the benchmarks still there seems to be an issue with memory leak as the game starts stuttering randomly after about an hour but i hope they fix that at some point 3 the developers once again push the envelope of open world action games by introducing new previously unseen mechanics such as switching between 3 characters in real time 4 for the first time in the gta series we can play in first person as well as third person although the fov in the first case is a bit too low for pc gaming 5 the world is full of distractions and fun things to do so you can play for dozens of hours without progressing much into the main story the mini games and activities alone are some of the best ive ever seen ive been having a blast playing tennis shooting in the range and playing catch with chop 6 multiplayer was introduced in gta iv but it had no variety in this one the multiplayer is a whole new experience with just as many things to do with your friends as in the main story mode maybe even more these are the things that sold me in the first place after playing 23 hours though i realized theres so much more to this game than i originally anticipated story and voice acting all the characters are well written and brilliantly voice acted the game does a good job at making you care about the characters and their lives the dialogues are very good and there are lots of funny jokes and situations the main story itself is not very compelling im 42% through it at the time of this review but it keeps you interested with all the cool setup missions and heists sound and music i really love a game that makes the sound of the guns realistic and satisfying gta v achieves that to some extent as i find the sound of a silenced pistol or sniper rifle very pleasing while headshotting an unsuspected victim the rest of the sound assets contribute to the aesthetic of the game whether youre stuck in traffic on a main highway or climbing a mountain the immersion is rather good the music on the radio is fantastic as always there are stations for every taste and all the songs are classics for their genre one of the most interesting things i found is that after most missions there would be a news broadcast on the radio reporting in detail whatever happened in that particular mission graphics i play on a pretty weak machine so i cant enjoy the full graphical fidelity the game has to offer what i can say though is that on normal settings it runs at very playable framerates 3540 fps on my laptop i7 3632qm gt635m 6gb ram and still looks great i love the detail in the character models and the vehicles if you switch to first person you can even see the interior of the car although the textures there are not the best gameplay this is definitely the best part about this game as always gameplay is responsive and smooth when in firefights the cover system is quite useful the guns feel very good to shoot and headshots are very satisfying the handling of the vehicles is greatly improved compared to gta iv although the fact that you can control your vehicle in the air or flip over an upside down car with the turn keys is pretty unrealistic and maybe degrades the immersion a little on the other hand handling of the planes and helicopters feels much more realistic they sometimes wobble about as if there is turbulence so you need to make corrections the side missions and activities are extremely well designed and interesting known issues before buying the game you should probably know about the few issues that currently exist 1 there is a problem with some characters used in the player usernames that may keep you from playing the game but there is a workaround for this problem in the discussions page 2 there have been reports recently that accounts have been banned for modding the game im not sure why rockstar would ban moddng but it probably has to do with anticheat measures 3 there appears to be a memory leak in the game and after i play for about an hour i get a strange random stuttering of both picture and sound it usually happens for a short time and if it persists restarting the game usually fixes it make sure you have all the free ram you can get before starting the game maybe by shutting down some processes especially if your machine is not that powerful 4 the initial loading time before you enter the game is very long at least for me for more information on possible issues you may experience you can visit the discussions page conclusions a generally amazing game experience i was hesitant to buy this full price since i dont have a very good pc but in the end im glad i did it will keep you entertained for dozens of hours the pc version is the best of all but if you were hoping to mod it better wait until rockstar comes up with an official statement about the banned accounts story 910 sound 1010 graphics 910 gameplay 1010 2 points for the good optimization p overall 1010

amazing game truly on the highest settings its truly a breathtaking experience this is the open world game we have been waiting for aside from a few minor bugs and the online mode having pretty intense lag at the time of review this is perfection in a video game
recommended
rating 8 ill start with single player  thats a win 910 as always this is where gta delivers and its one of the most nejoyable games of the year its immersive its fun its allmost everything only two problems here  its sort  does not feel like a huge improvement from gta iv its only far bigger otherwise not a huge improvement online  oh total fail 310 dont know where to start   the moronic lobby system for everything thats immersion breaking  its gta lobby online   the bugs the exploits the lag   in free mode everyone is out to get you and if they arent right now they will be soon  the most expensive toys arent really useful in heists or cant be used at all in heists  the overpowered karuma  its actually too good at everything  no point in getting something else   the restriction for exactly 4 players for heists  wich most of the time will force you to  1 spend most of the times finding players and 2 spend the rest of the time playing with at least one   even though the missions themseffs rarely require more than 2 players  the jobs  other coop element beside heists  are usually short and unchallenging

i wasnt pleased with rockstar delaying the pc version of grand theft auto v and i intended to wait for a sale before buying it but the reviews for the pc version were nothing but positive so i caved within the first week or two of the game being available on steam as far as the gameplay goes its just like any gta since gta3 ive not played the console version but gta5 does look nice on pc i felt that the story was done fairly well it had twists drama and comedy i didnt feel like any particular set of character missions were overdone or monotonous and i enjoyed being lazy using the autoaim feature with the gamepad and then switching to kbm for the scenerious where i needed more precision i ran gta5 on an i7950@42ghz 6gb ram and a galax gtx 970 exoc black probably one of the reasons the game actually runs so well in comparison to the gta4 pc disaster is that it loves system resources it was easily pushing my system ram usage up over 51gb and using over 3gb of vram going by what i saw on reviews of the gpu i increased my core clock just a bit and then gave the ram clocks a much larger bump this allowed me to crank the details greatly i disabled the nvidia shadows in favor of softest shadows for some reason im under the impression that if a gpu manufacturer develops a specific feature that it should look good and run awesome on their gpu but that doesnt seem to be the case with the nvidia shadows performance took quite a hit those shadows do look good but you really probably wont notice it while youre trying to drive through every coincidental red light going 150mph the only technical issue i had may have been related to riva tuner statistics server if you use something like msi afterburner or evga precision x they may interfere with the game and cause a d3d crash i had no issues after closing the evga application allinall good fun game rockstar made a good effort to prevent this from being a disaster and it shows ive not played online mode

firstly its gta 5 on pc its great because we actually have it recently a lot of negative reviews have come out trying to slate the game at every corner probably because there computers dont have enough power to run chrome and there pocket money was wasted on this brilliant gem secoundly hacker gta online has hackers everywhere its dead easy to hack google expained to me how it was so easy in 3 min anyway a way to avoid this is to open a solo or closed match or just ignor them and then vote kick them somtimes they drop nukes from orbit but its all in the spirit of capitalism thirdly singleplayer there is so much to write about with the singleplayer you cant beat this epic saga of criminal streaks and briliantly writen scripts the world is dynamic and feels real and the best part is mods a fully modable singleplayer is amazing i honnestly cant recomend it enough fourthly dlc so far all dlc is free heists ill gotten gain everything is free this may change for a story expansion somthing i am dying for but is free for most of them added complaints and final revew the game is buggy breaks cant connect to the servers for  but this game is so special its perfect i waited 3 years for this so did 4 million others and we all still play the game even if rockstar try shipping coppies in the sales with micro transactions we still love them everyone in the community over reacts they cry when rummors come around and make up lies to inforce them when it never happend im talking about you people who said they were banned yeah they never did ban anyone did they finaly the game is 910 bugs yes but its gta play the story feel sad when its over and love flying your golden jet while your friend smokes in the back this game is special and i will love it untill the day its servers die 910 would recomend to anyone who has 40 and would recomend it to people who have never tried the series

its a good game in general had lots of fun with my friends when it first came out played private of course because the public online is questionable other than what apparently rockstar did with the prices this review is before any of that so for this case i recommend it now after what they did currently either wait for an actual sale or someone buys it for you or the company learns some respect with the questionable marketing theyve done including the dlc because for what its worth its notyet

none stop played since was released 30 hours just for the singleplayer and online well alot more with friends p hours just fly by playing this

grand theft auto v has been called a perfect game 1010 scores thrown around by sites like ign gamespot and the telegraph but it is not a perfect game it is a very very very good game though its shortcomings are what holds it back from being perfect in my eyes at least the narrative has such a good setup the characters that inhabit this world seem so interesting but rockstar fails be delve deeper into each character which makes me like them less michael was the obvious focus as his story and background is far more fleshed out than the other two protagonists franklins is almost pathetic with his exgirlfriend side storymotivation to get out of the hood seem good on paper but its never fleshed out we see this exgirlfriend less than four times throughout the story and she is barely mentioned its little things like this that bog down what would of been the best cinematic experience in a grand theft auto game the actual missions themselves are extremely fun and varied with wonderful set pieces that really get you into the scene the real star of grand theft auto v is the map much like gta iv loads of development hours and love have gone into creating a living breathing city for you to explore and discover in from the busting metropolis of los santos to the dusty wasteland that is blaine county there is always something to look at and play around with this map is even more fun to play around with friends since there is so much variety there is always something to do with your mates i can see this game being in my recently played for a long time the gunplay is less clunky than gta iv with the addition of the weapon wheel first found in red dead and max payne 3 the driving is more arcadey this time round which while many people love i preferred the boaty weighted feeling of gta iv but hey thats me and finally the rockstar editor this is worth the price of the game by itself the rockstar editor is super user friendly easy to pick up and actually really fun to use i can see myself clocking many hours in this game just editing clips but please rockstar add higher bitrate videos the current highest bitrate option is doesnt look that great but the option to export in 60fps is really nice so overall this game has a few shortcomings but that shouldnt stop you from experiencing one of the most fun third person openworld games on steam i give it a solid 810 you need to play this game
recommended
good game but i need more heists if you like playing onlinemy opinion is that you should buy it  hf 
recommended
ive played over 200 hours on xbox one and beat the singleplayer twice its a great game in the gta franchise with the flaw of bad multiplayer if you plan on grinding missions for a couple of hours then get ready for lag low payouts and jerk offs who leave half way through free roam is just that free roam around a city doing well nothing really in my experience you need friends to even have fun in both free roam and contact missions yesterday i attempted to do heist set ups with my friend and we kept failing because of the other teams incompetance later on while i was oncall solo for heists we got to the end of a real heist and someone left boom 2030 minutes gone the character customization is impressive but the outcome always ends up with everyone looking soft not even a leather jacket sunglasses and a beard could possibly make your character look tough the unapealing amount of people wearing skin tight leopard print jeans is in the thousands as every missionsheist i join or make has at least one of these hipster s just wear normal clothes already unfortunately even with rs big anti cheat thing theyve recently implemented i still see hackers often yesterday again i was in my garage where out of nowhere jesus appears hugging my back i promptly see its a hacker and brush him off i hop on my motorcycle where suprisingly jesus decides to ride  and send my motorcycle out of my garage good bye jesus in that same lobby i saw jesus dropping money bags i left as soon as i could another funny hacker encounter was when this guy turned into a ufo and afkd in the clothing store so if you walked in you couldnt walk out witohut teleporting into the phantom world he later turned into a wind mill and trapped us all in the store the sale this summer was atrocious 60 dollars for the base game all ing week genius

great optimization for pc fun online play and well its gta with $270 million dollar budget devopled by rockstar north  its a fun game with a awesome story i played on the console and an free online mode while riddle with some cheaters   in my limited experince with 1 or 2 cheaters after 20 hours of online to date isnt bad to me i feel guilty to say in both cases it was actually kinda of fun floating above los santos in car with two other dudes on mics taken on a crazy freeroam ride with one that all said the heists you perform the progression and customization of your character when you play online  paired with gtas whacky and crazy sequences of mayhem with others  is great i know gtav didnt go on summer sale and instead rockstar opted to retain the price give you $200000 starting off cash if you did buy it during the sumer sale as model honestly i dont find that to be a big deal r didnt want gtav to be on the summer sale and so isnt worth the negative reveiw as a game you can buy it for $5500 for the pc on amazon right now if youd like

rockstar has always been one of my most favorite developers of video games they never seem to fail with any title they make and gta v is no exception it is one of the most diverse video games on the market the online is amazing in every way you are able to everything from races to heists and deathmatches also to anyone giving this game a bad review its because you basically cheated you used mods online which is prohibited in most games anyway you can use them in singleplayer and rockstar has stated that you can and that you wont get banned for it pros to many to list but here are a few diverse great storyline fun exploration graphics are top notch great characters in single player online is amazing cons character customization is a little meh i wish it could be more diverse able to completly customize a character first person fov is a little annoying and kinda makes you sick not much else to really give a con its a great port to pc

subpar console port of a game but which can be thoroughly enjoyable if you play with friends or playing singleplayer however the glaring insanely stupidity of changing the difficulty of enemy ai based on whether or not you have a controller or mousekeyboard can be detected in an instant how so in most cases you will as a mousekeyboard player be sniping with pistols smgs rifles and sniper rifles because not only do they spot you instantly by the pixel of your character theyre deadly as  and have a high tendency to just blow away half your armor bar in a shot however if you play with controller youre given free range to actually close in on them to blow their brains out they are less accurate and have trouble seeing you even if you were literally spotted two seconds ago npc ai is good but has some flaws when it comes to evadeescape actions when confronted by an armed player ive also got to say that pc gamers are not three armed mutants rockstar to use a plane or chopper youll have to use both your regular wasd keys and numpad to successfully move around you can probably to a smaller degree learn to use mouse instead of numpad though in my cases its ended up suddenly taking a sharp turn downwards land vehicles are great except if you get them 2 inches of the ground and happen to be at max velocity which then will make you into a dreidel makes for great jumps but then again if you decide that gravity should be lighter then it can not at the same time be heavier on the way downbut then again maybe we achieve terminal velocity faster graphically its very nice cant deny that and wouldve loved to see other games using the same engine to a degree also jp will be harvested 15 after mission setup and heist japan points will be earned into the thousands im sure buy this game if you want to have fun with friends andor wanna play singleplayer and want to do some really super senseless violence do not buy this game if you feel that you should be banned for using any mod created for the game even as simple as better shadows they have indiscriminate power to just ban you whether you created it or not buy saints row 3 instead in that case same kind of senseless violence and at times even greater character creation possibilities and funny story plot

good graphics and games if you a gta fans single player is great but short wish there was more option to do money then heist only as most of the mission is simply progression without $$$ as for multiplayer its pretty bad the loading is pathetic i have upgrade to ssd and it made a difference alots altho its still way to long to load between each mission not to mention half the time it get stuck in limbo or is just way way too long i dont recomande it for online unless they fix the loading but for the single player its great alots of nice feature just bad that there isnt more way to make money than a 510 minute taxi towing random encounter worth of 90  1000 $ overall i give it a 610 when they fix online and up reward or more paying mission in sp ill give it a 910

single player single player in grand theft auto v is great it features three characters a psychopath trevor a hustler franklin and a retired bank robber micheal this gives the game a crazy but unique playstyle were you get to live their strange life this game also features many easter eggs side missions and good looking super and sports cars online grand theft auto online almost feels like a second game featuring many missions and activites to do with friends or without them the story line of grand theft auto online goes any way to want from racing to robbing convenience stores this makes the game very fun with the possibilities it fulfills grand theft auto v is a great game and has been remade deeply luckily it wasnt a console port i thank rockstar also from optimizing this game to the point most modern pc personal computers can get over thirty frames per a second 910  great game

i bought it on a friday by the end of the weekend i had 50 hours on record i now have 90 hours on record kill other players stalk them  them off do heists get tons of $$$$ get stuck on one part of a heist for hours or days because matchmaking will give you a  team threaten to kill everyone scream in mic  everyone off make them call you a 4year old start speaking in tongues really loudly when a foreigner joins your game and starts speaking their home language cry more about heists and then continue following and killing other players till they go passive finally bully them via voice chat to force them to leave passive mode again and kill them overall 1110

 the graphics are amazing  the game runs well on most of the systems and it is well optimized  the controls are comfortable  easy to switch from single player to multiplayer  the rockstar editor  no problem with shooting or driving while using a keyboard and a mouse  the cops are ing dangerous  firstperson fov needs to be bigger  long loading times in gta online  sometimes gta online crashes  sometimes all players randomly disconnect in gta online  really annoying when people randomly start talking through microphones in gta online and you cant mute them is this game worth 60 euro in my opinion yes after all the delays it runs well but some bugs need to be fixed and the performence in general in grand theft auto v online needs to be improved hopefully a patch in a week or so will fix the problems i will update later on

smoothest game launch in a very long time other than a few glitches hereandthere in the online mode its amazingly fun

pretty impressive played every port of gta5 and this is without a doubt the best one had a few issues at the start but once you get past the intro it runs just fine
recommended
the port for this game is down right amazing running on an i53570k with a gtx 660 ti i am able to get a smooth 60 fps with mediumhigh settings obviously the best way to play this masterpiece
recommended
after a long much awaited delay i cant say that im in any way dissapointed this game is all that i would hoped it would be it runs on lower end pcs as well as looking great on high end pcs its a all around good purchase for everybody around the pc gaming community i am so glad that rockstar stepped up to the plate and made this game live up to the hype aside from some early download issues which are to be expected with the amount of people hitting their servers at one time all around i can say that this game is completely worth full priceat least for a pc only gamer and it wont dissapoint
recommended
fourth time buying this game and i still dont regret it
recommended
this game is amazing the world of los santos is huge to the point that i wish they created easy fast travel spots akin to assassins creed there is so much to do complete with three different endings characters you love to hate gorgeous scenery cars that actually handle well unlike previous gta games and a great storyline and believe it or not rockstar finally broke their mold because one of the endingswell ill let you find out when i hear people talk about how they were turned off by gta 4 and dont think gta 5 will be any better i ask them to reconsider there are some big differences between the two whereas gta 4 took itself a bit too seriously and tried to be dark and gritty gta 5 takes a much more lighthearted approach its much brighter the landscape is amazing from sterile industrial areas to gorgeous mountain peaks the story has a much lighter tone and the characters are much more dynamic than ol nico bellic sure the action sequences can get really intense but in general gta 5 doesnt have so much drama to weigh it down and you dont have an annoying cousin calling you every 5 minutes to go bowling that alone is a major improvement the graphics in the pc version are insanely good and highly customizable just about every function that you can imagine can be tweaked so that you can get the perfect combination of quality and framerate just be warned that some of the settings require a restart of the game but when it comes to the graphics quality between the pc version and the ps3xb360 version there is no comparison another big turn off to gta 4 is that driving is horrendous it truly feels like youre driving a gocart on an icy road even when the roads are clean and dry rockstar finetuned the driving in gta 5 so that its much more responsive and significantly easier than its predecessor its still not as easy as in other games like saints row 3 but its a significant improvement to gta 4 the game also allows for seamless switching between keyboardmouse which i prefer for gunplay scenes and controller which i prefer for driving and flying if there are any negatives i would say that the biggest is that if youre a gold medal hunter the game gives you no clue of whats required in a mission until the mission is over effectively forcing you into replaying the mission some of the missions are very long and convoluted so this seems like a really big jerk move on rockstars part additionally there doesnt seem to be any kind of cloud save function at least not yet i tried first playing this in 3d on my 3dtv and playend through a few missions i then tried it on my main pc and even though both are connected to rockstar social club i had to start from the beginning i thought that rockstar was going to implement cloud saving but either i misread or its currently down speaking of 3d if your pc is connected to a 3d tvmonitor or you dont mind redblue anaglyph you seriously need to play this in 3d rockstar built stereoscopic 3d into the game if you crank the nvidia 3d depth to max and you increase the 3d convergence in the games graphics setting  ho lee st and anyone with a modern nvidia card can play in redblue anaglyph their drivers can convert just about any direct x game on the fly ive played it so far in both regular 3d mode on my 3dtv and in anaglyph redblue on my main pc the 3d mode is stellar even in redblue if you have any of those crappy paper glasses around i recommend that you give it a try fair warning though you need to go through a few steps to really get it to work properly i can give the exact steps in the comments below if anyone wants them i understand that gta 4 might have soured the gta franchise for a lot of people but i urge you to give gta 5 a chance while it has some similarities it really is a different game in many ways and it deserves your attention

finally at lastgta v has finally come to pci gotta saythis is a much more improved port than gta ivbut howeveri did notice some things that are not right and rockstar may need to fix them and also some things are kinda weird for me here are some proscons for this port pros gta v pc port awesome 1080p support im currently using this graphics improved from console at least from my eyes it is very good optimized with the 350 driver from nvidia rockstar editor is very unique and cool exclusive to this pc port only looks beautiful from my monitor looking at los santos being alive mods there are no mods out yetbut this will be one of the main reasons of why this port is so succuseful cons some unoptimized areas sometimes when i got to some areas such as open plain desertmy fps will drop but when i go back to cityits back to 60 fpsrockstar please fiximprove this asap and also i use a asus gtx 970 and when i set up the graphicsive only used like around 2033 gb of vram and also by the time i set up the graphics optionsthe bar was green which i think it meant it was stable and optimized but apparently it completely didnt  kinda weird controls for helicopterplane not really a bad thingbut its just feel unfamilari cant remember any pc games that have this controlsyou use the number pad to drive forwardim not familiar with itbut i will have to master this controls and get familiar with the controlsso not really a game breaker or will lose verdict points so yeahthats all at the momenti feel playing this portits a excellent portpossibly the best gta game port ever well done rockstaryou earned yourself a very well made cookie for your efforts put into this port  final verdict 1010 for being the best port

great game as expected

i am not exactly sure how to start this review its been a long wait i bought the game 2012015 and since then  all i did was wait for it to go live after a few delays last night it finaly did go live and all my waiting was worth it before i ever launched it i went on the steam forums and checked what were the first impressions of everyone else what i saw was kinda troubling for me a lot of people were complaining how they couldnt launch the game load it completely had terrible fps drops so when it finnaly happened when i launched my game for the first time  i expected the same problems  i had none  the social club account i already had was required for gta iv too was easily linked to gta v  the game didnt crash once  it launched as any other game does performing first time setup etc  true it took some time to get the graphics settings just right for my gear i have a gtx 660 and a quad core amd 31 ghz which is a bit too weak but manages to run the game nicely and i do expirience some fps drops most of the time but honestly i did expect this  texture quality i use is  normal any other setting demands more video memory than i have even so i think the game looks amazing i can only imaginwe how it looks for people with supercharged computers my final impression is  1010 and my advice for everyone woth problems at the start  be patient wait for the load to finish itself try different graphic settings make the game run nicely on your computer before reviewing it negatively it deserves respect and patience we have been witing for this masterpiece for a very long time
recommended
at first i didnt get the hype of grand theft auto online then i headshotted some dude on his way to a heist with his crew and i heard over voice chat that btch killed blankblank kill that motherfcker then i led them on a street chase through the city and i remembered the 5 ds of dodgeball dodge duck dip dive and dodge then i went off of a ramp and landed in a river shortly afterwards they shot me dead as i tried to escape i get gta online now

i really would not recommend this game if you are playing it on a laptop unless you are willing to put in copious amounts of time into finding a fix that is temporary i would absolutely advise not to buy it ive had trouble with rockstar in the past i spent roughly 5 hours trying to get gta iv to run and it was so poorly optimized that it barely ran after the hours of trying to fix it this will most likely be the last time i buy a rockstar game they had plenty of time to test their pc products and they still made it extremely tough to run this is coming from a guy with a beast of a gaming laptop just do not buy this game

brilliant game brilliant characters even more brilliant script but the plot and the use of the map has been very misused in this edition of gta unlocking part of the maps at the time and taking the player to location that otherwise would have not be noticed was one of the main strengths of the gta series both this formulas have been ignored in addition if we consider that gta was one of the most enjoyable modding platforms available since vice city the lack of such feature or to better explain the fact that you get banned if you use mods takes so much away from a title that has been on the top of the world for so long please rockstar dont make the mistake that so many userunfriendly production houses have made dont make yourself be hated by the community allow single player mods without consequences in the online side of the game i do recommend the game its fantastic but mods in single player must be made possible before i can give a positive vote

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful

this game is super laggy and it crashes so i dont recommend this game

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

brilliant game brilliant characters even more brilliant script but the plot and the use of the map has been very misused in this edition of gta unlocking part of the maps at the time and taking the player to location that otherwise would have not be noticed was one of the main strengths of the gta series both this formulas have been ignored in addition if we consider that gta was one of the most enjoyable modding platforms available since vice city the lack of such feature or to better explain the fact that you get banned if you use mods takes so much away from a title that has been on the top of the world for so long please rockstar dont make the mistake that so many userunfriendly production houses have made dont make yourself be hated by the community allow single player mods without consequences in the online side of the game i do recommend the game its fantastic but mods in single player must be made possible before i can give a positive vote

rockstar eventually responded to my support ticket and the response was to advise that they are fixing the mouse input issues latest bug fix reports state these issues are fixed but they still persist  i am also experiencing a consistent decrease in fps the longer i play the game for which suggests a memory leak still exists even after their most recent updates which stated these sort of problems were resolved rockstar fix your fu game  also why is it that in gta online there is a constant stream of lag spikes which somehow tie directly in with my frames per second too so i can be cruising along at 75fps then out of nowhere 1fps and back up agan and down etc other players have advised they see this happening where my car rubberbands all over the place in sessions when this starts ive seen it happen to other players as well we are on very stable fibre optic connections here and are usually elected as a viable host connection in other games that use peer 2 peer hosting but for whatever the reason in gta online this fails so bad well if you read all of this and consider that i spent the entire time since the game came out with massively delayed correspondence between support and myself trying to get them to acknowledge that the issues i am having are the fault of their game and then to try get something done about it still to no avail well go ahead and buy a copy but i genuinely could not recommend it gtamp is being worked on which is a gta 5 multiplayer mod with an estimated release date of some time later this year once that comes out  perhaps then the memory leaks and mouse input will be fixed enough that i could at least recommend buying the game as an engine to support gtamp gtamp will avoid the inconsistent latency issues that r provide their customers with shy p2p hosting by giving us dedicated hosting for custom gamemode servers it wont be an deathmatch freeroam with basic rpg elements necessarily it will be something unique and exciting using the great map and content of gta 5 so thats worth hanging out for but right now no not worth buying wait for that to release and wait to make sure r dont slam it shut with a lawsuit threat or similar hopefully theyll be too busy selling preorders to gta 6 by the end of the year to care about gtamp ^ ^

believe the hype and get burned still plays like a ps2 game and the online portion is a tacked on grind fest not fun at all the controls are convoluted and the rules of familiarity changes all the time the characters are boring sociopaths and unrelatable this makes the missions a chore and you will have no feel for the stakes if you are a casual that want to kill some brain cells and toy around in a virtual sandbox at least do yourself the favor and wait for a sale

i was expecting a great game however when i started playing i came through to see multiple erorrs for a game which is so expensive i thought these problems would be solved along with this the game has very high cpu expectations to run the game features which are not required for games off the same demand which do not have these problems after 18 hours off downloading paying for a expensive game the last thing i want is a poor quality game which crashes whenever i pause the game and deal with multiple problems i do not recomend this game

i am done pretending this game is okay its not and people only like it because it is edge theft auto lets start with the online aspect its an abomination not because it is nopt a fun mode well i guess that is why its not fun because the community is well you thought the community on call of duty was bad this amps it up no one does missions they simply go and kill low level characters with miniguns and the other op weapons rockstar decided to give their jackass online community please either make the weapons open for everyone and quit making players have to level just so they can get some overpowered weapons they can get tanks and bomber jets which equals your game being ruined the community is the rudest i have seen since counter strike go sexism racism hackers and much more i shot a guy in the head with two clips from an ak47 before he died i was point blank shooting his head and it took two clips to kill him the hacking is real in this game you can no longer mod which was the only saving grace to this garbage franchise 310 for the online to me the story is the typical lets be criminals mantra and that crap i cant even beat the second mission its just uninteresting without mods 310 for the edgefest story rockstar was much edgy with this game dont buy this unloess you are max level online if you plan on playing online i know i will get thumbs down but thios game is just the online would be fun if not for a the community b the hackers c the trolls who do nothing but ruin the game for others and laugh like the subhuman mongrel they are d just not fun with mods being banned mods would of been the reason i kept this how do i end my eula i want a refund

is the game fun  yes but after a couple of years it just gets very boring kill and more killing to many kids on the pc version and no real skill players since most hide in a armored car like cowards then talk sh after they kill you this is also coming from someone with a 403 kd rating and thats all with real skill mind you hahahahahaha i didnt know being a coward hiding in a armored car or truck made any one good but okay ill let these little 15 years think what they will to those who say kd does not matter are the ones who suck bad or have a low kd rating so to feel better they say that dont be jealous please if you enjoy being a killing and having a car you can never afford in the real world his game is most certainly for you this is all for online and offline

edit rockstars weird behavior continues as i am banned for no reason what so ever no notice nothing banned from single player too no idea why i have been in a lot of lobbys with hackers but i dont know what is going on or anything im not angry just depressed that my 219 hours of grinding and frustration have just been undone for no reason rockstar if you see this rember that you where a good company untill you stalled the release for no good reason  aka fixing the game witch my screen shots show is false   i know there was a lot of hate on rockstar about some bans about mods or something i am not here for that i am here about something else i will be honest i was hyped very hyped so hyped that the moment i heard you could preorder it $50 when it came out i immediately played the intro and then online it was fun until i got my way up to level 50 then the hackers found out how to break the game and i was flooded with them most commonly teleporting around the map this got to the point were i decided i would record all of the scum running around gta v the thing that has  me off the most was one waste of data called rockstar admin he was the worst of them at first i noticed his name and did not like the idea of level one players worshiping him so i set up a max bounty called a mugger and also some mercs for good measure the only things that worked where the mugger and the bounty so i decided that i should probably check up on him on my tv of course this did not work because he turned off spectate witch i found a little odd as most high level players he was level 114 liked to show off their expensive stuff to as many people as they can i then looked at him on the map and saw that he went from the top of the map to the city in 3 minutes and that his character on the map was lagging heavily unlike everyone else i then went to see what was going on as he kept killing the same 3 people over and over again he had a tank on him again i know not hacks but still a  move i helped destroy the tank with the help of a buzzard he then climbed out of the burning hunk of metal and killed me in my kurama again not saying hacks just fishy with a minigun he then killed the rest of the players in his vicinity he then got on a highway getting ran over by 3 trucks 2 cars and 1 suv after 1 minute of this i get my lockon rocket launcher and shoot him he falls off a bridge and then teleports back up and kills me i then go into passive mode watching the endless flow of petty insults and swearing coming from him in chat i then record him get blown to bits from 2 stickys 3 air strikes 1 plane suicide and about a million bullets after this i decided to try to kick this guy and report him so far he has not been banned or anything rockstar please lock computers from running gta v after bans or something as this is getting more common by the day in all i do love this game to bits but i dont think rockstar is not taking hackers as seriously as they should also trying to explain to my friends who did not get gta v what was happening during the drug sequences in single player also is currently broken for me was amusing to say the least

 it does not start  steam launches the launcherexe which does close after approx 3 sec & nothing else happens  tested all that i could think off  3 different pcs  2 desktops 1 laptop  tested all the os available  tried 5 different launchers that i found all over the internet tried bunch of system settings disabled all non essential windows stuff enabled all crap as well played with virtual memory ram drive ssd hdd tried integrated graphics nvidia graphics amd graphics tried downloading via steam tried downloading via torrent tried downloading via rockstar social club  tried different monitors tried to create countless accounts with tons of settings tried to disable all non essential hardware tried launching the game via various launchers  gf experience cortex  tried command line bat file  tried to launch the game via wmvare emulated os tried to disconnect all usb devices disabled touchpad disabled keyboard tried all the possible options in nvidia panel did not bother with amd farthest i got launcher kept saying loading for 15 minutes then my mouse started to go slow motion & windows kept doing lot of weird sounds well done either rockstar or steam no wonder that people eventually decide to pirate stuff i mean look at it with steam its self i am forced to create a steam library and then have the game in bunch of subfolders moving the game around is difficult would it be so much to simply let me choose the path where i would install it without the steam library  i believe that all this crap is simply tied up to anti piracy protection but face it 99% of protections attempts have failed and the only people that got punished in the end were  are the ones that decided to pay money for your product perhaps this will never be heard by people that this is addressed to but i will take my mini chance

i am glad that the development team decided to go all out on this port and put themselves in the shoes of their characters watch as they rob you off your money when you realize that this game is as buggy as a rotting corpse you will get problems such as crashing due to failed initialization saving failed  rockstar services are currently unavailable and the classic request timed out then watch them help other companies rob you more off your money by requiring a ridiculous amount of memory that a poor mans 8gb ram cannot handle then if you feel like they havent molested your wallet enough watch them drain the life out of your credit card by selling you ridiculously expensive shark cards that will quickly go down the drain after buying your first high end apartment and luxury car or you can grind your way through the heists which is plagued with glitches random headshots troll eight year olds and lahhhggggggg but hey at least they promised to fix it later right right but if multiplayer is not for you then feel no despair for this game also sports a single player sandbox with an engaging story line you may play as michael de santa an american dude with a disfunctional family and rob people of their money or play as franklin an african american dude with a disfunctional family and rob people of their money but if those two feel too tame for you you may plas trevor philips a crazy canadian dude with no family and rob people of their money feel free to feel anxious about the heists that the game promised the players will be free to do however they choose then feel free to feel betrayed as those heists hold your hand through a scripted set of predictable events that you totally have no control over but if those heists dont do it for you there are fun side activities like parachuting racing and the extremely weird strangers and freaks side missions that feel like they ripped off from saints row annnd there are also some action packed activities like doing yoga towing cars for a living and watching movies by yourself look at all the properties you will only be able to buy at the end of the game when youre finally rich due to the money you get from all your heists unless you play the stocks market watch how rock star teach you how to make it big in the stock market by killing your competition destroying the products of your competition or downloading an app that tells you exactly what time to sell your stocks so join michael trevor and franklin in turning the city of los santos into a hell hole filled with robbery murder mass murder genocide homicide arson torture and drugs or create your own ugly character and join a million other people turn los santos into a hell hole filled with robbery murder mass murder genocide homicide arson drugs and laahhhhggg give us money v oh look im about to finish pacific standard 125m babyyy wait what failed initialization f f f fix this s you shark selling cs c sucking grds

not as great a game as gta san andreas which has much better writing mission design wit music and most other things gta v is designed more to be a makeyourownfun game with the story and missions being more filleresque that doesnt appeal to me as much as having the story be the main affair and made to be awesome i want to be taken on a detailed and exciting adventure not just be given the environment for one and have it be up to me to find something interesting to do with it minigames and freeroaming doesnt compare to scripted storytelling gta v feels like a greatly diminished design from gta san andreas i think that rockstar needs to shift its priorities and not expect to get a free pass on its story quality also with gta v the mission design has the player crisscrossing the map every next mission in the most annoying way in gta san andreas available missions would develop in an area close to the player in gta v the player has to backtrack long distances between each mission and the missions in gta v are bitesized largely deliverytype styled theyre often pretty boring gta san andreas missions are all kinds of different things and theyre pretty well thought out gta v is ok  but if someone wants exciting story and missions gta san andreas is a superior source and i recommend gta san andreas wholeheartedly gta v is pretty mundane in comparison

im not a fan of the 4 player heists at all too many people die too easily i cant get 4 people i know online and in the same heist at the same time either half the people i meet dont speak enough english to coordinate with anyway ive done all the heists at least once but i regret now not doing them more at release when there where more high level people doing them with pubs now its all low levels who insist on playing on hard then die a few seconds in most people i know have stopped playing entirely theres some 20  30 names on my social club list but never more than 2 on at a time and always the same ones i think this game was meant to suck actually in the same way that mobile games do this game isnt meant to be satisfying unless youre buying shark cards chasing the idea that if you buy everything in the game youll finally be having fun only if you get to that point you find its just as empty as before only now you get an attack helicopter that is near useless blowing up after one hit heists just make it where instead of needing shark cards you need people who take the game seriously but no one takes it seriously and most people stopped playing because of hacks lack of mission variety or just the overall grind and i think this is what r wants i think its by design they want those people who will drop $100 on shark cards the rest can play single player they dont care if they play online at all theyve bought the game and unless they buy a shark card theyre nothing but a drain on server costs from that point on i am not looking forward to gta vi anymore based on this the single player maybe not the online all i wanted from gta v was an online coop campaign just like saints row does flawlessly but in the gta universe they took out gyms cluckin bells and gang backup and for what for a dumb storyline about a jerk who has a jerk family a nobody who is just a rich nobody by the end of the story and a psycho who was believable right up until he started parroting about not calling women bad names but ing them then killing their boyfriends in front of them is totes fine also why is every black gta protagonist a complete punk cj spent 80% of san andreas getting dogged on by his friends and somehow still didnt see that they didnt like him frankin hangs out with crackheads and losers who do nothing but mistreat him are they afraid that if they portray a strong black man who isnt a punching bag itll be seen as unrealistic so much stupid went into making this game theres just as many touches of brilliance but for everything great theres something that makes me just want to uninstall and say  it

i have spent $60 pre ordering max payne 3 before it was released i spent $60 us on gta 5 i have never played either game and most likely i never will the problem i have isnt with the games per say it is with the rock star social club which is a fancy way of saying always online drm with a lot of snazzy social features at some point i must have logged onto my steam acccount at a close friends house and now somehow in a way that only rock star can explain my steam account is linked to his rockstar social club account that means that when i try to launch many of rockstars games i get one of two different errors depending on the game both errors can only be fixed by submitting tickets with many screenshots serial numbers and screen shots of serial numbers in my life i have bought 1000s of games many with very restrictive drm in my life i have also only submitted tickets on mmos i have neither the time nor the patience to waste more time other than the hours of research i have wasted on the internet looking into this issue than i already have i wont be submitting a ticket so that rockstar can be convinced i am not attempting to pirate their triple a multi billion dollar franchise i would rather spend my time playing any of the hundreds of games i currently have access to their drm if they have any is not so restrictive that their customer service gets overwhelmed when they launch a product and or patch a product this seems to be a problem only rockstar and ubisoft have

omfg where to start the heists these are overrated firstly there is a load of hype over the so called heists wtf does this actually mean no body in the world knows what the word means so you get sad nerd types who sit there bumming off the game thinking their hard knowing them they probably do get hard over this crap the heists are also very buggy the game froze no it wasnt because of internet or pc problems it was this crap game designed by the bloody scots i categorically refuse to play a  buggy game released 2 yrs too late that costs 40 when it is this buggy i also ing want to stab lester he is a fat  who has the worst car in the world whenever i shoot his stupid fin head it says i failed the mission to conclude let me set the record straight rockstar u may think that u are great but lemme tell u if u dont improve alot of people will prefer sucing bites to playing ur games i believe ur all tossers that should be sacked for being lazy i will not stand for this kind of wooly minded slip shot attitude justsayin

great game but the focus seems to be more around online play but i am yet to get that far  just an assumption based on finishing the single player game too many wasted areas on the map that have no point and are inaccessible ie the army base heist concept is amazing i just wish there was more of it kind of sums up the game waaaaay to short would i buy this game again yes but not for $100aud maybe $25$30 sorry beautiful graphics are one thing but they need to be backed up

another rock solid rockstar release  requires social club to play crashes almost immediately on launch  yeap  glad i paid for this   update the launch of this game was appalling huge amounts of different causes for crashes and different bugs causing eg incredibly sluggish fps on default settings the apparently needed mobile app still doesnt support pc a couple of days after launch the only official answer ive heard is that if you use anything but az az and 09 in your user account name they suggest you create a new user account which is ridiculous in itself some of the other causes for crashes have been solved by the community and eg on reddit you can find a decent list of suggestions however there still seem to be a lot of people for whom none of the suggested solutions work i finally managed to get myself into the game the crashes at launch seemed to have been caused by  my microphone disconnecting my blue yeti before launch got the game to launch and i could reconnect it once i was in the menu without it causing the game to crash again after managing to get into the game the gameplay turned out to be very good much more fun than i hoped for but still leaves room for improvement on the controls side the controls are incredibly complicated pretty much every key on the keyboard has some function assigned to it and the hints for using them are briefly flashed at the top left corner the first time you need it thus its easy to also miss it and get stuck trying to look for what key is for eg going into cover while the game has a lot of promise i cannot with good conscience recommend this to anyone until they fix their   this might take a month it might never happen ill try and remember to update this if that ever happens

so here i was expecting the game of a decade then after a 60 gb download with the anticipation mounting bam the thing doesnt get past the decodingupdating screens i demand a refund for this it isnt early accses and its one year late this is outragous either fix the damn bugs or dont bother i want my hard earned money back in my pocket youve already ruided this customers satisfaction dont do it for others ive tried well over 100 times to launch the game and tried these solutions to the windows account error to no effect

been waiting for this for a long time but i have to say that this time it disappointed me despite the numerous beautiful 4k screen shots of gta v thats been released earlier you might have gotten hyped for this game like me but after several developemnt delays the result is that the graphics are not even up to par with watch dogs which has been downgraded a lot since ive played ps4 version for awhile it is easy for me to say that the console version looks much better maybe i need a better graphics card or cards and a 1440p 144hz monitor rather than a single gtx 770 gpu and a cheap 1080p 60hz monitor build to fully immerse myself in this game but this time i only wish steam has refund policies because i cant see myself spending hours on this game getting distracted by those jagged lines and mozaiclike textures

now i am recommending this to people with pc that are built for gaming i tried this on two computers my laptop and my gaming pc graphics great for gaming pcs this has possible great graphicstextures on a great pc sadly for user on laptop sorry but youre out of luck until rockstar wants to update the game on my pc the map loaded fine occasional lag for a sec to reload the map amazing game for pc on my laptop geez talk about badgame occasionally crashes when trying to loadin fact crashes more than often the map will try to reload several times while you drivingmovinglooking out for your apartment see the thing is that they made a game without a low or very low setting maybe take away bushes gates certain details that just generally make it to hard for a laptop to work gameplay story mode overall gameplay of story mode is great being able to switch from characters and characters having different abilities being able to buy cars you love and just mess around playablity after the story okay i guess side missions and stuff to do afterward still can do whatever you want after the story is finished that is about it gameplay online great fun challenging gta online takes the best aspects of the story mode and puts them into multiplayer own garages cars tanks planes weapons etc being able to fully customize vehicles guns your character multiplayer is a struggle though inorder to keep up with certain stuff such as rentinsuranceammoclothingetc overall as a conclusion pc gaming computer is the best laptoplower end pcs is the worst

made pc gamers wait two years and pay $60 and the game runs like  1010 in detail the game is extremely vram hungry and has a few settings that eat up almost all the vram leaving no room for anything else making anybody with 2 gb or less vram play with ps3grade textures and minimal render distance if you do turn it up to high settings you will get 60 fps but with a lot of frame drops and if anything explodes or shoots at something the game will lock up until everything is over in conclusion overpriced poorly optimized overall the technicals of this game are very poor  you rockstar edit it appears that the game has a memory leak issue right now i will stick by my opinion until the leak is fixed

buy this at your own risk looks like almost all of the negative reviews are from people who cannot even play the game due to social club errors im currently still not able to launch the game after hours trying the possible fixes still no response on this issue from rockstar after more than 12 a day i rarely preorder and i sure do regret this one

i literally cannot even play the game i meet the system requirements i preloaded and went through the preallocation download and unpacking of the additional day 1 stuff i made a new administative user using the rockstar approved characters i updated my nvidia graphics card to the new gta v recommended driver i installed the latest rockstar social club version i verfied the game cashe i run steam as an administator and every damn time when i click play or play online my little blue icon turns green for about 45 seconds posts that i am in game and then turns blue again i would love to give the game a good rating but its kinda hard when i cannot even play the game after spending 3 hours after launch trying to get it to even run

hahawell overhyped 2k graphics are good i guess however they feel way too similar to gta iv the gameplay is very stiff it doesnt feel dynamic like the physics are bad actors unconvincing at best the start of the game at least is riddled with crappy cutscenes i got so bored of them that i didnt bother with missions after the prologue i just went rogue in the huge sandbox world i wouldnt recommend it at all at this price and i will never ever have hopes of a game as good as san andreas from rockstar ever again thumbs up on the first person though oh and the best part the best graphics and physics are found in the citys cats yes the cats are highly realistic unlike most other parts of this game

90% of the playerbase is pure cancer there are menus within menus within menus and when you want to do something it asks 3 times are you sure took me 20 weeks to install frame rate issues with an up to date pc everyone uses lockon for a cheap instant kill as soon as you spawn someone drivebys and guns your  down heists take 50 years to complete to start a mission you have to host it and invite people otherwise no one will join friends and job invite system is clunky and untraceable people with low rank have no chance since 98% of everyone who plays is rank 50 low ranks cant unlock anything so they have to grind through levels with a crappy pistol against badass merceanaries still no red dead redemption pc port 810  ign would preorder for 1000000 bribes

started up but after i got to franklin it crashed tried restarting 5 times continued to crash dont get this untill the bugs are fixed which should have happened in the 3 delays edit i re installed it and it worked fine for about an hour then crashed and the moment i got into the game after restarting it it crashed within 5 min

the game does nothing but run silently for a few seconds then crash without any output  not even an error message this seems to be a case where having special drm was more important than the game actually being able to run on a customers computer buyer beware edit an upgrade of nvidia graphics card drivers to a version released after the review was written solved the problem still the main point stands shoddy software enineering and problem was caused by the unneccessary drm component rockstar social club

i waited through the entire gta 5 console crash of 2013 dealing with the entire shhole show of online i waited with antisipation for the pc release knowing that i would enjoy it more and save more by using it on my pc over a console the day came today where downloading it was crap installing it was sh signing in to rockstars really nessissary social fart club to gain all my features crashed the game having to read that they found a issue on the release day that for some reason leaves the game unplayable because of the admin name i mean wtf how do you not notice that on nearly every pc that somehow ran past every single dev at the production facility and again having issues merging accounts because my account was locked after 2 i mean two attempts and then a reset i know for sure that at least steam has the right idea by offering a refund i am only taking it because i dont wanna wait another 6 months for rockstar to understand their problems and fix them i will say after another 6 months i will purchase the game again to get the full set of features i shouldve recieved on day one i will say not to buy the game just yet only so rockstar can fix their peice of sh they call the gta 5 experience see you in six months make a game that doesnt have such a big mistake you somehow overlooked after seeing all the money glitches on pc that can be avoided easily maybe i will torrent the game in a few weeks to see if i should support the company who once again produced a game that failed at launched just as much as the first time they released im suprised that they somehow skipped the near perfect release of the newer gen systems that went off far better than the older consoles i dont want to support a company who doesnt learn from their mistakes now for the people who actually got the game working i heard it was great but as a service to me and the other perople who are having issues please tell them that even though it may work its not gaurenteed to work for all now on the bright side it is a posssible 60 fps and 4k game that is what the team wanted and will include heists as well as all the other included dlc this makes the game good the specs to run the game at those quality is rather lower than what you would nomally think i also are planning to get the game later because im building a pc that can handle it better than my current labtop that runs most games at a good balance of quality and preformance the game if it works will not fail to impress anybody but i want to be clear of its current faults but i cannot forget that it really states notice some customers are experiencing issues installing or playing gtav due to a windows user account name error click here for details on how to workaround the issue wtf who doesnt notice the elefant in the room i guess th people who built a default pc to test their game contraz rockstar you lost a customer who was supported of this game who waited since day one of prepurchasing just to produce te same mistake fool me once shame on me fool me twice shame on you ill be waiting

had no idea how much leftwing garbage was in this game i tolerate a hell of a lot but i watched about 5 minutes of a fake tv show in this game and perused a couple of fake websites in the game and the entire thing is absolute leftwing satirical trashing of the right stephen colbert may have well been the games starring character i cant believe i gave these ers money aside from the leftist garbage the game requires 125 gigabytes of free space to complete the installation process that is outrageous

ive restarted steam and my pc my game is already preloaded and unpacked and activated on the social club and when i hit play it starts the grand theft auto vexe process but theres no game running after 2030 seconds it just crashes with the usual grand theft auto v has stopped working social club prompts me to restart in safe mode which only does the same thing i didnt pay $60 so i can enjoy not playing the game on release day i would have been better off pirating it instead of buying it legitimately apparently since then i would have been able to actually play it on release day

day one day fricken one doesnt work i would say this is unexpected but that would be a lie considering the issues the xbox version had my problem with this one is that year after a game has been out and you know they know what is required to get this up and running countless delays and 4 months sitting on preorder now its telling me my code doesnt work the game i have payed full price for not once but twice is telling me moment one of release that my damn cd key doesnt work brilliant so now i have to wait for support to uncrash itself which is going to easily be a week worth the time i would ask for a refund right damn now so i can buy it again but it appears that the social club also went ahead and deleted my everything so overall pretty much history repeating itself buy this game at your own risk a smart man would wait till they actually get this game fixed you know after the third ^%$ing time its been released

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful

i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

this game tries very hard to become a criminal life simulator but falls short of it the single player portion is fine with me i have almost no complaints about it except for the fact that missions dont pay for  the online is a different story loading screens will be an integral part of the online experience trying to do even the simplest things not involving things already in the map will take you to a loading screen in my almost twenty hours of online time almost five hours of it was stuck staring at a birds eye view of san andreas the loading screens would not be a problem if the actual gameplay made up for it in some cases gameplay is fun however most missions in the early hours of your experience will be steal a car steal an item or kill a person if you decide to make a lobby it will take a long time to wait for players who dont quit the first moment they get into the lobby this experience will be what defines the heists portion of the online if youre the leader be prepared to wait at least half an hour for one person i dont know if its the community or the design of the invite system itself but when i start up the game im immediately bombarded by mission invites to lobbies with no immediate indication as to what settings the lobby has if you want to find out you have to join the lobby endure a loading screen look quit if you dont want to play then endure another loading screen to go back into free roam when youre being bombarded by mission invites it seems to be sensory overload and is what contributes to the lack of players in my opinion even if f you make a full heist lobby youre still not in the clear yet an online mission uses team lives meaning that respsawns are shared among the whole team because of this system anybody who dies will waste team lives and bring the whole team down this is infinitely applicable for heists which automatically fail if a member dies without any team lives left in my experience ive spent 45 minutes in order to bring a heist lobby together only to eventually fail because someone died from something really stupid like suicide or using a motorcycle while it may be frustrating to fail a heist it is infinitely more frustrating if someone decides to rage quit after we fail once when that happens the whole lobby gets disbanded each of us gets to go through a loading screen and we go into free roam all of that happens without providing us with an option to simply let us stay in the lobby with three players whie we wait for another fourth person to join even though my experience with this game has been less than stellar i feel that my experience closely mimics my own real life experinces i have lived in socal my entire life and i would say that this game is one of the best simulators of south californian urban life out there it has everything from the numerous and meaningless activities hour long commutes to work and other activites to the excessively expensive products you can buy so if anyone would like to experience south californian life playing this game without violating traffic law murdering people and robbing buildings which should cover most exceptions would make for an excellent substitute while the game is pretty okay i would not recommend it if youre looking for a great online experience or a great movie criminal simulator

with some hours under my belt i have to change my mind on gta v being a good game to be honest its not its a pretty boring rehash of what used to be a fun game but which has been milked dry by now the story mode is alright the story is basically san andreas 20  the dialog is funny and so on the missions become repetitive pretty quickly and after a while you just get bored sure the city is well made but the amount of entrable buildings is very very low the online mode well thats repitiion coming out of every pixel you have a bunch of heists which are the only interesting missions but thats all some standard races with occasionally a funny twice when you race golfcarts some fedex misisons collecting item a then taking it to point x some ratkilling in there somewhere done then random people on a random server dont kill them too often and dont destroy their precious cars that respawns though youll get bad player points because you have to be a nice criminal meanwhile if you drive around aimlessly doing fall you are rewarded so yeah that was the part where i said to myself really in the end gtav is a game you can buy in one of gabes discounts its fun with friends but outside of that theres too much repitition to be a game youll spend hours playing unless youre some hardcore fanboy 2030 would be a good price for it

lets get one thing straight i love this game its loads of fun and very well polished the only problem is the online if you want to play online with your friends dont waste your money the curent state of the servers are pretty  youll frequently disconnect regardless of how good your internet is it makes it nearly impossible to do any heist roam the free world with your friends do missions dailies or anything online for that matter the game is great and is really well polished for pc however the servers are very unstable tldr if online is your main draw to this game wait until rockstar fixes their  servers

grand theft loading 5 review i am torn with this game first oft the worldgraphics is amazing the vehicles are fantastic the attention to detail is incredible however the loading screens are mind numbing you start the game thinking you are going to play online mode if you dont press anything at the menu it will automatically throw you in single player after a long load then after you click into online mode you wait again forever to find you are in a different server as you friends then you have to click join friends and wait another couple of minutes to actually play with them dont think its over there though because you will be constantly dealing with server splits you talk to your online friend trying for a while to find them and to come to the conclusion that you are all of a sudden on two different servers another couple of minutes joining their server again then if you go idle for more than 2 minutes you get kicked again from the server its depressing there is also the glitch where all my setting options are greyed out and unselectable now for some reason i cant join on my friends also im having another glitch where i cant buy ingame money just a spinning loading circle after i click on the card i want to buy i want to like this game i really do maybe after a few patches also i dont want to play with these console guys screaming and yelling in the voip is stupid buy this game when it gets patched and goes on steam summer sale krayzie77

enraging trying to play this game as it requires an outside login seperate from already logged into steam every time it crashes your computer you have to re log into this lame system rockstar support is among the worst i have ever encountered having your account locked after only a few failed attempts will render your game useless for a very long time dont waste money on this garbage rockstar social club is a cancer and a virus

i rarely write reviews but this game is in deep need of one with amazing gameplay 60fps and 4k i though this game would be great but its just a bunch of errors waiting to happen i cant play for 10 seconds with out a zlib fire error corrupt data files not connecting to social club server crashes game crashes this is extremely stupid and after a year of waiting since release i though i would have been able to play a good game maybe i should have waiting for gta 7 before all the bugs were out

the game is astounding in all respects however the online is a mess there is no division among servers so someone in america with a ping of 200 may be lagging around your server and that is only if you are successful in getting online in truth the system being used is so ancient and prehistoric that you will have spent more time loading than playing the game you want to set up a dedicated server load single player then load multiplayer then load a mission load the players into your mission load the mission itself and then when done load the end of the mission and load the server back up again usually invited players are kicked back to main menu and have to be invited again to the server when you play online and dont enter any events or missions you die by severe lag or get disconnected worst of all is the  where rockstar service is unavailable and you have no reason at all as to why you cannot connect but your friends might get online even though it says the services are unavailable its due to terrible online design and no literally no money spent on buying servers if you buy this game to get online just be aware you may never actually get online and all the  methods people tell you to do in order to get on will get you no where because this is all based on the terrible service from rockstar again another example of a game company that milk your money and tell you to go  yourself when their online service breaks down in truth steam should be removing this off their store as it only tarnishes their good reputation would love to continue playing the game but have been unable to for 2 days was playing perfectly fine for 3 days then this  its a disgrace and a waste of my time and money

how can i be writing a bad review yet have bothered to play the game for 35 hours on pc after playing 100s on the ps3 simple they borked the online quite badly for this version so far we have heists that fall apart if one person quits happens a lot can drop out due to poor network conditions if someone hosting has a terrible net setup and fails if one player does badly on their part of the mission we also have issues with game hacks and missions that have completely skewed out the value of money in the game saw my nephew run one player mission that awarded 2mil for a simple knife fight add to this that i have had ghost vehicle duplication in my garage and lost a tricked out motorbike worth $250k plus other vehicles when their game has not updated the garage correctly also first person mode  nice idea but the car dashboard views in quite a few vehicles could have been designed far better and make driving arkward and the interior detail is not that good plus its handling is a bit poor plus i also get to see some of their lowres textures up even closer  really theres some pretty poor texturing in many parts of the game not bad for a 60gb download finally they mentioned enhancements in the online features for the next gen and pc versions of which many have not appeared i have hung onto the game hoping they would fix this stuff but instead on my last contact to rockstar support after vehicle loss all i get is a response 10 days later asking me to try more things that i already tried when it happened and sending them in some videos of me doing it ok rockstar provide me with a tardis to go back and take these vids and i will gladly do it  i have played a fair bit since then and my garages have changed around i was about to give up on support making any contact it was all wishful thinking anyway on my part this game could have been so much better than it is its just a 60fps port with some graphic tweaks and some new glitches

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
