this is truly the definitive version of gtav it works so much better than when i tried it about a year and a half ago looks like they included lots of fashion updates in this release but expect it to take a while to unlock all the looks i must say i hate the story the characters and the liberal use of the nep word but i play online and dont have to deal with the losers on the cover or their script nep that

ive been meaning to write a review for gta for a while but i was unable to decide if my review was going to be for the sp or the online or a mix of both i mean i could talk about how the story was super fun the split between the different characters offered varied and interesting views on different issues or how modifying cars online and racing around pulling drivebys on unsuspecting people only to rage later when someone does the exact same thing to you is massively hilarious tonight i decided on a different path with a little help from a friend yo essy shout out dawg what gta is really about when you get right down to it and where youll find the most fun possible is if you go onliine find a server with a modder it isnt hard pretty much every server is infested with them like your average nightclub is infested with testosteronefuelled mindless sleaze machines if youre lucky and if the modder doesnt spend 30 minutes blowing you and everyone else up instantly over and over for some kind of perverse fun you might chance upon a modder who decides to do what one did for me tonight i paint you a scene of a lush forest a beautiful countryside slope filled with all that nature has to offer suddenly the redleather booted stripper army descends  everywhere guns in hands they are ruthless killing machines rockets fly and stripper bodies are flung through the air all is blood and pain you get into your insurgent unsure of what sick twist your life has taken your only goal survival but no your companion says he wishes to talk to a lone stripper to pursue peace so you pull up and watch as that brave brave man exits the vehicle and walks up to her suddenly theres a fist fight that redleather donned temptress is smashing your buddy all over the front of your insurgent whilst you grip your steering wheel and cry tears of pure blood why is the world so cruel what manner of evil had you discovered all you can think of in this moment is saving your sweet dear friend you slam your foot down on the gas and run that sleazy ho over bam she scoots a mile backwards into a tree her body surely broken high fiving your buddy you watch as he gets into the car your eyes widen in horror as you watch the broken stripper body stir back to life that demented hellspawn begins twisting herself back to her feet the redleather hiding her spilled blood as she gets up and starts running towards your car shoot her terminator you think as your buddy gets into the heavy mounted machine gun and opens fire its useless she runs away taking bullets into her back and leatherclad  as if theyre mere raindrops so full of horror are you that you cant even bring yourself to make a joke about the stripper taking loads instead you slam on the gas once more and chase her through the forest not satisfied until you run her over three more times stopping on the last to spin your wheels ontop of her back the only sure way to kill the termistripper menace great game 1010 would witness a stripper armageddon again screenshots available in my library

i usually dont write serious reviews but i will for this its a good game and will provide lots of long hours of entertainment i do really like it but im not going to talk about that you know all the good stuff so ill just tell you the bad stuff r seems to have gone a bit overboard on banning people if you mod at all you will most likely be banned if you dont mod you might still be banned if someone shoots money at you or frames you for modding youll probably be banned although it was publicly announced by r that sp modding was perfectly fine you will in fact still be banned this is because the main way of modding the game is through a dll file called scripthookv which basically allows any foreign code to be implemented into the game that puts other peoples security at risk r should have made the game more modfriendly to begin with the beautiful environment that r created is indeed beautiful but it isnt very destructive you might be going 100mph offroad and hit a sapling the size of a baseball bat and your car hit it as if it were a wall car customization is not what i thought it would be i owned midnight club los angeles and liked the car customization in that game gta v is nothing like that i suggest you watch some youtube videos on customization before buying things are pretty expensive im talking about online offline is easy to make money it takes time to be able to afford high end cars and apartments if you nolife a game then this is fine but if you just play every now and then it gets annoying never being able to afford the expensive things there are shark cards where you can pay real money for ingame money i dont really like this but i guess its better than paid dlcupdates i dont like the physics they arent realistic and its impossible to drift that gets on my nerves

saw trevors  in 1080p 60fps 1010 would watch again
recommended
fantastic i owned the game on xbox one and 360 and i thought it would be a waste of money to get on pc regardless i preordered it and took a risk i would never turn back i dont have the best pc gtx 750ti amd fx 6300 and 8gb ram and etc it runs beautifully i have it all set to high running a smooth 60 fps with textures set to normal i set everything to very high and leave textures on normal and i get between 45 to 59 fps never drops below fantastic game looks so amazing on pc and i would recommend to anyone it was well worth the wait and the added preorder money doesnt go unnoticed only thing i dont like is how we use our social club names not steam and i have my social club name as an old gamertag and i have to wait a year in between changes and it doesnt say how long i have left to wait doesnt affect the game in any way whatsoever fantastic

lots of funn

recommended
i didnt know until grand theft auto v that you can actually fail a game benchmark apparently you can 1110
recommended
what can i say its gta v on the pc and its better than its ever been i imagine most people have played this game at least a bit on the consoles by now so you know what youre getting into its the console version with a few extra features running at 60 fps and looking great while doing it little improvements go a long way on the graphical front everything has received a noticeable bump up from consoles and the system requirements are totally reasonable me and my friends have agreed that probably the biggest standout feature when it comes to graphics is the enhanced draw distance it sounds silly but it really does wonders when you see it in action the pc version comes with two main exclusive features the rockstar editor is an ingame recording and editing tool that gives you everything you could possibly need to film pretty much anything you want you have complete control over vehicles npcs time of day weather etc all while filming one downside is that you need to play through the story and some side missions to unlock every available npc for use in your film but definitely the thing that i love the most about the pc version is the custom radio station fill your station up with as many or as few songs as youd like and then its as simple as switching to it ingame while in a car and youve got a radio station filled with music of your choice in the options menu you can choose between having your songs play in sequence on shuffle or on shuffle with radio ads so it fits into gta i chose shuffle because i find the ads to be a little too long and a little too frequent on the custom radio station compared to the others by now you know everything else that gta v brings to the table considering its age so i thought it best to mention more pcexclusive features in this review recommended for sure
recommended
so far my favourite mission is  gta 5 has stopped responding
recommended
no bowling with roman 010 would not play ever again
recommended
killed a jew didnt get sued 1010 would nazi again

gta v is what you would except from the title highly detailed world great story cars and just about everything gta online has many issues though
recommended
it is gta 5 just buy it best game ever 
recommended
awsome game
recommended
this review took me almost 2 years to write and was delayed 3 times
recommended
game itself is awesome and contains a nice story to follow but once you step into the online world of gta youll regret buying it cause your fun will be destroyed by modders flying around and spawning  load of items around worth to be waiting for fivem multiplayer to be released to finally have a decent roleplay server
recommended
no bowling in this game 1010
recommended
 graphicslighting are definitely improved from the console versions fk you to the people who said it looked like ps3  i personally had no problems with the game launching try to update drivers if you are experiencing problems  smooth 60 fps is 1010  director mode is bae  buy this if you love gta 1010 42069 100100
recommended
after a long wait and many delays grand theft auto v has finally arrived onto steam its a great game that you can mess around on wreak havoc break laws obey laws buy stuff shoot stuff blow stuff up drive stuff fly stuff play with friends and many many many more features the graphics are amazing and i especially like the motion blur added to the pc version those with low fps 20  30 will be glad that motion blur is a thing the gameplay is fantastic i cant recommend another game as good as this one the controls feel right the movement feels right everything feels right the texturing is very detailed and so are the many small things in this game not a single thing is left unpolished in all of san andreas why are you still reading this review go buy the game already its worth the $60
recommended
love the game so far but my only issue is that my i5 4690k cant handle the game  might have to upgrade to the i7 4790k not looking forward to that but oh well this game is amazing on pc d edit cpu heavy game please advise
recommended

recommended
love gta v 1010 good graphics amazing storyline shame about the hackers online though example i spawn in in my apartment just getting drunk for a 5 star challenge and suddenly all players killed by what looked like a tank shell amazing gg rockstar gg indeed
recommended
this may be the second or third time you would buy this game my advice do it
recommended
was skeptical considering the price and never really played this series but this game was so worth it the realistic nonstop action was one of the things that got me addicted and i have enjoyed every second of it the story itself could be a movie if you are unsure about buying it due to the cost either wait a year for it to go on sale or just go for it you wont regret it ps make sure your comp can handle it first
recommended
i dont like this game anymore
recommended
grand theft auto v what els is thare to say about it hate the game well i dont care thanks rock star for 1 of the best games out thare
recommended
i highly recommend this game all the people who dont recommend this game just say its too expensive its worth the price online is super fun though there are some hackers but most of them are nice story mode is fun too if you dont have internet access all in all the graphics are great and its a well made game 1010 would sell my knife and buy again
recommended

likes   very good graphics  easy to play  rockstar act quick on banning cheaters  you can do almost everything sports killing etc  very good community system dislikes   too bad many players got banned from using mods dont worry r will fixed this in time  many pkers  no missions updates for too long i played the same missions over and over  new updates comes with overprices  many cheaters and rpexp hackers  sometimes the server crashed and separate you from your teammates after 600hrs of playing i should say to you about this if you really wants to buy it think again my friend it aint worth it until r do something with new missions hackers overprices updates and unstable server
recommended
this game is awesome great graphics not laggy and the multiplayer option is the best part
recommended
this game is purposefully mispelt brillant i still have caps turned on due to me activating the special ability for each character with the caps button
recommended
this games offers alot of replayability and really good graphics and it is also in my opinion the best open world game that is currently released
recommended
the best game

bloody blazin brilliant

why did i play gta v on pc i guess it was the graphicsor theahh i dont know that thingthat fpsyou see it on the console you alway get 30fps on the console ya know from thatthat gameplay experience be a pc gamer for once pc master race so i build a pc start it put my feet up and thought ill be a pc gamer like all the other pc gamer my pc it would be like the pc every hardcore pc gamer has we play highend games and sit in the room all daywell you know how it is i rated this game 1010 best port ever cheaper than console best gameplay experience still keep the nextgen wastedbusted sound if rockstar games can bring back the oldgen wastedbusted sound i would jump from joy
recommended
this game take from me the life
recommended
brilliant game good port to pc
recommended
step one buy gta 5 step two install gta 5 step three think about your life while your waiting for your game to install step four say goodbye to your life as you startup gta5 for the first time
recommended
i played gta v first on console so this review wont really be about the singleplayer story rather the pc improvements and other areas that fail ill have three sections one for improvements over the console version pros and cons improvements over the console gtav  better graphics obviously antialiasing looks a lot nicer no more pixelated car edges since there doesnt seem to be any on xbox 360  semimod support ill talk about that later in cons  a more mature playerbasecommunity you rarely find little kids screaming in their mics pros  decent story compared to gta ivs  multiplayer is fun with friends  online racing  tons of vehicles take gta ivs carshelicopters multiply them by three and add planes and tankstanks well one tank but still tanks  car customization was added back to gta  its relatively easy to get money  heists were finally added  r didnt bundle the game with microsoft live and made their own system intertwined with the social club cons  it seems to me that players who can buy shark cards can just afford everything in the game immediately microtransactions should have never been added  it is super frustrating to be a new player and have very wealthy higher ranked players chase you around in a tank or hydra and constantly kill you  modding r allows it in singleplayer but no cosmetic mods in multiplayer this makes absolutely no sense as some people require fov mods or they get sick so r either add a large fov slider or expect some angry customers  banning people for using mods in multiplayers  currently there is no multiplayer stocks system up the website is always down the verdict if you dont plan on modding the game and dont get angry at trolls and have friends i would say go for it personally though i bought the game largely because of the mods
recommended
this game is great and if you have it on one of the other consoles its definately worth the change
recommended
buy for single player briliant story full of content detailed to the extreme beautiful then you go online aweful community you will blow up boring karin karuma heist team mates nothing matters side note i would like to have online and single player have different review areas

hackers everywhere

imo well optimized running 4060 fps with a gtx 650 1gb gameplay was really fun for the first 100 hours then got kinda boring but still finding new fun things to do story is well made played it almost twice now
recommended
absoloutley addictive makes 3 hours feel like 20 min
recommended
im going to play this game for like my all life
recommended
love the game 1010

post edit i finnsihed the story mode when i did this reveiw i had around 17 hours and here is what i think after beating the game at around 4050 hours when this game first came out the game was extremely hype hungry and people were making ridiculous claims about their experiences with gta5so far from my experience is it was all overexaggerated hypei mean people were too sensational with the gta5 release and i can see that now after playing the game for a couple of hours and eventually beating the game pros graphics are ok but at times the settings can be a bit confusing feels like im actually playing in a replicated los angeles geography in this game is very impressive animations and cut scenes to and from each character is a really cool feature to look at it gives the game a sort of quality that isnt to be expected in a average video game completely unique and gives the game edge storyline so far is good felt like i was watching a series of tony soprano episodes with michael gave me a street compton gangster fantasy with franklin and topped it off with a psocopathic meth headdealer with trevor more possibilities to do with jobs and earning moneyincreasing stats and just engaging in other activities that you would have done in san adreas hearing the radio reminded me of older gta games how they used satire in a very creative sense however they tried carrying that on to other parts within the game and it got to a point to where it was very annyoing infact it looks like a rip off from what the developers of saints row did weed trip scenes of killing aliens and clowns so take that as both a pro and con cons few controls are  my issue was the aircraft controls so if you dont like the numb pad then do keybindings post edit its more than just flight controls many other controls are just flat out horrible rockstar did a really bad job with the mouse and keyboard control schemenot completely bad but very questionable control schemes performance is not so greatlet me itterate that the performance can be complete looks like lower end to mid grade pcs will not get to have so much fun with the game performancehell i imagine higher end hardware to have some hiccupsso far not really a good port from rockstar you pay 60 dollars for this game and rockstar pushes microtransactions that is the biggest con on this list very money grubbing and i really dislike that while i do recomend the game i still have to say that no it isnt worth 60 dollars if you havnt bought the game yet then you might aswell save your money and wait until it goes on saleeven though i give the game a 710 i feel as if im being slightly generous because i would rather rate the game around a 6 but im cutting rockstar some slack since the storyline is pretty goodthe map and the dynamic of a open world is pretty impressivedramatic improvments over the predecessor gta4 but for a game that costed 265 million dollars to develop and took an adittional 3 years to port to pc i expected much more from rockstarwhoever is making the decision behind this company has been doing a really bad ing job
recommended
definitely not as good as ign said but still dece

its been a long time coming but grand theft auto vs pc debut is a triumphthe rockstar editor is endlessly entertaining the online heists are with friends some of the most fun you can have in a multiplayer game the singleplayer story is an exhilarating series of increasingly absurd missions and it all takes place in one of the richest densest most atmospheric game worlds ever built the performance is amazing even for lowend computer can still run this at 30 fps on low the graphic are pheonmenal was delays worth it yes it was 100100 best game ever and always will be every gta series by far this has won the oscar award wait did i just say oscar award yeah i just did buy it now

you know gta always the best and this gta 5 just makes it better

recommended
great game too bad there are a lot of hackers in online mode
recommended
you more or less know what to expect when buying this game its gta the hackers arent a problem tbh most of them just go on rampages killing police or just teleport around dropping money just go in passive if you meet an aggressive one and join a large crew if you can so you can play with the crew as people there tend to not kill eachothers as frequently btw hackers are nice who doesnt like free cash
recommended
super great game still with 20fps and huge lags its super much fun

much violence many s very gta v wow

i dont get why people were  off the summer sale if you want it cheaper go to  they have gta 5 for like $50 i get that it said 25% off and they just added a shark card but thats better than just paying $6999 with only the game id rather buy it with the shark card for $6989 anyways also the new update did not ruin my fps im getting 3165 fps on very high settings which is really good for me 30 fps is great for me its playable this game is magnificent and so fun with friends or family if you do not have the game i suggest you get it

103000 too many hackerst though

singleplayer  amazing story  singleplayer mods  lovely open world sandbox well get to that later multiplayer  12 year olds death threats  hackers  shark cards  about as sandboxy as having your  welded to the inside of your  crack whilst eating a 7 year old fermented dog turd and sniffing lines of powdered uranium and listening to justin bieber do a cover of bohemian rhapsody with one direction as backup singers all in all its ok
recommended
if you dont have this then you should die
recommended
i can review this game without actually owning it because steam revoked it from my library while i was playing and told me i have to buy it again for 40 if i want to continue playing the game is very good though
recommended
 better controls than gta 4 check  better optimized for pc than gta 4 was check  awesome and crazy heists check  super fun online gameplay check  finally on pc check  returning to san andreas hell yeah if you love the gta series then this game is fanservice for you

why this game has almost perfect score because r gives you new free dlcs without charging your real money a really nice level system up to 8000 levels the modes ehhh no comments because they are too awesome why its not so perfect because cheaters are still out there and they dont affraid to use them because theres no vac ban you only get ban by r for a limit time r should give them a vac ban so this game can be perfect
recommended
1010 amazing port great perfomance great gameplay & in other words a master piece
recommended
playing on normal graphics causes fps drop while playing on high graphics fixes the fps drop good job on this one rockstar
recommended
such an amazing game even if you just plan to play online with friends i hope we get more dlcs ones that include some more hiests and such the story is something you dont need to rush it will always be there to do as for the online banning people are getting mad about if you wanted to edit your game and get the ban thats on you rockstar doesnt allow modding now im sure this might change in the future but for now just accept it gave it a 9 10 because the first few updates seem to bug crash my game each time 910

sads  that i cant play thisbecause idk waht is dis black screen trouble  but its a yes recc for meand this game is kewl i meani enjoy it everytiem i watch le fqiing vids sads that my laptops arentt strong enough to play this

one of the best games released on pc to date optimisation for pc is superb as for all the people who are writing negative reviews they have no one to blame but themselves for the bans i have seen only a handfull of hackers but they dont bother me all of the kids will be caught in the end fantastic game and well deserved 96100

single player  story mode 910 its the funnest gta game yet for me theres sooo much to do & the game looks great with a nice attention to details multiplayer  online 010 if you dont have an armored kuruma or a tank you will die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die and die  the community is so bad making it worse than the league of legends & dota 2 ones combined everysingle person you meet online will be an  trying to kill you the missions load for a long time & they load each time you exit or join theres also a lot of players who ruin heists or are greedy enough to ask for a lot of money in the end justdo not play online its not worth it unless you meet decent friends to play with in a private lobby

do you want to play team deathmatch it has it do you like racing it has it do you like flight sims it has it do you like tennisgolfdarts it has it do you like driving over pedestrians and blowing up other vehicles just causing general chaos you can seriously this game has everything you could want in a game i havent even touched the story mode yet and not even sure i intend to the freedom to go do what you want online is amazing if you want to log on and do missions to make cash you can if you just want to drive around in sweet looking cars rob a store and then evade the cops yeah thats pretty fun too a really cool aspect of the game are heists the heists are very similar to payday2 each person has a job to do planning is done and theres a huge score at the end leading up to it are setup stages that make you some cash as well theres also a survival mode that is really fun as well survive 10 waves and you make 30 grand pretty sweet especially if you like wanton destruction sticky bombs are fun no seriously theyre so awesome nothing says enjoyment like casually driving down the road and nonchalantly tossing a sticky bomb on the bus watching the driver freak out and drive away frantically into a crowd of traffic or if youre lucky enough pedestrians blow that thing up and let the chase begin you can place bounties on other players which adds for quite a fun time if you can manage to evade the bounty you get to keep the cash placed on your head i was a huge fan of saints row the third its one of my favorite games ever gta v shares some similarities but blows it away in every comparison and is definitely now one of my favorite games ever if not my favorite i didnt really have any intention on getting the game until i watched some of it on twitch my fear was that it would be just another  console port its far from that its a great thing to see that r took the time to work on the pc version and get things right fortunately i had some gift cards that i used to knock the price tag down all said 5 wanted stars out of 5 after playing it for 80 hours i can say its still well worth the 70$ price tag

i do recommend this game but the way that modding the game is handled by rockstar is stupid and oversensitive theyll ban you from multiplayer because you want the fov to be higher in first person be warned that all they seem to care about is selling their ingame money for notingame money also if rockstar cant connect to steam tough luck youll have to wait until it can to play at all

as you might have already heard this brand new 2 year old game is just fantastic  great story although a bit short if you ask me with loads of mission variety  shooting driving flying diving boating parachuting stealth you name it gta v has it also there are a ton of cutscenes that have great dialogue writing voice acting and are always entertaining and fun to watch  great main characters never mind what crazy people say trevor is the man hes pretty much the only gta character that acts like a psycho both in cutscenes and ingame you know when youre making him murder innocent people with a rocket launcher as you do michael is pretty great too a lot of his missions are wacky in a sitcomsoap opera mashup kinda way franklin is a bit too average in my opinion but he has his moments and a puppy  amazing graphics never knew 360 and ps3 games looked so damn good   this game is so full of small teeny tiny details for example when youre playing in third person and you pull out your phone it shows it in the bottom right corner of your screen and while youre navigating the phone menu you can see the tiny phone screen in your characters hand actually displaying the same stuff you see on your bottom right and when your character receives a call and answers it the phone lights up his face as he puts it up to his ear its small details like these that make gta vs version of los santos come alive  car sounds sit in gtas version of a lamborghini or ferrari switch to first person view and enjoy the engine sounds  danger zone fortunate son danger zone carry on wayward son danger zone gimme all your lovin danger zone1  runs fine on average poor mans gaming hardware  660ti i7 920 @3ghz 8gb of ram can squeeze close to an average of 60 fps with everything turned up to highvery high if you turn the grass down to normal if not lock your fps to 30 turn up the grass and enjoy your ps4 game that is of course if you dont get struck by the stuttering bug which they may or may not fix who knows or you know if your game doesnt start these problems are plaguing a lot of people so keep that in mind before throwing money at rockstar online is a thing im not a big fan of online games unless they are proper mmos this game is not an mmo but i wouldnt recommend playing gta online alone as in with random people cause it just might bore you to death it may not really be a perfect game by any standards but it gave me everything i wanted out of it and more its just a fantastic open world game and instantly one of my favorite games ever  1010

do i really have to explain this well ok i have never been a hardcore gta fan multiplayer samp was always the best part about it gta v singleplayer the story is not interesting a slightest bit the 3 character approach is kind of cool though but you can definitely have a lot of fun playing through it the 100% checklist adds additional motivation to do everything if you are a completionist like myself gta online its not as good as samp is  no custom gamemodes scripting etc  a ton of things to do but the loading times are killing it after each mission you will be sitting for 30 seconds staring at los santos from above not knowing whether the game is still loading or its just stuck official mod support  steam workshop support  for gta v and gta online would make this instantly better but alas rockstar social club while it is easy to set up and not to worry about it later a steam integration would have worked better especially for online in conclusion its a great game for a gta game but it is not something spectacular

edit the problems appear to be already fixed for me on the first day^^ well that was fast singleplayer  graphic could actually be better but still all over the place considering that the world is so big  realistic characters they are not normal persons for sure but it never feels like rockstar is forcing the characters to develop their behaviour  very interesting stories which are very well integrated into the gameplay and the environment during the missions the player has to interact with the world a lot but i never feels much scripted like in other games also the gameplay has a lot of variety  a smoothly and naturally acting world that takes place at the east coast of the usa  great humour although the game can be quiet brutal or radical at some point see trevors behaviour ^^  it actually made me laugh a lot of times and surprised me with creative ideas for missions etc  a lot of radio stations presenting nearly all kind of music directions  a lot of things to do apart the missions even just the tennis mini game is better than some other games out there ^^  revised wanted system the police and the whole system now work better although you could also argument that the car chases now take too long and that the police shoots too good but even then i still find the new system better than in older gtas  new skills and such for your character basically you can have some sort of bullet time for shooting but also for driving  last thing makes driving so much easier for people like me who shoot better than they drive ^^  more content such as cloths cars etc than ever before  way friendlier placed save points  a lot of settings to modify the controls etc  however i would like to have the older weapon circle system the new one seems to be not that optimal for pc

i never thought i would say this but dont buy this game until they fix it i remember reading a question and answer session with rockstar where they confirmed that they will allow mods with gta 5 would this not be considered false advertising as they said that it would support it officially then they take it away definition false advertising  false advertising or deceptive advertising is the use of false or misleading statements in advertising and misrepresentation of the product at hand which may negatively affect many stakeholders especially consumers many people only bought gta 5 pc for the mods me being one of them i already own the game on consoles and bought it for the mods on pc many people building whole new pcs to play it on pc now they take away mods idea rockstar offline mode  allows players to make offline sessions and mod them as they see fit in this mode the player would be identified as having modified content in their game and be allowed to play in this lobby owner of lobby can set starting cash for players joiningdefault 0 and would be able to ban people from their servers none of the cash earned in this would be put into gtaonline just into gtaoffline any modders found joining gtaonline would be bannedcheaters pool this would also allow people to make role play sessions and whatever else they wanted to make you can obviously tell who has modified data in their game so would this not solve the problems at hand and one last thing let us mod single player we are going to do it anyway so by banning us for it is complete bs

launch issues as expected seems okayish optimized otherwise on first glance you need nearly double the final installation size to unpack the game at least currently so ensure you have around 120130 gigs of free space instead of 70 make sure your user name doesnt contain any special characters for everybody getting the launcher b e x 6 4 crash  launcher stopped working try to disable your graphics card in device manager start the game then kill it now the launcher remains open detecting that the game aborted and it now doesnt crash when you reenable the graphics card then simply press retry on the now functioning launcher and you should be able to enjoy the game the servers for online play seem to have the usual launch issues though recommended but keep the above issues in mind at least if you intend to play in the next few days

i love this game and ive waited for the pc version ever since it was released i think it was well worth the wait which is why im recommending this game however i do not support rockstar and their current decison to ban everyone for the use of mods even in single player im aware that a large portion of people who bought the game intending to mod the hell out of it but instead are just getting banned in my opinion this doesnt ruin the game because i enjoy the game the way it is but mods make every game 10x better and i can only think to myself damn rockstaryou ed up in terms of the game itself its almost everything ive wanted in a game optimization this time around compared to gta iv is a lot better im amazed how well this game performs on both my desktop and my midrange gaming laptop at max settings when looking at the graphics im amazed by every single aspect it has to offer minor details such as puddles when it rains the glow and light pollution given off by the city at night from a distance etc this game has so many little features that didnt need to be added that make the game an even more immersive experience when looking at the story even though im about 35% in as of writing this review i actually enjoy it while i prefer all the opportunites mulitplayer has to offer with its minigames character creation and ability to play with friends i still find myself enjoying the storyline and being hooked on it i admit the first hour was a bit boring but when it started to pick up it picked up and got damn good its not often i find myself wanting to pay attention and keep playing the campaign in a freeroaming game as of the current rockstar modding banhammer controversy if you want the game simply to mod the hell out of it dont get it otherwise youre just going to be  off and hate a great game because the developers are being shitelords if youre looking for a game with possible modding potential in the future or dont care and want to experience the game as it is which offers a great storyline as well as one of the best multiplayer experiences get it empty your wallet let it all out you wont regret it boner10

quick summary another triplea open world hit from rockstar games purchase verdict yes points of interest surprisingly still playable on semilow end computers im running at around 30 fps on a laptop with an intel i54200u cpu integrated graphics and 8 gb ram of course lowest settings but still looks decent massive amounts of cosmetic customizations from clothes to cars to much more plenty of ways to earn money and experience in the game including races death matches heists golf and more hours worth of ingame movies tv shows and music radio mirror park anyone hilarious and witty dialogue descriptions and more play headtohead or cooperatively in online play very active modding community for offline play  recent mass amount of hacking and modding in online play can ruin experience 
recommended
very good game if you can run it xd

great game the campaign has a good story and utilises the free roaming aspects of the game the online is a great feature with friends although playing with strangers can get a little repetitive with overpowered players constantly killing you the pc graphics arent great although still look pretty awesome on the settings im playing on although im basically on high for everything apart from textures which i have on medium the gameplay is incredibly similar to max payne 3 its basically the same game but without the flashy cutscenes and with a different story i like the way the cutscenes arent prerendered as this helps optimise them for your graphics settings overall really good game pc version is a lot better than my xbox 360 version

grand theft auto v is a game which takes place in the fictional pacific oceanic city of los santos and has two primary game modes storyline and online ill give a review for each type as the two are profoundly different and impossible to review as a collective gamethey even have two different titles gta v and gtaogrand theft auto online grand theft auto v gameplay there are three main playable characters in grand theft auto v michael trevor and franklin michael is a former bank robber from the east coast whos got a sweetheart deal with the fibgta speak for fbi trevor is a sleazy trailer park criminal and michaels best friend from south los santos franklin is an exstreet gangster the storyline switches between the three and you get to play as each one in segmented instances as the story progresses and tends to lean between the three in alternating levels of importancemeaning when trevor becomes more valid to the story than the other 2 youll play as him etc  however it is possible to switch between character after you encounter them allowing you to have one as a main and only play as the others when the story requires it it is a new type of gta gameplay and frankly i enjoy it but i dont enjoy it as much as i did with san andreas in san andreas you were stuck with playing an african american street gangster true but you could change and customize him as you pleased making him fat thin muscular weak swagalicious clothes or a bum you had options in gta v you dont get the same level of personalization in the storyline and instead have 3 generic unchangable characters to choose from that would be a problem for me but gta online fixes that right and proper which is why i dont mind it in the slightest if i were to give grand theft auto vstoryline a score id give it 8 stars out of 10 above is all of the positive but what about the negative grand theft auto v has the problem as every gta v game has and that is that the storyline is always the same generic issue its people doing crime to get money because money is great thats it the story is paper thin and irritatingly simplistic grand theft auto online grand theft auto takes everything that storyline has and personalizes it you get to create and name your own character and you then get lumped into a game session that can each house 30 players max each everything is 100% public even the voice chatitll either be deathly silent or itll be an ear deafening cacoffiny of people talkingyelling at eachother at least its easy to leavejoin other sessions to find one more suitable for your preferences storyline the story behind gta online starts right after you make your character you fly into los santos on an airplane and meet with one of the main characters from the storyline who takes you through a tutorial to show you the ropes after that youre essentially on your own and are cut loose to make your own way in the world will you be a racer a bankrobber a sports nut or simply a psychopath who kills everyone in your path it is entirely up to you to make your own story gta online just gives you the means its your job to make it work gameplay gameplay in gtao is much the same as in gtav but its much more brutal if youre simply driving down through the street you might suddenly find yourself exploding for no reason and dead instantly only to realize that youd driven over another players sticky bomb and they had remotely detonated it when you were close gta online is a merciless dangerous place far more dangerous than the single player because almost every player wants to kill you especially if you get a bounty put on you then everyone wants a piece of your  there is a way to fix this though and thats in the form of the passive mode after you die or during a game you might decide that youve had enough of pvp and dont want to be killed by other players you can activate the passive mode after doing so you get a ghostly appearance and can no longer take any kind of damage from other players even the vehicle you enter will get a ghostly appearance and will be impervious to any player interaction youll even drive straight through other players the game mechanics is separated into 3 different obtainable currencies reputation pointsrp gtavs answer to experience points like in every other mmo style game out there you gain rpexperience until you get a certain amount which then levels you up gta$ the games actual monetary currency this is by far thee most important thing in the game as it allows you to buy cars apartments planes helicopters foodfor health ammoarmorweapons and everything generally required to increase your utility and ability to adapt to any situation the game will throw at you it is the only one of the 3 currencies able to be bought for real life money but it is exceedingly expensive gta$8000000 costs us$100 job pointsjp the least important obtainable currency it is not really a currency but more a means to choosing a winner in player vs player scenarios say two people kill the same amount of enemies but one maybe has a higher accuracy ratingfewer deaths than the other that person will get more jp for the mission than the other and thereby win eventhough they both killed the same amount of peoplecrossed the finish line at the same time this currency resets to 0 after each job cons the community can be extremely horrible full of angry russians and asians who cant speak a lick of english or mlg420blasturmomm9 worshipping  whom are also abound trolls are everywhere and are extremely obstructive and irritating hacking is a risk there are still hacks that are unfixed such as infinite money and invulnerability people are getting banned but not fast enough and its a growing issue bugsglitches you get stuck a lot and the only fix for this is to force exit the game through the task manager and restart the game this has happened to me 3 times in a week once when entering my garage from outside once when entering my apartment from outside and once after finishing a versus mission sometimes if the internet is lagging a bit someone might become invulnerable while being able to kill you because the damage doesnt register for them loading screens are crazy this is an issue i hope they fix soon there is a loading screen literally no matter what you do even if you join a lobby for a mission and then leave right after you dont just go back to where you stood before no you have to go through a second loading screen and these loading screens take longer if you go into the steam overlay meaning you are forced to sit there and wait for minutes at a time to actually play instead of being able to sit and chat with friends in between universal stuffstuff that applies to both graphics are extremely demanding if you dont have a top of the line pc expect everything to have to be on mediummedium is gta vs name for lowest  and still have some problems with lag physics are way better in this game and driving bikescars is far more realistic this can be both a positive and negative experience driving in heavy rain is extremely difficult and takes a lot of practice to get right i find it a positive thing but ive heard a lot of complaints that its actually too real all this considered i still recommend the game as it is despite the occassional issue an extremely fun game and more than worth the price tag if you enjoy the gta franchise this one is a must have  leagues better than gta iv

the advantages the game is beautiful pictures single player different from the original to get a sense of excitement is very different from the original a good content writing games and the voice of a character in the game is made out well the city of los santos the citys up to you to customize it with a mission to rob the rich and exciting disadvantages there are some scenes of the game to show the error time is moving much single player mode also do not communicate well about what the various vehicles

besides from all these negative reviews about modding grand theft auto 5 is an excellent game originally a tps can now be played as a fps game although this game originated for consoles before it still handles very well for what there using but besides from all this here are its top 5 pros and cons i played this game on xbox360 before pc top 5 pros 1  it is a sandbox styled game focusing on making you move around the map with the open world environment 2  the game for most is very beautiful and stunning for a game that did not originate from pc 3  the game is smooth and quite easy to get use to 4  there are a lot of things to do 5  you can create things ranging from races to death matches or if you want create a gta5 movie top 5 cons 1  as i heard a lot of people whine about is that it is very picky towards the mods you can have 2  optimized but not to every everyones standards 3  can be buggy and glitchy but hey it just came out 4  good amount of connection problems towards other players 5  the community before people would lend a hand to others but now its more of a open world pvp ground the game though for pc is still pretty young and rockstar has more than just this game to worry about and with the fact that everyone is always hating or being rude to rockstar im surprised they did not give up yet good job r after all that here is what i would give it 8  10 recommended for people that have a good computer as you wouldnt be disappointed thank you for your time here is my social club rockstars social area httpsocialclubrockstargamescommemberliveforlime

re reviewed with 170 hours played as always great efforts in visuals and audioi loved the quality of the story & voice acting but i was annoyed that we still play dumb protagonists that get told what to do by government agents yet again depsite taking on merrywhether a sht tonne of cops gangsters & street randoms we still have to put up with distressful family members whom dont appreciate sht and we still have to follow the story rockstars way because they dont create alternate story arcs which i wish they would do eg in iv i wanted to support faustin and kill dimitri now that i have completed the story twice  allowing me to try the alternatives to the heist a option b option and seeing alternative cutscenes based on who i was controlling i am starting to see past the graphicsaudioand map size the main things that bugged me during my enjoyment of the story mode are really showing and once again they are the things that bugged me in previous titles gta relies heavily on scripts and whilst this was excusable on last gen its not in my opinion now examples of scripts instead of active ai coding or car physics is traffic trolling there are so many cars that spawn in front of you and are scripted to meet you head onside on its the same scripting in a mission in which you are chasing an npc in a vehicle and they are scripted to always be in front of you causing some very weird animation & speed up if you catch them up  the lazlow mission is a fine example of this cars in vinewood hills often appear in a driveway and pull out in front of you so fast that its simply not a random occurrence its been scripted the speed they come out of the driveway and grip to turn is so high due to the nature of the car trying to meet you head on you can see this when on coming traffic seems to divebomb at you resulting in many npcs vehicles going off their designated line to hit you sometimes its so bad they will drive over to the wrong side of the road to hit you this is a police chase script then there are the police once again programmed with mega grip top speed and acceleration under certain circumstances when a police car is in chase mode behind you they have mega speed and a weird speed boost ram option no matter the speed top or cruising they get to ram you hard its a nice feature but its scripted its not an ai doing it you can break this script by turning swerving sharply and the police ai looses that script and you can quite often see it become a normal car with loss of grip sliding off out of control as the mega speed grip script it had has goneit regains it again soon enough when it gets back to chasing behind you again after it has magically caught up the tyres being shot out is another script that i hate again the car receiving that burst tyre is scripted to turn the wheel overriding any control you or the npc has rathe than physics causing your car to loose partial control due to your gripfrictionbalance being altered at speed due to a loss of a tyre the very same turning is seen in drunkbong stoned mode the script is so bad that even at legal city driving speed 3040mph in the uk the tyre lost still scripts the car top widely turn your wheel which wouldnt happen because the speed travelling doesnt upset the car balance when a tyre is blownit would simply grind to a slow halt tyres being shot out in police chases are often scripted it seems to be the police helicopters that trigger this in so many cases i have evaded ground forces and am using the hillsidesmountains to lose the air support as i lose the chopper and it goes into old a pensioner eyesight mode my tyres get shot as the police rifles are quite distinct in volume and sound effect you know you heard it this i passed off as lucky shots for the first few times but then it started to happen underground i would evade police air support by using the swere system in the citythe best way to get rid of 6 stars btw again as i enter the tunnel and the police physically cant shoot at me i hear the gun shot and tyres gosometimes i have lost two tyresyou cant blame latency here as this is sp mode this is either scriptingor police can shoot through objects such as rock and stone lets talk about wanted system still in 2015 gta v has the same wanted system that it had in iii as in its all designed around you and the police ignoring the fact that the city is full of people the wanted system targets you specifically the worst and most obvious case of this is using a suppressor not only does this ignore the entire stealth statistic you have maxed out it ignores the fact that suppressed gunshots are impossible to identify from rangeto the observer a bulletgunshot is not heard only the sound of the projectile hitting something is in close proximity you may hear the odd noise the gunshot makes as the blast is absorbed by the suppressorand the average citizen wouldnt know what that is with this in mind the you vs the police mode kicks in and your treated to a 1 star despite using a suppressor out of sight of civilian or police line of sight why did rockstar not bother to script ranged suppressor shots to be reported as suspected gunfire which in turn triggers the same script that using 911 police option does this option makes a police car turn up in your zone in a passive mode until it sees a crime another thing that bothers me is the npcs lock on mode when shooting at youits cheap its done because they dont have to code much obvious examples of this are the noose members hanging of the noose suvyou can ram the suv and spin it out of control but the gunshot aim still hits youanother example os when a police heli is going down the noose member in the back can still hit you despite the heli going down at speed making a perfect shot to hit you impossible i get why they do this its all about time vs moneyim sure that there are guys within rockstar that dreamwish they could improve this stuff but their higher ups dont allow them to also gta always sells in mass and the game doesnt really have any competition that would force them to improve what i have mentioned here these things break immersion even worse when your not absorbed by the story these are the things i wish to mod if a tool created allows methese minor details are whats left over when sandbox mode comes to pass story mode donelweft to do what you want mode and because the above i mentioned is lackingand or never changes the game becomes really dull and my reliance on mods kicks in which isnt all bad but it is a shame that only some previous gen mods get brought in as new ideas for the next gta rather than most of the good ones excluding the goofy script mods

grand theft auto is the best and fastest selling game of all time that is actual fact this game has broken world records for a reason those parts aside let me give you my experience with the game i played the original gta v on xbox 360 the day it came out and followed up playing gta online when it was released later both games might as well be two seperate games are fantastic the story mode is rich with excellent dialogue and amazing characters you never know what you will hear next or what might happen this is a game of satire if satire is something you are not a fan of or hate crude and vulgur humor this game will never sit well with you if you are okay with satire prepare for it to be cranked up to 11 as this is the biggest amount of satirical humor you can find no one is safe from rockstars plethora of jokes and jabs the actual game play itself is beyond solid compared to the original gta iv made on the same engine 7 years ago this game stands tall the driving is a tiny bit arcady but it is much more realistic and responsive than the sluggish and oil slicked tires of gta iv driving shooting is much more solid as well targets snap to much more fluidly with more precise control on where you wish to aim as opposed to gta ivs snap and  dragging of the reticule back to the center of mass flying is also solid and even much better than it has ever been before vehicles feel like they have weight to them while flying and take realistic damage specific parts of vehicles or aircraft can be targeted to cause precision damage such as shooting off the rotors of helicopters or taking out the engine of a jet speaking of flying there is turbulence now that is reduced by your flying skill which gives incentive to level it as well as enjoy the more responsive flying style planes can even stall if they fly straight up customization in this game is huge each character can wear a vast array of clothing and haircut or tattoo options and every vehicle can be customized with unique colors compared to gta iv its laughable how drastic the difference in gta iv you couldnt even customize cars you could get their color changed but it would be randomized what color you got so you had to repeat the process needless and there was nothing else thats it gta v has options a plenty from performance enchancing to many cosmetic changes as well as protective such as armor and bulletproof tires overall single player for gta v is an amazing experience and with the new first person mode replaying the campaign and just using fpm is an entirely different experience gta online is vast environment with so much content that i cant even cover everything i want to say about it here if you are truly interested in gta online go check out my guide duo vandals ultimate guide to gta online on the guide section and give it a rating if you enjoyed it ive been playing gta online to this day since 2013 and its the best online experience you can have

this game is quite self explanatory it doesnt need a review the gta series has given players the freedom they desire the ability to do just whatever you like storywise gtasa was better but the fact that v has three main characters more than makes up for this one hour of gta accidentally smashed a cat got rammed by a policecar car randomly exploded tried to fly a chopper upside down failed blew up my friends after exiting the strip club one stole my car nearly finished the final heist n00b dies and s it all also  endless references to real life counterparts with a hilarious touch just to avoid copyright issues  genious trio of main characters  level of detail is over 9000  car tuning is back cons gta online  grand theft loading a classic everyone should own endless fun with comrads and a polished singleplayer storyline

this game is a masterpiece dont mind all the coneheads crying because they used alterations online to all the  crying about being banned its simple do not use mods online you can easily remove the mods the same way you easily installed them if you think a company as big as rockstar and with as much talent is going to let you use custom content in the world they have created for you to play in you are sadly mistaken and obvously paid the consequences to say you no longer recommend a game because you went online with alterations is childish this game is great the graphics are great and so is the gameplay people wonder why rockstar is so hesitant to release for pc and when they do this type of  happens i use mods but im not a conehead who would try to use them onliine and get an unfair advantage i simply remove them and play online and when i want to mod it up again i readd them i bought this game 3 times 360 xbox one and pc the pc version is the best

this game truly is the ultimate version the way i see it far more superior than its console versions x360one & ps34 graphics are gorgeous the city is beautifull the story is excellent wildlife is fantastic as well as blaine county and trevor is crazy as hell but of course there are a few flaws such as the need to add more bars and strip clubs or the ability to enter bars such as tequilala or the other minor strip clubs around los santos period also would be nice if firstperson could be improved a bit oh and its been so many gtas allready and not a single one has added the ability to simply sit down on the benches out in the city and just watch people mind their own business except gta iv but with mods only and i think thats it great game r i love it
recommended
i love rockstar for gta online we need more innovation and heists

tldr the best gta game so far the only not so great aspect of gta v is the design of the city some parts feel very bland and forgettable but this is still not nearly as bad of a problem as it was in gta iv version of liberty city i would say gta iii and san andreas are still the best in the series in this regard with vice city and gta v being right behind them i guess when you let developers use mechanics like gps navigation they get lazy and do not give their best to make every corner of the city unforgettable like they once did nearly everything else is in my opinion spot on well you can escape from police a bit too easy but on the other hand if escaping was to hard this would probably soon become very annoying and interfere with you have fun unlike gta iv gta v does not take it self too seriously as a result the humour is back the main and side characters and their different personalities come together perfectly and the missions are once again wacky imaginative fun and just the right amount over the top weapons and vehicles are fun to use and from the technical side of things the game runs fine and looks very good voice acting and animations are great also i have no real complaints on the soundtrack although kdst vrock and chatterbox still remain my favorite radio stations overall as i already said the best gta game so far
recommended
after learning the free hugs trick from pewdiepie i find myself doing almost every time most of it with trevor playing like if trevor had mild mental retardation this game is ing awesome it allows you to play it like its your own game and by that i mean creating your own rules and such gta online well its good but its full of griefers who take advantage of moving their ps3x360ps4xone characters into pc which makes them virtually invincible with their armored cars highly resistant armor and ultra advanced guns and making them thik they are the kings of the game while in reality theyre being   killing newcomes who dont have a console and expected the game for pc since 2014 and want to have some fun with friends who are in the same situation and as for the server stability mor or less i have some lag while playing with friends but it rarely happens so the pc servers may have to be fixed somehow aside from that big problem with online ill give it a 1010 buy this game you wont regret it specially if someday it gets 10 or 20% of discount because do believe me it will happen

gta v gameplay and performance review the pc version rules ever since grand theft auto vs initial release back in september 2013 for the playstation 3 and xbox 360 pc gamers have been eagerly waiting for rockstar games to bring its title to the pc 18 months later and the longawaited game has finally been released unfortunately while rockstar games is known for releasing some topnotch titles its track record with porting its games to pc hasnt been stellar when grand theft auto iv came out for the pc platform back in 2008 about eight months after the console version it was criticized as a poor port at the time suffering from performance issues and requiring users to be signed in to windows live to save their progress it frustrated many users in many ways that its console counterparts did not though the pc version has some superior aspects as well the same can be said about grand theft auto v to some extent but well get to that later on in the review read the rest of the review over at hot hardware httphothardwarecomreviewsgrandtheftautovgameplayandperformancereviewisthepcversionthedefinitiveone

here are a few things that are unique to gta v 1 it combines the vast open wilderness of gta san andreas with the physics engine and visuals of gta iv while greatly improving on both 2 it is optimized well enough to run on my laptop with 3540 fps something i couldnt believe when i saw the benchmarks still there seems to be an issue with memory leak as the game starts stuttering randomly after about an hour but i hope they fix that at some point 3 the developers once again push the envelope of open world action games by introducing new previously unseen mechanics such as switching between 3 characters in real time 4 for the first time in the gta series we can play in first person as well as third person although the fov in the first case is a bit too low for pc gaming 5 the world is full of distractions and fun things to do so you can play for dozens of hours without progressing much into the main story the mini games and activities alone are some of the best ive ever seen ive been having a blast playing tennis shooting in the range and playing catch with chop 6 multiplayer was introduced in gta iv but it had no variety in this one the multiplayer is a whole new experience with just as many things to do with your friends as in the main story mode maybe even more these are the things that sold me in the first place after playing 23 hours though i realized theres so much more to this game than i originally anticipated story and voice acting all the characters are well written and brilliantly voice acted the game does a good job at making you care about the characters and their lives the dialogues are very good and there are lots of funny jokes and situations the main story itself is not very compelling im 42% through it at the time of this review but it keeps you interested with all the cool setup missions and heists sound and music i really love a game that makes the sound of the guns realistic and satisfying gta v achieves that to some extent as i find the sound of a silenced pistol or sniper rifle very pleasing while headshotting an unsuspected victim the rest of the sound assets contribute to the aesthetic of the game whether youre stuck in traffic on a main highway or climbing a mountain the immersion is rather good the music on the radio is fantastic as always there are stations for every taste and all the songs are classics for their genre one of the most interesting things i found is that after most missions there would be a news broadcast on the radio reporting in detail whatever happened in that particular mission graphics i play on a pretty weak machine so i cant enjoy the full graphical fidelity the game has to offer what i can say though is that on normal settings it runs at very playable framerates 3540 fps on my laptop i7 3632qm gt635m 6gb ram and still looks great i love the detail in the character models and the vehicles if you switch to first person you can even see the interior of the car although the textures there are not the best gameplay this is definitely the best part about this game as always gameplay is responsive and smooth when in firefights the cover system is quite useful the guns feel very good to shoot and headshots are very satisfying the handling of the vehicles is greatly improved compared to gta iv although the fact that you can control your vehicle in the air or flip over an upside down car with the turn keys is pretty unrealistic and maybe degrades the immersion a little on the other hand handling of the planes and helicopters feels much more realistic they sometimes wobble about as if there is turbulence so you need to make corrections the side missions and activities are extremely well designed and interesting known issues before buying the game you should probably know about the few issues that currently exist 1 there is a problem with some characters used in the player usernames that may keep you from playing the game but there is a workaround for this problem in the discussions page 2 there have been reports recently that accounts have been banned for modding the game im not sure why rockstar would ban moddng but it probably has to do with anticheat measures 3 there appears to be a memory leak in the game and after i play for about an hour i get a strange random stuttering of both picture and sound it usually happens for a short time and if it persists restarting the game usually fixes it make sure you have all the free ram you can get before starting the game maybe by shutting down some processes especially if your machine is not that powerful 4 the initial loading time before you enter the game is very long at least for me for more information on possible issues you may experience you can visit the discussions page conclusions a generally amazing game experience i was hesitant to buy this full price since i dont have a very good pc but in the end im glad i did it will keep you entertained for dozens of hours the pc version is the best of all but if you were hoping to mod it better wait until rockstar comes up with an official statement about the banned accounts story 910 sound 1010 graphics 910 gameplay 1010 2 points for the good optimization p overall 1010

amazing game truly on the highest settings its truly a breathtaking experience this is the open world game we have been waiting for aside from a few minor bugs and the online mode having pretty intense lag at the time of review this is perfection in a video game
recommended
rating 8 ill start with single player  thats a win 910 as always this is where gta delivers and its one of the most nejoyable games of the year its immersive its fun its allmost everything only two problems here  its sort  does not feel like a huge improvement from gta iv its only far bigger otherwise not a huge improvement online  oh total fail 310 dont know where to start   the moronic lobby system for everything thats immersion breaking  its gta lobby online   the bugs the exploits the lag   in free mode everyone is out to get you and if they arent right now they will be soon  the most expensive toys arent really useful in heists or cant be used at all in heists  the overpowered karuma  its actually too good at everything  no point in getting something else   the restriction for exactly 4 players for heists  wich most of the time will force you to  1 spend most of the times finding players and 2 spend the rest of the time playing with at least one   even though the missions themseffs rarely require more than 2 players  the jobs  other coop element beside heists  are usually short and unchallenging

i wasnt pleased with rockstar delaying the pc version of grand theft auto v and i intended to wait for a sale before buying it but the reviews for the pc version were nothing but positive so i caved within the first week or two of the game being available on steam as far as the gameplay goes its just like any gta since gta3 ive not played the console version but gta5 does look nice on pc i felt that the story was done fairly well it had twists drama and comedy i didnt feel like any particular set of character missions were overdone or monotonous and i enjoyed being lazy using the autoaim feature with the gamepad and then switching to kbm for the scenerious where i needed more precision i ran gta5 on an i7950@42ghz 6gb ram and a galax gtx 970 exoc black probably one of the reasons the game actually runs so well in comparison to the gta4 pc disaster is that it loves system resources it was easily pushing my system ram usage up over 51gb and using over 3gb of vram going by what i saw on reviews of the gpu i increased my core clock just a bit and then gave the ram clocks a much larger bump this allowed me to crank the details greatly i disabled the nvidia shadows in favor of softest shadows for some reason im under the impression that if a gpu manufacturer develops a specific feature that it should look good and run awesome on their gpu but that doesnt seem to be the case with the nvidia shadows performance took quite a hit those shadows do look good but you really probably wont notice it while youre trying to drive through every coincidental red light going 150mph the only technical issue i had may have been related to riva tuner statistics server if you use something like msi afterburner or evga precision x they may interfere with the game and cause a d3d crash i had no issues after closing the evga application allinall good fun game rockstar made a good effort to prevent this from being a disaster and it shows ive not played online mode

firstly its gta 5 on pc its great because we actually have it recently a lot of negative reviews have come out trying to slate the game at every corner probably because there computers dont have enough power to run chrome and there pocket money was wasted on this brilliant gem secoundly hacker gta online has hackers everywhere its dead easy to hack google expained to me how it was so easy in 3 min anyway a way to avoid this is to open a solo or closed match or just ignor them and then vote kick them somtimes they drop nukes from orbit but its all in the spirit of capitalism thirdly singleplayer there is so much to write about with the singleplayer you cant beat this epic saga of criminal streaks and briliantly writen scripts the world is dynamic and feels real and the best part is mods a fully modable singleplayer is amazing i honnestly cant recomend it enough fourthly dlc so far all dlc is free heists ill gotten gain everything is free this may change for a story expansion somthing i am dying for but is free for most of them added complaints and final revew the game is buggy breaks cant connect to the servers for  but this game is so special its perfect i waited 3 years for this so did 4 million others and we all still play the game even if rockstar try shipping coppies in the sales with micro transactions we still love them everyone in the community over reacts they cry when rummors come around and make up lies to inforce them when it never happend im talking about you people who said they were banned yeah they never did ban anyone did they finaly the game is 910 bugs yes but its gta play the story feel sad when its over and love flying your golden jet while your friend smokes in the back this game is special and i will love it untill the day its servers die 910 would recomend to anyone who has 40 and would recomend it to people who have never tried the series

its a good game in general had lots of fun with my friends when it first came out played private of course because the public online is questionable other than what apparently rockstar did with the prices this review is before any of that so for this case i recommend it now after what they did currently either wait for an actual sale or someone buys it for you or the company learns some respect with the questionable marketing theyve done including the dlc because for what its worth its notyet

none stop played since was released 30 hours just for the singleplayer and online well alot more with friends p hours just fly by playing this

grand theft auto v has been called a perfect game 1010 scores thrown around by sites like ign gamespot and the telegraph but it is not a perfect game it is a very very very good game though its shortcomings are what holds it back from being perfect in my eyes at least the narrative has such a good setup the characters that inhabit this world seem so interesting but rockstar fails be delve deeper into each character which makes me like them less michael was the obvious focus as his story and background is far more fleshed out than the other two protagonists franklins is almost pathetic with his exgirlfriend side storymotivation to get out of the hood seem good on paper but its never fleshed out we see this exgirlfriend less than four times throughout the story and she is barely mentioned its little things like this that bog down what would of been the best cinematic experience in a grand theft auto game the actual missions themselves are extremely fun and varied with wonderful set pieces that really get you into the scene the real star of grand theft auto v is the map much like gta iv loads of development hours and love have gone into creating a living breathing city for you to explore and discover in from the busting metropolis of los santos to the dusty wasteland that is blaine county there is always something to look at and play around with this map is even more fun to play around with friends since there is so much variety there is always something to do with your mates i can see this game being in my recently played for a long time the gunplay is less clunky than gta iv with the addition of the weapon wheel first found in red dead and max payne 3 the driving is more arcadey this time round which while many people love i preferred the boaty weighted feeling of gta iv but hey thats me and finally the rockstar editor this is worth the price of the game by itself the rockstar editor is super user friendly easy to pick up and actually really fun to use i can see myself clocking many hours in this game just editing clips but please rockstar add higher bitrate videos the current highest bitrate option is doesnt look that great but the option to export in 60fps is really nice so overall this game has a few shortcomings but that shouldnt stop you from experiencing one of the most fun third person openworld games on steam i give it a solid 810 you need to play this game
recommended
good game but i need more heists if you like playing onlinemy opinion is that you should buy it  hf 
recommended
ive played over 200 hours on xbox one and beat the singleplayer twice its a great game in the gta franchise with the flaw of bad multiplayer if you plan on grinding missions for a couple of hours then get ready for lag low payouts and jerk offs who leave half way through free roam is just that free roam around a city doing well nothing really in my experience you need friends to even have fun in both free roam and contact missions yesterday i attempted to do heist set ups with my friend and we kept failing because of the other teams incompetance later on while i was oncall solo for heists we got to the end of a real heist and someone left boom 2030 minutes gone the character customization is impressive but the outcome always ends up with everyone looking soft not even a leather jacket sunglasses and a beard could possibly make your character look tough the unapealing amount of people wearing skin tight leopard print jeans is in the thousands as every missionsheist i join or make has at least one of these hipster s just wear normal clothes already unfortunately even with rs big anti cheat thing theyve recently implemented i still see hackers often yesterday again i was in my garage where out of nowhere jesus appears hugging my back i promptly see its a hacker and brush him off i hop on my motorcycle where suprisingly jesus decides to ride  and send my motorcycle out of my garage good bye jesus in that same lobby i saw jesus dropping money bags i left as soon as i could another funny hacker encounter was when this guy turned into a ufo and afkd in the clothing store so if you walked in you couldnt walk out witohut teleporting into the phantom world he later turned into a wind mill and trapped us all in the store the sale this summer was atrocious 60 dollars for the base game all ing week genius

great optimization for pc fun online play and well its gta with $270 million dollar budget devopled by rockstar north  its a fun game with a awesome story i played on the console and an free online mode while riddle with some cheaters   in my limited experince with 1 or 2 cheaters after 20 hours of online to date isnt bad to me i feel guilty to say in both cases it was actually kinda of fun floating above los santos in car with two other dudes on mics taken on a crazy freeroam ride with one that all said the heists you perform the progression and customization of your character when you play online  paired with gtas whacky and crazy sequences of mayhem with others  is great i know gtav didnt go on summer sale and instead rockstar opted to retain the price give you $200000 starting off cash if you did buy it during the sumer sale as model honestly i dont find that to be a big deal r didnt want gtav to be on the summer sale and so isnt worth the negative reveiw as a game you can buy it for $5500 for the pc on amazon right now if youd like

rockstar has always been one of my most favorite developers of video games they never seem to fail with any title they make and gta v is no exception it is one of the most diverse video games on the market the online is amazing in every way you are able to everything from races to heists and deathmatches also to anyone giving this game a bad review its because you basically cheated you used mods online which is prohibited in most games anyway you can use them in singleplayer and rockstar has stated that you can and that you wont get banned for it pros to many to list but here are a few diverse great storyline fun exploration graphics are top notch great characters in single player online is amazing cons character customization is a little meh i wish it could be more diverse able to completly customize a character first person fov is a little annoying and kinda makes you sick not much else to really give a con its a great port to pc

subpar console port of a game but which can be thoroughly enjoyable if you play with friends or playing singleplayer however the glaring insanely stupidity of changing the difficulty of enemy ai based on whether or not you have a controller or mousekeyboard can be detected in an instant how so in most cases you will as a mousekeyboard player be sniping with pistols smgs rifles and sniper rifles because not only do they spot you instantly by the pixel of your character theyre deadly as  and have a high tendency to just blow away half your armor bar in a shot however if you play with controller youre given free range to actually close in on them to blow their brains out they are less accurate and have trouble seeing you even if you were literally spotted two seconds ago npc ai is good but has some flaws when it comes to evadeescape actions when confronted by an armed player ive also got to say that pc gamers are not three armed mutants rockstar to use a plane or chopper youll have to use both your regular wasd keys and numpad to successfully move around you can probably to a smaller degree learn to use mouse instead of numpad though in my cases its ended up suddenly taking a sharp turn downwards land vehicles are great except if you get them 2 inches of the ground and happen to be at max velocity which then will make you into a dreidel makes for great jumps but then again if you decide that gravity should be lighter then it can not at the same time be heavier on the way downbut then again maybe we achieve terminal velocity faster graphically its very nice cant deny that and wouldve loved to see other games using the same engine to a degree also jp will be harvested 15 after mission setup and heist japan points will be earned into the thousands im sure buy this game if you want to have fun with friends andor wanna play singleplayer and want to do some really super senseless violence do not buy this game if you feel that you should be banned for using any mod created for the game even as simple as better shadows they have indiscriminate power to just ban you whether you created it or not buy saints row 3 instead in that case same kind of senseless violence and at times even greater character creation possibilities and funny story plot

good graphics and games if you a gta fans single player is great but short wish there was more option to do money then heist only as most of the mission is simply progression without $$$ as for multiplayer its pretty bad the loading is pathetic i have upgrade to ssd and it made a difference alots altho its still way to long to load between each mission not to mention half the time it get stuck in limbo or is just way way too long i dont recomande it for online unless they fix the loading but for the single player its great alots of nice feature just bad that there isnt more way to make money than a 510 minute taxi towing random encounter worth of 90  1000 $ overall i give it a 610 when they fix online and up reward or more paying mission in sp ill give it a 910

single player single player in grand theft auto v is great it features three characters a psychopath trevor a hustler franklin and a retired bank robber micheal this gives the game a crazy but unique playstyle were you get to live their strange life this game also features many easter eggs side missions and good looking super and sports cars online grand theft auto online almost feels like a second game featuring many missions and activites to do with friends or without them the story line of grand theft auto online goes any way to want from racing to robbing convenience stores this makes the game very fun with the possibilities it fulfills grand theft auto v is a great game and has been remade deeply luckily it wasnt a console port i thank rockstar also from optimizing this game to the point most modern pc personal computers can get over thirty frames per a second 910  great game

i bought it on a friday by the end of the weekend i had 50 hours on record i now have 90 hours on record kill other players stalk them  them off do heists get tons of $$$$ get stuck on one part of a heist for hours or days because matchmaking will give you a  team threaten to kill everyone scream in mic  everyone off make them call you a 4year old start speaking in tongues really loudly when a foreigner joins your game and starts speaking their home language cry more about heists and then continue following and killing other players till they go passive finally bully them via voice chat to force them to leave passive mode again and kill them overall 1110

 the graphics are amazing  the game runs well on most of the systems and it is well optimized  the controls are comfortable  easy to switch from single player to multiplayer  the rockstar editor  no problem with shooting or driving while using a keyboard and a mouse  the cops are ing dangerous  firstperson fov needs to be bigger  long loading times in gta online  sometimes gta online crashes  sometimes all players randomly disconnect in gta online  really annoying when people randomly start talking through microphones in gta online and you cant mute them is this game worth 60 euro in my opinion yes after all the delays it runs well but some bugs need to be fixed and the performence in general in grand theft auto v online needs to be improved hopefully a patch in a week or so will fix the problems i will update later on

smoothest game launch in a very long time other than a few glitches hereandthere in the online mode its amazingly fun

dont be fooled my 12 hours played were me trying to sign in to my social club account 1010 would get locked out of account again in all seriousness it really is a good game as long as you know for sure what your log in is

chased by the cops jumped off a bridge landed in a yacht with 3 bimbo blondes partying 1110 would wait again

pretty impressive played every port of gta5 and this is without a doubt the best one had a few issues at the start but once you get past the intro it runs just fine
recommended
the port for this game is down right amazing running on an i53570k with a gtx 660 ti i am able to get a smooth 60 fps with mediumhigh settings obviously the best way to play this masterpiece
recommended
after a long much awaited delay i cant say that im in any way dissapointed this game is all that i would hoped it would be it runs on lower end pcs as well as looking great on high end pcs its a all around good purchase for everybody around the pc gaming community i am so glad that rockstar stepped up to the plate and made this game live up to the hype aside from some early download issues which are to be expected with the amount of people hitting their servers at one time all around i can say that this game is completely worth full priceat least for a pc only gamer and it wont dissapoint
recommended
fourth time buying this game and i still dont regret it
recommended
this game is amazing the world of los santos is huge to the point that i wish they created easy fast travel spots akin to assassins creed there is so much to do complete with three different endings characters you love to hate gorgeous scenery cars that actually handle well unlike previous gta games and a great storyline and believe it or not rockstar finally broke their mold because one of the endingswell ill let you find out when i hear people talk about how they were turned off by gta 4 and dont think gta 5 will be any better i ask them to reconsider there are some big differences between the two whereas gta 4 took itself a bit too seriously and tried to be dark and gritty gta 5 takes a much more lighthearted approach its much brighter the landscape is amazing from sterile industrial areas to gorgeous mountain peaks the story has a much lighter tone and the characters are much more dynamic than ol nico bellic sure the action sequences can get really intense but in general gta 5 doesnt have so much drama to weigh it down and you dont have an annoying cousin calling you every 5 minutes to go bowling that alone is a major improvement the graphics in the pc version are insanely good and highly customizable just about every function that you can imagine can be tweaked so that you can get the perfect combination of quality and framerate just be warned that some of the settings require a restart of the game but when it comes to the graphics quality between the pc version and the ps3xb360 version there is no comparison another big turn off to gta 4 is that driving is horrendous it truly feels like youre driving a gocart on an icy road even when the roads are clean and dry rockstar finetuned the driving in gta 5 so that its much more responsive and significantly easier than its predecessor its still not as easy as in other games like saints row 3 but its a significant improvement to gta 4 the game also allows for seamless switching between keyboardmouse which i prefer for gunplay scenes and controller which i prefer for driving and flying if there are any negatives i would say that the biggest is that if youre a gold medal hunter the game gives you no clue of whats required in a mission until the mission is over effectively forcing you into replaying the mission some of the missions are very long and convoluted so this seems like a really big jerk move on rockstars part additionally there doesnt seem to be any kind of cloud save function at least not yet i tried first playing this in 3d on my 3dtv and playend through a few missions i then tried it on my main pc and even though both are connected to rockstar social club i had to start from the beginning i thought that rockstar was going to implement cloud saving but either i misread or its currently down speaking of 3d if your pc is connected to a 3d tvmonitor or you dont mind redblue anaglyph you seriously need to play this in 3d rockstar built stereoscopic 3d into the game if you crank the nvidia 3d depth to max and you increase the 3d convergence in the games graphics setting  ho lee st and anyone with a modern nvidia card can play in redblue anaglyph their drivers can convert just about any direct x game on the fly ive played it so far in both regular 3d mode on my 3dtv and in anaglyph redblue on my main pc the 3d mode is stellar even in redblue if you have any of those crappy paper glasses around i recommend that you give it a try fair warning though you need to go through a few steps to really get it to work properly i can give the exact steps in the comments below if anyone wants them i understand that gta 4 might have soured the gta franchise for a lot of people but i urge you to give gta 5 a chance while it has some similarities it really is a different game in many ways and it deserves your attention

grand theft auto v love it love the game and i believe the developers did an amazing job on the pc port best part is that its on pc on pc we have mods like running around as a chimp with an ak47 and incendiary ammo with peds rioting all around you and missiles raining from the heavens from planes that are trying to kill you btw i played this game on ps3 for countless hours way better on pc of course

finally at lastgta v has finally come to pci gotta saythis is a much more improved port than gta ivbut howeveri did notice some things that are not right and rockstar may need to fix them and also some things are kinda weird for me here are some proscons for this port pros gta v pc port awesome 1080p support im currently using this graphics improved from console at least from my eyes it is very good optimized with the 350 driver from nvidia rockstar editor is very unique and cool exclusive to this pc port only looks beautiful from my monitor looking at los santos being alive mods there are no mods out yetbut this will be one of the main reasons of why this port is so succuseful cons some unoptimized areas sometimes when i got to some areas such as open plain desertmy fps will drop but when i go back to cityits back to 60 fpsrockstar please fiximprove this asap and also i use a asus gtx 970 and when i set up the graphicsive only used like around 2033 gb of vram and also by the time i set up the graphics optionsthe bar was green which i think it meant it was stable and optimized but apparently it completely didnt  kinda weird controls for helicopterplane not really a bad thingbut its just feel unfamilari cant remember any pc games that have this controlsyou use the number pad to drive forwardim not familiar with itbut i will have to master this controls and get familiar with the controlsso not really a game breaker or will lose verdict points so yeahthats all at the momenti feel playing this portits a excellent portpossibly the best gta game port ever well done rockstaryou earned yourself a very well made cookie for your efforts put into this port  final verdict 1010 for being the best port
recommended
great game as expected

i am not exactly sure how to start this review its been a long wait i bought the game 2012015 and since then  all i did was wait for it to go live after a few delays last night it finaly did go live and all my waiting was worth it before i ever launched it i went on the steam forums and checked what were the first impressions of everyone else what i saw was kinda troubling for me a lot of people were complaining how they couldnt launch the game load it completely had terrible fps drops so when it finnaly happened when i launched my game for the first time  i expected the same problems  i had none  the social club account i already had was required for gta iv too was easily linked to gta v  the game didnt crash once  it launched as any other game does performing first time setup etc  true it took some time to get the graphics settings just right for my gear i have a gtx 660 and a quad core amd 31 ghz which is a bit too weak but manages to run the game nicely and i do expirience some fps drops most of the time but honestly i did expect this  texture quality i use is  normal any other setting demands more video memory than i have even so i think the game looks amazing i can only imaginwe how it looks for people with supercharged computers my final impression is  1010 and my advice for everyone woth problems at the start  be patient wait for the load to finish itself try different graphic settings make the game run nicely on your computer before reviewing it negatively it deserves respect and patience we have been witing for this masterpiece for a very long time
recommended
at first i didnt get the hype of grand theft auto online then i headshotted some dude on his way to a heist with his crew and i heard over voice chat that btch killed blankblank kill that motherfcker then i led them on a street chase through the city and i remembered the 5 ds of dodgeball dodge duck dip dive and dodge then i went off of a ramp and landed in a river shortly afterwards they shot me dead as i tried to escape i get gta online now

cursing nudity sex killing do whatever the hell you feel like doing what much more could u want out of a fantasy game thats why we game in the first place awesome gamesp was fantastic the level design was amazing and graphics voice acting was one of the best out of all the characters i have ever heard not sure about mp dont care to play it well worth the full price only negative to me which is an opinion playing trevor thank god you only had to play as him a few times at times hes funny as hell and made me laugh but most of the time he was just plain annoying and i wanted to shoot him definatly felt good in the ending which theres 3 different endings you can chose from playing as michael and franklin however was awesome and had 2 different types of lives to live as oh and the major negative if you own a gtx 980 ftw graphics card about once every 2 hrs of playing this game youll get a no signal error to your monitor and only way is to reboot and it comes back on so save your game frequently if you own this card same thing has happened to my friend that has same card and this is the only game it does that too 1010
recommended
briefly worth the price no mod support i think already the single player is worth paying the full price after thinking about it its honestly one of the best i have ever played the storyline itself aint that innovative or special but its working and its very good entertainment it is however the mood you get and the immersion that makes the single player aspect so great online aspect of the game is pretty much what you would expect from it i would have wished more variety from the gamemodes  now dont get me wrong there is so much to do but if you are someone who have a lot of time on their hands like me then you will eventually get bored  atleast if you play with random people which i do not recommend heists are just the kind of variation i would like to see more in the future a great addition to the game no support for mods  apart from making your own radio station  makes game short lasting however and this is a big minus especially when looking back the history of other gtagames modding community was there already actually because of the lack of mod support i was seriously thinking about not recommending this game but once i saw numerous other reviews already negative because of that i changed my mind saying that encrypting game data makes the game cheater free is total bs  most of the cheating tools are third party anyway as far as i know there also exists lot of online games which include mod support and are cheater free its like putting the cookie jar on top of shelf and saying you cant touch it all the good kids wont but does it really stop a cookie monster

100 i havent been banned about the bans just felt like putting it out there multiplayer modding may get you banned go online with your fixes mods hacks or etc each at your own risk a lot of people making claims that rockstar this rockstar that online works perfectly for me and i have been a very good boy you have been warned by pc gamer and by the fov mod creator source httpwwwpcgamercomgta5modallowscustomfovinfirstpersonmode source2 httpwwwredditcomrgrandtheftautov_pccomments32n8m0i_made_a_mod_for_freely_setting_your_firstperson the bans last two weeks play single player or go outside or mope somewhere thinking about the utterly disappointing experiences youve had trying to exploit the system or try to work around a broken system that could be easily used as an exploit pros  runs really well at highest settings  charming characters this is my biggest like  really really pretty graphics  i dont have to go on 50 dates before a heist or thievery  first person camera implemented  explosions and ridiculous physics  havent had to buy anything in game with real money to enjoy the game  many different events and side quests  invest in stock market based on businesses you screw with in game more money  level up stats by activity  character customization  some car customization  unique settingsenvironments that set the country and the city apart  interesting storyline  pull heists in story mode or do them with friends online without mods  switching between characters to find specific quests  caught myself watching television in the game for a good 20 minutes played tennis for a good hour  two options of starting heists to determine how you want to deal with the robbery  options of choosing between specialists per mission to determine %chance of heist success and bonuses  evading cops makes sense by hiding in the wall near them  can flick people off while driving  headon collisions can kill other drivers npc  everything ingame is a jokeparody knockoff brand ie cokecola  crotchcola cons  driving with keyboard is hard for some reason i drive bikes better  first person shooter not as smooth as every other first person shooter  physics in a race can screw you over hard  may be resource intensive but it runs perfectly for me  loading takes 1520 seconds at the highest settings 35 seconds at optimal settings  rear view mirrors are blurrypixels  would be fun to have a dedicated server to screw around with to avoid mod bans  would be nice to autodisable all mods from gta online for the people who dont know how to turn it off would mean that you would actually have to have a mod menu or mod mode
recommended
this game is fantastic its fun its fast it runs amazingly well  better than gta four does such amazing finetuning available for your graphics settings and great support  rockstar helped me figure out that my crashing problem was because the vendor who i got my nvidia card from had overclocked it causing the drivers to crash ive been playing with single player mods  make sure to get the mod launcher to keep the mods separate for when you go online and theyve been really proactive in taking down the cheaters lately making the online experience even better and as theyve recently come out prosingle player mods im quite pleased helpful tech support promodding beautiful graphics and a fun community to play with whats not to love
recommended
this is my first review well actually its not it more a warning  i really love this game i have played it on a xbox 360 then a xbox one so now its on my gaming laptop well guess what you cant play offline  now when i go on holiday i cant play gta 5 but i can play farcry 4 etc so come on you modders out there mod offline for gta 5 i will pay for that mod gladly otherwise its a great game i love it but no offline play be warned fellow laptopers
recommended
good game just really bad matchmaking
recommended
easy for me to review and recommend this one pros its gta v awesome visuals good story fun singleplayer lots to do large map without any loading screens tons of cars lots of fun online 32 player max fully featured plenty of activities custom crew and friends sessions to get brod out lots of weapons lots of stats lots of leveling and progression in the character building passive mode allows you to be invulnerable at the flip of a switch  so no pvp when you arent ready cool movie editor  although the action replay feature doesnt quite work director mode is rad and you can actually make some really neat little flicks right there in the game you probably already saw some cons the load times the controls the menu and interface maddening controls on the menu hard to use the multiplayer interaction menu hard to use the map hard to rebind keys some of the rebinds dont actually change anything like mousewheel seems to always be both invehicle weapon and radio station switch then there is lots of click are you sure yes are you sure yes loading common bugs when joining other friends matches online  causing you to wait to load into online choose a friend to join  load in again then error load in again  just to do it all over can be a bummer you get kicked from some lobbies really quick if you afk for 23 minutes  even when its just friends playing with you  causing even more loading times some performance issues with some players  wonking out the mouse apparently the mouse sensitivity is linked to the fps where if you are having questionable performance  you will likely not be having too great a time trying to play either if you are on a laptop like me plug her in read up about the technical side of this games demands and be for sure about the can run question before you buy otherwise its a blast its gta v with crappy kbm interface and some goofy behind the scenes bugs overall definately recommended
recommended
if this is not the best written scenario and the best voice acted game since the beging of the time than i dont know what is huuuuuge flawlessly designed city tons of cars very well implemented fun and thoughtful missions 3 main characters than will stick with you long time after you completed the story mode great sense of humor and once more beautifly written script pc version looks awesome in 1440p 60fps and it was very well worth the wait one of the best games ive played to the date loved the ending  9510 and this is just for the story mode which took me more than 30h to complete online heists and tons of fun awaits ^^

this is a nearperfect game the modding community has just started but rockstar has been keen to shutting it down and im not sure how long it will take for them to let some mods through everyone knows what gta v is so no need to summarize that aspect but people are seriously giving negative reviews because you cant do something mods that a arent necessary for the game b have just begun and will grow exponentially within the next couple of months c can actually ruin online when s decide its okay to cheat the game is great the metacritic score says it on its own regardless of mods this is a tremendous pc port that has been greatly fine tuned and optimized i cant understand why people feel so entitled when this game is far beyond its price tag on its own like i said keep in mind that mods have only just begun and rockstar will probably make legit statements soon regarding them dont listen to all the butthurt jerks

it is quite true as i have heard that game it is indeed as i have heard

this game speaks for itself and doesnt really need a long and detailed review instead i will read up a passage from harry potter and the chamber of secrets  chapter eight  the deathday party october arrived spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle madam pomfrey the nurse was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students her pepperup potion worked instantly though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward ginny weasley who had been looking pale was bullied into taking some by percy the steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end the lake rose the flower beds turned into muddy streams and hagrids pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds oliver woods enthusiasm for regular training sessions however was not dampened which was why harry was to be found late one stormy saturday afternoon a few days before halloween returning to gryffindor tower drenched to the skin and splattered with mud even aside from the rain and wind it hadnt been a happy practice session fred and george who had been spying on the slytherin team had seen for themselves the speed of those new nimbus two thousand and ones they reported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs shooting through the air like missiles as harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was nearly headless nick the ghost of gryffindor tower was staring morosely out of a window muttering under his breath    dont fulfill their requirements    half an inch if that    hello nick said harry hello hello said nearly headless nick starting and looking round he wore a dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair and a tunic with a ruff which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed he was pale as smoke and harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside you look troubled young potter said nick folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet so do you said harry ah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand a matter of no importance    its not as though i really wanted to join    thought id apply but apparently i dont fulfill requirements  in spite of his airy tone there was a look of great bitterness on his face but you would think wouldnt you he erupted suddenly pulling the letter back out of his pocket that getting hit fortyfive times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the headless hunt oh  yes said harry who was obviously supposed to agree i mean nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and clean and my head had come off properly i mean it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule however  nearly headless nick shook his letter open and read furiously we can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as horseback headjuggling and head polo it is with the greatest regret therefore that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements with very best wishes sir patrick delaneypodmore fuming nearly headless nick stuffed the letter away half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on harry most people would think thats good and beheaded but oh no its not enough for sir properly decapitatedpodmore nearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a far calmer tone so  whats bothering you anything i can do no said harry not unless you know where we can get seven free nimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly

good game just really bad matchmaking
recommended
easy for me to review and recommend this one pros its gta v awesome visuals good story fun singleplayer lots to do large map without any loading screens tons of cars lots of fun online 32 player max fully featured plenty of activities custom crew and friends sessions to get brod out lots of weapons lots of stats lots of leveling and progression in the character building passive mode allows you to be invulnerable at the flip of a switch  so no pvp when you arent ready cool movie editor  although the action replay feature doesnt quite work director mode is rad and you can actually make some really neat little flicks right there in the game you probably already saw some cons the load times the controls the menu and interface maddening controls on the menu hard to use the multiplayer interaction menu hard to use the map hard to rebind keys some of the rebinds dont actually change anything like mousewheel seems to always be both invehicle weapon and radio station switch then there is lots of click are you sure yes are you sure yes loading common bugs when joining other friends matches online  causing you to wait to load into online choose a friend to join  load in again then error load in again  just to do it all over can be a bummer you get kicked from some lobbies really quick if you afk for 23 minutes  even when its just friends playing with you  causing even more loading times some performance issues with some players  wonking out the mouse apparently the mouse sensitivity is linked to the fps where if you are having questionable performance  you will likely not be having too great a time trying to play either if you are on a laptop like me plug her in read up about the technical side of this games demands and be for sure about the can run question before you buy otherwise its a blast its gta v with crappy kbm interface and some goofy behind the scenes bugs overall definately recommended
recommended
if this is not the best written scenario and the best voice acted game since the beging of the time than i dont know what is huuuuuge flawlessly designed city tons of cars very well implemented fun and thoughtful missions 3 main characters than will stick with you long time after you completed the story mode great sense of humor and once more beautifly written script pc version looks awesome in 1440p 60fps and it was very well worth the wait one of the best games ive played to the date loved the ending  9510 and this is just for the story mode which took me more than 30h to complete online heists and tons of fun awaits ^^

rockstar has always been known for its ingenuity pushing the envelope with its spoton social satire and breaking the mold with its unconventional gameplay the online version seemingly possesses some mechanics issues which effectively penalize new players for defeating their betterequipped opponents still the much hyped gta5 continues rockstars tradition of excellence introducing unprecedented new gameplay mechanics which make los santos rockstars scarily accurate mock up of modern california feel like a living breathing world my father insists that mom is still living and breathing but i can no longer smell her i can always smell her rockstar delivers on the hype with another top notch release thatll keep you playing in the sandbox long after mom calls you home

even though i got banned for using a mod in sp im very fond of this game single player is awesome the story is fantastic when youre not doing missions you can cause complete mayhem online is fun as well anything can happen there a player may decide to get a jet and blow you up you can set a bounty you can rob stores do heists and jobs its a lot of fun id recommend this to anyone theres something for everyone to do in this community
recommended
the game it self is very amazing worth buying but i see very stupid to ban people for using mods for no reason and without a specification of time
recommended
no mod i invite only session thats  now i cant play riot mode with friends or be the police mod thats ed up gta 4 was better with the mods this is not fun the game with mods not fun if rockstar do so you cant have mods in singleplayer im gonna quit playing this game and go back to gta 4
recommended
after waiting almost 4 years for this pc version im happy to say that the wait was worth it oh and all those delays before launch they apparently were meaningful as the game is greatly optimized comparing it to gta iv which ran horribly even on highend machines of its time ive put around 150 hours on gta online when i played it on the ps3 and im probably going put in another 100 hours before i even think about getting bored of this game the online is so nicely done i just hope they put out more heist content and fix a lot of the online bugs and make it a smoother experience overall this is a must have for anyone remotely interested in open worldaction games things i would like to see improve fixed youre not currently able to drop a weapon permanently in gta online there needs to be more car body kits spoilers etc other auto related after market modding options and you really should be able to control your cars radio volume without having to go to settings>audio and turning down the music volume from there sleeping dogs implemented a brilliant solution for this update rockstar has dropped the righteous ban hammer on players whom used registry hacks and abused mods for gains on gta online  this massive ban has made the affected cheaters to come out and bomb the game with negative reviews my advice to anyone reading this would be to outright ignore their calls for attention the games pretty darn good
recommended
when one and a half years ago the console guys started to play gtav and we pc gamers had to sulk i couldnt stand it and watched literally a dozen playthroughs on a wellknown video site on the net i made mental notes of what i wanted to do too and what to do differently i even wrote an article back then with tips and tricks they actually work hehe and recommendations about which crew members to take for certain heist missions now the game is finally out and i even preordered it so i could start right away i can tell you everything i had hoped for  making over a billion dollars using the games stock market and all the other stuff it is even better than i had imagined so many details and a huge map ask for sightseeing tours even on foot if you are not yet familiar with the gta franchise now is the right time to start everyone else what the flipping heck are you waiting for  excellent game
recommended
as a purely pc gamer ive been looking forward to this game for a long time theres something unique about gta which transcends the limits of a simply great game tapping into the core of modern humanity the ability to speed steal and slaughter with reckless abandon is the purest incarnation of our inner desire as expected rockstar delivers the next level of the series with the high quality weve come to expect all the while keeping true to their style overlaid mockery of our societal values leaving no aspect of our culture untouchable including themselves this pc port contains a few bugs which i expect will be ironed out in time only thing i could wish for is owning better hardware to experience the game in its full glory

growing up the gta series were one of my favorite video games unfortunately it did not stick around since the only time i could have played gta was during summers when i heard gta v was going to come out i was not as excited as i should have been i wasnt hyped i did not pay attention to their announcements or newsfeed for this upcoming release this also had to do with how rockstar refused to release it for pc till 2 years after its been released on consoles anyhow even knowing that i wasnt excited for the release of the pc version for this game i went ahead and purchased it seeing that many of my friends bought it in all honesty its a great game and ive been addited to it for the first 3 weeks eventually my enjoyment for this game died down gta v online is a sandbox game but it does lack things to do plus the hackersscriptersmodders did not help sustain the satisfaction they actually destroyed it from my previous experiences in gta games ive known that this game had cheats so it wasnt a surprise i did not play the campaign but im going to recommend this game and it has definitely paid off my $60

i do highly reccomend this game since i do beleive that the 8 month delay may have been worth it for gta v has been highly optimized to play on lower grade machines i have a fx4130 r9270x 8gb of ram and this game runs like a dream with 40fps on very high to ultra i happen to be the one of the lucky ones to not have gtavexe has stopped working everytime i launch and i dont expect rockstar to do much since they have such a low priority in pc gaming and have stripped the game of modding which was one of the main points of the game and banning people for using simple fov mods etc this game is very well put together with its brilliant and interactive story line and its fun filled random gta online i have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable games to play alone and even better yet with friends with heistsfreeroammissionsraces etc 1 if you are having problems with your game crashing i would reccomend going to wwwsystemrequirementslabcomcyri and search for gta 5 and run the scan to run the game all you need really is the minimum checked off and you should be good for normal to high settings with a steady fps 2 if you passed the scan and it still doesnt work try updating drivers for gpu and cpu at the makers website 3 if that didnt work try making sure you have all of your microsoft visual cs if you dont have all of them game can crash or not even load to aqquire go to httpssupportmicrosoftcomenuskb2977003 4 make sure you are administrator or right click gtav and hit run as administrator 5 disable antiviruses i have avastsuper anti spywaremalwarebytes and they do not cause problems if you have others i would try disabling them and trying to launch up the game 6 check for game updates as you know upon release a update was put out for gta v which fixed a glitch is story mode to see if their is and update go to gta v in your library right click and go to updates then make sure it says always keep this game up to date and hit ok 7 still staying in properties go to local files and click view integrity of game cache if it finds any issues just let it fill in the missing files if this hepled you click it as helpful

okay im going to start with what good about this game and then go straight into the bads in general this game is amazing has a good story line the game is well optimize the online is well done has allot and has many fun jobs that you can do and create with the r content creator ive played some really well done maps that was really enjoyable its also amazing how this is one of the first game that i havent seen any payed dlc season pass the only thing this game has are those micro transaction which are kind of useless considering how easy it is to start up a heist and make millions in one day the heist unfortunetly theres only 4 heist that 4 man coop i dont count the fleeca job as heist its more a tutorial into the heist itself considering how hard each heist gets with time another thing i would suggest to only do heist if you guys have teamspeak skype etc as long as its direct and not ingame chat your going to be fine also choose your memebers make sure they have a stable internet connection and that there not total idion and going to land stuff where there not suppose to or kill themself and then just quit the job this game is amazing excpet for some couple of things that can really break this game if r dosent fix them soon in the near future certain glitch bugs and loading screens anyone who has played online know how long they can be considering this game has been out on console for almost two years and i see the same issuses back on the pc i can understand the loading can take a long time on console but on pc it shoundnt happen considering how much money we put in out system except those minor porblem im going to give this game an 810 considering in online half of the game is just waiting and that can be extremly frustrating to certain people

i want to be able to add a batmobile mod so i can be batman at night and then get hit by thomas the tank engine only to cause him to explode in singleplayer but i guess that wont happen back to gta iv for mods then i recomend this game only if you dont have any plans for modding other than that its just another gta

this game is awesome

if my computer didnt leak any excessive ram from getting horny over gta i would be able to play this without crashing

gta v like the others gta games its a great game of course its not a perfect game have some bugs have some thing we want to do and we cant but its a game not real lifethe people are arguing about the 60 dollars they pay and they cant use the game like they wantits not recommended buy a car and make changes its not recommended buy something and change like you want to be perfect the users need to understand the updates are being made the dlc are being set if its the politic of the company not support mods we need to understand that imagine millions of people playing the game and have a system to separate the people using mods in single player or multi player imagine what it is having a team doing only that time they spent and they can use that time to make the game better i agree with the rockstar politic some players know how to use mods but other dont so nobody can use it imagine someone create a mod to make some cheat in the multiplayer the fun it will end and its the rockstar name of course i have the opinion maybe they can create some servers only to people want to use mods or cheat but maybe that will happen in the future lets wait and see what they are preparing for the futue lets play and not arguing lets have fun and not think we are talking about real lifethis is a game not a job not your life of course its only my opinion and i respect the other opinions so please respect mine
recommended
theres a lot of reviews attacking rockstar for banning people for using mods its about time rockstar listened to their customers and not  them off even if the eula says no mods that isnt set in stone whatever happened to the customers always right this policy of rockstar reminds me of the happy merchant meme rockstars banning mods because they want their shekels in addition to that the happy merchants who run rockstar made pc gamers wait over a year before it was released and then charge premium prices for it its  if youre not in america and it costs more because you have a weaker currency enjoy your shekels rockstar aside from that gta v is the best game ever im not praising the happy merchants who run rockstar but the very creative people who came up with the game i dont need to describe why this game is so good the stand out character in this game is trevor the other two characters are complementary to me trevor is a psychotic psychopath homo and i love that in a non gay way this game is better than gta iv because it as more diverse environment that was the problem with the last gta game it was all concrete jungle and no country areas to give you a change of environment type this is why i like sa better than liberty city this game has much more plane and more than one airport and im someone who likes flying gta iv decided that flying should be restricted to helicopters only and i didnt like that i want flying to be a feature in all future gta games also this is 2015 why not have hard core sex scenes already rather than just a strip club and s that you can see while they are humping you

gta v how could i put something negative in here its gta arguably the best game series is back although this game has been out for over a year on consoles i believe the pc version may have been worth the wait if you havent seen a single gta video yet ill sum it up in this game you can just freeroam build an empire do jobs do heists get money use stock markets yeah pretty much everything you can do in real life including attending your local strip club only there are seemingly no consequences something negative about all gta games so far happens to be the amount of bugs and glitches found in these games although every game in the series has been groundbreaking there tends to be a lot of issues with these types of things i wont go into detail or drag anything out so ill leave it at this yes this game is good have fun real world people

the long awaited gtav pc what should you expect [any major bugsfixs] okay now expect some issues at first mainly lag when i first got the game i couldnt drive a vehicle without such bad lag and stuttering the game waas unplayable after some researching i realised that there were new beta drivers for amd which wouldnt show up on my autodetection software for auto updating my drivers a quick google of amd 154 beta drivers will help you get that fixed as my game does now run superbly after i have made a few changes to settings nvidia have also released a gta v ready driver now im no computer guru and i dont have the best setup ever id like to think of my computer as a good pc kinda a bench mark for alot of gaming pcs  its a couple years old now but features an i7 processor and x2 amd readon 7850s  so its not exactly a rust bucket i have noticed this seems to be more of a game engin error rendering issues mainly when driving fast the game sort of coughs and splutters a bit and i get drops from 6080fps all the way down into the 30s for a good few seconds which is a significant drop and can be noticed alot have some hope guys rockstar have done a very good job and im sure they will get this issue fixed as a few on my friends have the same issue the game is still very playable just stay away from races if you have this issue [general comments] im still suprised at how the the game runs using a mouse and keyboard the driving especially is very well done other gtas has a very clunky feel if you didnt use a controller but not on here folkes also i love the shooting when using a mouse it feels soo natural with me being a fps player [the online] ooooh the online fantastic im sure you know by now what can be done online so i wont bore you but it is so fun when playing with buddies the servers are a little bit desynchy but nothing horrid [singleplayer] this is definately a game for those who have loved watching the evolution of gta ever since the birds eye view days right up to where gta iv left us you may be thinking other than gfx being updated what does this offer thats new in a singleplayer aspect truthfully not a hell of alot the only feature that i can think of my self that is 100% new is the character swapping how you have multiple characters as part of the story line and you can swap to any character whilst doing pretty much anything oh apolagies the first person feature too so first person truthfully for me a bit of a let down you can tell its a feature added into a thirdperson game mainly the fov but also the general feel you get its hard to explain but it just doesnt feel like a modern first person view experience now i havent completed the story line or even got very far into it due to my social and private time being destroyed by the addictive nature of the multiplayer but its looking like this could be a very strong fun durable campaign if you really have any questions feel free to comment and ill reply asap

1010 would be bad at csgo again

game is great and i will continue to play the single player story is amazing certainly better than all three of gta ivs stories inventory and weapon management is a much improvement to its predecessors customization of your characters and cars is back online play is fun as well aside from a unconsequential freeroam you lose money and have to buy or find weapons no real pickup locations although car performance improvements have to be unlocked with racing it still is well done people are getting upset for being banned when connecting to gta online with a modified game which is the case with every other game out that has a competitive system during online play same if you join an exploitive job or hang with people doing things they are not supposed to do it is a great buy just for single player if not for multiplayer also as long as you arent stupid and decide to modify you game when you play online

1010 worth the wait

grand theft auto 5 is one of the few instances where i bought the game on multiple platforms originally released on last generation consoles back in 2013 and rereleased on current gen last year gta 5 on the pc is the definitive edition ignore my hours since i have over 400 from the 360 and ps4 versions clocked into the online portion gta 5 has enough content to last you for a while the story mode is your typically gta game you play as michael franklin and trevor my favorite in which they each struggle with modern americas issues and there is the online mode where most people will spend their time on gta online is extremely vast in scope you can race do missions play heists deathmatch golf and much more paying $60 for a game these days feels like a rip off especially with season passes and dlc but gta 5 is different you actually get for what you pay for and more 1010

great game

very good game good graphics and a good buy

this game is very addictive the game play in single player and online are excellent but the online portion load times are ridiculous the server issues will cause you to throw your hands up in frustration team members getting disconnected during missions will cause an instant fail if you dont have a crew you will have to wait in the lobby forever then you have to pray the pick up guys is competent at their given task there are a million things that can go wrong during a heist and it will test your patience all that being said if you are lucky enough to get a good team together if you can bear the unbearable load times and are lucky enough not to have anyone leave or disconnect then during those few golden moments during a heist are the most fun you will have in any game those are the moments that keep me sane waiting for this game to load 1010 bar the server and loading issues

rebel radio is 1010 would redneck again

this is the most awesome and very best game of the worldthe story is bestgameplay is bestand online is good even the server is stabilise enoughheist is best but i think r should add more of heists i give 10010 points

i played this on the ps4 and decided to make a new player i just cant get over on how huge the diffrence is and how much more fun i have on the pc

its absolutely absurd just how good this game looks on pc its also a fantastically fun game gta online is a total blast i am totally eating my words and asking rockstar for forgiveness for all my ing at how long they took to release the pc version it was worth the wait
recommended
game of the decadethe best game available for pc 1110

2010 you can smack da es and hoes
recommended
well its gta 5 in buy it
recommended
this is a game i have been waiting to play and trust me rockstar did a fantastic job with the pc port the optimization in this game is great it runs smooth on very high with no sudden framerate drops the world is beautiful and there are so many details that will blow your mind the car mechanisms are great and do remind you of a racing game and the online is trully fascinating you create your character customize him level him up with missions and activities or even play custom activities from the community do not listen to others saying do not buy it because no mod support etc the game is great by itself and there is no need to mess up with mods anyway i will list my pros and cons pros great optimization excelent mechanics incredible graphics lots of content with missions and side quests the online is trully a diamond cons it seems there are quite enough hackers that can ruin your experience some people have problems with gfx_d3d errors and crashes even i had but managed to solve them not enough hours a day to play p additional notes about the ban with the fov mod rockstar stated that cosmetic mods are clear but anything that changes files etc is not the fov mod can be considered as a hack as it modifies several files from the game and gives you an unfair advantage over the people that dont have the mod by being able to see more it is better first to ask questions that to rush things

first time playing gta on any platformand its worth every pennyi have finished the story mode and still playing it to complete it 100% and i also on level 81 online pros  i can play it and enjoy it with laptop below the minimum requirements2532 fps on 1280x728 setting custom high its greatly optimizedexcept maybe for intel cpuamd gpu laptop theres so much to do in los santos great voice acting great variety of vehicles online is so much fun with friends and so many more cons  the story is not as great as the predecessor in my opinionbut each character is uniquei love that sometimes the shadows buggedshowing sharper shadow inside some kind of square around playerbut outside the square shadow is blurry and less detailed no animals in online mode online mode in public is not that funpeople often goes on rampagekilling everyone in sightthats why i prefer private session aloneor with friends and for banning problemi thought rockstar made it clearthey will not support moddingand they clearly states that modifying game files is prohibitedand yet people blame them for banning people using modded game
recommended
haha people getting rekt for mods good thing im playing pure vanilla
recommended
the best game in three years 13 14 15
recommended
it is the game of year without a question
recommended
really great game worth the money and time spent on it the base game has enough to screw arround with and to the people complaining about mods it has been said by rockstar before the game came out that mods are not supported so do your homework next time before you buy a game
recommended
duh its gta 5
recommended
great game good story wonderful port save for a few issues beautiful graphics now for the kicker rockstar has never come out and supported mods for the game originally posted by terk  heres the thing the method currently being used to mod isnt really what most people think of as modding scripthook is an example of dll assembly code injection which sneaks foreign code into the process in order to provide a method for an additional payload of code to hookmodify the game process in memory the problem with this is that there is no way to tell what the payload is nor is there anyway to prevent the payload from working in only some areas of the game thats the point a lot of people dont understand here were not talking addons were talking dll files that have been modified to allow a user to run any additional code they want and have the game accept it and execute it there are no limits to what can be run with this and the trainer that comes as the included demonstration of scripthook is a very benign usage of the potential to give you an example of the dangers of allowing dll injected clients to connect to multiplayer servers or any other client for that matter until recently in reign of kings hackers using the same method that scripthook uses were using injected assembly code into dlls to modify files on the computers of other players on the servers they connected to and in many cases even the files on the servers themselves when were talking about dll injection there is no such thing as singleplayer mod or multiplayer mod its just foreign code being run anywhere the user wants the only way to prevent it is to check the integrity of the dlls of any client on connection and cutting the connection as soon as a disprecency is found it may seem like overkill but the alternative is a complete loss of security for anyone using gta online

one of the greatest games ever made 60 hours if not more of singel play content and an infinite amount of hours in multiplayer there is no moding but who cares there is so much to do that if all you want to do is mod a almost perfect game then i fell bad for you
recommended
rockstar has always been one of my most favorite developers of video games they never seem to fail with any title they make and gta v is no exception it is one of the most diverse video games on the market the online is amazing in every way you are able to everything from races to heists and deathmatches also to anyone giving this game a bad review its because you basically cheated you used mods online which is prohibited in most games anyway you can use them in singleplayer and rockstar has stated that you can and that you wont get banned for it pros to many to list but here are a few diverse great storyline fun exploration graphics are top notch great characters in single player online is amazing cons character customization is a little meh i wish it could be more diverse able to completly customize a character first person fov is a little annoying and kinda makes you sick not much else to really give a con its a great port to pc

expect for some online bugs that are actually more funny when they happen and give you a damn good laugh than being annoying this game is ing amazing a good time make sure you have a couple good mates though to play with
recommended
great game
recommended
rockstar made a very good job here it is a huge sandbox with a lot of freedom requires a little high vram not a problem because of the good port wich has lots of settings for you to get your right experience monitored by video memory slider that allows you to ignore the suggested limits or take care of your hardware gta online offers a very satisfactory experience with lots of activities like parachuting street racing and of course the heists you can easily spend a couple hours without noticing the only issues i find are the long waiting load screens and the banning issue for single player modding i encorage you as a gamer to try it i had agreat experience with it
recommended
this is a great game it runs almost perfectly for pc and so far i have found no bugs great game rockstar one of the best i have played recently
recommended
randomly running over people has never felt so great especially when theyre real people real people who are trying to actually play the game

you cant customize the insurgent pickup and you cant use it in the heists  i just wanted to change the stupid color it has  i spent $1350000 for nothing but you can customize the insurgent and use it in the heists but no machine gun  about the game 1010  people are nice no one destroys your car or kills you and steals your money what a lovely community

as soon as i started playing this i was hooked what a game and rockstar definately have done a great job with bringing it to the pc pc specs are as follows i7 4790k 16gb ram gtx 770 2gb benq gsync monitor and i can run the game on quite high settings not highest but im mainly going for smoothness those getting fps issues with a similar setup to mine id recommend downloading the newest nvidia drivers and you should be good to go as well as disabling vsync

hey mates first let me say this is hands down the best gta ive played sense vice city the run down pros  drop dead gorgeous graphics  solid gameplay mechanics most likely ported from max payne 3 great sound track  fun gameplay  has a mmo component  its grand theft auto  good story so far  you can literally do almost whatever you want heres a true story that happened in game i walk into a clothes shop right in the middle of a robbery the robbers try to get away so i chase them down and gun them down i return the goods only to get a discount all i wanted was to buy some clothes but the shop was closed because of the robbery so i turn around shoot the clerk and rob the place my self and got away with it the end  mod support  tons of customization to be done  very long game  the game world feels alive i do however think there could be more wild life  multiplayer is fun when played with friends  small things like rampaging through the streets going on mass murdering sprees and having sex with hookers do have a small effect on the character at least on michel he tends to mention these to his shrink its a nice touch gigity cons  a massive download up to 60 gigs took me half a week to download hope you have a large hard drive hey rockstar theres a thing called file compression you should try it sometime  no revolver handguns or katanas or swords no dual wielding either or flamethrowers really rockstar if your trying to make this game as realistic as possible then why arnt these in you couldeve at least put crappy mall katanas in their all over the place  you are forced into some missions if you try to go home  homes are not customizeable  people wont fight you if your armed the cowards  no custom characters for story mode as far as i can tell  point a gun at a car with someone in it and they run you over in saints row 3 when you did this they were smart enough to get out of the car rather then risk getting their  shot off  cant flip people off outside of car at least i havnt figured it out yet  medics try to revive the people you kill or knock out like really you cant revive someone whos been shot in the head multiple times idiot  a good portion of the buildings are not enterable oh i wasnt aware i was playing the dayz mod ok that was a poor joke i admit it  you can fail missions for the dumbest of reasons  the game can be very taxing on your system make sure you got a powerful rig to run it if your expecting over 60 frames seriously i have 8 gigs of ram on my rigs and it uses 90% of it this is why loaded areas are a thing rock star get this sht fixed i shouldnt need 16 gigs of ram to run this  you cant place trackers on cars that arnt personal like you can in multiplayer  simplistic customization this means your stuck with preset shirts ect not like saints where you could recolor that shirt and put it in different styles also mod cars seem to lack visual cosmetics  drm heavy guess what no sign in no play this means if rock stars service goes down this game is fuuuuuucked why the hell do i have to sign in just to play offline fck this bs  just my personal con but i loathe the driving in this game especially on planes it takes a lot of practice to get use to so would i recommend it ummm at 60$ id say sure but only if your into third person shooters as thats how this game was designed to be played on sale at half off hell ing yes shut up and throw your money at this game you wont regret it
recommended
nothin but awsome
recommended
do you like modding do you like getting banned then this is the perfect game for you

the most recent offering the in the grand theft auto franchise has finally reached the shores of the pc is it worth the wait id say absolutely the graphics are excellent the gameplay sublime and the new songs on the radio are a treat first of all i want to start off by talking about story mode i feel as if the characters are well written and they develop throughout the game in a good fashion it helps the player connect with them emotionally which in turns offers more incentive to progress through the story however i feel the story can get a little stale at times not because of the writing but because of the type of missions everything big is a heist mission which are fun at first but seem draining as time goes on variety would help with this as the previous gta games had more variety in their missions aside from gta iv secondly the graphics are very nice the port is decent enough and with the amd gta patch my 280x was easily able to power it on high settings with little to no frame drops an issue i had frequently was that textures seemed to load slow and had not fully loaded sometimes if i drove fast ending up with me driving my expensive car into indestructible obstructs from time to time this is nothing game breaking but it did get annoying from time to time next the radio stations are better than the previous game in the series gta iv and since coming to next gen consoles and pc there has been a plethora of tracks added and a whole new radio station personally my favourite is nonstop pop and the rock radio but theres a radio station for everyone and if there isnt then theres always self radio self radio is where you can add your own music to the gym so you can traverse through the world of los santos and its surrounding countryside to your very own jams the map of gta v is very big in comparison to gta iv im very grateful for this but as i neared the end of the game i thought that it just wasnt big enough however what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality as theres lots of little neat secrets tucked away and its littered with races and missions to get you exploring the diverse landscape the online portion is a neat addition to the gta franchise and its been demanded ever since san andreas mp took off on the pc whilst this isnt as good as sa mp in my opinion i do feel as if it is sufficient theres a nice leveling up and you can feel your character getting better as you get faster more expensive cars and the more expensive apartments and garages i do feel as if the missions are repetitive online but there is a lot of variety as you can race do adversary mode do deathmatch and many others one feature i didnt like infact i abhor is the character creation i feel having to choose between two parents has stifled the creativity of the community and does a disservice to the online portion in conclusion grand theft auto v is a great game to purchase and youll hopefully thoroughly enjoy your time on the game with the amount of stuff to do and explore and experience it has great graphics stellar radio selection engaging story fun online portion and satisfying gameplay

its a really addicting game youll find yourself playing it without being able to stop you can install mods but only safely if it only affects singleplayer rockstar confirmed the modding thing looks better than the xbone and ps4 versions if your computer can handle it im the type of guy that plays games for the story instead of the pvp crud pvp stuff generally doesnt interest me gta v provides a great fun story while being fluid gameplaywise not joking i give the singleplayer 1010 the multiplayer gets a 810 for me

base game is pretty similar to how it has been for the past 2 years game runs great on low specs machine as well and still looks good so better speced machine will do better in terms of graphics sometimes the entire lobby gets kicked in online hopefully that gets fixed soon some bugs in gta online like getting stuck in the heist passing screen in the flecca job more bugs not listed highly recommended for people who dont have the game yet

this is a gooz game

its the classic gta formula you know and love except bigger and better in most ways anyway  overall the gameplay and movement feel very nice and fluid the best in any gta game so far i did use a controller with autoaim fully enabled though because i cant drive for sht with a keyboard and i cant aim for sht with a controller i tried using both switching constantly between the two but it was too clunky so i decided to stick with the autoaiming controller  each main character has an unique special ability that makes driving  shooting more fun and rewarding than ever  a lot of worldfilling content basically a large amount of content that makes the world feel alive and believable while adding a touch of humor and satire this includes a ton of sidequests dynamic events tv channels internet websites radio stations billboards text messages emails civilian discussions and more  a lot of pc settings to tinker with what youd expect from a good port  firstperson mode is a great addition almost makes the game feel like a bethesda rpg almost  the 3 main characters are great very good acting trevor is hilarious for the most part the story is also great overall if you think of it as a parody  soundtrack is ok some good stuff some less good stuff  while the bad realism has been significantly reduced from gta 4 it still feels a bit too weirdly realistic sometimes like you can barely do any kind of jump platforming at all or do car surfing like in saints row  your characters legs are just gonna give up on life and go into ragdoll mode that can be funny at times but its more of an annoyance than anything and you can even die unintentionally because of it  the minigames such as tennis are a nice addition and are wellmade but again they are a bit too realistic to be fun for more than a few matches the novelty wears off quickly  another thing i found really weird is how you cant permanently save a car in your garage maybe im just used to the saints row garage system but i mean whats the point of modding a car if youre going to lose it forever when you leave it behind the 3 main characters cars are permanent and they spawn back at their safehouse no matter what you do with them so i dont get why theyre not allowing us to save our own cars permanently too  a bit too much of the main story revolves around 2 of the main characters being childishly mad at each other if you absolutely want to know a score id probably give it a 8510 mostly for the sheer amount of content and the good stuff generally outweighting the bad stuff generous maybe a little but its honestly a great game and despite its flaws its still one of the best games of its genre
recommended
amazing game would buy again a
recommended
best game ever
recommended
i would recomend this game as a single player game only the online was one of the best parts on this game untill hackers got control of it hackers are in almost in every lobby and are able to kill you spawn money spawn cars and just ruin the whole game come on rockstar you need to fix this

1000% recomended to be completely honest with yourselves when has any big title game offered anything during a steam sale when it was only released a month ago this is rockstars way of being fair to the people who have already purchased the game and to not make them feel cheated while making this new purchase appealing to new customers they arent required to do anything for this event or to satisfy you and yet you say its not enough that they are greedy please you guys are the greedy ones here learn to accept things happily rather than reject them angrily now go find an actual reason to complain elsewhere its the internet im sure youll find something

there are times when i look at los santos and think why would you even think to build that this is appropriately a thought that i often have about los angeles in gta 5s case the tone is different baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled yknow despair rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit i look at it and i wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so i marvel at the care evident in san andreas gorgeous sunsets in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world in the artfullychosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience everything about los santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years the abiding irony of grand theft auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in los santos hates it there

it does not need any explanation its perfect

very solid port the game looks immensely better than it does on consoles controls are smooth and quick the story is great characters are well written and funny some will prefer the darker story humor and characters in grand theft auto iv and the missions are fun only complaint is the tedious and sometimes completely unneccesary loading screens the game earns a 910 great job rockstar

its unfortunate that some people cant share the same good experience i do i do recommend this game its one of the best ive played by far but trust me when i warn you not to use mods at this point hopefully rockstar will get their rear in gear and allow mods or unban those wrongfully banned i dont believe everyone banned is exactly innocent but i believe the other 95% should be unbanned andor compensated for wasting their money on the game
recommended
super optimized and great fun
recommended
the game itself is fun the only problem i have is when playing offline on steam and trying to connect offline to gta v i get an error message failed to connect to rockstar servers and the only way to play is by having some sort of internet connection so if you have no net and get this message your screwed
recommended
its very fun at first especially when you have friends to play with and talk to but very soon after it gets very boring and the only thing there is to do is run around killing other players for no reason and trying to finish heists that take about 2 hours each to complete the game also takes very long to boot and there are still some minor bugsglitches in the game if you like wasting time buy this game otherwise save your money and buy a game that you wouldnt get so bored of real quick 6510 because its no longer fun bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh

dare i say game of the decade first person mode is great this runs 60 fps on ultra settings on my laptop the video editor is superb the driving is fantastic so much to do the minigames feel like they can all be their own standalone games tennis is way better than wii tennis one mode thats hectic is rally race where theres a driver and a copilot the driver is unable to see checkpoints so the copilot has to through voice chat guide the driver to the exact locations of the checkpoints the gunplay is very superb here it feels better than dedicated first person shooters the online element is great rpg like progression and they have more plannedcasino dlc soon this is a must buy it was worth the wait after having clocked 56 hours in and beaten the main story i still have the drive to get right back on maybe load up some gta o or roam around in single player the whole experience is like being in a high budget movie where you make every choice its the single most amazing game on pc so far if only it could become the industry standard as well as the optimizations on it to make it run at such high graphics on a mid range rig witcher 3s minimum requirements are above the recommended requirements for this game

recommended
cool cool cool after a long wait finally appeared on the pc story mode should be made even longer multiplayer is ok
recommended
not bad might have been amazing if i didnt own it on 3 consoles
recommended
the singleplayer campaign has an excellent storyline with good character development however the campaign itself is fairly lengthy and you may feel that it drags on at times but overall i was happy with the overall experience the multiplayer component is also a nice feature where you can do heists play several different minigames or just explore the streets of los santos it can be a bit annoying to find a full lobby for heists though and one person can majorly screw everyone else on the crew so id recommend playing with friends instead of randoms another issue is that you essentially have to join a new server after every activity heists racing etc which takes an extremely long time to load you may also be forced to load into a new server if a person leaves halfway through a heist mission as a result staying on the same public servers may be a bit annoying unfortunately i agree with many others that the firstperson view is completely unusable nevertheless i enjoyed my time with this game tldr good singleplayer campaign but netcode for multiplayer isnt that great also needs fov slider

goodbye life rip but seriously so many people are complaining about r raising prices and changing prices and all that personally this is the best game i have ever played also like most people i bought this game for the first time when it came out on pc for $6000 can we all just be glad that we can run ultra at 60fps constant well most of us anyways i would pay up to $25000 for this game there is so much to do places to go and things to blow up sure there are a few bugs here and there and lately 95% of online lobbies have modders but that doesnt take away from the amazing fun i have had with this game 5 kim kardashians butts out of 3 pizzas

my journey began at the firestation after beating a few firemen in a fist fightthat i pulled out an smg to ensure victory i found my true calling driving a fck1n& fire truck never before had i experienced such ecstasy and a feeling of i am king many will go crazy in gta v while driving a tank but the real fun is in your local fire department i drove around washing the streets of anyone and everyone who questioned my reign over los santos and then i took the fire truck on a high speed police chase on the high way i never thought driving a 35000 lb vehicle at speeds of 100mph could be so invigorating i was almost falling out of my chair when the cops tried to tackle me off the road in their standard sedan squad cars i decided after the chase had gone on for about 5 minutes to take the truck on a safari mudding in a firetruck oh man there arent words to describe getting air and doing doughnuts in such a beast unfortunatley the cops still were chasing me so i decided to implore the laws of physics and simply ram head on into each cop car it was beautiful and the truck still kept on going i then took it back to the city and noticed it was late at night so i began my cruse of the streets looking to pic up some ladies in true gta fashion this is my only complaint of this game i couldnt pick up these individuals of interest becausee a firetruck is too small for such an ordeal then i realized it was ok this was the gta gods telling me to purge the streets of these fell temptresses so i unleashed the full power of the spray cannon mounted on top of my mighty ride and sent the heritics flying as they were bathed in my holy water in the end i brought home a firetruck to my house rather than a woman i believe this may be a wise choice for us all to do irl
recommended
worth the money for single player online is loaded with hackers you can play in closed sessions with crew and friends though online also gets very repetitive and boring illgotten gains dlc is a complete joke mostly cosmetic crap online needs more heists there are only 5 total but like i said still worth the money just for singleplayer
recommended
amazing game but it should be more clear that you need at least 2 gigs of vram to run the game at 720p

recommended
do i need to say anything its gta
recommended
this game is essentially twoinone so i will separate my review into two parts gta v story mode  a new approach in the gta series that allows you to play with three very different characters while the story is goofy it is very fun with all of the heists you get to do and you grow attached to all three of them i loved the story mode and i think its awesome that rockstar allows us to replay missions without having to start the story mode over gta online  an amazing feature that i absolutely love there are people with hundreds of hours into this game that havent even touched the story mode yet because gta online is so much fun doing missions heists and races are very fun i do think the matchmaking could use some improvement so you dont have empty lobbies and load times could use some improvement as well its very hard to get an actual heist team together but there are forums online that allow you to find dedicated members that will play a heist with you overall this is my most played game on steam and you will see why once you start playing it people that are getting mad at rockstar for banning for using fov mods etc are just mad because they werent more careful when reading the rules of gta online or probably didnt disable it when going from single player to online
recommended
loved singleplayer online needs improvement

i love it i have seen 1 hacker

i would recommend getting this game for the 40 most of the negative reviews come from the fact that lots of people have gotten banned for installing mods yes mods make the game fun i would like to fly about in a iron man suit while going on a murderous rampage but even without mods the game is still a good time waster from playing custom game types found off the internet like murder maze oh even a good stand off between you and some friends vs the cops either way i find the game fun without any custom mods improving my fov however one little thing that annoys me and i dont know if this just affects me but my game randomly freezes so i stay still but other can still move and i unfreeze and there a mile in front of me 910
recommended
i like this game has good quality very fun
recommended
the greatest game of our generation im so far at level 100 in the online and ive put in 190 hours in since the games its release on pc about a month ago and i have not regretted a single minute of it well done rockstar simply well done the only thing i would say more than absolute praise towards the developers is a simple request for them can we please have an experimental vtol flying gunship added into the online experience like id play whatever ridiculously difficult heist youd create in order to get it and pay the millions in gta online cash that would be required to buy it you have the hydra jet already which uses the same mechanics and i wish that i and others could just join in the fun of the hydra jet can we please have this
recommended
new features on the pc version make it absolutely worth rebuying
recommended
me and my friends pre ordered the game and then we had to preload when the game was launched we were so happy it was a way diffrent experience on the pc with more fps we played for hours and hours i would recommend this game 
recommended
better then the console versions in every way the main story has new life brought to it with 1st person and better graphics it has never been so captivating if you havent played through this story yet you are in for a treat if you never go online and just do this you will have still played one of the best games you will ever play with hours of entertainment online now this is where the majority of my review will focus since ive already competed the main story on console my main focus was online and here is what to expect online has so many rises and so many falls teaming up from the get go you can find a way to join up friends tho make sure you both have completed the tutorial as it wont allow you till you do if you have friends on gta online then it will be a blast if you dont you can join a crew or just play with strangers but be warned you will have less fun doing it this way as most of the bigger crews dont help or even talk to you and strangers are sometimes worse what you may find is you will complete a mission together then as you are transported back into a session together you will spawn near everyone else you have strangers amongst this bunch there is a good chance while you hotwire a car they will shoot you in the head for no good reason it can be annoying but it can be fun to spend the next 30 mins hunting them down to get sweet revenge alternatively you can put a bounty on their head for all the other players in that session to get your revenge for you or you can turn passive mode on and no one can hurt you whats more the worse you are to your fellow players the more you become a target on the map deathmatches  can be fun but you do get these custom death matches that are made to create utter ruin for all except those that created it be warned then there is the skill system it doesnt matter if you are a better gamer this game punishes you for simply starting up and taking on other players without having a higher skill bar you character will die easier have less access to guns armor cars run slower for shorter ect to me this was stupid as it was a real handicap that new players would find disheartening and ex veterans would find unfair you may get the drop on these higher leveled people unload an entire clip at them then all they need to do is come up pistol whip you and your dead races  suprisingly you will find some challanging races in this game be sure to try all of them as the 1st time you go on a track you may not expect it to be so intricate off road planes bikes boats even parachuting is a type of race you can do online all of which are fun and well done playing in 1st person if you have a wheel you can switch and use it instantly without need for menus if you have a plane and a stick same thing i personally switch between joypad and keyboard all the time mouse for shooting range joypad for game missions  this is one of the best features missions can be increadibly entertaining requiring real team work to complete often pitting one team against another to complete an objective the only downside to missions can be the waiting time in the lobby to get enough people often you are looking 5 minutes on average letting anyone join to 35 minutes if you want to populate the lobby with people of simmilar skill heists  this is the big one like in the game heists requre missions that set it up and missions that involve the actual heist it is thrilling and exciting to do one and you come away with a lot of money the only downside to heists is that it is only this exiting with friends over headphones you can type talk to each other but with strangers there is no garuntee they will reply if you dont have four friends that play gta then you will have to go with strangers and even tho you can re invite them for the next mission often you will be mixing and matching which means long waiting times in the lobby and unpredictable people in your mission which you have put in game money down to host hackers  this is by far the worst thing about gta online the hackers they are everywhere i use the term hackers loosely as all they have done is downloaded a mod and loaded it up on gta anyone can do it at 1st it might seem these guys are great as they shoot money out of their guns or have parties on a random spawned giant chrome plane but the longer you play the more you see that these guys ruin the entire experience remember that guy who shot you in the head for no reason well lets say you get revenge and run him over oh he doesnt like that so you will have random missiles from the sky hit you for about 10 minutes untill you manage to turn passive mode on then he will come at you with a machine gun that shoots cars as that effects you even in passive mode worse is that he might turn god mode on and drive around in an armoured car with a machine gun this happened just yesterday it tuck a tank to eventually blow up the vehicle after several shots the guy came out 20 headshots later he was still standing there it wasnt till we all said how much of a wuss he was for not being able to fight properly that he left they will randomly spawn dancing jokers around you take all your guns away for that session or even take controll of your character these guys ruin the entire experience rocksteady said they will be banned if cought but no one is catching them i dont even know where to report them and if i do am i reporting the right guy or just someone they have taken controll over often you see text saying that wasnt me even tho you are dying due to sky missiles from that person you then leave session wait 5 minutes to be loaded into a new one and hope another hacker isnt in it overall this game for single player alone is a thumbs up 1010 for online it is mixed as on one hand it could be an experience like no other hitting peaks where you litrally think that was one of the best online experiences youve ever had and lows where you feel like there is no point to working hard in the game if hackers are going to ruin it because im an optamist i give online 610 but really it would get less if done by a proffesional if you get it and dont have many friends on the same game and want the online experience feel free to add me theoneknownasd

i needed a canoe to get up here through all the tears im going to review the game not rockstars business practices bc i like video games and dont pretend to work for forbes in regards to the sale i dont see what all of the butthurt is about companies do that everyday instead of lowering the price they throw something on top so they get the original amount and you get something extra i digress theres a reason this game continues to be $60 its better than every other video game that developers mindlessly pump out this game has endless replayability outstanding graphics physics shooting and driving hundreds if not thousands of things to do or events to participate in free dlc actual worthwile dlc not some bs nobody cares about hundreds of vehicles in which you can customize and place in one of three apartments you can ownyou can own 3 theres several to choose from wonderfully written and acted story mode hopefully with some dlc of its own someday heists work as a team to rob some fools yes they took a while and were not without their own frustrations but theyre here and amazing playing gtav for 30 minutes makes you feel like every other developer doesnt give a sht about their product you can see the amount of skill and pride that went into making this is it really that wrong when somebody makes something so good that they dont need to lower the price because its still better than the brand new stuff from the time this game was released until they make a new one you could buy 5 or maybe 6 cod or madden thats over 300 bux and the hours you put into all of them wont even touch the time put into gta suddenly 60 doesnt seem so bad imo theres a very very short list of games that you would want to play for this many hours and not get bored in conclusion unless youre starvingin which case you should buy food i still might consider starving tho you need this game in your library with some buddies this game is a never ending riot of unscripted awesomeness i own it on 3 platforms and have just shy of a month of gameplay in just gta online it didnt leave my xbox 360 for 11 monthsseriously it will dominate your free time for a while but completely worth it lastly dont listen to the people sobbing over the sale price it says 7999 bc they added a $20 dollar shark card which would bring the total to wait for it 7999 but theyre giving it to you for 60 theres probably a couple reasons they did this yes shark cards dont really cost them anything but now new players can get a little boost when starting gta online its still technically a sale so wipe away the tears and put your big boy pants on regardless of what you think of rockstar their business practices or the price you shouldnt deprive yourself of this experience you can hardly go on a date to the movies for under 60 bucks

who gives a  what they did during the sale it was still a sale they werent being greedy they have the right to not put their game on sale it was the same price as before but you get a bit extra from one of the bundles just appreciate that get over yourselves this game is fantastic hackers arent even as bad as everyone says
recommended
i would say that this is one of the best games so far i love the graphics the game engine and all the little things that makes this game so real i know that 90% of the people are complaining about the banns of using mods and i understand it it really pisses of when you have spent alot of money for this game and it kicks you right into balls when you are having a little bit of fun but why still so many people are installing the mods and playing gta online with mods it doesnt surprise me at all that rockstar is banning people for using mods in public servers if they dont do it you wouldnt play gta online because it would be full of cheaters and hackers please spend that one minute in your life and think you can play safely with mods in singe player but remember to delete them before you enter gta online

cant believe how many cry babies there are giving this a bad review saying how crappy rockstar are for putting the price up & including ingame money then calling it a 25% sale theyre not forcing you to buy it you know so why cry anyway that aside given how old this game now is it is still among one of the best games to play to date & easily the best gta in the franchise so far though nothing will beat the vice city soundtrack also now that heists have been added it makes it even better for online gameplay doesnt get old when youre in the middle of nowhere fire a gun and get a 1 star wanted level gg

packed full of features that has an outstanding story the rockstar editor is a great tool to use that has been improved since the last gta game there are hours of fun gameplay to mess around with to and the freeroam aspect is just amazing online is great and what even makes it better is the community however hackers are occasionally on which can ruin your game but that can easily be fixed by switching server

i could have played this game when it first released in 2013 but i stuck it out and waited for it to come to pc two years later and a few delays but all worth it entirely the game looks amazing and plays really well i guess its kinda good that all the bugs were really worked out by the console players so that we could have a bug free experience im running the game on high settings with a 4790k and a 760 with about 5060fps anyway this is the first game i have ever preordered in my life and i love that i did also its the first steam game that ive paid full price for and it was definitely worth it right now i have about 30 hours in and i still havent run out of things to do

this game is fantastic game of the year there are so many things you can do in this game like crash get in a session with 1 person load load more loading screens find a new session which also has just 1 person in it crash more do a heist get to the end so your teammate can  upcrash and waste an hour of your time i literally spend more time loadingcrashing in this game than i do playing not even exaggerating 1010 would crash again

this game has brought endless hours of fun for my friends and i although since rockstar thought it would be necessary to ban pc users who installed mods was the singlehanded worst ing thing this monster of a company could ever do and its very irritating when i have to check the games integrity of cache more than i should and takes such a long time now ive said this once and ill say this again fix your ing game rockstar its been ed since day one on 360 & ps3 i will still reccomend this game to others although its very buggy laggy crashes more than it should and this really pisses me off i waited for gta v pc thinking just wait until it comes out of pc its going to be great but then when i play it i feel just as restrained as i did on console edit thanks rockstar now fix the damn bugs and multiplayer interface

great game especially after they released a statement claiming that it was a mistake mods are now ok for singleplayer i think but it was still a  move that they pulled maybe it was an accidentv or damage control either way its a good game

910 i play this game apart of a group doing heists and messing around in open world gameplay itselfs is alot of fun if you are considering getting this game its always easy to find players for a group invite system is great never fail to get a team for something i played this game on console i was actually gonna start all over again i realised that i could transfer my console status to pc so i got to carry on where i left off so thats a great feature any console account can be transfered for me i think the game is better on the pc and was well worth the wait i have had alot of fun on this but a decent amount of time in since ive had this game alone and with friends the reason for the 9 is simply when you are playing with friends in a server session driving around in open world killing other players [for example] you would be randomly disconnected from that session but it actually says everyone left so i dont know if thats one of us having issues or weather its a game issue most of the time performance is great so my verdict is get this game

now then now then well us pc players have been waiting 2 or nearly more years for this game q would i say its worth the wait a well i would if rockstar fixed the game the pros the game looks amazing and runs amazingly good the campaign is fun for me i love this game as you can tell by the amount of hours i have the cons heists are sameish and not enjoyable  mainly because of friends that cant run the game well without freezing online needs more heists and weapons should be minimised since it is not possible to carry a  ton of weapons at once also there are a lot of bugs that need fixing so rockstar at the moment i rate this game 510 mainly because the online servers are not very good and the amount of bugs that the game has seriously rockstar all you need to do is fix the bugs and i straight rate this game 1010 ps rockstar sort out your

recommended
very good game game works perfectly no bugs that i can see i recommend this game because you can do whatever it is you like to do in an open world the only downside are the other players looking for a kill and the raging police so be careful while driving down the streets of las santos another thing i should mention the graphics in this game are insanely amazing if you showed a friend a picture you took in this game i wouldnt doubt theyd think it was taken in real life if you like killing innocent people stealing and driving cars or robbing stores this game is for you so what are you waiting for pull out that $60 in your pocket and come join me in this amazing crime

i would reccomend this game for playing the sp like all of the games in the gta series the sp gives the player a vast and diverse world offering endless choices to make doing good or evil however the online version is one of the most bugged games ive seen lately and ive played lots of those eg ghostrecon assassinscreed al games that where pushed to be released giving loads of bugs in this game the online version gives problems connecting to friends and other player loading heists you can invest dollars in a heist only to find out you have to play it with four players wich if you are at the moment playing alone is a big problem but when you go online your friends cant even join if somehow otherplayers manage to join you you get a blackscreen  i was hoping it was just a loadingscreen but no the only thing that was working was my talk key and the others kept waiting for me to start the heist short of if you are into sp games rpg style in a modernworld with some shoting elements then this game is something for you if you want to get a good multiplayer experiens it looks to me you are better of playing payday2 although here in gta you get far more heists and possibillities and unfortunately also the bugs sincerely farathinel

wait till they fix the game before you buyeven alot topend pc having problemsbut will buy as soon as it is fixedgot my refund
recommended
my pc isnt even the best and it handles this game just fine now the only issue is that if you do use mods try not to bring them onto gta online as it will be recognized as a cheat you could simply uninstall them or do what i do and not use them i had just as much fun without any mods another issue is the amount of memory while it is almost 60 gbs its worth it ive had hours of fun on single player and hours of fun online
recommended
i actually liked gta ivs story apparently this makes me a mutant but an angry slavic immigrant who is chasing down a war criminal and killing mobsters in hilarious fits of rage is way better than playing as 4 different people it felt so weird in gta v theyre just like ok now go play as this guy now um what why niko had a character he would just start shouting at people when you were driving like a maniac all these characters are just boring theyre all like wow i want money and power bcuz  _ i guess a lot of people got the game for gta online anyway i played that a bit didnt really get it i guess i was thinking it would be more rpg like where you have a safehouse and you go do scummy criminal things for da lulz but its basically just gtav with other s running around killing people and there are minigames i guess heists would be cool but i didnt get that far i bought pay day 2 for the heists but it was super dumb and i hated it also the levels were poorly designed but gta v is a technical wonder all it needs is a ton of mods to add in actual stakes or something fix the  guns and it would be a pretty cool sandbox game like it would be cool to just play as some guy and like rob people who are trying to go camping or block off the highway at night and make people do demeaning things for the lulz and then have to dodge the cops and other criminals who want to ventilate your body a lot so you gotta ruck it across the mountains and  i dunno what all can be modded but i know gta iv could be modded a lot the cats are cool in this game they run around act mischevious like i said it is a technical wonder the way everything is rendered and the scope and detail of the world but its just really superficial like all the gtas you just run around doing pointless missions until you die then you respawn at a hospital or whatever nothing important ever happens really you can just run forever or drive forever nobody cares you have no responsibilities or duties so it all feels like youre just wasting your own time some survival aspects would make it fun some way to interact with people other than just punching them idk its really really pretty but thats about it i mean you can drive over them but people in this game have like no fear or they run like the flash so you cant really even intimidate stupid bystanders they run so ing fast its like wut everyone is usain bolt the last time i played the game i was the rich irish dude dunno his name so i went for a walk into the back yards of the other rich peoples homes anyway so these three npcs were sitting outside at their pool and i walked over to the pool and stood there and the two women characters were gossipping about something so and sos butt or whatever and then they just stopped talking mid sentence and i stood there and all the npcs sat there and like thirty seconds went by then they all stood up and walked away from the pool into the road for some reason i followed and they started to run they split up so i just followed one of the women and she just walked and walked and walked out of the rich people suburb thing and onto the main highway by the coast and just kept walking eventually we were walking through traffic and then alllll the way over by some other place then she went onto the side walk and kept walking i maybe followed for like an hour expecting something to happen and then nothing happened but then about 20 minutes later she got stuck on a mailbox bcuz next generation gaming anyway i just sorta stood there then i heard some sirens and some dude yelling on a megaphone a cop car came whipping around the corner and hit the mailbox killing her so all in all id say that adventure was a complete success 1010 buy this game now
recommended
very amazing game i would recommend this game to anyone who likes an open world game that you can play alone single player or multiplayer the game also have really amazing graphics something that i have done in this game that i thought was really cool was doing a deathmatch and we all had guns everyone on my team died and it was me verse 3 of them so i took out my sniper and picked off to enemy then the last one i flanked around and spayed him down with my sub machine gun

im thoroughly enjoying my gameplay on gta v online as well as the amazing story however if youre going to buy this game id suggest you play with a controller keyboard players are at a huge disadvantage due to the aim assist feature of controllers this means that if youre up against a controller user youre more than likely going to lose the gunfight simply due to aim assist

within a month of being out ive played gta v every single day its been out and have 130 hours i never played gta v prior on any console i was very excited for it to finally come to the pc like many i was curious about how it would run turns out its one of the best ports there probably is very easy to run 1080p with 60fps and even better it doesnt require a $500 gpu to max out i must say im in love with this game my friends dont play it as much as we did the first week but i continue to play daily the preorder bonus of $1500000 was a good gesture but now that is petty cash once you get into the game you get it all figured out and know how to keep up the cash while maintaining full garages

this just covers gta online the game is a lot of fun you can fool around blow up slaughter countless people and just have a good time this is especially true when playing with friends there are some missions that are very rewarding when done with some friends similar to something like a raid in mmo rpgs but to me the game has flaws that it should not have disconnects of party members during missions loading screens like forever random disconnects where you end up alone on a server loading screens they wouldnt be that bad when not that many every side mission has its own loading screen inconsisencies when it comes to vehicle speed shown in shops and shown on the speedometer although it works as intented id like to have a more realistic looking representation on that meter while the game has its flaws i see my self coming back time and time again just to wreck havoc on this sandbox town 1010 would blow up again

i skipped school and bought the exclusive collectors edition on release bought it again when the disc got circle scratched curse you xbox 360 and bought it a third time when i lost the second disc i then purchased it for the ps4 and the pc thats $370 not including a shark card here and there i have to say that it was all worth it grand thefy auto v is hours upon hours of fun and laughter the excellent story mechanics the outstanding graphics no game before had ever come close to the realism enormous map and the amazing online mode make this game my favorite 1010

absolutely great gta5 was probably one of the most anticipated of the gta series and i have to say its probably one of the best out of the rest i have spent most of my time playing this game when i can i highly recomend it to anyone who enjoys realistic graphics and senery to shooting games this ones a keeper

why its fun you get to kill things rob things fly things shoot things yell at people do missions rob more things steal cars why it isnt fun download takes a hella long time
recommended
as someone that has played this game on the ps3 i have to say this is just a straight upgrade from the console version unlike its predecessor gta v is a succesful pc port
recommended
where do i start oh yea its a grand theft auto game gta v is one of those games you can have fun just roaming around in without getting bored shoot strippers pull off illegal stunts the king of the cheat codes it has it all gta v is a huge rebound from iv in my opinion you have 3 main characters rather than 1 its pretty incredible how interesting the story is and the gameplay 1010
recommended
daaaaaaamn rockstar u guys have optimized the  out of this game we all know the story the content etc running 60 smoooooooth fps and just a generally awesome pc port thanks for not rushing this game this is a new standard for pc ports
recommended
1010 would crash bug again
recommended
the game is buggy as hell and sometimes hard to play because of it this isnt what i waited a year and a half for but im rating it up because its a good game and very fun to play if they fix the bugs and glitches i would be super happy
recommended
i went to singleplayer campain and got my car stuck in a fence then shot my car and it flew up into the sky my verdict of this game is 1010 best flight simulator
recommended
its amazing how much they improved the game when they ported it to pc ps4 and x1 pc is definitely the best version too bad its so glitched at launch
recommended
game is great had it on console and now on pc it is nice having 60 fps and better graphics the game had a couple of problems at the start for me but it all got sorted out pretty quick
recommended
3 delays and 2 year for this day to come the game is a galaxy away from the consoles i guess it was worth the wait after all impressive graphics and doesnt need require a expensive pc to run it at 60 fps or higher well done rockstar
recommended
rockstar did a great job of gta v for the pc i cant wait for icenhancer for it

this game will go down in history
recommended
this game is good and if you have a 4k machine then even better i recommend installing this game on a ssd as it takes a bit of time to load on hdd but it is ok on a ssd samsung 850 evo 1tb for less than 290 from samsung recommended seller on ebay which i think is worth it console gamers can barely manage 4k at 30fps as thats what tvs are good for generally speaking tvs go up to 30hz refresh on 4k models even non 4k models dont go too high and thanks too all the console gamers who beta tested for us with  graphics and so on but now it os our turn to test 60fps @ 4k and the rockstar editor
recommended
rockstar servers are improved on the pc version but the community acts as of childrens with special needs constant lobby leaving and perhaps server crashing and lack of intelligent players makes hiest an epic fail captureing random fun death moments in gta is now ruined because of the new updated video capture mode you have to stage or set record for a death montage action replay doesnt capture your death even if you hold down and a while dying very dissapointing it looks as the same mods will be released but alot more limited on the games engine looks and plays great you will love this game but i wanted more better more animations and incaps from dying npcs again like in gta iv perhaps a gore mod that will never happen
recommended
this game is the best grand theft auto i have ever played and one of the best games i have ever played i played it on the xbox 360 originally however compared to pc that fealt so stripped down to what it really is and im seeing that now the story isnt the best ever but it has some intresting characters like trevor a very well acted out psychopath the gameplay is great however atleast for me the starter keybinds are a bit wonky lots to do esspecially if you have never played it before and its your first time playing it ever the graphics are amazing on almost any graphics level to be honest and its a pretty stable game the only issue is that for windows users the game tends to wanna crash and have issues however rockstar did say they would eventually fix this issue and so other than that this game is fantastic
recommended
its a fun game worth the money

community is a bunch of asses but thats to be expected with the grand theft auto community the story mode is great though just a few kinks and glitches to iron out if you arent a total  give me an add and llllllllllllllllets play

awesome game the pc launch issues are resolved and the game works perfectly it is well polished and other than long load times it runs very well it is nice to actually play a completed game for a change it seems the pc world is flooded with paid alphas and betas these days with large disclaimers telling you to expect problems i guess it was worth the wait to finally play a finished game the graphics are amazing and there is such a large variety of things to do that i never get bored playing those 2 things alone make this a winner

 warning review based solely upon storymode performance  ive been waiting for pc release since it launched on consoles sans the firstperson viewmod i can say with 100% confidence after only playing the story for about 10 hours that it was worth every ing bit of waiting those two years for this to release on pc  in every single regard buttery smooth 60fps @ 1080p with everything cranked sky high except aa fxaa enabled msaa & txaa disabled even when i start blowing  up the fps doesnt drop below 4550 this is hands down rockstars masterpiece gta v runs better on my pc than any other gta before it ive waited so long for this and ive yet to be disappointed still cant believe it 1010 my pc specs amd 8350 @ 45ghz 16gb 2133mhz ram 480gb intel ssd evga 780ti sc

i have play this game for over a year on the xbox 360 not once did i complain about the heist the lack of vehicles lack of missions and etc i didnt care about all that i cared more about the experience my friends and i doing dumb sh in gta online first of all the single player aspect of the game is great it doesnt follow gta 4s mistake of repeating the same type of missions ex follow target kill target go to place to kill target etc each mission in gta 5 feels unique especially since switching character was a thing and makes every mission unique and diverse and how rockstargames used this aspect was very well executed and it made sense in the missions for gta online i really enjoyed what i had played on my lastgen xbox 360 the experience of an open sandbox game and with your friends planning epic planes and gettaway cars because my friends and i were going to rob a convinience store that sounds stupid and it was but that was the whole point of gta online having fun in anyway possible especially with your friends gta online isnt ment to be played alone i recommend you bring a friend with you if you dont have any friends then make some friends everything i have explained about gta online was on lastgen i cant begin to explain how much the pc version captures everything that i loved and gives me more a more rich and visual improvement over the lastgen console personally i dont see a huge difference between the currentgen consoles and the pc nor does it matter what matters is that everyone who has been waiting for this on the pc may now get to enjoy one of the greatest openworld sandbox games on the pc gta 5 and online  1010
recommended
amazing at 4k and 2k resolutions a steady 60 fps all the time online or off its a master piece rockstar has done it again so worth the wait 1110as great as it looks and plays when the game isnt crashing or freezing up your whole pc when you alt  tab out or just about do anythingetc purple textures every where please put out a patch already to address all the crashing and freezing issues me and my 6 friends are all having we all have way more than enough windows 7 gpuramcpuetc power to play this at ultra and 60 fps 14401600p except 60 fps at 4k fix asap

recommended
great game especially after they released a statement claiming that it was a mistake mods are now ok for singleplayer i think but it was still a  move that they pulled maybe it was an accidentv or damage control either way its a good game

910 i play this game apart of a group doing heists and messing around in open world gameplay itselfs is alot of fun if you are considering getting this game its always easy to find players for a group invite system is great never fail to get a team for something i played this game on console i was actually gonna start all over again i realised that i could transfer my console status to pc so i got to carry on where i left off so thats a great feature any console account can be transfered for me i think the game is better on the pc and was well worth the wait i have had alot of fun on this but a decent amount of time in since ive had this game alone and with friends the reason for the 9 is simply when you are playing with friends in a server session driving around in open world killing other players [for example] you would be randomly disconnected from that session but it actually says everyone left so i dont know if thats one of us having issues or weather its a game issue most of the time performance is great so my verdict is get this game

best game i have ever played the story is amazeing and the multiplayer is also good but i would like too have some mods like a life mod for multiplayer or else
recommended
the game needs no review by now all i can say is rockstar did it well im not even a little bit sorry of the 60 i payed for it the action the driving the humor and the world and all the live tha comes with it all the explorations al the little touches like wet clothes all the interesting and beautifull locations the world is actually bigger than i expacted at first at 62 hours spent in game i havent even tried out the movie editor and i spent maybe 1h in online i think there has not yet been a game with such great pricecontent ratio no monthly fees no  microtransactions just good old gta oh another thing that amazed me i was expecting for the game to be well optimized since i read that this is taken care of by the same team that did it in max payne 3 but to have most of the stuff on high very high some on ultra even and still run the game on 1080p with no problems on my 5 years old pc i5 750 8gb ddr3@1333 hd7870 the only the investment that i did on my pc since 2009 was 1 year ago with getting a hd7870 for 90 and additional 4gb ddr3 1333 for 30 im still blown away sometimes how beautifull it can look and that this is running smoothly on my pc just for comparasement sleeping dogs for example looked worse the world was smaller and alot more boring and for sure it did not felt so real the gameplay got repetitive really quick i had to run that game on mendium and not even sure if i was able to run it normally on 1080p gtav is a game that belongs into every gamers library 910 at minimum
recommended
game was delayed cause not good enough for pc x360ps3 alpha testing phase begins game still delayed for pc xboneps4 beta testing phase about to begin game delayed again hiests gonna come with pc on this date game delayed again game finally here cant even get past the social club bug which cant be fixed apperantly 1010 would delay again

not worth $60 wait for sale in 5 years
recommended
this game has brought endless hours of fun for my friends and i although since rockstar thought it would be necessary to ban pc users who installed mods was the singlehanded worst ing thing this monster of a company could ever do and its very irritating when i have to check the games integrity of cache more than i should and takes such a long time now ive said this once and ill say this again fix your ing game rockstar its been ed since day one on 360 & ps3 i will still reccomend this game to others although its very buggy laggy crashes more than it should and this really pisses me off i waited for gta v pc thinking just wait until it comes out of pc its going to be great but then when i play it i feel just as restrained as i did on console edit thanks rockstar now fix the damn bugs and multiplayer interface
recommended
having a blast highly recommended i have on the ps4 also but i prefer mouse and keyboard so i bought for pc also

the pc port of gta 5 has been great so far and thats saying alot i remember when i got gta 4 for pc when it first came out and it barley even worked the graphics look great if you can play it at max then do it the load time into online is quick and so far i have not encountered any bugs you can really tell that rockstar took alot of time and effort into making sure this game would be ready by launch and im glad to say it exceeded my expectations
recommended
this game fing rocks if you dont own this game youre missing out rockstar keep rocking

recommended
if you want to have your mods and risk getting banned be my guest but besides the point gta v is a great game definitely best on pc
recommended
dowloaded a mod that would fix some graphics issues i was having got banned after the next patch i dont think theres away to remove the mod either
recommended
when gta v first released for consoles i tried to ignore it and all the hype that surrounded it as i knew it would be a long wait for a pc port to be released however even after all of the delays i still feel as though that wait was worthwhile rockstar have clearly put a lot of effort into making sure this game isnt just a shonky pc port in fact its obvious that a lot of time has been spent optimising to ensure the game runs as well as possible on high settings i played at 4k and my 2x780tis were able to maintain a constant 60fps on very high settings  something a lot of less visually impressive games struggle to accomplish i can certainly see why a lot of critics and fans have deemed the pc release the definitive version the game looks incredible at moments although not necessarily as pretty as some less openworld aaa titles it does also suffer from some quite obvious popin at times but otherwise its visually a very pleasing experience as far as the actual story is concerned the dialogue is hilarious at times and the characters are well designed to match i do think that franklin was the weak link but otherwise the storytelling was engaging and entertaining throughout ive only finished the story mode so its now on to the online where im sure the experience will be similarly enjoyable highly recommended
recommended
utterly brilliant
recommended
in the latest patch i got a lot of lags in the game and please fix it because when the game got released i didnt had lags

alright so after watching the so called princess robot bubblegum i have to say that it is definitely in my top 10 anime ever watched right after the one the only highschool dxd and maybe highschool of the dead let me say somethings i liked and disliked in the anime i like the story that the writer of the anime put into it you can really relate to the characters and you actually feel really close to them another thing i really liked about prb was that they know about todays clichs in anime and they embrace it fully by letting people see it can still be a deep and touching story the anime also shows some inside to economics by telling you how to get more money in merchandising and other relateable things like that the things that i dont like are really hard to state since prb had me laughing the entire way through it one thing i dont like is i guess the length of the episodes since you come to expect around 20 minutes of pure gold but we dont get it in this hidden gem so thats kind of a bummer so my final verdict for princess robot bubblegum is a solid 910 would reccomend to watch with some popcorn and a cold drink now we all have to hope for the next season of prb i sure am hyped now
recommended
ive waited so long so so long im so happy that is all thank you

from the forums friendly reminder of how moderation usually works order of events 1 people make many threads discussing the same topic 2 moderators merge all similar threads 3 forums maintain some semblance of order 4 people go into a rambling confused tirade about free speech forgetting that this is a private forum and censorship before hitting the post history link on the right hand side of the page and locating their posts there are redirects to inform users where the threads were merged to however during events such as release patches updates promotions etc we forego redirects since we would get 23rds of the page fill with redirect links tldr we do not censor posts before creating a new thread check if there is already one discussing your topic similar threads get merged rockstars mods are great sensible people and the only people whining about the game are people who dont understand the rules

ive played gta v on the xbox and was blown away once i got it here however i will never think about going back to the console for this masterpiece of a game it runs fantastic looks amazing and the 1st pov makes it feel like a completely new game this is how you port a game this is how you make a game it has everything you could possibly want no point in reviewing the game itself if you dont know what it is by now then it obvisouly is not something youd enjoy suffice it to say this version is the version to own it runs on a wide variety of pcs  up and down the spectrum if you can run it with the settings turned up wow you are in for a treat shut up and give them your money you wont regret it

grand theft auto 5 is a remastered version of an insanely popular last generation title which has been built from the ground up for current generation consoles and also ground up on a separate build for pc owners given the modding community has been enormous for the franchise since the release of open world gta 3 each release to pc in this franchise really does generate a lot of interest in this iteration we have franklin michael and trevor who live in the region of los santos though we dont get to go to liberty city or vice city we do get a little bit of time in the state of north yankton canada two of the three protagonists have a big job together and generate some history prior to the events of gta 5 and this leads into the story where michael encounters his new adopted son franklin the story is definitely the most interesting in the series and it really does run like a dream for pc owners the story goes for a considerable amount of time but i played basically all the easily available missions and had it complete in less than 35 hours there are a few bugs and the steam forums seem flooded by technological noobs and theres a serious issue with sli but the game really does pay respect to the pc community for the first time from the games developer the game features an all new angle which allows the player to connect to the protagonist a lot more and because of the new first person mode i found myself less obligated to go on rampages and to drive well in fact driving is so much easier with this new camera angle for the first time since gta3 was released it really does add a lot of value to the game but its not refined like most first person shooter game development companies release  i hope this will be more apparent in the next game in the franchise we also have a stock market by which if you arent familiar with what you can earn by investing in which company in which time youll miss out on much of the postcampaign content the system itself is intriguing educational and fun i ended up having all three characters have about 170 million dollars thanks to the stock market and one of my characters will be earning half a million for every week that passes so i definitely cant complain youre able to buy properties visit bars strip clubs play sport buy weapons and of course pick up hookers the controversy has officially passed for me in that the ability to be able to access the mature content isnt really interesting anymore  even though its really important to the game if a gamer is playing only for the mature content and violence im willing to bet that player isnt legally old enough to play the game i was hoping we would see smarter ai firetruck missions ambulance missions and vigilante missions and all of those features we saw in san andreas and vice city but i was disappointed the wanted system is easy to evade and presents no real challenge there were no additional missions besides taxi missions and the game is really quite easy as with my previous points it doesnt pack a lot of interesting content besides the main campaign and a few extras but the game veers towards being an online focused game i applaud this but i dont at all consider myself a multiplayer player though its currently one of the most popular online games in the worldi feel all these things along with proper sli support are the only things this title is missing and its otherwise a complete version of any gta game perhaps for the next title having completed this game on xbox 360 and pc now i can highly recommend this title to any adult who shares an interested in the franchise nostalgic or not the story is totally worth it and the aaa pc release is beautiful and scalable to many different computer hardware configurations its a title thats worth having in your collection im really looking forward to gta 6 and the possibilities of playing around in an equally beautiful north yankton liberty city or vice city
recommended
worth it

its gta v you should already know if you want it or not as for the pc version looks great runs great has a ton of options and features this is a great port the usual suspects of loudmouths are having problems this is what happens when you have 1m sales in a day but if you have a modern pc with uptodate drivers you should be fine dont expect to be able to crank everything to max though theres a lot of options that have a huge perf hit for a relatively minor visual improvement be wary of ultra grass and extra high resolution shadows you crazy people with titan x sli should be fine though p

fantastic game with loads of opportunity and replayability best game of past few years for me

i dont know what im doingkinda how i feel like in la nice people though i want to play more of gta but i just get lost
recommended
the magnitude of the map and just how open the world is for exploration and causing chaos makes the game extremely fun even with no goal or mission at all the port is very well done and plays well controls with kbm are clunky the first hour or two but you get used to them fast no regrets for full price on this one the hype was real
recommended
best version of the game ever

i hated it initially i thought it was poorly optimized trash then i installed 154 catalyst beta released specifically for gtav for amd cards and it made all the difference im playing the game 5760x1080 triple monitors eyefinity crossfire 2x 7950s with a i74770k and 16gb or ram on an ssd its now a dreamlike butter the 154 beta driver made all the difference

with all the push backs for this game it was worth the wait and pain at the same time i dont know how the consoles versions look like but let me tell you the pc version is beyond worth preordering i love it its thee best grand theft auto game ever so far
recommended
the game is giant full of content innovation the storyline is interesting every mission is interesting nothing you do feels repetitive the game easily immerses you into its world having 3 characters to me feels like rockstar covered every single point of view that you usually get from gta protagonists franklin for the times of gta sa michael for every other protagonist and trevor for those crazy rampages you used to go on for no reason just because its fun to kill people currently gta online is full of annoying bugs and is barely playable the servers put you in with people all across the world chinese australian which makes playing with them impossible due to lag and ruins the overall experience rockstar has a lot to fix before online becomes fun but you can still go ahead and give it a try

waiting for this to arrive on the pc was well worth the wait i am running an fx8350 radeon 290 4gb & 16gb of g skill ram with all settings completely maxed at 1080p with the exception of antialiasing at 2x the game runs very smoothly with no lag once loaded and no slow downs whatsoever for me this game looks and runs far better than watch dogs ever did gta v for the pc is ultimate proof that developers can optimise to run well for both amdintel radeongeforce cards
recommended
this is the best game ive played in decades and is more entertaining than watching my top 5 favorite movies the 1st person mode makes the game truely immersive

recommended
i cant stop playing this game send help pls 953648284710 too much fun its boring
recommended
possibly one of the best sandbox games of all time that has an amazing soundtrack and unforgettable storyline the multiplayer is also very fun but it is practically required to play only with friends since the whole community is very aggressive and tend to kill you constantly and harass you only problem is that the game tends to freeze very frequently if you play it for an extended amount of time but hopefully this issue will be fixed
recommended
best gta installment yet no online mods or trainers yet and i personally dont expect any due to rockstar making gta online capable of increasing how much money you have via micro transactions if you came for online mods get gta4 or if you dont mind offline only mods in gta5 then get gta5
recommended
well i think its been long enough to write a review the only issues i have with gta v pc is the first person fov especially when driving it makes me sick literally simulation sickness i hope they expand the slider to include fov for both first person walking and driving to at least 90 degrees i have also heard of people getting banned for using single player mods like the fov hack to address part of the problem mentioned above i have used these mods myself but have never logged into multiplayer even once mods or no mods so if i discover my multiplayer account has been banned once i finish singleplayer and finally do log in for the first time there will be hell to pay however i suspect the people complaining of a ban did not disable the mods before logging into multiplayer this is pure speculation however onto the good stuff this is everything gta v was said to be on pc this is the definitive edition for sure graphically speaking however with first person feeling more like broken gimmick than an actual feature i am rather disappointed it was what i was looking forward to the most i would recommend this game to anyone into the gta franchize its a whole lot of fun rampaging around and causing trouble the story is phenomenal and the same old satire and parody of our real world politicalsocial problems are all there i find playing gta helps remove pent up stress after all who doesnt want to blow up the creator of life invader p but be warned do not use mods if you play online while we can know theres nothing rockstar can do to stop hacking and mass banning people is a stupid practice that serves no purpose much like the drug war avoid poking the bear

recommended
1010 would sell csgo skins again
recommended
do i really need to review have you really not bought this game yet come on its gta v the only reasons you could possibly have for not owning this yet is your computer cant handle it you cant afford it right now you realize your internet wouldnt be good enough to run it anyway you think its too violent and offensive you are waiting for them to get the online to run smoothly which for the most part they have already fixed this so there is really no need to wait any longer your a whiney  and you cant enjoy things that are fun this isnt your type of game you dont like the genre your waiting for it to go on sale you played it on console and you dont like the idea of replaying games i had it on 360 as well but i see no harm in replaying especially now that they have heists and stuff ________________________________________________________________________________ if you havent met any of these reasons i listed please enlighten me why dont you own this game yet seriously leave a comment i am curious ________________________________________________________________________________ if you dont like this game it is not the game that is wrong it is you if you meet any of the reasons i listed above for why you dont already own it then you probably shouldnt buy it because honestly this game is not for you also you should not buy it if you are impatient very critical gets unproportionally upset about tiny flaws easily offended going to give a negative review because you lose connection to a server every once in a while on an otherwise nearly perfect game while the game has mainly fixed problems with disconnections you must understand that with the number of people playing at a time right now it is to be expected that servers will lag [compare to cod]

i play this game to much send help

recommended
rockstar has made no attempted to fix issues with the games launcher system currently does not work for lots of users edit after about 3 hours of installing things going through forums and checking game files the game started to work though it shouldve at the beginning the game is visually stunning even on some lower resolutions and the character switch function although locked for the tutorials is super fun to mess with

recommended
i was planning on getting a job working out and learning to cook but instead i got on gta and did a job went for a run and ate snacks 1010
recommended
very fun game too play
recommended
return to form for gta right from the start you are hit in the face with the over the top action that has made gta the pillar of gaming that it is from there it only gets better first off you have to talk about the visuals they are amazing there are moments where i forget im controlling the action and not watching a movie the frame rate is buttery smooth dynamic lighting highly detailed textures and so on make gta v feel alive and begging to be explored so far im only a little ways into the story but it already is engaging and im excited to see how it all unfolds without feeling burdened by it dont pass on this gta is the crown jewel of gaming and gta v once again proves why
recommended
this is the best game ever d
recommended
its cool
recommended
thx to all the peasants for betatesting
recommended
my  &  great game overall runs well already played through the story multiple times so the story mode is pointless but still fun fun but not so fun to play in online if you dont have any friends who own this game pls add me if you want to play d  fov in first person should be higher  little too heavy to run even with some high end pcs overall rating 14042015  810
recommended
ive been waiting since the release of the ps3 version for this and i can say that im happy i waited i havent encountered any problems so far and im glad the online is running as smoothly as it is now i probably wont ever pick up the ps3 version again
recommended
the long wait for the pc version has payed off the game runs silky smooth and looks great even on my modest hardware with only 1gb video memory im glad i waited instead of buying a console just for this
recommended
runs smooth on my amd phenom x2 and geforce gtx 560 storyline is great and online has no lag
recommended
absolutely fantastic optimization even with a midrange gaming laptop i get 40ish fps @ 1080p
recommended
game is playable for single player needs work only a couple of down sides it crashes when you are doing missions in single player and cars need a little work all around go game just needs some updates
recommended
ya so 88 just crusin down the street in my 64 awesome game bought it for 360ps4 and now pc and still no regretz
recommended
o m ing g best game ever in computer
recommended
the 1st person view d
recommended
never felt this anxious and hyped for a game in a long while and the best of it all is is that it was worth the wait and the hype is lived up to i want to thank my mom for giving birth to me to allow me to experience this great game i want to thank the console peasants for alpha testing it on xbox 360 and ps3 and beta testing it on xbone and ps4 1010 would have a sleepless night before a release date again
recommended
it has cats in it 1010
recommended
you forget a thousand things every day pal make sure this is not one of em

recommended
aqu4botz recommended 116 hrs on record posted 13 april last year preordering watch dogs was the worst decision this year preordering gta v was the best decision the game floats like a butterfly stings like a bee runs so fast even console peasants can`t see
recommended
its okay watch dogs is better though
recommended
loading times are annoying
recommended
who makes this garbage it looks like a game that was meant for gays i hope it stops existing soon like the democrats
recommended
its the best game ive ever played
recommended
it took me so long to right this almost 17 months and i can now say it is well worth the wait
recommended
three words worth the wait
recommended
1010 would kill cops for hours again
recommended
88 would wait again
recommended
the delays were worth it 3010 more reallistic than life
recommended
best hooker massacre simulator of 2015 1010 dorritos mtn dew ign
recommended
just the 1920x1080 and 60 fps is a new game
recommended
best game 2015 if you didnt buy game yet do it now
recommended
this game is alot of fun better optimized than many other games in a similar situation i would not recomend it for anyone with higher than 1gb of vram due to the fact that you will likely have to play at 1440x900p overall very fun and gta online is amazing
recommended
theres a dad in it buy it
recommended
1010 would get rekt by big  armored cars again
recommended
runs fine on very hight 1080p fx6300 45ghz r9 280 oc 8gb ram 1333mhz but if u have 4gb nevermind the game just cant run on 4gb about the game 1010 its gta i dont need to explain it
recommended
where is my pre order money   i have the code but its already used and i dont get the preorder money in game i bought gta v yesterday 14th
recommended
very nicely ported over to pc with an extensive list of graphics options cant comment on keyboard and mouse because i spent 20 quid on a controller for games like this a while back and much prefer using it make sure your drivers are up to date and dont try and push the options beyond your hardware and you should be fine reading some of the wailing and gnashing of teeth at launch i can see why rockstar arent that keen on releasing for pc
recommended
after 19 months of beta testing in console finally we have the final game on pc thank you for that masterpiece
recommended
run at ultra settings and doesnt even lag and no freezing unlike other games ive played in ultra settingsbecause of fps and good punk rockcrossover music
recommended
bought the game twice for xbox 360 once for xbox one and once for pc 1110 would buy this game again
recommended
amazing game you can do evrythinbut loads are to long for everyone
recommended
great optimisation if you have the latest drivers from amd and nvidia great graphics great storyline followed up with an excellent online hopefully gta v should recieve some mods down the road from now but until then im sure this game will give me 100s of hours of fun well worth the asking price
recommended
very nice game
recommended
having sex in first person mode 1110 ign would sex again
recommended
worth the wait 
recommended
i preordered this game played the  out of it the day it came out and the next and i have 18 hours on the game in 2 days 1010 would smack an old lady in the face with a baseball bat again 
recommended
if you intend to play this game online you better have very good internet connection
recommended
great
recommended
why its fun you get to kill things rob things fly things shoot things yell at people do missions rob more things steal cars why it isnt fun download takes a hella long time
recommended
as someone that has played this game on the ps3 i have to say this is just a straight upgrade from the console version unlike its predecessor gta v is a succesful pc port
recommended
eat sleep get shot by 6 year olds repeat
recommended
this is literally the most diverse game i have ever played you literally can do almost anything its like the most realistic simulation that acctually simulates anything you might do in everyday life as well as living a thug lyfe buy this game now
recommended
overall the pc version is 110% better than the console versions id recommend it if you enjoyed the game on console and the only issue not a huge deal that i have is the flight controls theyre just kinda hard to get used to at first i went ahead and changed the controls so that the mouse controls the pitch and stuff for the planes and helicopters also i turned the sensitivity for the mouse during flight way downjust gives it an easier feel i think murdered a hooker with a hatchet 1010
recommended
great game but im having some serious issues 1 the game crashes after about1020 minutes of playing 2 its totally laggyunplayable i just get about 510 fpssometimes maybe 20 even tho i have the requerements
recommended
two years for a pc port and they still release it with the mouse input tied to frame rate for that laggy crappy port feel 1010 would lag again
recommended
community is a bunch of asses but thats to be expected with the grand theft auto community the story mode is great though just a few kinks and glitches to iron out if you arent a total  give me an add and llllllllllllllllets play
recommended
my god its awesome
recommended
grand theft auto is the popular and recomendent game in the world and i very like to play this game and i tell that this game is the best
recommended
its amazing how much they improved the game when they ported it to pc ps4 and x1 pc is definitely the best version too bad its so glitched at launch
recommended
game is great had it on console and now on pc it is nice having 60 fps and better graphics the game had a couple of problems at the start for me but it all got sorted out pretty quick
recommended
3 delays and 2 year for this day to come the game is a galaxy away from the consoles i guess it was worth the wait after all impressive graphics and doesnt need require a expensive pc to run it at 60 fps or higher well done rockstar
recommended
rockstar did a great job of gta v for the pc i cant wait for icenhancer for it
recommended
cash fam
recommended
this game will go down in history
recommended
the best game ever
recommended
first day first my bad impression soooo to be honest i would not call this a review there bye what did i find out in the what would it be 3 minutes not much driving a car with a and d not my cup of tea if you out in time enough you probably will find out what key combination needs to be used where i am not into controller games and not liking this it looks kinda cool and probably a lot of people will like it but for me this is just a xbox or ps whatever flashy game that has weird controls like left x arrow up lolstick left yada yada and that translates to me guessing when there is a popup somewhere on screen telling me that wait what letter i was still running to find out what i needed to do its me i know im old i know 50 euro through the drain you know if you are into these games have fun from my perspective i would not reccomend it but i guess i am the oddball here so i changed my vote to yes second day im a dork i know ive been shouting and cursing to get further in the game i have to do everything 5 times before i understand what to do sooo im not good at it it is however as beautiful as they say its almost like a movie my wife even wanted to know what movie i was watching that good does it look for a nongamer the gameplay its still a mess and obviously geared towards the controller play it is playable and i am convinced that i can get deeper into the game so im in ill keep updating my review during the gameplay
recommended
after making bilions of dollars and all that time to port the game for pc rockstar failed to deliver a stable release i am unable to even start the game simply because someone didnt do their job this is very dissapointing
recommended
just buy it
recommended
i avoided playing or watching anything about the game on the consoles and just waited for the pc release so happy i did they got everything about this game right pc port is nearly perfect this is what a pc game should be game of the year without question i was annoyed when they delayed the game twice but if this is the final result then more games should be delayed ive had it crash twice but i have overclock sli setup so it may be my computers fault not the game i have gtx670 sli and get over 60fps at 1600p with everything at high or very high except textures at normal as 2gb vram is not enough it will run with high textures but you can see the stuttering as it constantly swaps the frame buffer from system ram one thing i did notice is that sli scaling is not as good as it could be one spot i tested i got 52fps with one card but only 63fps with both i did find that turning on msaa 2x with one card killed my fps but with both cards it only took 2fps hit what i found the best in terms of visuals and performance is to run the game at 25601600 and use nvidia downsampling to 19201200 this gives a much sharper picture with less performance hit that using 1200p and msaa different setups may have different results hopefully a driver update can squeeze out some more sli performance cant say enough good things about this game though everything that i didnt like about gtaiv is fixed and improved some of the best writing and voice acting ive ever seen havent tried online yet so i cant comment like i said this is what a game should be and a game like this is why we buy high end pc and not crappy consoles as others have said thanks for the consoles for beta testing for us buy this game and show developers why pc is the best platform for games
recommended
this port is great  i played it with gtx650ti all high and got 3170 fps all the girls in strip club is suck keep talking about your master race thou

note for 415 regarding current state of game  game still has issues for a lot of people i would wait until these issues have been sorted out before buying review so i am no gta fan boy or even rockstar games and to be honest i didnt think i would care for this game so much i bought to play with a friend online and figured why not game probably ok and has a lot of things to do from what i see well after playing for a few hours i was pretty hooked theres a lot to do now i do imagine i will get bored little later once it gets very competitive but i think i will get my monies worth till then however my friend was unable to launch the game as of yet he is experiencing a lot of issues where currently they have not found a workaround from what i can see so that is kind of lame i do recommend this game though however i would be skeptical about buying at the moment if you have a friend that has the game and you are sure you are going to buy it if it works create new user meeting workaround standards have gta5 on external and put in steamappcommon folder reason 60gig install delete temp steam data google search on how to restore backup games to library then test launch on your computer and see if its a fixable work around or un fixable either that or wait till fix notes appear  pros good optimized graphics 4k possibility smooth frame rate excellent voice acting first person mode for a excellent immersion experience third person mode fun offline and online game play elements manymany actives singing in the shower own your own place and garage with perks funny shows to watch on tv mouse steering option lots of musicradio station content customer music library if desired online progression tesla car clone the ds clone land vehicles cycles motorcycles trucks haulers cars suvs tanks apc monster trucks aerodynamic vehicles jets helis assorted planes sea vehicles jetskis assorted boats submersed vehicles subsscuba many weapons negs game currently has lot of launchrunning issues for bout 20% of who bought the game very big install long loading times unless very good internet  high end gaming comp possible time out issues at any time if session is lost to mp loads singleplayer instead of going back to main menu may be a option for this can encounter some serious laggers who are playing then troll you sometimes difficult to get groups for certain events can encounter griefers but not as bad as apb for anyone who knows about that first person car mirrors dont work right very low rez reflection and only shows environment cars can have that touchy turn and accelerate on keyboards either no throttle or full throttle or full steering a direction would hope for a little more immersion such as blinkers and a throttlegas control option mouse steering can be really touching difficult to use as a primary method all females are transvestites i suppose strippers dont strip specially when invited to apartment some features missing for good immersion ease of use cant remember the main one that slipped my mind  conclusion if the game works worth it still however would invest into controller for driving racesflying on mp not sure if you can switch back and forth actively have not tested 910
recommended
this is definitely by far the best version of gta v you could ever play now only if in the future theyd be willing to give it dx12 and vulcan support one can dream right it would be crazyness all over the place this game is absolutely part of my top 5 games ever along with super smash bros castlevania sotn world of warcraft and the crew at full price it is worth every single penny 9810
recommended
i know how a few words dont make a review but if you really need to know why to buy this game you really shouldnt
recommended
best geme vere created buy ppls with unlimited talent
recommended
already played on ps3 appart some minor launch bugs everything is nice and looking good i cant say really good untill i get a new pc ^^ cant say much about multiplayer if it becomes like on consoles you wont have much fun outside friend sessions 90% griefing so what else could i say its gta and now get the  off and play the damn game already
recommended
if you are having trouble at launch like the rockstar client crashes and an error message occurs i had the same problem to fix this i went into device manager > display adapters i have intel hd 4000 and an nvidia card > disabled the nividia card > started up the gta client it then loaded without crashing > then i quickly enabled the nvidia card before the actual game launched i know that the desciption isnt the best but i hope it helps anyone with the same error i had
recommended
i have the exact recomendated settings and works decently as promised 60 fps all high 1080p make shure to defrag and optimize ur hdd after install you will need in total 130gb or it wont istall after install it will only ocupy 61gb in this game a ssd makes a big difference other than that is gta5 online is very very good and addictive

i would reccomend this game for playing the sp like all of the games in the gta series the sp gives the player a vast and diverse world offering endless choices to make doing good or evil however the online version is one of the most bugged games ive seen lately and ive played lots of those eg ghostrecon assassinscreed al games that where pushed to be released giving loads of bugs in this game the online version gives problems connecting to friends and other player loading heists you can invest dollars in a heist only to find out you have to play it with four players wich if you are at the moment playing alone is a big problem but when you go online your friends cant even join if somehow otherplayers manage to join you you get a blackscreen  i was hoping it was just a loadingscreen but no the only thing that was working was my talk key and the others kept waiting for me to start the heist short of if you are into sp games rpg style in a modernworld with some shoting elements then this game is something for you if you want to get a good multiplayer experiens it looks to me you are better of playing payday2 although here in gta you get far more heists and possibillities and unfortunately also the bugs sincerely farathinel

if you are reading this reviews then you are just boredcause aint no way in hell that you are in doubt to buy this game or notrockstar waits for ya money 2010

i would like to leave a review but cant play i have to link up social club to steam in order to play but there dosnt seem to be an option for it after all this time of delays and waiting this is what i get why cant rockstar make it simple after playing it on ps3 id still recamened it if you can get it working also it appears to be a steam issue a friend bought the game through a site that dosnt involve stem and is playing the game edit logout then log back in on steam that worked for me
recommended
amazing just how i though it would be
recommended
should have brought a poet 1010 my god its beautiful and beyond expectations

1010 would get 30 fps on low settings again fixyourshit
recommended
best graphics on pc they go as realistic as it is possible with current hardware framerate is awesome few bugs here and there memory leak connection issues that might frustrate living  out of you but nothing that wont be fixed in a month menus are a bit confusing but nothing is that perfect as for gameplay only in this game you can just drive around see 2 guys next to their broken car stop next to them and with thought need any help approach them just so that one of them would tell you wanna loose some teeth and punch you

i had trouble with my grapihcs card at first but then i got it to work all i had to do was enable it when it was loading anyway game is great 1110

recommended
great game
recommended
honestly the best game i have played period gta v is a masterpiece full of great times great graphics and a great storyline i wasnt expecting effective optimisation after the disaster that was gta iv but to my suprise my pc i7 4790k 8gb 1866 and a 760 can run the game at almost max at a steady 60fps what are you waiting for give rockstar your money and get gtaing
recommended
ha well we all own it on old gen consoles and now we own it again on next gen
recommended
if you are getting one game for pc this year get this one masterpiece 1010
recommended
grate game fun with friends
recommended
nice game i just can say this is the most successful of the gta series keep going
recommended
this game was sick nasty
recommended
robed a shop got a 2 star got attacked by civilanians then stol a jet jumped at 200ft in the air pachuted down and ramdom guy kicks me whiles on floor and then i die ign 910 not call of duty
recommended
within the first month i logged more than a few days realtime into gtav the odd thing is that i find myself doing more or less the same things over and over again pac standard heist and then a game of golf or two to unwind the worst part is that this is why i love it so much theres so much to do that you end up finding the variety overwhelming and just stick to something familiar 910  runs at 60 frames which is all that seems to matter anymore
recommended
falled over using a gun shot myself 1010
recommended
this game has been well worth the wait the console peasants have essentially been running the beta test for what has become one of the greats running in dsr 2k mode and then downsampling back to 1080 really adds crispness to all aspects when playing at home and when at a friends this still looks amazing in 1080 with reduced textures on my laptop if you are condidering buying this game do it if you dont want itsilly
recommended
fun game and all i would recommend this to any pc gamer it just the flight is confusing without a controller
recommended
max settings didnt go below 30fps on the benchmark and thats with a hd7970 amazing port hats off to rockstar the game is also pretty much on the best open world games ever made as youd expect if you have any doubts about this port you can shove them aside right now and just buy the game if you could run gta iv youll be able to run this even better
recommended
this game is everything they promised and more however i was disappointed when stealing cars doesnt really work in online mode due to insurance furthermore online mode is practically grand shopping spree auto because everything costs way too much
recommended
sick game
recommended
best game i have ever played the story is amazeing and the multiplayer is also good but i would like too have some mods like a life mod for multiplayer or else
recommended
the game needs no review by now all i can say is rockstar did it well im not even a little bit sorry of the 60 i payed for it the action the driving the humor and the world and all the live tha comes with it all the explorations al the little touches like wet clothes all the interesting and beautifull locations the world is actually bigger than i expacted at first at 62 hours spent in game i havent even tried out the movie editor and i spent maybe 1h in online i think there has not yet been a game with such great pricecontent ratio no monthly fees no  microtransactions just good old gta oh another thing that amazed me i was expecting for the game to be well optimized since i read that this is taken care of by the same team that did it in max payne 3 but to have most of the stuff on high very high some on ultra even and still run the game on 1080p with no problems on my 5 years old pc i5 750 8gb ddr3@1333 hd7870 the only the investment that i did on my pc since 2009 was 1 year ago with getting a hd7870 for 90 and additional 4gb ddr3 1333 for 30 im still blown away sometimes how beautifull it can look and that this is running smoothly on my pc just for comparasement sleeping dogs for example looked worse the world was smaller and alot more boring and for sure it did not felt so real the gameplay got repetitive really quick i had to run that game on mendium and not even sure if i was able to run it normally on 1080p gtav is a game that belongs into every gamers library 910 at minimum
recommended
i really liked the design of the social club log in screen other than that i havent seen anything 
recommended
not a  pc port 1010
recommended
the complete package 910
recommended
game of the century
recommended
absolutely fantastic easily one of the best games to come out in the last 5 years fantastic story which depicts the degeneracy of contemporary america with a great multiplayer suite to boot easily a must have
recommended
lots of content for the price you can sink hours into this game just messing around
recommended
its very good whith 1st porson shot i love it
recommended
someone came up shooting at me in an armored kuruma you cant shoot the dude in the kuruma because of the armor so i had to blow it up and had to pay 10k of insurance he comes at me again a minute and i had to decide to pay 10k to kill him or die besides this online is the best multiplayer experience ive ever had just turn off voice chat when outside of a mission
recommended
ey i got rekt in it when i punched a colored man in the face
recommended
tattooed a willy on lazlows chest and whacked fabien over the head with a laptop loved every minute of it

best grand theft auto by far good job rockstar
recommended
love this game good job rockstar
recommended
played it on my roomates ps3 when it first came out thought it needed polishing when it finally came out for pc though i was blown away cant wait for dem visual mods
recommended
i do recommend this game and not recommend this game i dont recommend because even tho you have a pc that uses intel core gta v will stutter alot and using low graphics will still make the game extra slow i recommend the games if brilliant awesome rides guns heists i dont recommend 510 i recommend 510
recommended
you must play this game its very awesome game
recommended
couldve been more epic hope rockstar can focus a little more on the connection issuequite annoying 10 out of 10

finally the grand theft auto the pc community had been waiting for
recommended
great game tons of action beautiful cars that you can keep even if they blow up excellent customisation and totally worth the moneys just one flaw what kind of idiot would wear a tshirt and a scarfplease let me wear one with my denim jacket other than that flaw i highly recommend this baby
recommended
101 hours and countingi have no doubt this will be my game with the most played hours i have played through the campaign twice now first on ps3 and now on pc and i still love it the story is not liked by everyone many just prefer kicking about online shooting people which i certainly enjoy but i do believe the story is something to be enjoyed on its own merits the way it works can all be read on the store page so i wont list all of the features but it really is enjoyable and has lots of hours in it when youre done with the campaign you can move on to gta online which has a good progression system of its own and is absolutely packed with content the best of which in my opinon are the heists where you can spend hours upon hours with random people completing setups for heists and then finally pulling them off its a nice feeling and great fun albeit on caveat is the fact that you will spend a lot of time waiting for people to join if you are playing with randoms only i have managed to do it though and made some friends along the way to complete future heists with if youre like me and played gta sa throughout your childhood this is your dream game and will live up to all the nostalgia of driving around in this expansive living world doing random things all the time
recommended
1010 would buy again
recommended
oh baby that is one optimized port also the game is really good mods
recommended
mods edit need to change before rockstar bans me for saying this
recommended
can hit the bong and drink whiskey 1010
recommended
i love this game too much this is my favorite gameplay ever 
recommended
good pc port  as for the game itself not much to say either  endless fun  specially with mods
recommended
very good game game works perfectly no bugs that i can see i recommend this game because you can do whatever it is you like to do in an open world the only downside are the other players looking for a kill and the raging police so be careful while driving down the streets of las santos another thing i should mention the graphics in this game are insanely amazing if you showed a friend a picture you took in this game i wouldnt doubt theyd think it was taken in real life if you like killing innocent people stealing and driving cars or robbing stores this game is for you so what are you waiting for pull out that $60 in your pocket and come join me in this amazing crime
recommended
omg the graphics look amazing loving it so far
recommended
i dont care about singleplayer and everything about online sucks its a broken piece of 
recommended
910 bushes are op

this game is addicting 
recommended
alright so after watching the so called princess robot bubblegum i have to say that it is definitely in my top 10 anime ever watched right after the one the only highschool dxd and maybe highschool of the dead let me say somethings i liked and disliked in the anime i like the story that the writer of the anime put into it you can really relate to the characters and you actually feel really close to them another thing i really liked about prb was that they know about todays clichs in anime and they embrace it fully by letting people see it can still be a deep and touching story the anime also shows some inside to economics by telling you how to get more money in merchandising and other relateable things like that the things that i dont like are really hard to state since prb had me laughing the entire way through it one thing i dont like is i guess the length of the episodes since you come to expect around 20 minutes of pure gold but we dont get it in this hidden gem so thats kind of a bummer so my final verdict for princess robot bubblegum is a solid 910 would reccomend to watch with some popcorn and a cold drink now we all have to hope for the next season of prb i sure am hyped now
recommended
my favorite mission so far is grand theft auto v has stopped working if only it would come out if dreamcastp
recommended
stopped the traffic while watching animes on a cellphone in the middle of the road till midnight 1010
recommended
this game is fun 1010 multiplayer is fun 1010 what should have been added gtav workshop for mods so we can just download it from the workshop and dont have to copy or paste files heists stuff should be in singleplayer multiplayer stuff should be added into the singleplayer overall this game is 1010
recommended
awsome game always loved gta games and this one has the best story line out of them all
recommended
very strong game playing very invested perfect game 1010 online no money to buy a very expensive and sad online levels too slowly too hard online no money online

recommended
game is good but servers lagging to much
recommended
at first i had extreme issues with the game crashing my rig has an i5 4590 gtx 760 oc $gb edition 8gb ram and a 1 tb hdd i was getting really frustrated but i found how to get it not to crashing in the graphics settings change directx 11 back to directx 101 and turn msaa off this will eat up a lot more ram but crashing will be gone
recommended
great game
recommended
even though rockstar doesnt allow mods and will ban you still is one of the best games i have played
recommended
really nice game having a lot of fun playing this game
recommended
got a lap dance from a stripper and then shot her 1010
recommended
i have play this game for over a year on the xbox 360 not once did i complain about the heist the lack of vehicles lack of missions and etc i didnt care about all that i cared more about the experience my friends and i doing dumb sh in gta online first of all the single player aspect of the game is great it doesnt follow gta 4s mistake of repeating the same type of missions ex follow target kill target go to place to kill target etc each mission in gta 5 feels unique especially since switching character was a thing and makes every mission unique and diverse and how rockstargames used this aspect was very well executed and it made sense in the missions for gta online i really enjoyed what i had played on my lastgen xbox 360 the experience of an open sandbox game and with your friends planning epic planes and gettaway cars because my friends and i were going to rob a convinience store that sounds stupid and it was but that was the whole point of gta online having fun in anyway possible especially with your friends gta online isnt ment to be played alone i recommend you bring a friend with you if you dont have any friends then make some friends everything i have explained about gta online was on lastgen i cant begin to explain how much the pc version captures everything that i loved and gives me more a more rich and visual improvement over the lastgen console personally i dont see a huge difference between the currentgen consoles and the pc nor does it matter what matters is that everyone who has been waiting for this on the pc may now get to enjoy one of the greatest openworld sandbox games on the pc gta 5 and online  1010
recommended
amazing at 4k and 2k resolutions a steady 60 fps all the time online or off its a master piece rockstar has done it again so worth the wait 1110as great as it looks and plays when the game isnt crashing or freezing up your whole pc when you alt  tab out or just about do anythingetc purple textures every where please put out a patch already to address all the crashing and freezing issues me and my 6 friends are all having we all have way more than enough windows 7 gpuramcpuetc power to play this at ultra and 60 fps 14401600p except 60 fps at 4k fix asap
recommended
simply put the best video game i have ever played the story is fantastic hilirious and gripping the characters are very well voiced and scripted the world is huge detailed and above all beautiful this game is truely a masterpiece it is gamings mona lisa or bugatti veyron if you dont play this game you really are doing gaming wrong
recommended
this is a game for pc gamers who waited so long for watch_dogs but sadly died due to the horific mess which ubisoft still says it was a success any way this game is amazing i hated it to  on playstation 3 but now all i can do is love it like two pigeons buy it now and i mean now

this is easy more than enough humorous explosive well performed content that lets you forget that you have other games in your library rockstar knows how to keep its series interesting by refining the diamond that gta is
recommended
best game of 2013
recommended
help my code is already used what do i do
recommended

recommended
alot of fun pretty buggy to start but runs fine now pretty much a reminder of fun from the xbox
recommended
q is it a realistic game a yes you can smoke a bong and get high at house parties 10510 wud smoke it again
recommended
write a review its gta it speaks for its self
recommended
within a month of being out ive played gta v every single day its been out and have 130 hours i never played gta v prior on any console i was very excited for it to finally come to the pc like many i was curious about how it would run turns out its one of the best ports there probably is very easy to run 1080p with 60fps and even better it doesnt require a $500 gpu to max out i must say im in love with this game my friends dont play it as much as we did the first week but i continue to play daily the preorder bonus of $1500000 was a good gesture but now that is petty cash once you get into the game you get it all figured out and know how to keep up the cash while maintaining full garages
recommended
best port rockstar has done in a while
recommended
great game and thank u rockstar for banning modders and cheaters in gtaol its now playable i feel sorry for those banned because of using graphical mods though
recommended
it was cool until they banned players for single player mods so sad ive liked rockstar since i was a child
recommended
very nica game
recommended
this is an amazing game this is now my most played game on my games list and i love the online and story is good i have played it on the ps3 but the pc version is way better if you dont have this game i ask you why are you waiting get it now and you will love it was worth the wait great work dev team next time dont make us wait soooooo long
recommended
great game i have it for the xbox and pc so much better on the pc
recommended
awesome game good quality port to the pc as well they really have made it optimised i was worried that i would have to upgrade my graphics card from the amd r9 280x that it is to something more substanstial as much as my settings arent maxed to the fullest i experience the game in incredible details and a perfectly playable 4050 fps in comparison to the 2030 i get on gta iv almost ten years old i am very pleased with the port job they did on this game and after playing the game originally on the 360 to then migrate my online character through social club was also a benefit to see my character reimagined for the next generation do yourself justice and add this to your steam library i couldnt recommend it anymore especially for the director tool and replay option that you can use both online offline and in director mode exclusively awesome game
recommended
ok so i got an i7 20 ghz 8 gb of ram and ati radeon 5650 1gb and it crashes like hell cant play more than 30 mins without crashing so they have been lying about the minimum sys req cuz u need at least 2 gb video to play this game on pc online action is great same problem but still a good game i recommend it if u have at least 2gb video card and 8gbram its interactive and fun and the pc version is the best version on the market just dontdont get it if u have minimum sys req waste of time and money
recommended
great game so much to do
recommended
best gta they ever made
recommended
best game in the world ever it got every thing race dm free mode best graphics 60fps can be played in ultra hd 4k resolution and online mode
recommended
put 80 hours in  had fun rockstar releases patch  now unplayable cant even launch rockstar then offers stickers release a patch for crashing before the game even gets to the loading screen  thanks
recommended
absolutely worth the 18 months wait for rockstar to polish this gem for the kind of hardware available on pc the firstperson mode is an unfortunately narrow field of view but id always preferred to play gta in 3rd person anyway online is actually being policed as it were by rockstar to keep cheaters from ruining an otherwise great multiplayer experience one of very few games i was willing to pay full price for and i would do it again
recommended
best game soundtrack on steam
recommended
a bunch of 12 year olds driving around in armored cars killing you for no reason probably the longest loading times in the history of the world everytime you try and do a heist with randoms one of them randomly leaves for no reason which makes everyone start all over again you have to have 4 people for the heist setups even though most of those i could probably do solo also there are too many problems with disconnecting in free roam mode that everyone seems to have
recommended
absolutely brilliant there is nothing else quite like it i guess this makes gta 5 my game of the year three times in a row now
recommended
this is a game you install it and play it and enjoy the ride

recommended
basicly many games in one just start it up and go do what you feel like doing all kinds of shooting racing some stealth and just general messing around which makes the gta games ever since the topdown 2d firstgeneration so great  so far it has not caused me to commit violent crime in real life so that seems to be a hoax besides that its really all its said to be online mode can be a bit rough around the edges but has greatly improved since it first became available on the previous generation consoles on a side note it runs suprisingly well even on more limited machines albeit with downgraded graphics it still looks good which it nice because i can play it on my laptop and still have fun
recommended
absolutely perfect as good as it was on the consoles this is the polished perfected version of the game we had to wait but it was worth it i bought it day 1 and ive absolutely loved it ever since with a gtx 760 and a 33ghz quad core processor i can run the game 90% maxed out anything less and youre selling yourself short the graphics are incredible
recommended
the game is great but as you mightve heard r banned modding for single player and online this ruins one of the highlights of pc gaming mods rockstar pelase allow the player to mod this game youre basically shooting yourself in the foot if you ban people for modding the game
recommended
the story is amazing and the story version of the game is fantastic aside from a couple of incredibly painful missions with no connection to the narritive yoga  why the story was incredible the online version isnt worth playing at all for any reason it seems like anyone can take control of the menu since almost every game ive joined has immediately gone into a loading screen and they can trap you in very long games which arent explained in any way you just kinda have to hope theyre easy to figure out or that youre on a team with someone who has done it before there are way too many missions which seem available yet are actually just places where you can start an event having these out in the world probably seemed like a good idea but in practise a menu would be much simpler for those have more functionality be faster take up less loading time etc etc the ui takes ages to load and doesnt feel intuitive to use  there are lots of random keys across the keyboard that control these features the 4 or 5 different mission types arent exciting theyre all the same damn thing in different places whoopydedoda its laggy as hell players constantly glitch out and reappear bullets dont hit their mark explosives dont go off missiles and rpgs swerve or vanish for no reason when you do finally find something that looks semi decent or something that you can do solo without waiting for players you cant communicate with cant get any kind of voice cumminication to work just fragments of audio playing randomely it feels much harder than it needs to be i did a mission about a dozen times before i came to accept that there was simply no way to succeed without playing with others  why was solo play even a damn option if it makes completeing the mission impossible if you accidentally sign up for something you dont want to do you get punished for it you either have to complete the job whatever it is or bail and get called a bad sport or something which gives you some kind of stigma ingame this wouldnt be so bad if the ui was in any way user friendly which it isnt the way the game loads you into a free roam mode then after you select any mission it holds you in some extra menu you cant seem to access any other way is extremely annoying it takes a very long time to load anything you have to pay close attention to the bottom right corner of the screen because sometimes it loads a window with only a couple of seconds to make a selection sometimes it gives you 2 minutes and there seems to be absolutely no indidcation which mission will have which delay before starting completely dissapointed with the online experience if the main story missions hadnt given me 3040 hours of amazng gameplay which they did nothing to complain about with the campaign id want a refund and i probably wouldnt be buying anymore rockstar games so many things need to be either completely reworked for the online game to be considered an actually game atm its just crappy free roam version of the story without the story coupled with some really annoying menus and sloooow load times i really wish i could make two reviews here one for the online experience and one for the story one was amazing and one was completely worthless
recommended
i have to say the graphics are great the gameplay is great and everything else is just fantastic obviously there are a few problems not adding pc to the ifruit app random bugs etc but a game this big has problems thanks for actually adding it to pc after 2 years of waiting and delaying
recommended
idk why everyone complains about modding as it does not ruin the game would you like it if you made something and then changes it pros graphics optimized to a great level lots of content dynamic controller support cons 65 gigs
recommended
mind blowing

have to make it quick and simple if you played this on console either last gen or current gen once you start up grand theft auto for pc you are going to understand why the pc is the master race of gaming regardless of the settings you are playing on the game runs amazing currently i have a i7 5820k and a amd r9 270x and im getting 80 fps average on 1920x1080p display settings and for my graphic settings almost everything is on very high or high the only setting thats not on high or very high is the texture setting and thats on normal rockstar has added the video editor and director mode and i still havent completely sat down and used it but for the little time i was messing with it i was saying to myself that this is an amazing tool for content creators and for people who just like to fool around with friends in online lobbies and i came to the conclusion that everyone is going to have an epic time with these tools and that i was very thankful for rockstar giving the pc community this exclusive content to sum up this quick review i have waited a long time for grand theft auto pc and it has officially arrived and the game just blows me away because of how great it looks and runs i highly recommend this for returning gta 5 players and new comers as well have a great day

really love the gta games since the first days and now there is a online modus wuhu all other reviews complaining about uh oh i got banned in online modus bad rockstar are basically little kiddies who cannot play such games without cheating

well what can i say its so amazing how much effort was put to create such amount of delightful details in this masterpiece another impressive thing imo is pc optimization considering poor performance of its predecessors well done rockstar thats really the most worthy buy in steam i can remember pros great story especially comparing to other sandbox\openworld games pretty deep characters\cars customization amazing city thunderstorm rocks wellwritten characters decent performance shooting mechanics as good as in max payne 3 pretty obvious tho cons weird car physics shadow glitches that ive seen in a lot of players

its a fun game i have it for 360 and ps4 i got it for my computer cause i thought of all the posibilities i could have i really like this game but it does not run on my computer it is no where close to meeting the requirement to run i wish it didnt have to have such high graphics and use so much ram but its a good game so i cant complain to much
recommended
love it the community is growing and its becoming increasingly fun only problem is all the people who buy the armored kumura who drive around and waste you because theyre too afraid to step out of their bulletproof bubble i suggest buying one $525000 i think then driving around ruining the game for everyone on your server lol
recommended
not banned so i will give it a thumbs up

as someone who has patiently waited for this game since day 1 of release for consoles and never played a single bit untill the 14th of april 2015 i can definetly say that this game is the most fun that ive had out of a game in a long time if you are on the fence about getting this game by far throw your money at the screen even if you own a console copy grand theft auto v is extreamly easy to run and is a relieve that it is so with all the rushed games this generation hint hint ubisoft with the minimum specs of a 9800 gt and q6600 24ghz currently i run this game on an average setup with a 560 ti graphics card and a i32105 processor with a smooth 60<fps most of the time on mostly normal settings but dipping down to about 40 in the city during daytime the only complaint that i have about this game is a small graphics glitch that i have seem to be experiancing where occasionally bars appear forming out of cars for 1 frame and can get distracting although this bug will hopfully be fixed with patches drivers or future directx overall i will give this masterpiece a 1010

very addicting i must say

this is the best game ive played in decades and is more entertaining than watching my top 5 favorite movies the 1st person mode makes the game truely immersive

recommended
i cant stop playing this game send help pls 953648284710 too much fun its boring
recommended
possibly one of the best sandbox games of all time that has an amazing soundtrack and unforgettable storyline the multiplayer is also very fun but it is practically required to play only with friends since the whole community is very aggressive and tend to kill you constantly and harass you only problem is that the game tends to freeze very frequently if you play it for an extended amount of time but hopefully this issue will be fixed
recommended
best gta installment yet no online mods or trainers yet and i personally dont expect any due to rockstar making gta online capable of increasing how much money you have via micro transactions if you came for online mods get gta4 or if you dont mind offline only mods in gta5 then get gta5
recommended
well i think its been long enough to write a review the only issues i have with gta v pc is the first person fov especially when driving it makes me sick literally simulation sickness i hope they expand the slider to include fov for both first person walking and driving to at least 90 degrees i have also heard of people getting banned for using single player mods like the fov hack to address part of the problem mentioned above i have used these mods myself but have never logged into multiplayer even once mods or no mods so if i discover my multiplayer account has been banned once i finish singleplayer and finally do log in for the first time there will be hell to pay however i suspect the people complaining of a ban did not disable the mods before logging into multiplayer this is pure speculation however onto the good stuff this is everything gta v was said to be on pc this is the definitive edition for sure graphically speaking however with first person feeling more like broken gimmick than an actual feature i am rather disappointed it was what i was looking forward to the most i would recommend this game to anyone into the gta franchize its a whole lot of fun rampaging around and causing trouble the story is phenomenal and the same old satire and parody of our real world politicalsocial problems are all there i find playing gta helps remove pent up stress after all who doesnt want to blow up the creator of life invader p but be warned do not use mods if you play online while we can know theres nothing rockstar can do to stop hacking and mass banning people is a stupid practice that serves no purpose much like the drug war avoid poking the bear
recommended
great game and runs better than consoles
recommended
had a few graphical glitches to start with but they cleared up eventually although i am still having a bug where the terrain will derender around me and i will have to use the traffic and random static meshes to navigate the roads for a few seconds but i can deal with that other than that as a first time player of gta v never owned it on console i would whole heartedly reccomend this the system specification are incredible for such a huge game and the controls are fantastic i use controller to drive and kbm to control my character in first person story wise that game is okay it has a lot of side missions and random encounters that are very fun and the central character stories are interesting although i absolutely hate trevor you all know what i did in that one mission p

fourth time buying gta v 2 times on x360 because sister scratched one of the discs and 1 time on my ps4 i think it was worth buying again my favorite feature is the self radio d i can listen to my own music while turning s into pancakes it is visually beautiful with 4k support i dont have the requirements to use that but holy  does it look nice without it i use a 360 controller so i dont know how the controls are with the mouse and keyboard but the gamepad works great

ive always been a big fan of rockstar they are my favorite developer that being said i have bought this game 3 times and it is well worth it in my opinion i bought this on ps3 xbox one and now pc ive been waiting for a pc release since the game was announced in the beginning this has to be one of the best games i have ever bought because even after around 100 hours on the ps3 version 40 hours on the xbox one version and with the above amount on the pc version i still find that this game does and will have a bunch of replayability for years to come and for the sake of the race 4k 60fps or die
recommended
the only game where the cops are better than the navy seals 42069

this is the best version of gta v period my only complaint is that rockstar needs to fix the  mouse input because its irritating
recommended
openly allows you to stamp on cats and dogs 1010  would stamp again
recommended
amazing game yes some issues here and there in terms of graphical performance but a few have been ironed out dont cheat and you wont get banned simple
recommended
the story mode is very repetative but has an amazingly interesting storyline that had me watching all of the cutscenes as it is in most gta games it is mostly just driving around and shooting some people however there are some fun and interseting levels the games engine feels nice and looks good in both first and third person povs the pc port was very successful and it runs quite well random frame rate drops and crashing occur when running the game with dx 11 with a gtx 970 so i reccommend using dx 101 with this card customisation in the story is excellent in both the character and vehicles in multiplayer gta online the vehicle and player cusomisation is a bit restricted by your level and achievements online missions are very repetetive and provide little motive as the rewards are small frankly there is no point in doing them but the heists are great fun and are challenging and reward players that choose to play as a team handsomly with big cash payouts and experience rp when freeroming in gta online there is not much to do after i had invested in a luxury appartment and car completed all heists gotten bored of the repetitive missions and killed some innocent ai and players alike i found myself at a loose end this is why i will probably no longer play grand theft auto v unless ther is some good dlc or updates and i think that the money i paid for this game was only just worth it but only because of the interesting srotyline and few hours of heists
recommended
 it has backstreet boys  needs more dmx 1010

i doubt theres a whole lot i can say that others havent already said gta v gets a lot of things right and fortunately only a few things wrong the three protagonists are all excellent well developed characters that feel like people they have both their good and bad sides just like real people i wont want to say too much due to not wanting to spoil anything i will say that these are characters that are easy to like despite doing things in the past and over the course of the game that well again no spoilers negative wise yes the plane and helicopters controls are poor especially with a keyboard theyre a bit better with a gamepad but still difficult to control although this is a matter of opinion some people love them some hate them if youre looking for more fun casual controls like you can use for example in saints row 3&4 you wont find that here the car controls take getting used to but theyre not too bad once you get used to them thats not to say theyre great however there is one thing gta v gets right that stands out over iv in one word checkpoints okay theres more then one thing but one thing comes to mind right away no longer do you have the frustration of dying at some point during a long mission involving several different points only to have to redo the entire mission because of one simple mistake no longer will one difficult part that might take quite a few tries to get right involve doing the entire mission again and again rather then just a part of it although any repetition like that can be annoying theres a world of difference between redoing an entire mission repeatedly and having to repeat a part of it especially if its just a quick sequence another great thing is that they eliminated the loathed calls from friends you know the sort youve just driven halfway across the map to start a mission your phone rings and you answer it thinking it might be something important you quickly discover that nope its someone whether it be roman or one of your friends with the every lovable hey niko lets go bowling you may even say yes because the game makes you feel like a jerk for saying no gta v eliminates that yes people will sometimes call you for help with something saying more would be a spoiler however these calls generally lead to something a lot more interesting then going bowling overall an excellent game where you call the team put in a massive effort yes there are some bumps in the road but the good far outweighs the bad even if you do end up waiting until its on sale i do recommend at least giving it a try

i honestly dont understand why so much people are making negative reviews i personally think mods in online are stupid but they shouldnt ban the people and yeah the loading screen takes forever sometimes but for me personally im getting no problems  this is a review of the online version anyway apart from that online is very fun with friends rockstar have done a great job i have great fun with my friends frolecking around in fort zancudo sure in public lobbies a ton of people just hunt you down either with bounty or no bounty but theres always private lobbies and if you really want to keep away from online theres even a great single player anyway thats all i can say im not the beast at reviews

this game is nothing but pure awsomeness its got the entire package great graphics free roam private sessions public sessions great singleplayer and so much to do in both the singelplayer mode and the multiplayer mode its been 100% smooth from start to finish and ive had a blast for atleast 170 out of my 178 hours played imo anyone whos stupid enough to say that this is bad is stupid enough to forget their own password for their steam account aka braindead the few issues that me and my friends might of run into were all client side and fixed by using logical thinking not by posting bad reviews making yourself look incredibly stupid not trying to sound like an  this is truely a great game

before i say anything bad i want everyone reading this review to know that this game is one of the best released for pc that rockstar has made everything runs smoothly and i am getting many hours of great content out of it the only real problems are listed below online has a few minges many of my friends have had people drop money on them resulting in them being banned there has also been many people being banned just for having single player mods i find that kind of dumb
recommended
best game i have ever played
recommended
i ing love this game but r obviously does not want anyone to use any type of mod on their game as of right now in story and online im assuming r did not warn the players that they would get banned for using these mods and i think that is ing stupid if so i do think people should be able to use mods on story mode at the least im not aware of the mods that are currently out right now and what will be available in the future but it does make sense that r would not support these mods online because i assume they at some point could be game breaking look back to when we use to play on consoles the game was ing ruined people were practically making the game unplayable for other players with these mods it seems like r has more control over their product on the pc and if thats true then why would they even think about letting it go to  like how it did on consoles they dont want mods dont use them
recommended
i love this game its got a great story and a great online mode 1010
recommended
annnnnd people still wana hack i hope rockstar and valve fix this crap im happy to just play the single player since the game is really just wide open fun but online you stick with your friends and the people you know arent hacking and do missions together which is great fun until they rage lol but even though playing with randoms was half the fun so being that its not all rockstars fault i still give this game the thumbs up we all know it deserves
recommended
the graphics are amazing game play and story is immersive and flow together perfectly with all the other aaa titles that have come out this past few years that where buggy and unplayable it was refreshing to see just how well this game preformed on release day good job rockstar it was worth the wait please release more dlc storys for this game

do i recommend this game hell yes your pc is  well then spend about 1050$ getting a new one dont have the money then you might have problems all and all gta 5 is an amazing game and to be honest it may start bumpy glitches ect but in my game i havent had a crash once ever on this game but a few as in one frame drop my pc is built for this however as in the begining dont got the cash then dont buy it enjoy others and dont write a bad review blaming the game rather than your   300$ walmart piece of

this game sucks there are so many bugs the heists dont work half the time the community is terrible everything is too expensive you cant even own a cat buy it buy it right now 1010
recommended
single player game is awesome you dont have to worry about rage quiting if you keep failing a mission it gives you the option to skip sections that you cant pass this eliminates my biggest frustrations with most games the characters show real change as the plot progresses that being said the ending felt like a let down gta online is great if you can find players that dont want to shout slurs on voice but 90% of the player speech in the open world consists of that definetly turn on passive mode in the options menu otherwise youll never explore the open world as the other players like to turn it into a deathmatch game
recommended
i love the game but thanks to the actions of some hackers and the overzealous response from rockstar games i cannot recommend it three people i know were in a game that also had hackers the hackers started firing at everyone with miniguns instead of firing bullets though the miniguns they were using fired money everyone ended up with millions of dollars weather they wanted it or not the people i know contacted rockstar about the incident they were told not to worry that everything would be rectified four days later they were banned from online that is not on edit rockstar have since apologised and stated some people were banned in error since it was a mistake that friends of mine were banned i have added this edit to my review and changed the rating to recommended as the banning of my friends was the main reason i could not recommend this game the original review will remain for posterity
recommended
loading screens simulator 1010
recommended
its one of those mustplay its really worth the money spent on it and thats something not easily said these days about games i really recommend at least one play through besides the main story line which took me a solid 75 hours without geeting distracted by other things there is so much other content in there its unbelievable the level of detail contained in gta v is amazeballs details details everywhere just play it
recommended

pretty awesome game love driving through the streets of ls on a bike in first person few graphics blips day 1 but im sure theyll get hammered out
recommended
played the game for a day now did a few missions drove and messed around a bit i was loving gta 3 was seriously hyping on vice city cause i love the era havent played san andreas at all computer not powerfull enough at the time and was okay with gta 4 so far i am having a blast the performance is great even on my subpar computer it even manages to look good on lowest settings which are called normal instead of low or some such thing nice touch its the first full priced game i have bought in a long time and i am pretty sure i wont regret it full recommendation for fans of the genre there are a few glitches like massive fps drop now and again for a second or four but its manageable and it never happened in a mission so far some cutscenes were a bit off sync have to stop writing now and resume playng 
recommended
best game open world forever
recommended
lots and lots of fun 1010 would run into wall again
recommended
deff improves the decisions i make in the real world 1010
recommended
i very much like the game many hours of fun with friends but with the game coming out on a new platformer brings new problems such as the thousands of people experiencing game crashes at random it aggravates people when you are half way through a heist then your game crashes therefore destroying the fun and further more making your friends and team mad at you dont get me wrong i like the game but rockstar could you please focus on the thousands and thousands of people having these random crashes problem first before making it durable for modders please rockstar
recommended
if you dont have this game then get it there is no reason to not get this game it has something for everyone 1000010000 would kill a  again
recommended
an amazing game to have so much fun with friends
recommended
seriously this game is addictive  u guys who want to be a crime could play this game its fun when u can rob someone and hit the police me and my hommies play this game with so much laugh even though me pc doesnt support even the minimum requirement still this game is fun to play solo
recommended
a good first few days until we get infested with hacks 1010 for now
recommended
its gta 5 so of course it is amazing but there are a couple of things i would like to see change 1 i would like to see gta having a better save system since most of the time when i have done something in the single player that change will not go through if it was something like changing the clothes or upgrading my car although it is not a huge problem i feel like it should be fixed also the game is a bit laggy in single player but in multiplayer it is way better for some reason even if i have the same settings on both 910
recommended
pc version is the definitive and best version available

left my apartment ran down the street and punched a woman in the back of the head shot an old man in the face and stole his sports car cops chased me into the countryside hid in a crackhouse cops got scared and left robbed careme abdul jabbal of his candy bars cops chased me home then i played gta v
recommended
forewarning  amdintel switchable graphics users you will have trouble getting this game to run because of issues that rockstar has neglected to address after spending hours trying to get the game to run it looks beautiful i dont mind playing the entire game again the npcs are so likeable and unlikeable and you can actually have a fun time from just walking on the sidewalk im not kidding i was even able to transfer my online character from console onto here neat story is compelling and keeps you playing online can be pretty fun but still needs some work  as it did when i played on console writing a detailed review is pretty pointless chances are youve seen plenty of the game already its a great port aside from the issues as far as crashing and not being able to run for some people  all of which im sure will be fixed eventually
recommended
nice game lots of fun

the game is classic gta with friends

this game is great with all the features and mods and the graphics are amazing but my 2 lester mission wont work the jewlery mission the store is all buged out and i can see anything
recommended
awesome graphics are fantastic rstar has really came along way in the gta series this one of course being by far the best one yet story mode was a lot of fun and online play with friends is pretty great too looking forward to more dlc updates for gta as well for online play need more heists
recommended
defending strip club with friends cops come in with a motorbike we blow it up strip club gets set on fire we run to the back of the club 1 friend trips on body everyone trips on that guy we all burn to death physics 1010 1110 would burn again
recommended
interesting game free world shooter online
recommended
what to say its gta after gta iv being a severe step backwards compared to sa v is a good step in the right direction gta online is fun although it could do with more complex missionsbecause  heists aside most missions are pretty generic and repetetive with a few friends alot of fun non the less hopefully r games keeps on adding stuff and not just vehiclesbut missions that go more towards the story mode missionsmaybe they could transfer those to the online mode on the technical side i am amazed how well it runs on my overaged pc athlon ii x4 640 8gb ram gtx 470 and still looks beautyful on normal to low settings i can only imagine how stunning it will look when finally my new system arrives by the end of this year tldr gta as gta should bewith the addition of an improvable online mode that offers quite some fun for a few friends ps hackers are therebut luckily you can avoid and pretty much ignore them if you so wish
recommended
great game but the world unloads itself every now and again not sure if its my graphics cards or my pc in general but still a fun and well detailed game
recommended
124 hours after 2 weeks this game is damn fine

as someone with a graphics card that has a similar power as the one listed in the minimum requirements and the exact amount of memory as listed in the minimum requirements i can say that the developers did a good job optimizing the game it runs smooth on mimimal graphics and i have not found gamebreaking glitches in the past 10 hours or so there seems to be only an issue with alttabbing out of the game this will sometimes result in the game freezing every couple of seconds that does not go away until you restart the game using the steamoverlay does not seem to have this problem if you liked one of the previous gta games i recommend playing through this one there is lots of stuff to be done and mess around with
recommended
gta v is a well optimized experience for pc  said no one ever seriously though this game will melt your pc good benchmark screenshots though so play if you have a beefed up computer seriously make sure your card has been made after this game came out like an nvidia gtx 960 or 970 those could do well get some nice ram too it recomends 4 as the minimum but that wont help for  i have 4 so id make sure you have atleast 10 if you wanna do well tldr unoptimized with amazing screenshots of the benchmark tests read a review of someone who could play it and didnt see if their pc was good enough

grand theft auto 5 pc we waited 2 years for this version was it worth the wait hell yes 60 fps with awesome 4k compatibility made it the ultimate version scripts now are under way and we already getting retextures we will be seeing remodeling soon enough once you have finished playing gta v singleplayer there is gta online an awesome way to spend the rest of your time on gta v for the pc theres always someone playing gta online awesome things in gta 5 singleplayer story missions fully immersive gameplay buysell stocks buy and sell stocks from other companies such as redwood and other well known companies of gta 5 plan heists the heist preparation is amazing in the singleplayer campaign from preparing the vehicles to choosing your crew freaks and weirdos aka side missions animal peyotes become the animal spaceship pieces find them all with trevor its time to wreck some $ht with franklin do races with your awesome unique superpower with michael you drink in the backyard not givin a flyin fk characters in this game are very unique and all have their interesting characteristics not to mention there are a ton of references in this game and tons of easter eggs all cars have their own unique model and stats awesome things in gta online races challenge your best friend enemy or any random person to a land air or water race deathmatch challenge your mates enemies or and random person to a team or free for all death match survival survive against waves of enemies as they increasingly get harder as the more waves you pass missions play by yourself or with people to complete a vast majority of missionscoop missions requested by the known characters from the singleplayer mode like lester franklin lamar martin and trevor heists the new online heists and most anticipated heists update allows you to host your own heist with a crew of up to 4 people where they will help you in doing the preparations for the heist finale in the end the payout is worth it most of the heists payout up to $100k for each person if 25% each but you can change the payout for each person as the heist leader and of course the heist leader gets the larger cut as heshe is the person paying for the heist as of to date there are currently 5 heists and bonus challenges await for the hardcore players to receive epic rewards that rack up to $12000000 oh and make sure you have a high end apartment to host the heist from own up to 3 apartmentsgarages store your modded cars in your garage for safe keeping while you look over the world of gta 5 from your apartment rp or reputation points as you level up in rp you unlock specific weapons vehicle modifications clothing and various body art such as tattoos makeup and hairstyles join other people with sessions up to 32 slots you can play with your friends in the world of los santos or you can kill the person you hate with a tank you just bought from doing tons of heists many many times until they enable passive mode or rage quit various tools rockstar content creator used to make awesome custom races or death matches to find community created races and deathmatches check the rockstar social club website and browse through the awesome content currently pc exclusive director mode use the animals and characters you found in gta 5 and make a video currently pc exclusive rockstar editor once you finished recording your action replay or your gameplay rockstar has built in a video editor so you can edit and upload your video once completed cons currently gta online is flooded with cheaters due to the current script mods and are using them to cheat in money use god mode spawn in vehicles and pretty much sum up to ruin your experience gta 5 files are encrypted and currently wont be seeing any huge world changing mods till a workaround is made so sorry but an iron man mod will not be around for a while if you are a returning player from the console version not much is different but stability is definitely better and runs a lot smoother and i would definitely recommend buying this game and the price is well worth it if you are a new player i would definitely recommend picking up this version if you can run it ps this game pretty much proves that pc is indeed master race p graphics has no limits console peasants

gta v what can you say about this title other than great gta v story mode allows you to play out some epic scenes good enough to make movies from  well actually a lot of them were taken from movies lol now do not take that last part as in they ripped off the movies because they changed it enough to where it becomes something new and different but still full of epicness i found myself invested in the characters and wanting to see what happens next it wasnt all smooth sailing though when you first start playing trevor it gets slow or did for me i did not like his character and found it hard to play he is nasty dirty disgusting and down right crazy and disturbing but soon he gets back in touch with the others and that all changes  he doesnt change the fun level does  i found myself playing 5hours or more easily in a sitting because i just couldnt put it down i had to see what happened next everyone out there will most likely find a conection between themselves and one of the characters its a must play gta online most games of this type throw you online in little maps of deathmatch combat gta online allows you to play the whole open world of gta v and do what ever you want the hiests are great fun and well done the missions are plentiful and diverse  racing landseaair sky diving deathmatch pve survival etc etc etc owning your own house or condo setting up your own hiests or just goofing around in the map the fun is endless it truelly is the only drawback is from level 120 it was not as much fun as it got after lvl 20 stick it out reach lvl 20 and start to really enjoy the online aspect of the game overall gta v is a must have in anyone library do not miss out on this title  pc  or you will be missing out on one of the best games ever made and that is not fan boy hype

worth every penny xd

people are giving negative reviews to the game because of the increased price before the summer sale but that doesnt mean the game is bad the game is still incredibly fun the graphics are good and i have no major complaint 1110

it takes a while to install but trust me its worth it the first person graphics every thing its worth it
recommended
cool

addictive like played it for 15 hours straight addictive
recommended
i played and finished gtav for ps3 on initial release and purchasing on pc was a tough choice for me after two days of playing i cant say i regret purchasing it twice the game is optimised really well even for those who have to run it with low settings the first person mode is addictive and gives the game a new feel and overall it really does feel like the definitive version note some people have trouble with frame drops at the moment and with rockstar social club which disables them from playing this will most likely be fixed but no problems for me as yet and online seems to work fine
recommended
this game is so much better on pc you can now run your game in 60fps and with loads of stupid and fun mods i would tottaly buy this game if you only played it on console

its extremely fun especially with friends pros the whole game physics are hilarious and extremely fun to play with many random moments happen where you just flip out of your chair laughing car physics really fit this type of game most of the stuff you wouldnt expect in a simple game is thought about in gta 5 for example clothes getting wet dynamically civillians checking your new car out and saying something about it you can hear the car cooling down sounds and more and more and more the story is well thought through and you can choose how to do a heist cons there is atleast 1 cheater in every lobby who gives money is invincible etc etc the story felt kind of short it gets boring after some time if you play without friends
recommended
like theft enjoy murder how about cruising around on a stolen infernus terrorising the sidewalks of los santos be it multiplayer heists or just the singleplayer story gta v will be the game for you with hours of endless entertainment you can travel around san andreas exploring the stunning map and just generally having a good time so what can you do well for a start theres singleplayer following a well planned storyline franklin clinton is sucked into a world of crime with a retired old man and a deranged canadian planning heists doing heists then splashing out on your honest earned cash are the basics to this game then theres multiplayer create your own character and rank up in the world unlocking new weapons hair styles clothing you name it
recommended
game itself is really good  story is pretty good  freeroam is fun as you can do what ever you want cycling driving cars flying planes and helicopters hunting shooting s and what not  online is fun if you have friends on the other hand  online is hugely ed up rockstar likes money so they have made cars and everything really expensive and making money is hard although if you have friends and find screwing around and playing same missions fun do it get yourself gta v if you dont have friends try random lobbiesbe aware there can be lots of cheaters and other s so be prepared if there is only s and such look from the web i believe there are many websitesfor example wwwredditcomrgtaonlinecrews where you could find similar players like you

the best of the best
recommended
simply the best grand theft auto yet
recommended
this game has the greatest online heists and only online heists the heists are fun immersive and require teamwork to get through the setup process is really enjoyable as it leads to changes that actually are happening in the heist that you are going to complete after setting up the heists also give you very much satisfaction when you complete the heist earning thousands of dollars to probably spend on cars the story is also very fun and immersive with franklin michael and of course crazy trevor i very much recommend this game to everyone that enjoys storylines and great online features
recommended
great graphics great campaign and decent online
recommended
what can i say its gta 5 everything about this game is good the story the stroy length the mpvthe heists u will be sucked in to the game for atleast 50 ish hours berfore completing the story if u do a couple side missions but not all if u have friends who have this game and play the mp alot then that is another reason u should buy it cuz this game is even better with friends 1010 ign 910 gamespot  u gamespot

excellent single player and lengthy multiplayer with free updates and plenty to do also people complaining about corporate greed when the game has only been out on pc for 2 months and therefore didnt go on sale are idiots theres much worse examples of greed ala cod who keeps their games at $60 until the next one comes out then it drops to $50 for a year

rockstar the developers of grand theft auto v has proven to us that they worked very hard to finally make a gta 5 port on pc that us pc gamers would enjoy and they pulled it off this game supports 60 fps added first person and a working multiplayer however i do not recommend this game to people that have weak computers this game is very cpu and ram demanding you play as 3 players michael trevor and franklin in the single player and you must make many decisions in the game while doing a lot of missions that will have you grilling hours into this game the missions may deal with racing assassinations heists and much more that you have a variety of missions to witness the grand theft auto series has prospered and their fans come in to enjoy all their titles that release many people rate this game negative because mods can get you banned and the summer sale tricked many players that gta 5 was going to be 25% off but ignore those players for $60 this game is worth the money what do you do after you finish 2030 hours worth of playtime in this game online that is you can do many things online that are similar to missions in the singleplayer butthis time you can play with friends if you have any o_o this game is truly worthy for you to invest your money in 9510
recommended
i bought the game and a couple days later after transferring my level 5 character from xbox because it sux me and my friends had a fist fight we ended up shooting eachother and running over our corpses on the sidewalk while police mercilessly rampaged through the city a couple weeks later we were screwing around again and i was driving a plane at night time and scared the living s out of my friend as i crashed into a telephone pole right next to him while he was in first person in a car apparently all it takes to steal a military plane from a base with anti air missiles is to just drive a car and ramp it over the fence and make sure a tank doesnt get near you which doesnt have to if you hijack one or get it straight from the hangar the missiles arent even a threat if you stay low enough 1010 stealing fighter jets is easier than robbing little ol grannies

very good gameonline is brutal fun but lot of players cheats i tested modmenu but i hated it i love original game without cheats <3
recommended
dumb popcorn fun rockstar delivered on making this a very different better game than gta iv and los santos is just a pleasure to explore but missions can get pretty stale and youll quickly realize that the campaign doesnt have as much to offer as its overthetop intro leads players to believe from a technical standpoint it looks great on pc runs fairly well social club integration doesnt feel too awful and doing away with games for windows live makes the online far more enjoyable than past titles however if you play on kbm the aiming and controls can feel pretty floaty which is never a good thing but its gta its dumb it knows it and it plays dumb its great even better with modsfriends the price tag is fairly steep for what you get but i think it was worth the money oh hey also its soundtrack feels fresh and poppy expect very bassy electronic works hiphop and some very out of place latin american stuff pleasure to listen to fits perfectly within the game flow flying lotus really steals the show on flylo fm look up his track stonecutter

i highly reccomend this game very fun but without a good computer dont bother getting it but if u have a good one get this game it is so fun i enjoy it cant stop playing 1010 game i love it

i longley awaited this game due to the fact that you can mod it if some of you havent heard people have been getting bans recently for modding on gta 5 campain honestly i think this is stupid this completley destroyed the community and ill personally never forget it i do not recommend this game anymore edit nevermind mods are all good again

sim vacation you can get dressed up but it doesnt mean someone wont take you out i love the sunsets dangerous drives on the beach del perro pier burger shot and my smg ive named ollie the actual game looks great so far played 10% but find on line mode irresistable the game has taboo topics if youre put off by that be forewarnded one can play online or in a private session and just race and never have a negative interaction with enforcement frankly then youll get from online it what you put into it based on your game play pros i will play online every friday night until i get arthritic i enjoy hearing the other gamers its the ultimate party line who needs comedy central thumbs up on the graphics customizations music and vast landscape love the races even desgined some great design gui often i find a good racing group online i am entertained for hours purchasing weapons  realistic lots of detailed scenery that is not repetitive which shows how much labor went into this game cons the online servers are filled with hackers and gang bangers who can be unpleasant but yeah it happens in real life too its a mad world most locations are outdoors making newbies an easy target for a high level players youll grow wishes for online mode since im typing more interiors to explore or fight in this might make more balanced campaigns and allow for more intimate fighting that vehicles cant access finally a grappling gun for climbing or zip lining a taser gun because its humane lol and net gun just because yeah id be funny will race again will explore again will kill and be killed again may never leave the house again
recommended
this game cant provide a bad experience for anyone and i mean it other than that 510 too much water
recommended
great game recomend but one flaw the multiplayer got no party system other wise if you got alot of money you should get it
recommended
first of all let me say that gta v is one heck of a port on pc it makes gta iv look like garbage atleast for what it was during the first few days during launch secondly id like to point out that the pc version of gta v is most definitly a considerably huge upgrade over the xbox one ps4 version  the story is quite excellent actually some people might say gta iv story was better which might be the case but i personally think gta v has a pretty good story by itself  the ability to switch between the 3 characters ingame is pretty sweet i personally hope they might consdier building upon this for future games but well see  gorgeous open world you can see they put quite some extra work into the pc versionit was worth every penny to me  unless youre a heavy completionist reloading save after save to get every nick and dime out of the first playthrough this game will offer countless hours of replay value one of the things that i though personally couldve been done better was  you can literally go through the entire game without upgrading anything at all it felt like it was kind of obsolete even bothering upgrading the weapons or cars at all  some of the side missions started to feel a bit generic after a while while it took a heck of a time before that happened it could use some work as well id personally give the game a 9  10  and its a must buy for any gta fan out there
recommended
after 200 hours of gta v im level 90 in online and still alot of nice stuff to do in online and not even close to being rich singleplayer has not even been touched and the game is very addicting in the beginning as soon as this game gets on sale does not need to be big but when it does its sure as hll worth every euro  dollar my favourite game probably 
recommended
its gta v it is everything you expect the game to be with more and more mods being released you can have countless hours of fun just messing around in sp mode

so i bought the gta 5 max payne 3 tiger shark card bundle but i dont know where i get the code for the shark card do i get the money when i load gta online or do i have to put in a code if so where do i find the code but besides that love this game 100% worth it

would seriously recomend this game  it is one of the best it really gives you the ideea of what a good development team can do everything is in the highest details  the game throws at you new stuff as you go along and gta online is very cool  but only if you play with friends because the community there sucks 1010

the long awaited gta v for pc is finally here honestly gta v is fun as hell the single player part is great for most part ive spent lots of time playing it both online and offline my final score for the game graphics 95 gameplay 95 sound 95 music 95 content 95
recommended
absolutely perfect well worth the wait
recommended
great game
recommended
<most of my play time is from online rather than single player> grand theft auto v is a brilliant game it features seriousness and sillyness ranging from a nice drive around the city to being carried in a limo by a helicopter to the top of the biggest mountain the missions and heists are a lot better when you are able to use voice communication my crew and i use skype every time we play and it makes everything nice and easy with quicker response times by us there are a couple of bugs that i have noticed  objects popping into view just as you hit it not being able to move after completing a mission  heist for a period of time and randomly losing cars that you spent your hard earned in game cash on overall i would reccomend this game whether youre a casual player or a tryhard
recommended
had a lot of doubts about how the port would be in this game especially since how gta iv was was very happy with the release everything works smoothly and the game itself is great recommended
recommended
well its gta so its awesome but online that just does not work i mean really you go in and ppl are in tanks just farmeing you till you leave and then haveing to rank up to unlock pretty everything i get the point of it but its not fun forceing ppl do do some thing then its a job but the story part is awesome and good enough for it to be worth it
recommended
bought a new pc gta v works fine  <3 love this game although im scared this just a temp new pc while waiting for my ultra pc i hope it works on it 
recommended
what a great game story mode was short and sweet unlike story mode from 4 which felt so long and drawn out online is a fun experience the load times are annoying but tolerable even for a dual ssd user who doesnt console and there are ways to play where you avoid most of the loading times hacking seems to be somewhat under control after the latest update but im sure thats a work in progress overall i highly recommend this game on a side note all these people ing because the game isnt on sale are dip and whiners this game is fully worth the full price and if you liked other gta games this will not disappoint i bought a couple cash cards to give me a nice start with some dope cars and bikes and have no regrets despite the fact that i dont make a ton of money theres a reason this game was a massive best seller and its not because of hype its because its genuinely a great game thats a ton of fun bottom line if youre a gta fan this is a must purchase its the best gta game to date with pretty much endless activity if you arent a minmax power gamer hellbent on maximum efficiency
recommended
top pc game gta online is epic

amazing to the console version theres no competition i am running at full settings on a laptop getting a minimum of 30 fps if i wanted to tone those settings down were talking 60 fps grand theft auto has always been a great series with gta v trumping all the others even if you already have the console version paying the extra $6070 is totally worth it

one of my favorite games of all time i had it for console and bought it again for pc and there is no doubt in my mind that this is the definitive edition of the game the graphics are incredible the story is wellcrafted and the world is unique i keep playing it in order to squeeze every little reference out of it and i havent grown tired yet the subtle jokes and satirical characters are great to me this is a must own for anyone who is capable of running it on their machine

this game is an open world game you are free to do whatever you like and shoot any npc you want i think it lets you get out aggresion in a healthy way towards the people that cut you off or have things to say when you are driving the single player game is awesome with a great story and amazing characters
recommended
the best

just because its awesome

its gta whats not to like can do all the horrible things people want to do in a virtual recreation of la have a blast with it

rockstar are one of a kind game runs seemlesly on 8 gb ram i7 4970 and a  gtx 650 with 2 gb gddr5 getting 50 fps in an open world game @ 1080p with normal settings and aa turned on normal setting  low though i have to say the graphics still look pretty good and the textures look really well done if u have an old pc with avg specs dont worry ull be able to run it just fine well thats for performance as for game play well xd gta v is badass
recommended
i have played this game almost exclusively since it came out on pc the single player story mode is awesome with great characters and set pieces online mode is also very entertaining with heists and jobs you dont have to buy money cards to enjoy the game online as you can earn plenty of money in heists and other jobs the only thing i dont like currently is that when you are playing races if your lobby votes for random you are now more likely to get a nonracing job than a racing one this kills racing lobbies and it is now very difficult to gat a racing lobby with more than 8 players rockstar change it back to how it was before the last update if i am playing races in a racing lobby we should not get a nonracing job when voting random it kills racing lobbies
recommended
ive played this game since ps3 i skipped ps4 and xbox1 and this is amaing on pc it has huge graphical improvements director mode a new radio sttation called the lab plus all the features of ps4xbox 1 such as animal transforming in singleplayer lots of free dlc online all accept heists dlc content is accesible in the campaign because the campaign already has different heists  theres alot more to the game like the mods this game is highly recommended 1010 pug stamp of approval
recommended
awesome game could not be happier with my purchase
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played
recommended
honestly amazing game i cant get enough of it it was great on console and its even better here on pc the only thing bad about it is the fact that rockstar thought it was okay to rase the price using a bundle during the steam summer sale thank god i bought the game before the sale otherwise i would have do bare witness to the milking of steam users wallets
recommended
this game is the best game i have played in a while
recommended
minus the fact the game is buggy and glitchy it is fantasticwould recommend ten fold for gta v on pc except when it comes to gta online didnt work on console wont work here either but all in all love it
recommended

nice game what else can i tell i got this game a day before it released first on consoles i got it for my ps3 waited 2 hours in line and it was definitely worth it played about all night it was fun i played all gta series starting from the first one and ending with current one a lot of things have changed i would say main reason to love this game is that it represents san andreas from gta sa used to love it and still love that game good graphics physics gameplay and so on this game is definitely awesome especially since it was released on pc so many mods horryshiet yet every dlc you get for free free  ye its free unlike bf4 or cod or any other game so is it worth buying hell yeah it is like look at this pizza usually costs 20$ say you buy two pizzas and lots of soda how long will this last you probably two days gta will last forever so buy it god darn it ps rockstar why the hell you changed the price to 79$ right when summer sale hit and make 25% discount jew much thats not cool

ive had this game on ps3 and ps4 and the pc version has not failed to let me down even though i had to wait the game was still superb 1010

easily one of the greatest games ever rockstar did an amazing job with the pc port it makes gta iv look like trash in comparison

recommended
great cept for modders in online

its fun if you have the money to buy the game and committed to play it but if youre are like a hardcore dota 2 or any other mobas game you just waste your money instead of buying the game you should probably just buy arcana hero set which is more satisfaying in the nut shell this game is awesome and the server is just great
recommended
a really great port for one of the more stranger stories in the gta franchise though dont mistake the strange for anything but greatness
recommended
fantastic game graphics are amazing storyline is long and easy to follow need i say more its gta v of course its good
recommended
worth the wait perfect game

gta v was fun at stages and gave us what we always love about gta series freedom single player was fun had alot of good moments but personally the missions which needed switching between 3 playable characters was kinda game breaker for me yes its great way to show 3 different perspectives but there was something about it i didnt really like anyway the one thing that i must hype about is the online rockstar cloud which saves all the characters progressions is still a little bit buggy and demands to be careful how you leave the game and how often you save but everything else is golden love it 1010
recommended
fantasic game alot of  heads on the servers but still fun to  them up when they talk
recommended
this game oh man its fun fast exciting and brutal if you have played the previous games in the series you know what this is about if you havent its like any gangster movie you got car chases shootouts crime and punishment fun in all ways
recommended
amd users download beta 154 drivers game run awfully before like basically unplayable now the game is a improvement max settings some stuttering occasionly however still not very optimised rockstar please sort your  out other than that well its gta v so have fun
recommended
best gta yet online is fun but hard to put together groups for heists
recommended
definatley a step up from the console versions of gta v i have already played 140 hours in just 2 months and plan to play annother concidering i put over 300 hours into the ps3 version i am surprised that it has kept me hooked this long with continued free dlc releases rockstar have done a fantastic job with gta iv being a  pc port in the begining i thaught that this would be the same story but no it was well worth the wait and the delays to get a finished product that is almost perfect in every single way gta v was my favourite game in 2013 and it is again now in 2015
recommended
the game is fun and the graphics is a big improvement the control of the vehicle is so much better gta 5 online is fun and have heist that let you earn fast money it is so far the best game on rockstar $7490 is worth but i bought it after the preorder kind of sad but at least i earn money via the heist
recommended
very fun game but prices are a little high but it is well worth it
recommended
they could make better multiplayer and more options but oh well its gta and probably best game around in this genre

ive bought this game 4 times once on xbox 360 launch night i absolutely loved it i spent countless hours exploring the amazing atmosphere of blaine county and the avid and hectic moshpit of los santos i then bought it a year later for my playstation 4 where it was lesser of an experience i didnt play as much why i didnt have any friends to play with they were all on xbox one thats the catch you can experience the amazing singleplayer but eventually itll get dull thats where grand theft auto online comes in its overwheming but without friends to play it with its boring so i traded in my ps4 copy and bought myself an xbox one copy it was amazing again i played for days and then i heard about it coming to steam in april i remembered from the launch that pc was supposed to come sooner but it never really did so i jumped at the opportunity to experience los santos and blaine county again i bought it here and it was like xbox 360 all over again i kind of lost point in this review sorry

 online  first youre like motherfukken grandeft auto 5 thousand then you wait in loading screen for 5 years after that you start grinding for money because everything has to cost millions then you have to unlock all the stupid upgrades for your cars by racing  you have to pay for the upgrades too and they cost ign thousands of bucks and theres the added bonus of your favorite hackers dominating the world records for any race anywhere anyway so you cant even get that cool hoe tattoo you want on your shoulder then you go and do all the heists and are like yeah i got mah bro mils and all in order mils and now i faken rank 968395310513 then suddenly you used all your moneys on cars and upgrades then some ing hacker comes and takes all your ammo and as you have no mone you cant even have fun to blow  up as you used it all on crap you need and cos youre dont care about going on rampages and killing random people anymore you dont even bother getting the money for ammo because ammo costs alot ing hackers taking all my ammo what did i ever do to them then theres the thing with the ing garages being too small what the hell why cant i store 100 cars cmon 30 cars is not enough its like gotta catchem all pokemon style then there is weird vehicles that you require high rank and they also cost millions

grand theft auto v is an absolutely fun game where unlike the previous grand theft auto games everything about it screams of satirical elements out of the three not counting mp characters you can play franklin an ex gangbanger and michael a heister who faked his own death want out of their previous lives yet keep getting sucked back into them one way or another the third one trevor is a psychopath through and through and wants to free one of his and michaels former crewmates from prison as well as run an industry based on illegal weapons and other substances its been a while since i last played the story though so lets focus on the better half of the game online the biggest differences between sp and mp besides the obvious multiplayer element are as follows 1 in single player when you shoot the legs of an enemy they lay on the ground shooting you if you dont finish them off in multiplayer they decide to say f bullet wounds that would normally cripple me im getting back up and running for cover 2 multiplayer has the ability to buy your own properties 3 the notsoobvious repercussions with a moddable game and multiplayer script kiddies some of them present interesting challenges such as filling a downtown street with ufos and a legion of rocketslinging lesters others will ruin servers and oftentimes the game itself for everyone playing with them as it seems so far rockstar has been doing nothing to cull this issue as of yet ever since they rescinded their modding ban and it has gotten out of control other than those differences heres procons everyone likes those pros great graphics benchmark tests shooting and hitboxes work well together bipolar community driving works great wanted system works great balance between paytowin and efforttowin online with one small issue cons graphics are built for 4k resolutions anything smaller will randomly see odd shapes on surfaces every so often like michaels houses doorway gta online has an aforementioned hacker problem bipolar community undecidedequal very strange tv shows ingame most radio stations are rap or some sort of technodubstep stations theres 1 rock station 1 pop and 1 country the rest is rap or technodubstep rediculously stupid npcs i cant tell you how many times ive fired a gun and seen civilians run into freaking out highspeed roads like dodos of a cliff and not to mention driving npcs are even more of a pain especially if traffic is enabled during a race these sheeple doo make fun memories though all in all it is a great game but with a few minor issues and to all of the bad reviews based on a raise in price for a sale the game itself is not on sale but the bundles are for the price of the game gtav is a big game that recently came out for pc you will not get your 2550% off on it youre all lucky that it is on sale the way it is
recommended
just fantastic on the pc you can easily sink many many hours in to the campaign and then you still have the amazing online component
recommended
i love gta5 the game looks so much better on pc
recommended
enjoyable singleplayer campaign with a decent length to it online play will keep you busy for hours and has been well designed to prevent griefing etc though this is gta we are talking about so expect a fair number of lunatics out for your blood i found the gta online initial loading to take quite a long time but the loading once in the game was pretty minimum this could vary depending on your connection etc though
recommended
i would like to play this but i cant read japanies so i cant play it

this game is fantastic even a masterpiece when it comes to the pc version i cannot recommend it enough for the sheer amounts of fun enjoyment and replayable with this title ps httpi2kymcdncomphotosimagesnewsfeed00080048760dgif

like theft enjoy murder how about cruising around on a stolen infernus terrorising the sidewalks of los santos be it multiplayer heists or just the singleplayer story gta v will be the game for you with hours of endless entertainment you can travel around san andreas exploring the stunning map and just generally having a good time so what can you do well for a start theres singleplayer following a well planned storyline franklin clinton is sucked into a world of crime with a retired old man and a deranged canadian planning heists doing heists then splashing out on your honest earned cash are the basics to this game then theres multiplayer create your own character and rank up in the world unlocking new weapons hair styles clothing you name it
recommended
game itself is really good  story is pretty good  freeroam is fun as you can do what ever you want cycling driving cars flying planes and helicopters hunting shooting s and what not  online is fun if you have friends on the other hand  online is hugely ed up rockstar likes money so they have made cars and everything really expensive and making money is hard although if you have friends and find screwing around and playing same missions fun do it get yourself gta v if you dont have friends try random lobbiesbe aware there can be lots of cheaters and other s so be prepared if there is only s and such look from the web i believe there are many websitesfor example wwwredditcomrgtaonlinecrews where you could find similar players like you

quite a lot of hackers at the moment but still a great game and a fun game to play with friends

rockstar the developers of grand theft auto v has proven to us that they worked very hard to finally make a gta 5 port on pc that us pc gamers would enjoy and they pulled it off this game supports 60 fps added first person and a working multiplayer however i do not recommend this game to people that have weak computers this game is very cpu and ram demanding you play as 3 players michael trevor and franklin in the single player and you must make many decisions in the game while doing a lot of missions that will have you grilling hours into this game the missions may deal with racing assassinations heists and much more that you have a variety of missions to witness the grand theft auto series has prospered and their fans come in to enjoy all their titles that release many people rate this game negative because mods can get you banned and the summer sale tricked many players that gta 5 was going to be 25% off but ignore those players for $60 this game is worth the money what do you do after you finish 2030 hours worth of playtime in this game online that is you can do many things online that are similar to missions in the singleplayer butthis time you can play with friends if you have any o_o this game is truly worthy for you to invest your money in 9510
recommended
i think this is good
recommended
i bought the game and a couple days later after transferring my level 5 character from xbox because it sux me and my friends had a fist fight we ended up shooting eachother and running over our corpses on the sidewalk while police mercilessly rampaged through the city a couple weeks later we were screwing around again and i was driving a plane at night time and scared the living s out of my friend as i crashed into a telephone pole right next to him while he was in first person in a car apparently all it takes to steal a military plane from a base with anti air missiles is to just drive a car and ramp it over the fence and make sure a tank doesnt get near you which doesnt have to if you hijack one or get it straight from the hangar the missiles arent even a threat if you stay low enough 1010 stealing fighter jets is easier than robbing little ol grannies
recommended
good game but the ram 4gb and vga 2gb its still lag but this is cool game and fps so good thx steam and social club
recommended
single player campaign in most parts is very good characters are different and funny dialogs good and voice acting is amazing game offers variety of missions and overall story writing is actually good its like comedy crime thing where everything goes worse and worse i really liked that so yeah sp experience is great
recommended
great game to see your friend driven over more than 10 times
recommended
good game and good port multiplayer is riddled with hackers atm but besides that its guchi
recommended
i really like this game do to that fact that you can do whta ever the hell you want on the map i dont like the game because for some reason it cant upload my saved charater that i played 100 hours on my free time of work i play everytime im off or i get a chance why the hell is my player not uploading from rockstart game cloud please explain
recommended
probably one of the best games ive played so far the graphics are amazing sometimes i catch myself just drivingflying around los santos for hours this game has an awesome story and such hilarious conversations i should also mention the music which is very good rockstar did and amazing job with the city traffic its very realistic and so is peoples behaviour if you enjoyed the previous gta games you are gonna love this one
recommended
alot of fun campaign mission this time around they focused on 3 characters and bank heists and some side missions the online is fun once you get to the lvl 12 and heists but overall it wasnt as much fun as i was hoping it would be online id grab it for half off or discounted if you are in the mood for big open world gta gaming
recommended
played through xbox360 first and knew itll be must buy for pc played the game through on pc loved it even more
recommended
best gta so far very good immersive detailed lots to do in and out of the story line
recommended
pros  great graphics  good story  well made diverse map much better than gta ivs  multiplayeronline mode is a massive upgrade from gta ivs as well  lots of car mods  buyable houses on gta online  strip clubs  free dlc added every now and then cons  scipterscheaters online occasionally  players are punished for using mods on singleplayer   paytowin system isnt a great idea but rockstar wants money i guess  radio stations could have a little more variety i hear the same songs a lot songs can be added though [ httpwwwrockstargamescomnewswirearticle52419selfradiocreateyourowncustomradiostationingtavpc ]  bad matchmaking system for heists players shouldnt be punished for their teammates dying heists can take forever sometimes
recommended
very good gameonline is brutal fun but lot of players cheats i tested modmenu but i hated it i love original game without cheats <3
recommended
dumb popcorn fun rockstar delivered on making this a very different better game than gta iv and los santos is just a pleasure to explore but missions can get pretty stale and youll quickly realize that the campaign doesnt have as much to offer as its overthetop intro leads players to believe from a technical standpoint it looks great on pc runs fairly well social club integration doesnt feel too awful and doing away with games for windows live makes the online far more enjoyable than past titles however if you play on kbm the aiming and controls can feel pretty floaty which is never a good thing but its gta its dumb it knows it and it plays dumb its great even better with modsfriends the price tag is fairly steep for what you get but i think it was worth the money oh hey also its soundtrack feels fresh and poppy expect very bassy electronic works hiphop and some very out of place latin american stuff pleasure to listen to fits perfectly within the game flow flying lotus really steals the show on flylo fm look up his track stonecutter

a very good storyline focused game and rockstar had once again made a successful game hopefully the next grand theft auto they will make will be better even with the delays they managed to made the game fully polished bugfree game which every company should take a page out of if you are going to delay use that time wisely to make sure the game will work and not be broken nonetheless rockstar didnt disappoint
recommended
this is the only game i have payed 60 dollars for on steam and i dont regret it fun with friends fun by yourself
recommended
great game
recommended
my favorite things about grand theft auto v is west coast classics the car customization free roam survival game mode heists and dialogue especially because of micheal and lamar in single player id recommend this game to anyone except for my mom and any child below the age of 11 youll probably end up playing this game for a while since it is very fun especially with friends and because there are many things to do on top of that youll probably enjoy many moments in this game because of the variouis funny and epic things that can happen in it

the summer sale is over get over it yes rockstar did perform some shady  but they still need to make money no matter how much you dont like microtransactions rockstar needs to always make money and right now the shark cards are the best solution especially with the summer bundles since gta online mods are out of control this is a fact i have 60 mil in game that other players have given to me so there only solution was the bundle to get a chance to still make reasonable amounts of money a few months after the pc release now to the real review its gta and above all its gta v so far the best in the series to me i have played as a long time fan of gta since gta iii and these games are just plain fun it combines the openess of gta san andreas the broken city feel full of crime and hijinks like in gta iv the outrageousness of gta vice city and the familier gameplay of gta iii this will be a game to remember from days to to come

recommended
80100  one of the best games to date if it works enjoy getting your time money and computer consumed by this beast of a game
recommended
would i recommend this game yes absolutely it has everything a good game should have graphic gameplay storyline and the graphic settings are scaleable so dont worry if you have a computer from the flintstones era you may probably be able to play the game it isnt a perfect game but rockstar did a very wonderful job in this game one flaw i can think of is after finishing the game then what it seems the developers decided to not include repeatable missions or way to use up all the money youll gain during the game and thats bad gta online is good a little too much of loading screens and the whole carnshop thing isnt very consistent with the games setting imho but well compared to the multiplayer in gta 4 its a whole different thing bad thing that joypad abusers have it way too easier than mousekeyboard users they basically have an aimbot they usually shut up after eating a rocket though

i hope you give us new heist online

a lot of fun though the online can be a bit chaotic

really great game for playing online however the waiting times are long

all the way from 2007 and still going strong when i say going strong i usually like to think so in the community workshop and hat section but on a serious note this game is absolutely sensational and whats the best of it now well its totally free and definitely deserves the quote the most fun you can have online  pc gamer the game has a wide and diverse selection of 9 different classes ranging from their own unique abilities and strategies that can be performed against each class kind of like a rock paper scissors thing the fast boston talking and even more fast running scout to the towering minigunwielding hulk of a russian man known as heavy though every character class usually represents a soldier in a common fps of some sort what i love about this is the fact that valve has openly breathed life vibrant personalities characteristics and nationalities into this ragtag bunch i also enjoyed the customization of weapons and accessories named after the witty puns possibly the slight descrimination and referenced culture of that said character really brings out the comedic flare of the game and shows that humour can mix amusement in with entertainment another great thing to note in this game is the fact that its holiday themed either new campaigns modeled after a specific holiday down to the newly cashed in fan made hats are launched to the public to bring in funds for both valve and the original creator at hand halloween christmas easter just to name a few are a great example and addition to the games growing campaign and community i definitely recommend this game not just down to the fact that its free but because it still remains fun to this day and constant updates on campaigns and official hat accessories keep this game alive making the game overall timeless

when you have had a bad day there is no better feeling than walking up to a hooker and punching her straight in the facebut on a serious note the game is stable i have had no problems other than getting bombed of the server every now and then

finally gta v the pc master race unites the online portion of the game will keep you being social killing randos smashing things attempting weird jumps and ticking off conservative parents for eternity
recommended
this game is a blast to play both literally and figuratively just keep in mind that some of the people you will meet online are not the mostmature otherwise this is a great game even by rockstar standards
recommended
nothing says quality games like switching to trevor and seeing him in a tutu

probably one of the best games ive played so far the graphics are amazing sometimes i catch myself just drivingflying around los santos for hours this game has an awesome story and such hilarious conversations i should also mention the music which is very good rockstar did and amazing job with the city traffic its very realistic and so is peoples behaviour if you enjoyed the previous gta games you are gonna love this one
recommended
alot of fun campaign mission this time around they focused on 3 characters and bank heists and some side missions the online is fun once you get to the lvl 12 and heists but overall it wasnt as much fun as i was hoping it would be online id grab it for half off or discounted if you are in the mood for big open world gta gaming
recommended
played through xbox360 first and knew itll be must buy for pc played the game through on pc loved it even more
recommended
love killing my friends in grand theft auto v great game slightly overpriced but worth it 1010 would bang wow intensifies
recommended
love this game very much have not found anything wrong with it just beat the story today love the story mode and if you dont already have this game its a must for you to get
recommended
for 40 you get tons of content main story missions tons of side quests and just things to go see and do the editor is just friggin amazing if you not used it or even tried it its a must other companies can learn from this no question the online content is another game entirely that give you the opportunity to experience gta pvp like only rockstar could working coop to pull of heists this imho is the biggest seller for online that are both challenging and rewarding or go deathmatch car racing even just shoot another player after you done a heist and take hisher loot as well ah betrayal always good no honor among thieves there is nothing more to be said really except its a must to have on your shelf or steam library & i look forward to mugging you every opportunity ps  only negative point i can make is wish i could make a transfer of funds from game bank to my real life bank come on rockstar share some of those billions with yer investors ^^
recommended
superbly optimized > you can easily get 4070 fps with almost any decent system but even with godlike system about 90 is max you can mod the singeplayer fun game with friends community questions and topics site is great and r answers a lot of questions good story awesome multiplayer system you can see from my hours put into the game that i enjoy it a lot 1110 would highly recommend this game to everyone who like openworld games and likes to have fun with friends

finally managed to install it without getting lagfps drops love the game of the best gta games ever made
recommended
this version blows the console versions out of the water great visuals and high framerates make this much more enjoyable then the nextgen versions gta online works for the most part it worked on day one and the only issue i have had it losing connection sometimes but it is only after being in a session for a few hours i have had some crashing issues three times in 35 hours but this is before any patches have been released im sure they will fix the crashes now that tons of error reports are being submitted some people say the game will not start for them at all i have been able to luckily play since the game lauched a user on reddit posted a fix for my crashing and it was to disable vsync that seems to have fixed the problem i had horrible screen tearing so i now force with nvidia control panel gtx 970  4670k i get around 80100 fps on veryhigh settings with msaa off
recommended
whether you come from the old gen the current gen or maybe your even a new comer to the game the beautiful graphics the amazing optimization that can let you run it on a potato at 60 fps and the great rockstar editor only some of the many reasons you should get gta v even if you already own it i give it 1010 for looking better running smoother and overall being a better experience than the consoles and for being ing great in general

it takes 6 ingame hours to walk from michaels house to the golf course at normal walking speed

pros great story amazing graphics well optimizedstable online mode 60fps cons gta online has some really big bugs that should be fixed final score 9\10
recommended
you guys in the negative section use mods for singleplayer not online i r8 a10 awesome graphics with lots of graphic options fabulous optimization even lowend pc can play gtav fluently full controller support simlessly switch between keyboardmouse and controller even in tense combat or high speed driving vivid and colorful game world los santos lots of different terrain in ls including downtown city countryside mountains ocean even under water world tons of cars to collect and customize and more vehicles such as airplane helicopter fighter boat submarine you can drive featuring characterbased gameplay switch to different characters to experience different life in los santos including the characters you created nice and neat story between 3 different characters walkthrough the story from different aspect and know the 3 main characters life style beside main story theres lots of activities for 1 to 30 people to play with including pvp and pve events heists are so fun dedicated missions for each position everyone finishe the jobs to complete a bigger job mighty rockstar editor evolved from gta iv rockstar editor allow players to record gameplay not only video and editcompose it ingame then publish to youtube intergrated with rgsc webpage easy to share and track the game progress achievements and even songs in radio need more customization of vehicles i want to customize my own aircrafts boats and armored vehicles need more weapons to choose there are lots of weapons in gtav now but some are missing and never too many weapons need more house to buy some mansions in los santos are awesome such as franklins but unavailable in online mode need more clothes and costumes such as windbreaker where is the snow scenes we had snow in christmas update on console but why theres no constant snow scene in gtao such as mountain peak can not sell weapons so its a trouble to switch weapons while you have unlocked lots of weapons match making system is not stable its difficult to connect to public game grand theft auto was the leading brand of the openworld game title and this is so true as gtav pc version is so success thx rockstar

great game very fun online too but they really need to region lock servers and put in ai team mates to help with heists so players could at least learn them and not have to deal with elite  or people from another country who you cant understandalso its annoying constantly having to reset them when someone leaves or gets dcd at least take a cut in money rewarded for heists if playing with ai teammates

i have to put out 2 reviews gta 5 1010 game is worth it just for the single player campaign gta 5 online 210 gta online is the most broken buggy pos i have ever seen or had the displeasure of being apart of crashes hard crashes not just restart gta but power down your comp restart type  constantly infinite load times load times in general bugs galore broken matchmaking completely non existent doesnt even work heist are straight up copypasted from the single player campaign lacks a ton of content their answer to content in gta online is doing the same  a million times hacks galore rockstar support rockstar clearly does not give a  about any problems anybody has gta online is a joke i can only assume its there to pass off online drm its just slapped together trash i would recommend the game just for the single player partonline is a waste of time and just plain not fun
recommended
clearly one of the most well optimized and fun pc games especially with mods and the improved multiplayer servers including the ill gotten gains dlc with fps realistic actions this game should be nominated for gotc just a few patches for the online rockstar is already working on them and we are done gta v game of the century
recommended
here is my review for gta v single player pros  open world with very big map which you can explore and do many many things from side quests to activities  stunning graphics  excellent voice acting  the music is as usual in gta game good  easy gameplay  a live city the ai was very well made  you can do almost anything you want from watching tv playing golf parachuting going to strip club buying various properties or even wreaking havoc in the city  the main story was although nothing extraordinarysolid and good  fantastic main characters each one with his pros and cons in his character  even if you finish the game you can just play it from time to time for fun doing whatever you like  you can customize your vehicles at a great extent something that i really liked cons  you cant have a proper girlfriend like previous gta  although the cops are more challenging than previous gta and thats good sometimes it becomes a nuisance to escape them  rockstars move before the summer sale to increase the price was horrible and it stopped 3 of my friends from buying it online is really enjoyable but i stopped playing because there were too many jackasses that attack you for no reason epxloding your car etc making the gameplay frustrating for me
recommended
great game
recommended
buy this gamebuyit buyit
recommended
its gta on pc feels great what more could you ask for besides some dlc lol best company in the world except for valve imo just do what you do rockstar and if youre really on the fence dont be as long as your pc can handle it youre in for a good story mechanics sounds visuals fun online with friends as long as no hackers id rate the game as a pc port 910 job well done just wish more people were online like the original launches on consoles
recommended
as i am writing this some people are reporting issues with launching the game due to an issue with windows user names unfortunately i cannot speak for them my experience however has been perfect this game runs silky smooth on my computer which has a i7 4770k and a gtx 980 i am running at 1080p 60 fps and maxed out settings i do not have a 4k monitor so i dont know how well it runs in 4k there is no doubt in my mind that this is the definitive version of the game after 1 12 years we finally get to see los santos the way it was meant to be seen and thats just the graphics my favorite thing about this port is that it doesnt even feel like a port to me it runs like it was meant to be played on pc the addition of the clip editor and director mode adds a whole new level of depth to the gameplay the director mode allows you to use characters from the game many are already unlocked but some have to be earned through gameplay that already sounds like so much fun and thats before mods which will make this game perfect
recommended
i love this game im now lvl 177 and its amazing so much fun i definately recommend if you have friends to play with d

9510  ign this game is spectacular though there were many delays but i guess it was worth it heres my list of pros and cons and please if you disagree dont be an  about it everyone and their opinions pros a huge open world and many explorable places to go dont forget beautiful great optimization at least in my opinion many things to keep you from beind bored like races parachuting killing your friends and acting to be innocent and so on many variation of styles to choose form to distinguish you from your friends heists are amazingly fun requires you to have friends though ^ and many more i cant put in a review cons many players tend to be s but i guess i can understand why as this is a m for mature rated game some graphic settings will tend to cause you lag in multiplayer some tiny bugs and glitches that honestly makes the game more fun lmao conclusion the game is a great game to share with your friends and to put all your idiocity in it you can go heisting or racing in the hugeopenworld that it delivers
recommended
took 3 rolls during the loading screen of online my rolls kicked before i got into online it took my rolls an hour kick

grand theft auto v  graphics  best graphics on the market right now  customization  cars bikes outfit hairstyles guns etc  size  large map many different areas to explore  fighting  punch stab beat shot its all fun  vehicles  helicopters planes cars trucks bikes etc  characters  three different unique characters fun to switch between trevor is awesome  driving  extremely touchy grip is unrealistic very very arcade cartoon feel  story  somewhat boring story not terrible but not as good as gta iv  hard to run but not because of bad optimization its just a extremely good looking game  length  game is short story is not that long but the side quests and messing around take up lots of time overall  910 amazing game with some small faults

after finally getting round to playing this game on the pc what a massive improvement i have to mention from the old days of playing gta v on ps3 my current rig runs this game on very high setting at 60 fps which is only limited by my monitor without stuttering like some people have complained about this issue in the negative reviews section on steam furthermore this is a fantastic game to enjoy with friends i cant justify the online experience too much because i never really play in public lobbies i prefer to play in private lobbies with friends which is a more enjoyable experience avoiding the little kiddios who think gta is cod gta v was a game well worth the wait in my opinion overall a fantastic game which runs really smooth on my msi nvidia gtx 970 gpu one negative is rockstars ridiculous steam sale price including an item instead of discounting the price of the game which i was shocked by since the game is 2 years old
recommended
good game for a shooter ive played the ps3 and ps4 version and it is pretty good only problem is the terrain glitch
recommended
a very good game with so much to do and a giant map to explore
recommended
much better than console amazing online

heavily recommend this game solid gta game and very good port and will work on most systems and achive 1080p60fps 1010

i mean its gta whats left to say its great great story graphics music everything
recommended
i have had problems with the raw input mouse setting i have had to change it to direct input due to stuttery mouse movement otherwise it is a great game along with the modding capabilities i rate 88 m8
recommended
i f love this game the storyline is great no annoying cousin constantly calling and asking to go bowling or hang out there is plenty of side missions and really high replay value if you plan to play online make sure you have friends to do heists with when you get to level 12 or higher doing them with strangers sucks and almost never works out i now have a gtx 960 4gb ssc with all the settings turned up and it is absolutely amazing first person mode is the s too buy this game you wont regret it unless you have a toaster or a potatoe
recommended
ufo landed on me as i left my apartment blew me up 1010 hackers 1 in more words  very well optimized and awesome graphics  singleplayer storylinecharacters  variety of cars and guns  customizability  weather system is amazing  beautiful landscape  moonlike gravity physics sometimes a con  dlcs have been adding in some fun new things  online passive mode  online prices are high unless your life is gta  online matchmaking blows  online hackers can get annoying  online loading takes forever  controllers cant be custom mapped in game so most issues with online can be solved by playing with friends in a private lobby solves what most people complain about this game great game though singleplayer is nearly perfect online needs some work but thats usual for any online side of a game
recommended
now i dont need to tell you how great gta v as a game is the massive and active openworld the gripping storyline and the diverse and fantastic gameplay but now with the pc version of this game the game can finally be played at its very best it can be pushed to its limits and be enjoyed to its maximum potential now its probably good to start with the problems since this game isnt perfect naturally you are going to have problems in openworld games like this there are occasional fps drops and i encountered stuttering for a while until it was patched also the game does have its glitches and graphical errors but they do not happen regularly and hardly deter from the gaming experience plus its online system could do with quite a bit of work they have in essence taken the same system they used for the console versions of this game and thats a problem with pc its peer to peer system does have issues and it means its much easier to hack the game as a result hackers are appearing more often i think rockstar having not developed anything like gta online on pc before need to have a rethink if they want their players to enjoy gta online the way i know it can be though the sad reality is that rockstar arent likely to be doing anything about this unfortunately but the singleplayer part of this game alone makes this game worth buying in the first place as explained later so in contrast to that rather bad start time to talk about the good parts of this game of which there are many rockstar have overall made a fantastic and well optimised game you will see hundreds and hundreds of posts about performance issues but when you consider the playerbase for this game on pc that small percentage is a minority you arent going to see many posts about the game running as well as it does of course so dont be fooled by other people even if you do encounter performance issues at first with the default settings the advanced and incredibly detailed options menu will allow you to tinker with the game so that it runs just like you want it to now enough about performance the game congratulations to rockstar here for they have actually created what i believe is the closest thing to a living city unlike most openworld games where the gameplay gets repetitive very quickly there is always so much stuff to do in gta v plus with the mods available now as well as the games native replay value you can get hours and hours of gameplay out of this more than can be said for a lot of games plus the game itself is beautiful i spent too much time just wandering around every now and then just to admire this games visuals in conclusion the combination of all of these great aspects means gta v is the brilliant game that it is although this game has performance issues and you do need a decent pc to run this at settings to justify playing the pc version as opposed to the console version in the first place if you are one of those people who can run this i cannot recommend this game enough

i bought a shark cash card after the steam summer sale and when i went o activate it in the social club store the activation code had 2 more numbers than it would allow me to enter it says its invalid if anyone could help that would be great

this game is great i love the story mode and all of it i have played about 540 hours on this game on console to but the multiplayer is just  i mean the modders and the hackers and the peaple saying im going to get your ip its just stupid some of the modders and hackers are nice and fun but other ones are just  so if you want a great 60 hours of a story and just so much to do and explore this game is for you  but if you are here for the online its not worth it and also just a side note make sure you at least have a 32 ghz processor i lerned this the hard way so i hope this review helped you byeyeyeyeyeye

story8510 nice  funny and intresting and awesome story gameplay910 very enjoyable gameplay the switch system is giving more joy to the game graphics 910  they did a really job well done to the graphics they are good portoptional 810 the port is great mostly i getting 6096 frames per second on my gtx 770 sometimes goes to 4850 but that is not heppening allot the port is good and playable has allot options vram requierments are high multiplayer gta online7910 enjoyablefunny and good to spend the time in it  play the online heists with friends or the mission and however you like beware of the players who just killing everybody they see or hackerscheaters you might meet them but just dont do cheats yourself and do not download mods the mods will work at the singleplayer but beware do not use them at online or youll get banned price7510 well the its the regular sad 60 dollars $5999 usd but well they spent allot to creat that game above 100 million dollars and they requesting money well i say due the game is very good i kind of netural if the game is worth the 60$ or not its really depressing to pay allot of money 60$ to every game now but if you starting to rage or cry it wont help unfortenatly overall isan actual 1010 they did allot of work and the delays we was very raging untill then when the delayes has occoured but now i kind of greatful for those delayes imagine if the game was realese on the spot and it was so  port such as grand theft auto iv rockstar meneged to do a job well done this is one of the best game i played in all time and i very recommend you to buy it when you can if you got 5999 $ usd in your steam wallet and you want to buy a game then this is for you

grand theft auto online has been one of my favorite games with rockstars common free dlc and great support and community of the game i preorderded it on pc and ps3 the first month of pc playtime for me and my friends had probably some of the best moments in our gaming together unfortuanatly as expected there would be setbacks for the pc version of the game cheaters and modders the current state of gta online is broken just about every lobby is filled with hackers and modders finding randoms to befriend and have fun with is just about impossible now the only way i can truly enjoy this game is if i host my one inviteonly session or i could wait untill mods from private sessions or deticated servers are released if they actually are in the making i would say get this game but wait untill some more news is released by rockstar it may say i have low hours in this game but that is becuase this is a different account i have over 100 hours in online nolyf

gtav is the king wen it comes to open world games the story mode hasa great story and is very fun muiltiplayer is fun to play with friends in private matches but its not very fun with randoms overall i would recommend this game 910
recommended
probably one of the greatest games ever made the story is fantastic the world is stunnigly beautiful and huge and the characters and their voice acting is absolutly phenomonal it took me 38 hours to finish the campaign at a leisurly pace and i enjoyed every bit of it i felt the singleplayer was totally worth it for 60 dollars and multiplayer is an added bonus just get this game
recommended
i always love the freedom we grant ourselves with rockstar i modded the game for weeks until i got banned time to use a dedicated sever client  <3 1010 would mod again

10  10 the best characters of all the gta games and by far ive played them all since gta 3 1 downside cheaters lots and lots of them and they do very annoying bad things to you 2 downside the system requirements my amd hd 6950 runs it well @ 1920x1080 but i had to turn the graphics settings down enough that my pictures doesnt look as good as the screenshots to a large extent because of no aa but not only that
recommended
best game of all time why someone might ask simple you can find out if jetfuel cant really melt steel beams
recommended
has some bugs but is a good game
recommended
great multiplayer game d
recommended
this game is awesome mainly because of the capabilities to alter the graphic settings depending on the computer you can alter the graphic settings so as you can truly create the ultimate personal graphical gta v pc experience recommended for anyone over 15 who loves open world gameplay as well as multiplayer
recommended
a well executed pc port amazing game enough said just buy it

i played a little bit was fun after i got an insurgent pick up and could destroy all those s with armored kurumas overall 910 such a great feeling to roll around in a tank you stole from the army base and blow up all the cars and cops like a boss
recommended
a crazy fun and addictive game
recommended
such a great game they made you buy it 3 times great game long time to download
recommended
its vast wide and fun variety of activities fun missions sometimes challenging to the point of actually wanting to retry instead of just going i wish they havnt put this mission in the game the main characters are unique wonderful voice acting gameplay is great both in terms of combat and driving although some times vehicles feel like bouncy slippery hot boiled eggs on wheels and it just feels great to do anything and thats without even going online once which i am sure will deliver as well at the time of writing this review i am using a computer below minimum requirements and magically i can run this game on steady framerate unlike some other games that have much lower requirements and can barely run cough stargorge cough verdict buy
recommended
only just started but there ia quality coding here bugs yes but so far not critical
recommended
very fun amazing graphics the singleplayer is simply amazing loads of fun and waste your life away in a life simulator but like better

fun for the whole family
recommended
its a good game it really is  but rockstar is doing some serious  ups  79$ summer sale  25% off  that  the good things about this game are the graphics and gameplay mechanics it pushes its game engine to some limits but i do believe they could of done better  the mods are fairly easy to install all they need to do now is add a steam workshop  the main issue with this game is the amount of hackers on the servers  i mean floating cars and driving on water are cool and all but the free money that you can get banned for having and u cant even get rid of it fix your god damn anti cheat system  anyway i guess im done  here is my final words  play single player  you will have a blast  play multiplayer get ready to be banned and cheated out of the game 
recommended
one of the best in the franchise since grand theft auto san andreas
recommended
i tried talking to someone and they kicked me in the balls 1010 just like in real life
recommended
this game is amazing i play it all the time and never get bored of it 1000001
recommended
 1110 would go on a rampage again if someone mocks trevor for his accent this game has gorgeous graphics and enormous world details not only the land but the air  sea and the underwater world is visually eye popping the story is very much hollywoodish but well written perhaps the best feature about this game is the three characters with their own linear plot and the way they interconnect thorughout the game my personal favourite player is trevor he is psychopath but the humor surrounding him is funny especially those relating to his canadian origins watchdogs map is also very much detailed had a totally different gameplay and development direction
recommended
awesome game just the singleplayer worth every penny

why the  are you reading this review just buy the goddam game
recommended
grand theft auto v is banging  if you enjoyed all other gta stories  your not going to be dissapointed the gta online feature is the best thing aabout it 
recommended
pros  awesome graphics and animations  characters were interesting and voice acting was superb  playing the story from three characters perspectives is a fresh and fun change  pulling off heists while switching between 3 different characters and objectives is awesome  side missions are enjoyable and not repetitive  driving and combat is very nice and fun  gta online heists with friends is a great multiplayer experience cons  characters in the story are too extreme to an unrealistic level  a lot of missions require driving for long periods of time  the final mission was abrupt and the ending had little closure  gta online is only fun with friends final verdict 810
recommended
i thought the game was cool until rockstar decided to be greedy pay to play raising game price before sale rock on scumbags this is why im gonna pirate rockstar games from now on
recommended
my advice is  storyline finish the 2 quests and than go play online
recommended
probably a great game if you are not bogged down in trying to understand the complexity of the 3way splitpersonality of the game almost as confusing as watchdogs was at first happy i bought it  but its the last game of the type i ever buy if they cant code it to play on a gtx780 at ultra everything at 1080p we are not cashpoint machines
recommended
this game is well worth the wait i like playing it on my pc at 60fps and being able to record it whenever i want sure it has some bugs right now but they will get fixed i know that for sure anyone looking to purchase it on here i suggest you get it the game is so much fun and will be even more with the additional mod support that is now out best game 1010 would play again after being shot for staring at a officer in the wrong way
recommended
the game is great the port is good and the player are  if you buy this game just to play heists you will probably be disappointedwhen modders are allowed to mod gta online i am i will return to play the game but with the last installment of gta online dlc i have to stay the game is becoming boring as all there is too do is spend money and make money this gets extremelly repetitive

i have a lower end laptop and this game still runs well and looks good even with most of the options disabled its very well optimized and grand theft auto online is a ton of fun
recommended
the one game to prove that scotland isnt useless
recommended
changing the game price was a  move however this doesnt mean the game is bad still very enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone
recommended
its gta v for pc get it if you think youll like it cause you will unless youre a peace activist hipster
recommended
it is a very good game
recommended
despite only having minmum system requirements i still get decent graphics and performance completed main story without any crashes rockstar really have put good effort into making this work for pc its only the draw distance that trees in mountains if i look further back can see them pop up but its not as if things just spring out in front of me id love to see this in 2160 x 3840 resolution @ 60 frames per second maybe sometime in the future when i have a new computer i dont see point in buying the shark cards though
recommended
gta v pc is the ultimate version of one of the greatest games in history and the best openworld game that you will play until the advent of gta vi or rdr 2
recommended
the best game ever

1010 i love this is game i totally would recommend getting this game i have this game on other consoles and its my favorite game

i spent $100 on shark cards then a player spawns $10 million in bags in a random server a little disappointed in the weak moderating hackers just dont get in their way then youll enjoy the game more
recommended
fun game to play and use mods when it gets boring
recommended
buy this now
recommended
best game i bought from steam
recommended
grand theft auto v was the first game i ever bought for full 60 aaaprice i dont regret it but its definitely taught me to be very cautious about aaagames the singleplayer is fantastic being able to switch between three different characters at once is great the missions are great and the overall gameplay is great as well the game is in my opinion worth the price for the singleplayer alone and that is good because gta online could have been a lot better progress is slow for every level you gain you will only unlock one or two things that you actually care about also purchasing vehicles for your garages is disproportionally expensive a mediocre sports car from the 70s costs $400000 compared to what the missions earn you completing the last and most expensive heist at the heighest difficulty will earn at most $1250000 split across four players rockstar have done this so that they can sell you shark cards yeah microtransactions that go up to 75 in a 60 title moreover the servers are filled with hackers who can be very annoying some will just give players money but a lot of them have only found creative ways to annoy you or make the game unplayable for you besides the fact that gta vs pc port is much better than that of gta iv doesnt mean that rockstar games are finally fully supporting the pc as a platform they are still doing everything they can do to make modding the game more difficult and the ill gotten gains part 2 update objectively made the game run poorer i myself have experienced the framerate dropping from 60fps all the way down to 14 in certain situations since the last update so in conclusion the singleplayer is great and probably worth the price online definitely isnt and dont expect rockstar to support you and the other pc gamers they still dont
recommended
gta5 is the best of the series to date i beat single player mode twice before trying online and i must say the multiplayer aspect is brilliant i have also read many reviews and most of the negative ones complain about hackers honeslty i have never experienced anything that took away my fun from people hacking in muliplayer sure i see hackers all the time online but never have i found myself turning the game off because some low life hacker ruined it for me people complaining about constantly getting killed by hackers obviously have not found passive mode nor a good crew to play with do not let other reviews scare you from buyingplaying this game online it has given me some of the best white knuckle edge of my seat action ive ever experienced in a video game and ive been gaming for over 20 years totally worth every bit of the $60 i paid for it hope this helps
recommended
timeless classic great laugh heists update was epic still waiting on cops vs robbers
recommended
great game the new updates for online make me a bit laggy but i dont exactly meet the minimum requirements to play this game people are complaining about the hackers a lot but most of the time i dont have that much trouble with them maybe 2 times a week i encounter a hacker thats actively killing everyone they see they arent that much of a problem to be honest 910
recommended
sp played through the sp version and it took about 44 hours so just enough bangs for the bucks there are still many side quests and overall completeness is under 70% i cant compare gta v to gta iv as it is impossible to start latter one thanks to the crossregistrations on thrillions of sites however compared to the older ones san andreas etc the game delivers what it promises and its fun to play it gfx is astonishing story is well written and even better scripted i find franklin a bit ignored from mid&late in the game and role assignments a little silly special ability vs role eg driving should be franklin but it is mike notoriously but its ok as the game still gives a lot of entertainment online when i write this review i just tried the online version but i dont think ill add it more than another few hours or so the reason is and im sorry to say that its rubbish probably i was expecting too much but gta online has just 10ish players per surprisingly laggy servers as i read 16 players per server is the maximum the one i autojoined had 810 or something so it cannot be compared to apb or other mmos its just lobbylike something for random people or the opportunity to share a private server with a couple of friends and play together anyways i was expecting more at least 100 players not being visible on map & no name tag above the head so one could melt in as a random citizen a bit better tutorial focusing on telling the player how to play together instead of what so many things one can do experienced already in sp things like that a minimmo so to speak either way buying these shark cards turns out to be completely pointless no cash show off in an mmo environment having the largest house on the tallest hill with your own private g650 & airfield & stuff but pointless purchases of random justunlocked stuff which will never really be seen by anyone rockstar tries to sell stuff to make players buy virtual money for real one new money only vehicles health restoring snacks etc but without content and massplaying i doubt it will be successful eg on a wowlevel it could be with better netcode though oh and i was shot dead a few times by a player driving a tank yes tank around the map hunting for other players what would it be in a 4000 pplserver mmo fun of course but not so much fun for starters of course familiar huh  to sum it up i recommend buying the game even on a virtually high price as the game delivers a lot of fun in sp and huge amount of content thanks to the astonishing amount & quality of work rockstar put into the engine and the game
recommended
this game is awesome except where all those san andreas states go san fierro las venturas from now on this is not a recommandation this is suggestion if there is going to be a dlc or a map mod for singleplayer i think it should get that states back but i still appreciate their work because apparently game is around 60 gbs and if they tried to fit the other states probably well had to buy a whole new ssd or hdd for gta v even a new pc because all that rendering for that huge map couldnt be done in nowadays decent systems but if rockstar makes something to the new gta game that can allow us to travel like gta 1  s playing system to choose between gta ivs liberty city san andreas san andreas vice citys vice city that wll be awesome imagine you are approaching to the airport and going to one of the ticket selling places and saying that you want to travel vice city from san andreas and they giving you the ticket there is a small flight scene taking off and going twords the sea then boom landing of the plane and getting out from the plane to the inside of the airport and now you can do whatever you want in the city but this is impossible because everyday graphics get better better graphics  better game  more storage space  powerful pc better graphics  this feature  10000$ pc if they add all this features to a game that might fall in next 6 years only high end pcs of that year can handle the game and there will be more work involved so the game get delayed 6 years more long story short if thats going to possible i will love to see some feature like that from rockstar but i dont think that is going to possible not because rockstar cant make it because computers might not be able to handle that thanks for reading this long stuff enjoy playing gta v if you havent yet dont worry the days arent making this game old whenever i got bored from singleplayer i go online when i got bored from online im installing mods when im bored from that new mods came up and rockstar prepares an update this game is never going to get you bored by the way please disable your mods before going online those mods are only for singleplayer
recommended
its awesome my pc sucks and it runs like a dream rockstar programming skillz are out there fun factor ultra high
recommended
yeah but horry shet lots of hackers
recommended
this game was very well optimized for pc i get a steam 60 fps with rare dips 1010 would recommend this game to anyone
recommended
rockstar have done an exceptional job here just finished single player will change this review if i run into hackers online
recommended
great game to play with a fully lobby of friends on voice chat gets really boring really fast when playing online alone due to the amount of hackers and idiots out there ruining your heists or jobs by dying in stupid ways or just leaving in the middle of themtho the game does crash for many people due to various reasons single player will always be fun though cant get enough of running from the popo
recommended
step 1 buys game step 2 opens game step 3 signs into rockstar social club step 4 plays prolouge enjoys single player step 5 goes into online bangs a few hookers buys fast cars plays heists step 6 enjoys online step 7 a few months after step 6  hates online because of hackers and because of no money to buy any more hookers step 8 crys because said person realizes how many innocent civilians they killed step 9 goes into singleplayer forgets the fact that said person killed people gets a mod menu bangs 69 hookers turns on invincibility turns on no wanted level gets weapons with explosive ammo shoots peds shoots more peds spawns in dump truck and runs over a lot of cars in dumptruck 42069 would bang again

you can toss money at strippers 1110 would toss money at strippers again
recommended
amazing graphics and game few bugs on release benchmark tool not working fps drops sometimes especially with lots of grass and trees around early days though id hope these minor issues get fixed but so far 910 well worth the wait and effort from rockstar
recommended
super fun and immersive game never gets old and there are contant updates that add new things for free tons of vehicles never ending action weapons and races  so much more the environment is huge and great to explore its even more fun to play with friends online it has freeroam which countless hours can be spent in but if you somehow get bored of that you can play heists with your friends and do other missions bored of that do some races bored of that go parachuting the possiblities are endless and i highly recommend this game to anyone of any age 1010
recommended
i do recommed this game in many ways  giving a bad review on a product just because price went up it was marketeers work to bump the price and lower it on sale  not the programmers  designers  coders etc  it was just bunch of slimy dudes  game is awsome and well optimized it is a gta v a rockstar title thanks rockstar but lower the hell of a price next time  huh 
recommended
i would love to play it but i have a error that no one is dealing with but the time i play it is a ok mayne

in favor a 15 paragraph review of nothing thats not already been said of the game ill give a basic tldr of my experience as someone who didnt play until it came to the pc its grand theft auto 5 so theres not much more to add on that front its the same story same game same everything that you saw or played before just now on pc with better graphics and modding thus it has all the previous positives of the older gta5 excellent story good gameplay all the pros and positives youve heard for years with new hd content a pc community behind it now would i recommend it yes but there are issues i just feel that i cant not recommend it due to the fact i got 400 hours of gameplay from it however 90% of that time for me came from multiplayer as once i finished singleplayer i had no further urge to play the campaign some may dump a huge amount of time in game and then never touch it again like myself or some may find the issues an immediate turn off i dumped a lot of time into the game but havent touched it in months if youre not interested in singleplayer like myself and favor more of the online aspects of video games you may run into more problems than those focused on singleplayer due to the severe hacking problem r could be doing a better job and going about it more effectively taking care of certain aspects of the game in a much better and more efficient way this game has been around since 2013 yet it still seems as if some things still remain unpolished and seem like they will never be they also fall flat on extra content r will add different color textures to existing weapons and vehicles or add one or two things and call it free dlc extra content instead of fixing hacking fixing the underlying issues with heists adding new heists adding more things to do with money you gain ingame and so much else but that doesnt happen you just get a gold textureswap car and thats your extra content thats the basic tldr see below if youre interested in more detail of some of the problems the pc version has story is the same story if youve played it before youre not paying for much aside from upgrading to pc and getting dem better pc master race grafix downsides very much exist and range from plain little nitpicking to outright gamebreaking two biggest problems  whatever your stance on modding the game has some major hacking issues until a separate client is made that runs gta online separate from singleplayer or separate installs of singleplayer and online are made for modders the issue wont go away its so rampant very rarely will you be playing and not have at least 1 hacker in your game they can range from doing something as minor as spitting out unlimited money to large gamebreaking issues or plain griefing ie  modders are able to kill and destroy your car even while youre in passive mode teleporting around the map godmode infinite ammo all guns spawning so much onscreen it hardcrashes the game or will lock up your pc they can completely interrupt your gaming experience by spawning items and fires inside you so you cant move and you die everytime you respawn due to fire damage even in passive you will have your kd ratio ruined and if a certain ratio is required for clans youre gonna have a bad time most of the time youll find yourself reloading lobby after lobby or like many other people forgo public lobbies and stick to private which is sad to see on the bright side r is at least pretty good about reimbursing losses that can be reimbursed and banning offenders if you report them however sometimes hackers arent even near you so you dont even know who to report out of the list of players which can be problematic  heists good concept bad execution some itemsvehicles are only available if you complete the different hesists just trying to get a group to start a heist is beyond a hassle trying to complete one with a pug group is neigh impossible and youre going to spend 30 minutes waiting for a lobby to fill up only to have people leave or once it starts at least one person not cooperate or listen die within a minute fail the heist and youll revert back to waiting in a lobby for another 30 minutes just to repeat the outcome its so bad theres a subreddit for people looking to find players to form a heist group with someone could write an essay on how heists need fixed in essence risk vs reward does not balance out nor does cash per hour there just isnt enough of a reward for people who already complete them once and recieve the inital cash reward and their vehicles to keep playing them grinding missions solo on hard will net you more money much faster and it also means you only have to rely on yourself and dont have to deal with little kids trolls idiots langauge barriers people who dont know what theyre doing and wont listen etc etc more hesists need added and more incentive to do them needs added before people stop having to wait forever just to get a full lobby to start one
recommended
this game is quite good however the game runs poorly i ran this on my 50 gb ram computer and it lagged as hell this ruened my experience and i run the game on my 4 gb ram computer and it ran fine this is one confusing game but im not into computer capabilities and i appreciate the beauty of gta v
recommended
glad rockstar took their time porting it
recommended
grand theft auto v is banging  if you enjoyed all other gta stories  your not going to be dissapointed the gta online feature is the best thing aabout it 
recommended
i remember it saying that i would get a extra 350k for preordering gta before march 31 didnt happed  but i still got the 1 mil for online and 500k or the story mode i have a decent computer  not a monster but a good one  and it runs very smooth on my settings it look beautiful btw there are also bugs like when you rob a grocery store and the door wont open leaving you stranded in there also when i am driving close to a bridge i see a giant grey triangle right inside of it which confuses me because i can see everythibg around it quite nicely but its just that damn bridge what would i rate it  based on day one errors  that have been fixed within 24 hours  and bugs and minor glitches a solid 8 this is a must buy if you have not played the consloe versions or if you have some extra cash to throw around notice gta online works now fyi just incase you dont know or if you heard it is broken
recommended

this game is great the game was amazing for x360ps3then it moved to the next gen consoles whoch only improved it more by adding first person and little gameplay changes now its out for pc and the game is outstanding the gameplay controls well with a keyboard and mouse but if you dont like keyboard and mouse this offers full controller support the game is improved massively just by adding better graphics and 60 fps this version also has everything the x360ps3xboneps4 had and more you also get bonuses if you are coming back from the console versions this game has been so improved i cant cover everything list pros 1 keyboard and mouse feels fluid 2 full controller support 3 graphics are nice 4 community is much better 5 gameplay is improved cons 1 needs optimisation 2 lags for no reason at points ie in garage in online and in the desert 3 you need at least 15 gigs of video memory to make the game look normal 4 you need 34 gigs of memory to make the game look as nice as possible 5 you need a great computer to run this so 910

if you like mmos and destruction this is for you play in a group or play on your own its all good

recommended
great game freaking excellent i love playing this game i enjoy the engine the graphics the map online heck even the ai its a beautiful and well made game i love playing it at least for the 15 minutes before it crashes and has to be restarted it pisses me off so much i spent around $50 on this game come on rockstar for real just like when i bought gta iv
recommended
this game is good its not good if you a cant run it b it crashes on startup c you are some wimp who cant handle simulated crime and probably are a jehovahs witness but if you dont fit in these three catigories you have a giant game with tons of quests and things to do 1010
recommended
all the reviews i read said that everyone on gta online is hackers that take your money and repeatedly killed you they must have only played in one lobby cause i havent ran into any hackers and actually they were very nice helping me because i have never played a gta on pc before they gave me controls and even helped me master helicopter piloting on a keyboard and mouse i definetly recommend this game to anyone

i like it but i dont play it to often you get bored 610

this game is more like two in one the first game is the single player and the second is the multiplayer the first is probably the best game of whatever year that it came out you have to but it for just that alone also this guy says the n word in it loads which just make the game the multiplayer is a pisstake you want to get a house well get ready to do loads of  boring hiests that are impossible to do if you have none of your friends playing it once you have loads of money like me dont ask how i got it there is no longer any point to playing the game apart from if there is a dlc get this game for the single player guys are nobs in the multiplayer
recommended
the one game to prove that scotland isnt useless
recommended
i have a lower end laptop and this game still runs well and looks good even with most of the options disabled its very well optimized and grand theft auto online is a ton of fun
recommended
it is a very good game
recommended
despite only having minmum system requirements i still get decent graphics and performance completed main story without any crashes rockstar really have put good effort into making this work for pc its only the draw distance that trees in mountains if i look further back can see them pop up but its not as if things just spring out in front of me id love to see this in 2160 x 3840 resolution @ 60 frames per second maybe sometime in the future when i have a new computer i dont see point in buying the shark cards though

gta v pc is the ultimate version of one of the greatest games in history and the best openworld game that you will play until the advent of gta vi or rdr 2
recommended
changing the game price was a  move however this doesnt mean the game is bad still very enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone
recommended
its gta v for pc get it if you think youll like it cause you will unless youre a peace activist hipster

recommended
1010 i love this is game i totally would recommend getting this game i have this game on other consoles and its my favorite game
recommended
heres a list of things that really bother me such as clunky flying controls combat isnt very smooth tons of loading screens private sessions with friends are difficult to maintain the cost of purchasing mods for your vehicles are very weird incremental costs to lower your car doesnt work that way you buy springs and adjustable coilovers one timeand thats ittheres other issues but thatll do for now on the whole its a fun game but all of the issues this game has freakin saints row games havent had my message to r is to learn from what volition didand just copy them ironic since volition copied r game idea

everything is good good game  good graphics  good story  good choices  good gameplay  the story left me thinking and smiling this game brought me enjoyment that i havent felt in a long time if youre thinking of buying this game then buy it its worth it
recommended
its a good game but right now i cant play the game because of a bug the exits and social club say gta 5 exited unexpectedly sadly it seems the comunity are doing more than rockstar to fix it so if you want the game id wait a bit because you might be affected by this bugnot every one is affected my friend can play it
recommended
very fun but even on amazing computers it can still have low fps 99910
recommended
alright no wisecracks in this one straight to the down and dirty review so this is one of the best games ive ever played this is the only game ive owned across 3 different platforms the 360 ps4 and now the pc the pc despite all its issues believe me the issues are disgusting is the best version r really did a good job with the port it isnt gta iv 2015 yes there are many issues plauging the pc version such as hackers in gta online the texture popins self radio which causes most of the popins cpu going haywire on that get it fixed etc however through future patches mods and general improvements to the game as time goes on this game will run a lot better than it does now in its current state i give this a 810 you guys will have lots of fun with this game hours will be wasted in joy and occasional irritation hopefully r will fix the radio issues in a future update and with that the texture popins easily recommend to those who have the specs to run it i still run this with a gtx 960 an i5 4460 and 4gb of ram little stutter after a few tweaks good job r
recommended
gta v is a game for everyone except kids this game has it all from an amazing campaign to the addicting gta online youll play this game for a long time
recommended
goodbye social life hello social club
recommended
nice
recommended
my specs are pretty bad so i have to run it on low settings but i still really enjoy it 1110 gg rockstar
recommended
good game but too many hackers
recommended
open world adventure awaits but not for the faint at heart patience is key but if you have it crime does indeed pay while buggy at times sometimes unplayably so the times the game does work as intended makes up for it hours upon hours of guaranteed fun for the whole family or at least the adults in the family content is definitely not for kids and neither is online chat some advice find a crew or at least play with friends literally 90% of this games playerbase has no idea what theyre doing and grouping with pugs has about the same chance of failure again patience is key also karumas are for nubs
recommended
this game is amazing high quality entertainment 9510
recommended
i had two strippers give me a lap dance for half an hour then their models turned invisible and my player character sat in his pimp throne contemplating life until the lap dance time expired and the strippers models reappeared
recommended
kicking cats confirmed 1110 on a serious note this game is fantastic already sunk 180 hours into it as of may 1st and there are many more to come its a game that lets you do virtually anything sure you can rob banks and do odd jobs or race but personally i like to go mountain biking up mount chilliad with friends buy some beers at the liquor stores and drink out in the desert then get into fights with rednecks or just grab a bmx bike from my garage and hit the halfpipe outside of my apartment the possibilities are endless if you have not yet gotten this game i really dont know what youre waiting on everything is better on the master race
recommended
you probably dont need this review for the game with metascore 97100 one of few games im proud to have on release date for the full price  good story  3way perspective on everything 3 main heros  lots of humor  awesome soundtrack  atmospheric  huge load of activities  nice looking graphics  good optimization  best russian voicing you can find russian guy as travor  bad launch week with all kinds of problems  bugs like missing objects after cutscene  gpuhdd demanding  online mode is too chaotic bottom line get it if u have enough money and your pc can handle it
recommended
gtav is a game which involves reddit users bang wagoning and making good use of the steam review function for anyone who is wondering this is what people have been complaining about getting banned for using mods online people online using mods and cheating increased the price of the game right before the summer sale except for thats a lie because they didnt increase the price the base game just never went on sale 1110 would look for excuses to complain about everything and anything again
recommended
gta v on pc is the uncompromising version of the game worth the wait in my opinion currently running on i73770k  gtx970 running 60fps  on pretty much everything high 2x mxaa  nvidia txaa does support 144hz unpacking took longer than downloading the game itself will unpack again 300mbps down  20 up dont waste your time on consoles heres the real version of the game thanks for beta testing console users your move console
recommended
this is a really good game ive not experience any bugs whatsoever
recommended
great game for 100s of hour of fun def recommended might be goty if they fix some of the issues with the online client people seem to give this game bad reviews because of mod support but i dont care about mods they where never promised either so i dont feel like im missing anything so heres a positive review to counter that p well it wont but one can try right 
recommended
i stole a car in san andreas i stole a bike 1110 would upgrade again

finally got 100 hours in to review this so basically this is an epic game im running it on something close to a potato and while i use half vsync 30fps it looks so pretty i prefer gtao instead of story mode since grinding and stuff but try to play as fair as possible i went on a shooting rage with my friend about a week ago and got placed in a lobby with hackers so apparently hackers get their own lobbies as well instead of just being banned long story short great game buy it when r finally figures out how a steam sale works
recommended
why did i switch to the pc i guess it was the mods or the ah i dont know that thing you know that thing freedom you see it in even windows i wanted to get away from closed platforms yknow those those walled gardens be free for once a pc gamer so i built a nice rig installed steam bought a few games and thought id be a streamer like all the other streamers and my friends theyd be like the friends in these streams wed game together install mods but well you know how it is in all seriousness i highly recommend this game mods or not theres a lot of misinformation regarding mods going around but honestly this game doesnt really need mods to be good unlike this other popular game coughskyrimcough im having a lot of fun as it is with the stock game game looks and runs beautifully has some pretty solid keyboard  mouse controls with no forced mouse acceleration and perhaps some of the most wellacted dialogue in a video game ive played los santos feels much more alive than it did before and really this is the definitive edition of the game

currently at 60% of completion and am loving this game just so you know im playing this on a  intelamd laptop from 2011 and the game is running on normal with 30 fps very good optimization had a lot of fun just roaming around the city of los santos and killing pedestrians this game made my time fly by pros big open world with a lot of places to visit nice graphics great storyline a lot of side missions to take part in love the new ammunation and los santos customs the new heists online are killing it cons sometimes boring in sp rarely happens but it does happen multiplayer is nothing special imo has a bit of bugs that need to be solved graphics related software related conclusion overall a really great game and a thumbs up to you rockstar for finally releasing it i mainly bought the game to play the singleplayer campaign but its fun to play with friends online aswell so is it worth 60 current price definitely
recommended
online is so much more interesting and has more replayability for me than story mode well done rockstar you made a gta where i have not even finished the story yet because since i began playing online i cant stop

when it comes to open world this is definitely the best game i have played in my life so far and ive been around since the c64 was the latest fashion the reason for this overwhelmingly positive ingame experience is the amazing degree of detail in both the landscape and the people living in the los santos area the landscape it feels totally natural organic and vivid back in 2004 i lived and worked in los angeles now when i drive around los santos i keep having flashback moments of my time in the states i recognize signature landmarks streets even shops as with the original city of angels the landscape in gta v transforms smoothly from rich to poor neighbourhood from high rise downtown to hollyvinewood hills and from oil pumps to santa monica pier amazing the people the way the people interact with you as a player and with themselves is very convincing and sets a new standard for todays computergames not only do they dodge and run but they also have quite interesting conversations going on when calling someone on the phone they even react to you stalking them the increase their speed up until the start running from you loved that the missions and details as with all the gta games the mission design is nearly perfekt this time around imho even better than with the predecessors missions are very entertaining not too hard and not too easy best of all they really make an effort to tell a story be it the careful planing of your first heist or the introduction of the main characters and their personalities the way the story within missions is being told reminds me of highclass tv series like breaking bad house of cards or boardwalk empire the handling of vehicles i love the way the game plays with a controler you can really feel the diffence between the various types of vehicles you are driving or flying only for action sequences where you have to shoot stuff i tend to switch to mouse and keyboard just because im way better with aiming than with the controller but that probably comes from me being a pc gamer nearly all my life all in all great aaa game great value for your money get it you wont regret it

gta v  singleplayer review first draft version 1 clocking out at 102 hours at the time of writing and this without any gta online counted as i have not yet started online even once introduction to be fair grand theft auto neednt a big introduction to most people as it is a huge and ifluential title but nontheless i shall give it a quick rundown so what is grand theft auto v well some people say its a sandbox some call it a quasiactionrpg some just stick with third person shooter and non is really wrong either it takes elements from most genres and bangs them together to make them work and they really do its a game that gives the player immense freedom you can either go full psycho and kill everything that moves steal cars kill animals and so on or you can go play golf this is just an example but the stark contrast is there and this is the thing that makes gta one of the most successful franchises of all time the freedom of doing whatever the hell you please is a satisfying thing indeed story spoiler free in this game youre introduced to three protagonists a hood gangster a retired bank robber and well frankly a psychopath in a series of events these three become connected and their three seperate stories become entwined into one in one of the most interesting ways i personally have ever experienced in a video game at first i was not very impressed in fact but that might be because you start off as humble as this game gets a gangster this alone is not a problem but i was generally put off by the fact that what felt was every third word was a and yes i am aware that this games plays on stereotypes and that in fact it is very common but it still felt silly after 5 minutes get past the small things however and youll find a rich and fleshed out story set in a great setting with immaculate attention to detail misc as i mentioned in the introduction there is for example golf to play well thats not all theres all kinds of side activities ranging from street racing to tennis from hitting money transports to getting attention in gentlemen clubs its a universe filled with things for you to do things to occupy you and this is one of grand theft auto vs greatest features pros  great combat  immersive gameplay  a ludicrous amount of features  extreme attention to detail  fleshed out story  fun side activites  its able to mix humor and seriousness in a way only rockstar can do  great music  superb customization for both vehicles and characters  impressive graphics  near perfect voiceacting on almost all characters including pedestrians and random ai cons  some dialog feels a bit forced  i personally encountered bugs when tabbing out of the game crashing it but this might be due to other issues  during my 102 hours of gameplay my game crashed thrice this is not as much as of a con as a general fyi info  flying controls suck really bad  if a cutscene is accidentally skipped i found no other way than to kill myself to cancel the mission and then restart it from the beginning as you can tell most of these are really just nitpicking the only real problem i had with this game was the flying controls flying helicopters was just the most infuriating thing i did in this summary its bloody brilliant definately in the top ten best games of all time when i finished the story at 83 hours in i couldnt stop myself from keep playing yet i found another 20 hours before i felt i could say that i am done with the singleplayer and i have not even completed it to 100% yet so do i recommend it maybe a tiny little bit maybe a tiny tiny little bit buy it if you like good games im done here
recommended
what is there to say im sure everyone knows what this game could offer well im here just to say that it delivers playing this on highvery high on my notebook with gtx765m fluently i was pleasantly surprised by the well done optimization its an amazing game amazing story amazing wild ride it takes you on

needs work but its still a fun game i have to say yes i recommend it because there is a lot of good to this game but it currently has some problems that range from annoying to serious the game crashes infrequently and randomly not often not at the same screen not with the same error nothing traceable it will just randomly crash once in a while that sucks donkey  the racing might as well be called grand leveling grinder ffs rockstar the cheaters are ruining it for the legitimate modders i will spare the details here if you are interested theres tons to google get ready for loading screen online seriously if you like watching a circle spin while voice chatting with friends this is the game for you to get to a friends only online session you must start the game in story mode first really you make 520k on average for completing missions it costs $30k to put neons on your car and the crew paint job forget it a ing knit mask costs 4 digits fix the mother ing economy rockstar on this topic want a spoiler for your car sure want to change it for another go for it want to change back you get to buy it again wtf good luck with stock market heh overall though the game is good

a sequel to sleeping dogs a heartwarming story of a troubled boy whos father forces him to put the dogs to sleep at a local puppy mill to help bring money for their poor family this game takes a much brighter turn as you rob banks kill innocents in the city steal everything break everything and raise mayhem if being a psycopath on your own as three different people in singleplayer isnt enough you can go to online raise a crew up then all go to the  bar together then murder all the strippers with a hatchet to cleanse them of their unholiness 42069 no more putting down puppies best psycopathic tendencies simulator 2013 wait 2015

what a game while the multiplayer can get rather stale quickly the story is brilliant however i would love to see larger expansion like dlc personally i dont mind paying 1999 to even 2999 for something that could bring 1020 new vehicles new part of the world las venturas please little more story unfortunetally r will rather choose to go with new overall releases compared to what blizzard e does with expansion for its games worth a buy however only when its on discount 810

gta v on the pc >just as long loading times as the xbox 360 1010

as every single review ive seen has resulted in either not recommending this game because of the rise in price during the summer sale or the hackers in gta online i felt a short but proper review of the game itself was needed pros fantastic storyline including characters setting etc great graphical optimisation fun online play depending on what you do one of the best if not the best open world video games cons bearing in mind this only depends on what you do ingame gta online is riddled with hackerscheaters during free mode if you play in a public session however it is easy just to find a new session or go into a solo session  gta online gta$ is obtained mainly through a grindy job system which is based off of the time you spend in the job rather than what the jobs objectives are even then the money output of the jobs isnt large enough for people not willing to spend hours upon hours grinding out the jobs overall the game is fantastic both single player and multiplayer especially if you have friends to play with 1010

truly one of the greatest games i own great on multiplayer with friends just as wonderful in singleplayer loads of cars to drive civilians to shoot and houses to own singleplayers storyline is classic and properly done just as the voice acting good for hours of fun 1010

probably the best game i have ever played and the best optimized well if you havent played any gta then heres what to expect in the game based off of my own experiences goes onlune switches to first person mode spawns on a sidewalk a player drives by and shoots me to death i respawn takes out axe he happens to be running on foot to a vehicle i murder him with this axe i turn around to return to my dump truck that i spawned ealier another player drives by in a van he gets out starts humping me i start humping him a massive plane mashes into us and everything explodes we respawned and had a pointing contest heres another story while setting up a heist spiky and i decided to take a ride in a cargobob a massive military plane we set out on our epic journey i had no idea how to tilt the plane therefore it was slowly tilting to the left the view was beautiful all was fine until we seen a mountain it was a late sight and we could feel the wing  itself agaisnt the mountain top each engine on the left side of the plane was ded not big surprise spiky and i were panicking fearing we were going to die in a fatal crash i noticed that the ocean was about a mile away so i tried to keep this sideways plane in the air were not going to make it spiky screams yes we are prepare your  i state the plane glides into the ocean and sinks to the ocean floor quickly i escaped the wreakage all in first person view and swam to the roof of the ocean i looked back to see my friend run out of oxygen and die i swam to land spiky respawned then we blew each other up the end 9000010 would hump again 9000010 would survive a fatal plane crash again in first person view cons you havent purchased this perfect game yet pootis heavy do i recomend this game  yes if you dont own this game then  you

singleplayer 1010 multiplayer  410 worth $60  no if its on sale for around 30 yeah lots of content and tons of things to do on multiplayer missionsaround 10 different styles events heists team missions that require teamwork setup missions and a big a$$ reward for the finale overall fun but most of the online community are scumbags which made me quit playing pretty fast a lot like most openworld pvp style games good game but a terrible community that ruins it its gta5 so obviously the single player is great action tons of fun amazing story but not much replayability everything you would expect from the newest gta basically

first let me just start off saying how long the wait was it was long in my eyes the wait was totally worth it note this review is primarily for the online portion of the game connection to start off i dont have the best connection literally 15kbs and i cannot change that [i also have satellite internet {800ms ping} which is garbage for gaming but good for downloading so thats how i downloaded the game] originally i thought i was only going to be able to play the game in story mode luckily for me i can play in private online sessions with a few friends 13 with a bit of lag which makes me happy my connection does stutter a lot while im driving around at high speeds downtown but thats because of all the npcs that reside there in simples races with my friends theres no problem with lag one of my favorite things to do in the game is to fly over los santos in my stunt plane and i can do that with my friends without lag as well which is wonderful the game renders the world differently in the air which somehow helps me not lag in air overall connection doesnt matter too much id say with speeds over 100kbs youd be perfectly fine hopefully rockstar will fix some vehicle latency issues in the future as my friends with great connection still get a bit of lag here and there graphics the graphics are truly amazing if you have a machine that can max the settings out youll be amazed i have to say that rockstar really did a great job on the textures the water looks great the civilians have pretty good textures and world reflections look great at times there are minor graphical bugs flickering of some grass textures that type of thing but they arent too prominent im really impressed with how the game looks gameplay nothing all that new has been added to the pc version of the game in terms of missions or locations the keyboard controls are pretty easy to get used to which is good there is a bit of mousesmoothing that you cant turn off though performance i find this to be one of the most important aspects of the game the framerate its a huge upgrade from gta iv on pc a decent machine can run gta v on midhigh settings around 60fps where with gta iv it was about 30fps i want start of saying that at the time of first downloading the game i got a lot of framerate stutter id be at 70fps one moment and in the same location it would go down to around 15fps and jump straight back up to 70fps my original solution to this problem was just to restart my pc whenever i wanted to relaunch the game and that worked but recently rockstar rolled out a patch that seemed to eliminate the frame stutter problem which is wonderful i can run gta v on close to max settings with grass quality being the only setting turned to normal my framerate sits at around 4570fps at high speeds through downtown los santos i hit my lowest framerate being 45fps in lower populated areas with less to render i can go high speeds with around 70fps my average framerate is around 5560fps cpu fx 6300 oc @ 38ghz gpu r9 290x [stock] i do feel there is a little room for improving on framerate so hopefully rockstar will release patches that include a bit of optimization overall the game in its current state looks amazing runs decently and has decent connection functionality there are minor issues with the game but i feel they can be improved upon as rockstar rolls out game patches as having over 125 hours in game at the time of writing this review i think im in a good place to say this game was completely worth the wait cpu fx 6300 oc @ 38ghz gpu r9 290x [stock] 4302015

boohoohoo i suffer from severe autism and am unable to read the warnings on mods before installing them maybe if my crippling dyslexia allowed me to read i would know that rockstars stance on modding gta v was unknown until recently and as such it would have been best to exercise caution before playing gta online with my mods installed its much too difficult to uninstall my mods before playing online and rockstar should accommodate my laziness as if gta online isnt already enough of a toxic cesspool i should be allowed to use my trainer in the presence of up to 29 other people to further ruin their fun instead of taking responsibility for my actions i will continue to be mildly irate at rockstar and will proclaim that i was banned for nothing or for only having an fov mod installed even though it is almost guaranteed i was using a trainer online even if i was only using an fov mod my idiocy and lack of foresight mean i am very upset at rockstar for doing something they said not to do ps did you know rockstars eula is invalid its true and that means my actions are aokay i mean theyre breaking eu law for hecks sake they should go to super prison give me back my $60 gentle suck on my scrotum and write a personalised apology letter to each and every person as stupid as me edit i told you

great game but the damage model for vehicles is a huge step back compared to gta iv every car is a tank now as it can take so much damage further more it is now impossible to deform a cars roof or its doors this is a huge malus for me as i loved finding creative ways to demolish my car in gta iv

i like how rockstar actually hands out bans of course people will go i swear i didnt do anything well maybe i cheated a little bit but not much hilarious gtao is great fun a dozen times so if you get some friends to play with you now im looking forward to more heist dlc
recommended
its gta a very good version lots of down votes because of the mod support but if you dont care and only wanna have fun with friends on the online part of the game then this one is it single player is short and can be done quick but online is where the fun is at would be nice when we can finaly use mods on single player but this shouldnt make you not want to buy the game tldr im sure you know what gta is the online part of this game is so much fun
recommended
just absolutely fantastic i was hesitant about buying this game since almost everything i read about it was positive if you have a decent machine and 60 gigs of free space on it i highly recommend it the story is top notch and very long i have played about 30 hours and am now just touching the tip of the story iceberg doing heists and missions with friends online is an insane amount of fun

unfortunate for the people who do mod but besides the fov needing to be changed i see no reason for mods anyway i like the game for what it is and will play it for a long time optimized very well also coming from playing it on ps3 it looks beautiful runs like a dream mostly in the 70s in fps with almost everything on max distance scaling turned half no hd shadows no msaa no reflection msaa and grass on high even exceding my 2gb vram limit by almost 700mb it still runs great i7 2600k 47 ghz gtx 770 2gb windforce manual oc 16gb installed on wd black first edition of hdd wahh wahh wahh if they are banning people for modding then dont mod till they allow it how hard is that to understand
recommended
this game requires a quad core of 24ghz or higher it can use up to 3gb of ram dont buy this game unless you meet the required specs i have many friends who have bought it and they cant run itoverloading their video cards which did result to sparking the capacitors on them please pay attention to the video ram usage up at the top when your in the graphics menu for any sli or crossfire users gta wont detect that your using sli or crossfire so make sure that they are linked up first through their control panels then turn the safety off in gta up at the topsuggested limits i have to gtx 550 tis in sli i can run everything on very high but it seems to me that the gta video ram specs are off it always says that im using 35gb of it when i only have 2 but everything else is great about this game i would recommend it to anyone

really nice and addicitve game though would appreicate if rockstar patched the models of the dudes at 720p the only drawback however is the price man 79$ for a game you gotta change that rockstar

nothing neggative its just a really good game it is hard to find anything wrong with it the bad commenters are confused with the gamedlcgreat white shark card bundle that came out wich is about $80 this is one of the bast games i have ever played the graphics look like reality the map is huge you can play with your friends in online mode there are tons of missions online and story mode and all types of cars this is a game that is worth every dollar

amazing gaming and play flawless with no lag on my pc i have this game also on xbox one and for pc the xbox just does not compare
recommended
seriously there is no need to review this game even though ive had the game on ps3 for a year and half before the pc launch id still say the wait was worth it too much fun and the game looks a billion times better than any console
recommended
one of the best free roaming game out there in the market right now with great replayability thanks to gta online highly reccommended if you just want to have a great time
recommended
its an awesome game and its worth to get it it is totally different from the past gtas

probably the best game played so far the ability to play offline and online with such a small difference in between different platforms just makes the game even more sick and desireable cant stop playing wont stop playing

if youve ever played a gta game you can pretty much expect the same stuff you did in prior games just with more things added in gta v online is pretty good if you play with friends i highly advise to not play with randoms during heists or anything else online there are two things that absolutely drive me to madness in this game the ing piece of  menus and how  the wanted system is in the game like i said before its gta if youve played other gta games before you really arent missing out on anything totally groundbreaking

recommended
well i havent play a lot but i can say there are a lot of hackers like a lot and rockstar is not doing anything about it is a problem cuz is annoying this people making mest in the server and making it run slow is also quite disturbing for me the prices of ingamen content i mean the cool stuff appartments high end cars guns customization is really expensive and is going to take u a lot of time to get those thing but your going to be playing in the same server with other players that already have all that so is very unvalanced but in the end i love the game single player and online both are great i recomend it cuz all this problems are fixeble
recommended
this is the best and most realistic loading simulator i have ever played

benchmark for pc gaming  2015 although it still could use serious improvement in modding support and user input control aspects ie customizingadding analog controls no trackir support ect

one of the best games i have ever played and it is optimized to perfection on the pc i am playing on an older generation processor but it handles the game insanely well i refresh my monitor at 75hz and i can run ultra settings at 1080p and maintain constant 75 fps with vsync on it seriously is amazing and on a completely different level than playing it on my ps4 it really doesnt compare and with the mods that come out you will never get bored of this game great 60 dollars spent just dont pay for those microtransactions on gta online the only thing i hate is the loading times i had it installed on my ssd but didnt really feel like it was that fast now i put it back on my regular hdd and its still about the same speed just really slow loading times only con this game has but its hard to fault given how well optimized it is and how huge it is specs i5  2500k 16 gb 970 msi gaming 4g

gta v is a game i played on both xbox 360 and on pc the pc version is so far ahead of the lastgen version its mindblowing considering how gta v on xbox 360 was absolutly pushing the systems capabilities to its max this is a generation defining game and a definite must play for anyone who enjoys any sort of fun this is one of the most graphically pleasing games i have ever played even on medium graphics the story can be a bit cliche at times and is definetly not a bioshock infinite but certainly contains compatant storytelling by rockstae and has a satisfying ending and alot of hilarious moments the gameplay is just dumb fun its hard to explain in words you just have to exeperiance the fun of racing through los santos in your pimped out zentorno at 100mph while drunk high and with cops on your tail beacause you just murdered a npc that cut you off on the freeway audio wise we are lucky that the rockstar dev team completly redid the radio with alot of newer hits and a selfradio function to put your music in the game gta does also have its problems with the main one honestly being the time spent on loading screens i have immensly enjoyed this game and it was certainly worth the wait for the game to grace us with its presense on pc just look at my hours at the time of writing this review i am at about 914 hours and i have enjoyed every minute of it including the 10 of those hours i spent on loading screens this is a truly masterful display by rockstar that dosnt leave you much to complain about you will definetly get your moneys worth on this purchase to sum it all up so i can go back to playing gta is that its an amazing game that you will sink amazing amounts of your life into final verdict 9110

the game is worth every penny spent visuals are amazing gameplay is spectacular  to the people moaning about being banned for mods and thinking you are entitled to not be banned just because you paid 40 are idiots you agreed to the terms so dont break them and whine because you broke them but paid for it so you should be entitled to do whatever you want even if it means runing the game for others  yeah i get the mods are cool and awesome making the game fun but currently their is no way of preventing them from being used online so players can enter the online mode and ruin the game for others  yeah sure im with you guy about their being no mods is pretty pathetic but their trying to stop the game from getting ruined for us  r just make it so mods only work in single player and everyones happy

i have played this game for a least a 1000 hours on the xbox 360 so i really know the ups and downs to this game lets start with single player single player  rich story amazing character development ton of easter eggs plenty side missions and activities its iffy on the modding and i side with rockstar on this one because it is so easy to get the mods to online i have already seen my fair share of whales flying around in the online portion but hopefully rockstar will change that online  now all i can really tell you is that online is the best part i cant really review it because you make what you make online where as the single player portion you have to follow a story but i will give tips since i have played the online portion for a god awful amount of time 1 make friends not enemies i know you want to shoot every player on the street but if you mess with the wrong person who has a good understanding of the game then they will give you hell and youll get that bad taste of defeat 2 use your money wisely you will lose your money faster then you make it like i said with the first tip make friends then get a heist started and make money dont blow your money on the most expensive car because believe me the best cars in the game are some of the cheapest 3 get into a crew this way you can have the backup of all your friends and crew mates and destroy anyone who messes with you or you could do the funniest thing you and your friends can crew can think of thats basically what i do every time i am hanging with them whether its riding motor bikes in a motor bike gang fashion or picking players up with the cargo bob helicopter and flying around los santos the game is yours to do whatever you want money and friends are really everything in this game so get them both and mold your character to your linking this game is amazing on both the online and single player portions so enjoy it the way you want to enjoy it

the game is so nice but apparently rockstar being so careless after releasing the game and they lost the big community just not like the same day when the game released when was like 450k players online and within a month with no updates and improves they lost this big number of players all the way to 50k  60k  so dear rockstar please fix improve etc and make the game even more better

this game got it all  dogs having the sweet tenderly love  you can bang s in online mode while your mate takes pictures of it  slap hatsglasses of innocent pedestrians and beach bums  travel 1 mile in 20 seconds with the zentorno  insure your car  the story mode main story actually got a good story and it is captivating  make your own crew so people know who they are ing with  gather your mates in your highend apartment and take some hits from the bong  check my screenshots for more awesome stuff  trevor enough said  radio channels are sooo full of  which is expected and a good thing good songs too kendrick lamar rihanna britney spears johnny cash etc cons  infinite loading screen in and out of online mode getting into jobs missions the game is 40% loading screen but once youre in and comfy you wont see another loading screen for hours so thats really a pro and not a con  no animals in online mode perhap for sparing the poor creatures the pain that would come to them  ehh weapon stats they all have different namesshapes but pretty much deals the same damage duuh except for rocket launchers and snipers ofc a great game this beats every single gta in the past by far if you liked any of the gta games or disliked any of them try this chances are you will love this

wierd messed up optomisation my rig runs it at high settings 50 fps but i have an i74880k gtx 7704gb and 16 gigs 1866 ddr3 ram my friend over here runs the game at 70 fps ultra settings and he has an i54690 gtx 970 and 16gb 1600 ram where in most games we get about the same framerate or similar on the same settings but here on gta 5 there is a massive difference it makes me almost want to give the game a thumbs down because i was really looking forward to the awesome 60 fps and great graphics edit i beat the game and found some stuff so now to make a proper review graphics are good but i wouldnt say they are spectacular easy to run on a lower end rig on lower settings hard to run even on a beast rig on max settings includes msaa up to x8 story plenty of it and is pretty long you definatly get your moneys worth on the sp alone mp does not really work for me i can get into a sevrer fine but the minute i come within viweing range of another player it sais that everyone left the server off to the side leaving me on an empty server even when the mp does ever work i fin it very boring there are missions sure but they are pretty much copy and pasted into different areas of the map and as for the heists they are kinda fun but once you beat them its not worth replaying i give an 810 multiplayer kind of ruined some of the experience but the sp was amazing and after some tweaking i got the game to run on my rig pretty well at ultra just dropped vsync and msaa in general and i get 70 fps in the city and 40 fps in the country i will add more to this review if anything comes to mind
recommended
its been an absolute blast from the start to the finish and even when you beat the game there is so much to do and the online is damn fine aswell  just love the game only thing is maybe the last heist is so easy it felt a bit cheap paleto bay score was grand

we have all seen these reviews of cheaters saying they were using mods on singleplayer and got banned they were lying they used the mods on singelplayer and multiplayer and tried to cover their sses the only way that they could be telling the truth is if they truly think they were they probably used mods on singleplayer and didnt take them out when they went online they were cheating even if they didnt know it rockstars anti cheat detects these mods and bans the cheaters it was not rockstars fault people were being banned it was theres all these downvotes on steam ruining the reputation are just because people were dumb and had mods on when they went to online its there own fault they were banned rockstar has stated you will not get banned for singleplayer modding but if you have mods online you will rockstar has done nothing to wrong the community those who made bad reviews and understand they were wrong please delete the reviews aaaaaaandddd my review of the game driving 910 shooting 810 story 9610 flying most players dont like it and would probably give it like a 3510 personally i use the mouse flying and love it id give it a solid 9510 character customization online 610 not a fan of the hairs and all females look terrible singleplayer 510 little to nothing you can do to your character is it replayable for sure i give replayability a 1010 and here are some random questions you might be asking what is your least favorite thing the invite system is bad so getting randoms for a heist is hard i suggest just making a small group of friends to heist with aaaaaand i also dislike how most randoms you get dont listen when you talk to them and ignore everyone your opinion on heist cuts 40202020 worth buying a second time for pc yesssss you get great things like the dodo and kraken and you can show off your hatchet in melee fights b dont forget the great modding already some awesome mods ive seen favorite thing in the game heists i just did the prison heist for a second time a few minutes ago i loved that feeling of finishing it with my friends and we all had a great time okk now time for the total 57170

i had this for ps3 but the pc version is like playing a whole new game it was so well done and very minimum bugs during launch that have already been patched up well for now for me runs smooth as butter on my mid range pc with ultra graphics 1110 would buy game again and again
recommended
they say they had over a year to  optimise  this game for pc it looks more to a direct port to me and what is with this drm  if i launch the game i want to launch the game not 4 subprocesses that hook into some   social club front end framework anyway i wonder why after some weeks this it out it still suffers from major issues like the memory leak i have 16 gb of ddr4 but when playing this game windows starts to act up and wanting to kill the processes cause of the huge leak if i knew of this beforehand i would not have spend money on this if i knew some nodvd crack to bypass the bs launchers i would definitly use it
recommended
awesome game and even better in first person

an obviously welldeserved 10 out of 10 ive played this game alot on the xbox 360 back in 2013 i loved how endless the game was how gta online would give me the strongest urge to work hard for goodlooking sports cars as a rather dedicated pc gamer i chose to wait for the pc version id have my expectaions heighten as each delay was announced im very very glad to say that this port perfectly lives up to my expectations a fine beautiful revisit to los santos its 100% certain that rockstar made perfect use of their extra time i can run this on 60 fps constantly on very high graphical settings despite the major graphical improvements and the support for rather highend resolutions this game can pretty much run on a wide variety of decent pc machines in shorter terms grand theft auto v on pc is ing optimized the rockstar editor also steps up as the ports new star feature giving players the opportunity to express their creativity and share their experiences at launch i experienced some crashes mostly being driver crashes but all that disappeared after a simple restart what really bothers me though are the rather inevitable gta online connectivity issues but a couple retries if not restarts of the game let me connect to servers with no problem this wont affect my view on gta online though for i was always sure itd happen again gta online has a wide wide range of activities to participate in with friends too 100% optimized 100% fun 100% worth it lets all wait for the mods
recommended
love it fun to play with freinds and just do what ever you want

two black guys say n a third one says it intermittently well optimized fun first person lots of options can run over hookers and take your money back from them

ive played this game for 100s of hours on ps3 the p stands for peasant and still am coming back for more i have been awaiting this day for a while even though i have been occupied with lots of other great games if you havent played gta v yet then you really should give it a shot if you are a person who enjoys any video games at all and since this is a steam review you are reading then you probably do enjoy some games so far my first impressions on the pc are amazing i wont bore you with every tiny detail of my pc specs but with 32 gigs of 1833mhz ram and an i7  overclocked gtx 670 the game runs like a dream i was able to transfer my ps3 character and my cars have come to life in a way i never thought i would see them the paint jobs shine amazingly and the vehicles look incredible all the other reviews are telling you exactly what i will which is just go and buy the game and start enjoying the pc master race experience of one of the finer games this lifetime

best game ever pros  stunning visuals & graphics  almost everything feels real object detail shadows effects etc  every characters feels unique great voice actors realistic character details  3 main characters with different personality skills unique vehicles and background  even npc feels real can call cops at you can chat with you even fight at you if provoked  many kinds of animals that can be threat  playing the game with fps mode feels different  the land sea and air is exploreable with realistic means  huge diversity of vehicles car you can pimp most of them bikes planes boats heli minisub military vehicles  many weapons types variant and modifications to choose for  great story  cops more active and cunning to track you down  ingame money feels precious not easy to earned and can be spend out quickly  tons of things to do side missions collectibles achievements explorations  the game is huge improvement from the prequel more optimized with current hardware and software  gta online and online heist fiture havent try it myself yet cons  60gb game size is kinda take a lot of time to download  ingame benchmark tools have some issues not just me  long loading time using ssd or sshd may improve loading time  vram hungry games if you want to play it with higher graphics settings antialiasing and resolutions  50 bucks for the game is worth it but not everyone is willing to pay that much a discount gonna be nice conclusions just buy the game and play it till you bored with it im bored

ing love this game d very well optimised the only bad thing was that r really took the  taking nearly 2 years to come on to pc i mean come on i think r made alot of money from it though most people have baught this game twice or three times now at 35 but all in all very very amazing game highly recomend it to anyone the game runs at 60fps all the time at medium settings 1080p on a bad pc my pc specs i5 3330 nvidia gtx 640m 512mb vram i overclock this p by 30 mhz 8gb ddr3 ram

what makes a good game good graphics good story good gameplay good ai good audio good multiplayer the list goes on and on for what some people think defines a good game im not here to argue and tell you that youre dumb for thinking graphics make a good game or anything else like that im simply here to tell you how great this game is this game is by far my most favorite game of all time no seriously i have played this games campaign over 30 times and thats not a joke ive actually played it over 30 times i started playing it on xbox 360 and fell in love with it thats where i played it 30 times i thought it had amazing graphics great audio quality tight gameplay and an amazing story now that i have it on pc the 360 version looks like lego this game is one of the most beutiful games i have ever played and the best part about this games graphics is that you dont need a $2000 in order to play it and for it to look not just good but amazing you dont even need a 4k moniter this game is pretty easy to run so most of you should have no problem running it still not convinced to buy it how about the story its amazing rockstar took 3 different characters with totally different background lives and extremely different personalities and they tied them all into one story flawsly the story is amazing you have gun fights you prepare for heists you chase people in cars and the whole time its going on youre doing something that makes sense in the story no gta v doesnt have gangs but this game isnt about gangs as much anymore gta v is more centered around hesit and team play but there are still gangs within the game if you like great audio then once again this game is for you the car noises the characters voices the weapon noises and everything else that makes a noise is just amazing what about music you like great music i do too this game a variety of different music and about 90% of the artist on here are pure gold it has tracks with jay rock kendrick lamar queen black flag  snoop dogg nwa and many many more great artist whether youre into electronic music or old school rap theres a radio station for you the only complaint that i have is theres not a heavy metal station but the punk rock station sort of makes up for it the ai is great too it doesnt feel like theres only 30 different vehicles and only 10 different player models it feels like the real world there is so many things to see and do now if you are dead set on playing a game just for multiplayer then this game is good for that too you create your own character and the creation even goes as far to pick your family heritage and stuff it has a great tutorial to start you into the multiplayer and there are so many things you can do missions races or just roaming around with friends or new players online its a great set up and i highly recomend it all in all this game is great to play alone or with friends if you havent bought it already or if you think you should save your money stop over thinking it simply buy this game its a great game i honestly doubt you could just hate it so youre not going to waste $60 youre going to put $60 to great use ive bought this game twice and i might buy it even more hard copy and for friends if i do i wont regret it not one bit for day one this game has so little bugs that its amazing stop reading reviews and buy this game so you can write one yourself

gta v where to start well i r8 88 m8 its gr8 no h8 only appreci8 in all honesty it was worth the wait i was semi expecting something similar to gta iv which was broken and a bit carp however this feels like it was made for pc in the beginning yes there are a few bugs depending on system specs from what i hearexperience 2xmsaa on amd cards can be annoying with tearingflickering however other than that i cant fault much else other than the keyboard controls are a bit derpy but nothing a controller cant fix which made the game a bit more enjoyable with the release i was worried that my 6300 45ghz and r9 270x would struggle however with most the settings on very high under normal 1080p im averaging a steady 35fps and the game still looks stunning i do recommend purchasing this as now the console peasants have run out of arguments as to why they are superior but it is still a great game even after putting 100 hours in on my now not used xbox 360 having it released on pc brought the game back to life for me and i look forward to the many hours of gameplay that it will offer me

goodbye my life t_t

what are u waiting for

im still mad at you rockstar making us wait all that time for gtav to be playable by people who choose to play on the pc master race but the game is incredible at first i thought it was gonna be some kind of crappy remake with the graphics cranked down and everything but the game actually looks better on here than it does on consoles and it runs seamlessly too and gta online works perfectly even if you have a terrible internet connection i am impressed still you should have released this 2 years ago

a lot of people asked me why i bought this game three times didnt you already play it on the xbox 360 and one why would you waste your money again well id bring up a bunch of points improved performance graphics more friends free online mouse  keyboard but one of the answers i always gave was mods not cheating mods for multiplayer fun mods even graphical ones for the singleplayer where noone but you are affected with the new eula in place i suggest you try stay strong and avoid getting this game until the eula is changed back even if you dont plan on modding only then will rockstar realise the mistake theyve done edit so it was all a misunderstanding mods are allowed in singleplayer but it seems the anticheat bot was bugged and caused a lot of confusion therefore i will give this game the thumbs up it deserves

inb4 butthurt modders get angry at me i dont know why you need an fov mod or any other mod for that matter besides the game has only been out for a few weeks it would not surprise me to see heightened support for mods in the future give it some time youll get your roflguns i think i have an issue with the monitor i have gta5 set to as i have experienced a very minute amount of screentearing in my playtime running on an i54690k with 16gb memory and a 3gb gtx 780 tldr if you have no plans for modding buy this game if you do buy it and be patient play the story missions or troll online lobbies or play another game dont hate rockstar this game is beautiful and a lot of fun

a lot of people judges this game caseu they can not play it on casue of some big issues guys i had win7 and i coudnt play it then i isntalled win 81 enterprise  and it works perfect about the game its very cool a big difference from gta iv so its hard to adjust perfect graphich not lugging online mod is also good great working only negativity about this game is that you can not use mods if you do you get banned so  but still perfect i recommend this to everyone
recommended
so far i have had no issues running the game for story mode or online i really am enjoying the game and am very pleased with my purchase i have a windows 7 64bit pc with a i7 processor 32 gigs of ram and a nvidia 780 video card everything looks great and plays smooth as silk only played for a couple hours but this is lightyears ahead of gta iv in game feel no regrets and i would recommend to friends and family

zero flaws the game has been not ported but built from the ground for pc gameplay is changed drastically due to 60 fps and is just fun

worthiest 60$ ever spent

lets face it you know what gta is already

1010 this game is a must have and heres why if you havent played this game on consoles before this just know its like a perfection of many gamers dreams it tells an amazing story with really interesting characters to boot that actualy has very mature and realistic story compared to any other gta  on top of that the gameplay is amazing and tons of fun youll never be bored and once you are you can play online with friends which is hwere the game truly shines the multiplayter perfects open world multiplayer by giving you tons of choices of what t do and how to personalize you online perosna this game does everything right and never ceases to keep me entertained whether its on pc or console now lets get ot why everyone hates this game yes rockstar is actively reventing mods and yes they have absolutely every right to do so lets get this out of the way you are never supposed to mod any game a developer may support it but it is always said that the games are generally made the way and are meant to be modified however gta v is a special case because unlike before rockstar is actively stopping this they have right to do this because you agree to let them and it is their intellectual property you may have bought the game but they own the rights to the game gta name abd it makes sense that they would protect like so mods remove their control over the game even in singelplayer which with hoow smooth annd easy the transition between sp and mp is they might be trying to prevent a more sneaky modifictation to make it through by even keeping them oout of singleplayer they are simply trying to making the game more enjoyable for everyone and lets face it rockstar is a business mods will extend the games lifetime immmensely also increasing the time before they can expect a succesful gta on pc even though many pc gamers believe that is just fine it isnt and id rather have a newer game than a bunch of mods if they can release a newer game sooner it can be better and even more polished than this one even with that said however i do understand the need for outcry for complete lockdown its not hard to see it from both sides but something this complicated if left solely to the dev will take forever to fix gamers and modders should pu in their part to rockstar by at least not modding for now and simply making you point clear to them and the problem will bi solved much clearer however i digress back to the matter of whether or not to buy this game the answer is simple absolutley yes it is understandable if your wary or completely against it if you wanted to mod but i would reserve judgement i dont see rockstar permantly banning all mods they are a smart developer and knows there is a huge lovew for mods up until they come up with a solution or the community finds a workaround until all that is fixed you will still have one of the omst polished and wellmade pieces of entertainment to keep you engaged

played the full game though on ps3 was happy buys pc run max settings is most excited about trevors balding hair and lumpy  xd 1110 would look at trevor again

couldnt keep away from this game forever could we certainly ing cant in the city i live in the entire place is practically giftwrapped in adverts and posters for the thing they almost outnumber the blokes in singlets and flipflops calling each other cant i had to go down to melbourne for a bit and i was faintly relieved at not seeing any there until one of the trams rolled by absolutely plastered with the logos like it had gone at full speed through the last eb games convention you know what i noticed though a lot of the posters ive seen consist only of the head and shoulders of one of the characters with no attempt to sell the game or make any reference to its content just the title underneath cause they figure thats all they need here it is they announced grandly throwing the sheet off the swill trough and jumping back as the pigs all thundered madly towards it yeah i see what you were getting at now amnesia so gtav then the fifth grand theft auto after 1 2 iii vice city san andreas iv chinatown wars and all the other ones adding up not being one of rockstars strong points gtaiv was of course the game that taught the world that gritty realism and tragic character drama have their places and that place is not the same place as the place where you can pile up all your dead s on the side of the road and then ramp off them into a big fire i know you aspire to write stories with some complexity rockstar and that players insisting on selfishly trying to have fun in your game must be very frustrating but you kind of brought this on yourself when you decided that tw@ would be a funny name for an internet caf gtav tries to cunningly hedge its bets by constantly swapping between three different protagonists in the hope youll like at least one of them but that smacks of gamblers fallacy to me its entirely possible to toss three coins and have them all come up tails or indeed for two to come up tails and the third to shoot up your dogs  and give your dog bowel cancer franklin is probably closest to being the protagonistprotagonist cause he does the standard gta straight man thing where he rolls his eyes exasperatedly at every random weirdo who thinks that flagging down passing pedestrians is the best way to put out a contract hit but meekly follows their instructions anyway like a passiveaggressive husband michael by comparison is a very activeaggressive husband who retired from bank robbin to spend more time screaming at his family and breaking things and then theres trevor who seems to be an attempt to represent the standard mode of behaviour of a gta player in that hes a filthy amoral psychotic with the innate likeability of an incontinent honey badger in a house kitchen an hour before the health department inspection but my major beef is that none of these characters are likeable and its not because they you know kill people and  lord knows i cant throw stones in that department at least not til ive cleared the basement out theyre just poorlywritten and inconsistent which may reflect the fact that their dialogue was being written by enough people to choke a sarlacc franklin just comes across as whiny and michael having realized that all his illgotten wealth has done nothing to bring him happiness seems to think that the logical solution would be more illgotten wealth to that end we have the heist missions which is the big new feature after taking fat dudes on dinner dates didnt exactly ignite our pubes last time around and its not a bad concept you plan a robbery mission and do some recon and vehiclestashing tasks before the caper itself well i say plan you plan them in the same sense that you plan a sunday drive down a oneway street because like all the missions they bear the increasingly omnipresent sandbox paradox total freedom when outside missions and when inside total instructionfollowing simulator that fails you out of ing nowhere because you got in the wrong car or went two feet the wrong way and the game just felt like things were getting weird the extent of your input is picking which of two predetermined package tours to use and what crew members to bring their stats increase as you use them but since each one is only available for like two heists apiece in the whole game it doesnt mean a whole lot the protagonists also have rpgstyle stats incrementing away in utter pointlessness levelling up your flight skill can mean the difference between planes handling like both your wings are stuck up a sumo wrestlers  and handling like the sumo wrestlers put on slightly aerodynamic hats i suspect that this is all preparation for the mechanics of gta online and how cunning of you rockstar to hold off unlocking that until after ive submitted this review and stopped giving a twodollar blumpkin about the game well the jokes on you i just moved house and my internet wasnt hookedup anyway bet you feel stupid now but digressing back towards planes for a moment why did i have to go through a planeflying tutorial after a story mission in which i had to fly and land a plane had the sumo wrestlers expressed some dissatisfaction with my performance or is it just that this game is a mess and not the potato salad molestation charges mess that was saints row but an engorged mess of unrelated and clunkilytutorialized features lots of story threads but no strong overarching one mostly character a pisses off organization y somehow and fends them off for a while until character a slaps himself in the forehead and goes i just remembered im a murderer lets just murder whoevers got a narkon and then have a bath in his wife well just to appease those champions of emotional stability who have been burning crosses in the front gardens of unimpressed games reviewers i wont say theres no fun to be had its got some colour back into its cheeks and generally feels less like a fat old sheepdog has fallen asleep on the physics engine i cringed a bit when it brought in buyable properties but they unlock more missions and gameplay so theres a point to it other than just soaking up unnecessary money as is the case in other sandbox games theres not much that particularly made me go christ who thought that was a good idea like that dinner dating business last time but then again theres also nothing that made me go christ who thought that was a good idea because they were totally right to think that and i want to kiss their big soppy face theres nothing that excites me that i can point to and call the defining moment its just a whole load of people doing stuff which i admit is a fairly weak argument world war ii was just a whole load of people doing stuff but at least getting your leg blown off gives you something for the next letter home dear mum remember when my dance instructor said i had two left feet well ive managed to redress the balance somewhat ps ing hell aaaaarrrgh  yahtzee

great game probably my favourite game on the pc right now i have two main issues with this game 1 i have over 30 hours played and ive probably spent a good 3050 minutes of that time in loading screens the most frustrating thing ever is waiting for online to load for 3 minutes and then being sent back into story mode because youve failed to connect to an online session argh 2 the community setting up a heist takes hours because as soon as people find out its only a setup they leave people want to complete heists to make money but they refuse to put the work into the setup something definitely needs to be done about this tldr awesome game 1010 highly recommeded

as a returning player i can say that i am surprised with all you can do in this game compared to the early 360ps3 realease hitting x to duck in cars first person view of course and lets not forget neon lights p this game was truly made for pc with that being said however making your game appear nextgen doesnt necessarily mean that its nextgen when these companies start releasing games with less bugs and problems along with being able to reach a wide variety of gpu setups then i will say we have reached nextgen it was not always how shiny the graphics looked it was about how smooth the game was and problem free it was this helped us enjoy a game even more so than how it looked this is coming from someone who absoulely loves rockstar they have truly  upon pc gamers by banning the usage of mods if modding capability is a deal breaker for you then this probably wont be your game i love modding but not enough to sacrifice $200 of invested money into gtas shark card system nope all in all i get to see 3d chesticles in a strip club via first person and listen to my own music 1110 would get thrown out of strip club again

there are a few things that i like and dont like so i will split them up like so modding modding is very much allowed in singleplayer however the lines become quite blurred at multiplayer rockstar appear to be banning people whom use mods no matter the case and as openiv has not released a version for v in which you can edit cosmetics yet people dont know what is allowed say is an fov mod allowed or will i get banned it is very much in the air at the moment so if youre looking for a rich vibrant modding community like that of gta iv i would stick with said game until it is confirmed what is right and wrong to use graphics well rockstar werent making a bad decision when holding back the release date for so long the graphic fidelity of this game is quite astonishing the only bad thing i would say is that alot of the options in the graphics menu appear to need a game restart but apart from that great job r north the world on the surface gta v and partly gta sas los santos is really amazing if you look how many pedestrians models they have made it really shows quite the amount of effort and time rockstar have put into this game however there are points where the world will become undone say franklin one of the games protagonistsantagonist gets hit by a car will the driver get out and help him no they will drive over him until his ribs are now a layer of mash potato view preferences as like gta iv rockstar has implemented alot of different camera angles like the edgy cinematic camera  will not lower framerate below 24 fps  that follows your car or firstperson in every position speaking of firstperson it isnt the most defining feature it couldve been however the fov is so low 65 degrees what why and it doesnt even tell us that is the highest aforementioned they banned users for creating a fix to about 110 degrees and did not fix it in the recent update online f me online can be amazing at time and the character creation is way better than what it was on the 360 and ps3 i would even go and say it was fun however i dont really like how you can change your appearance one and then done finito i mean meg ryan did it why cant we leveling stars off fairly fast but lessens pace after a while which is fine it has many skills you can improve at times i will just say it is an actionrpg it is very fun but putting a shton of players in a huge openworld with guns and the ability to mod and destory cars can be a bad choice at times que rper hello mechanic can you bring me my bike waits five seconds finds bike and starts to ride hydra out of nowhere shoots at him and crash lands and smashes into his bike and his unhappy face see what i mean dedicated servers could be implemented so that players can spend less time joining a server in a city a hundred miles away and join a server populated with locals and friends with tiny loading times becuase of how close the server is to you in the end it is just above a console port fantastic graphic fedilety you would find on a personalised computer but somethings they havent changed at all not everyones using a controller and lives a mile away from the screen rnorth i understand loosely why they ban people for modding but atleast tell us what we can use eh anyway that is all from me hoped you enjoyed the review maxel

modding or no modding this game is absolutely fantastic worth every penny

the online version is rife with hackers the single player has fun stuff like bug car saving so after you dump 60k into a customoized car and then go to save it in a garage it might not be there later and some stupid special car will be there instead dont get me wrong the game has pleanty of good points and the comedy in the story mode is pretty good especially with regard to trevor but there are some things in this game that will make you rage
recommended
well i enjoy that game a lot even tho i waited almost 2 fu@king year for that game the multiplayer is full of kids and dumb people the apcs are shoting like hackers the script and the dsync are just awesome 1110 rock star is tha best not

please note that i have a  laptop and the review will change as soon as i get a desktop i have had a great experience playing grand theft auto v for the playstation 3 what i really cant seem to figure out is why rockstar took this long to release a game thats still filled with bugs to be honest they should have waited a little while longer then again thats why you release a bug filled game to the public and have the public complain about said bugs and the company fixes the bugs rockstar is a good company to follow and this game proves to everyone why theyre still the best i loved this game on the playstation 3 continued to love it for the playstation 4 and prowd to have gotten it for pc but quite honestly i dont think it should have been made for pc i do recommend this game though its a great game to have on any sort of device that it was made for i love playing it and i enjoy hanging out with my friends in it theres no reason to get this game what so ever got the game for playstationxbox sell it get money back and get this game for steam cause it will be worth getting at the end of the day
recommended
like gta 4 without roman 11110
recommended
ive waited to hear that gtav would come to pc after it was announced i jumped for joy however taking them this long to bring it to pc was a really long time since it was finally released i enjoyed the campain its very tricky some times one thing that upset me was the system in which a missin is failed in earlier gta titles you fail a mission you gotta go back to where the missin was triggered to start it again gta v you fail that and you can restart at a check point yes i understand that sometimes a change is good but to me it didnt feel like a gta title swapping betwine charactors is diffidently a nice change 3 for the price of 1 each with there own unique skill behavours and cars and using them in many missions the heist system for both sp and mp is a real nice change too bringing team work and friends together as well as planning and stratagy another nice feature when buying vehicals is when they are destroyed you can always reuse them mod them and muck on with them as much as you like i got a tank and just went nuts 1010 i like this game as i like all the other gta games its one of many games i would not change about ie modding like other gta titles i never really modded them because i see there is no reason too however people are being banned for a simple mod known as a fov however in there disclaimer it does state reverse engineering is prohibited you need to do such trick to see how the code works to even do this kind of fix so being banned by this simple mod is anyones fault appart from the high graphics requirement ive enjoyed roaming on the map with just normal settings it may not be fancy but it works for me multiplayer is great too better with friends earn money take jobs buy cars mod cars buy garages and appartments and heist for big payouts it does keep the mp experience alive and fun unfortunetly it would be nice to be able to buy side properties like helipads docks and airports to official store boats heavy vehicals and copters it would have been a better change if buisness could be bought to just to earn that little extra dosh with all that being said this is a mixed review yes it may be a good game to play and enjoy the story but it does have its flaws noone can say a game is perfect and to be honest no game is perfect but its about enjoying the game as you play it people who like to mod games this one is best avoided if you planning on modding and playing mp but past gta players will have fun playing this game sadly most people dont understand gta v terms and conditions and usual 99% of people dont bother andor skip this t&c and finally i gave my game rating of play it
recommended
i dony know why but i love this game
recommended
thumbs up to rockstar for banning the people modding the game play it like its supposed to guys i agree banning in singleplayer is a bit excessive but online banning hell yeah keep the bans coming rockstar

this would be long review but ill just say what is bad in this game and its only my own opinion radio station worst radio station work made in gta history310 i could go on and on why radio is bad and why campaing its liner no other options to change game course just heist missions with two paths610 other games has it why gta is different for renovations bugs and online problems nothging is perfect but still online is the key 810 this game is still superb ill give it 910 but it could be legendery if games spirit would be more simular to older gta series

great game rockstar has done it again although in my opinion liberty city was a more dense and alive city you have to commend the attention to detail and scale of gta v the only problem i am currently having with it is stuttering this is with a gtx 970 8gb ram 1tb hdd and a i5 4690k if you have these specs you may get stuttering

this game is an absolute masterpiece of detail in an environment and its characters as well as the story that drives them the multiplayer is done well but connection things could be better designed such as heist teams separating after every setup mission how long it takes to actually load into a game as long as the slowest computer in the lobby and there is no region grouping here so be prepared to play with people from all across the globe etc but the game works the vast majority of the time and theres a lot of fun to be had with it in both online and singleplayer
recommended
well worth the upgrade if you have played on either next gen or last gen the 60fps is amazing and the mods just top it all of allowing so much fun in gameplay
recommended
damn great game

the best of the grand theft auto series thus far

incredible perfect gameplay awesome graphics facinating online cool story both at onlinestory mode keep it up and i think we need more heists ddd

a lot of fun i could not wait for this game to come out and it is a amzing games and amazing grahics its just it crashes it just crashed 2 times in a row on the same gta online heistmission which is not good it got a lot better but it still crashes and is annoying and when u playing a mission the game will not give u money cuz it thinks u are rage quiting when the game is crashing but other then that this game is amazing best game ever

farcry3 skyrim halflife 2gtav not like you didnt already know but gtav is gaming royalty optimized perfectly for my slightly above average pc the graphical options should be included in every game 1010 only thing that could have been better would be the introduction of las venturas and san fierro in the map

just an absolutley amazing game from start to finish i first had this when it came out on the ps3 and i didnt like it so much but when it came out for pc and i heard that we can play gtav in fps mode then i thought this should be interesting i wasnt wrong neither as it was as sweet as proberbly the best game i have played to date well done rockstar studios bravo

if you love loading screens this is the game for you

very good name by the way d
recommended
gta v is an awesome game the graphics are just beautiful the game runs very well gta v has a great story with an interesting characters if you are done with the single player you have the awesome online which have many features and things to do and you can play many hours and still not get bored all the things added to this game in the pc version are very good for example rockstar editor and wildlife and many little things in generalthe verdict for this game is 910 because there are some fps drops disconnecting from online sessions and loading time but i am sure all of that will be fixed

this game is awsome i recamend buying it

sorry for this useless review but this game is totally awesome personaly i find the graphics amazing on the pc version  superb  if you dont know gta or just deciding to buy gta v do the usual research checkout youtube etc
recommended
gta v for pc is the way it was meant to be played two thumbs up this game is great the problem is rockstar doesnt seem to notice how often graphics driver crashes occur while playing this game on dx11 on the current drivers too there is currently no fix available from rockstar which means your game can crash immediately after the driver kicking you from your multiplayer session and making your rep go down you could play in dx10 but it just looks worse doing it that way considering how demanding this game is in the first place any gpu that could handle it is already dx11 capable rockstar should have focused all of their efforts into dx11 instead of splitting it up then it would be playable in its best form
recommended
so first i killed a hooker robbed a bank ran away from the police went skydiving and then downloaded gta v the game is amazing
recommended
they call it a wasting disease cause you waste peoples time
recommended
well where do i start the game plays awesome on my pc 4670k  8gb of rams and gtx 760 theres modders like in every gtao but rockstar is doing verything in their power to enforce justice online which is good but it can also make the game dull sometimes modders do make the game interesting with snowball fights to the death or just flying in a car theyre driving unfortunately just like theres good modders theres bad modders theyre are some modders that go godmode and kill everyone or frame users and kill the lobby in the name of a random user modders arent easy to comeby over all this game gets a 910 its never ending fun and with friends the fun wont stop
recommended
my cd key did not work and i cant ever since someone hacked my acount

fun game perfect to play with friends

pretty 3d of with steam and this offer bought with the shark card and they cant be bothered to reply to my support request as to why my cardcash has not been delivered going to claim money back from my credit card for the value of the shark card so i can buy it in game and not get messed about by people who cant be bothered to look after long time users game is great not played gta in 10 years since early pc days but glad i bougtht it 60gb download takes a few hours on a decent connection so dont get too excited about playing it straight after buying it using xbox controller on the pc makes gameplay much better imo overall just wish i bought it from the local shop
recommended
this game is nice to play and very very  confuseing whille you first time play it but in a whille you get through the annoying parts in the game and learn it more the more gta gets fun  graphic is nice  very nice multiplayer  costumize your characther but still feels limited  hentai bubble gum  find out your self d   singel player without your costume characther  multiplayer has not meny main quests called hiest which makes it feel limited and boring by doing same quests over and over game not worth 50 but buy it from gtwoa or other sites that has it cheaper 
recommended
20 things you can do in gta v 1 rob a bank 2 get the es 3 fly an aircraft 4 drive a tank im sure you cant do that in an open world game 5 swim underwater 6 shoot everyone 7 die 8 drive off a cliff 9 parachute like a boss 10 look at girls in the beach 11 get chased by the cops 12 meet trevor 13 meet micheal 14 meet franklin 15 make your character the way you what it to be gta online 16 install mods only in singleplayer 17 pretend to jerk off 18 scream in the mic gta online 19 stab everyone 20 discover new cars

recommended
not much to say a great port for a great game

fun to play great graphics awesome story a world that feels real
recommended
great game i love the integration with the ios via the ifruit app
recommended
i played through most of grand theft auto v on the ps3 but put it off once the pc version was announced probably the best stories out of all of the gta games
recommended
what is there to say its gta
recommended
very good
recommended
when has grand theft auto not been fun buy it
recommended
1010 would get shot at with money bags by hackers again
recommended
its gta v on pc it is damn pretty too with good machine even without one its better looking than on consoles the game itself is amazing of course and i dont think ive ever laughed so many times when playing online every time i play there is something so absurd that i laugh unceasingly and violently plus its always fun to fail a very high stakes heist at the very last second time after time till the other players rage quit its ok though theres plenty of other player to shoot out of the sky whilst they fly by in their golden helicopters
recommended
just like console less squeekers 910 i kinda miss hearing 8 year old scream the n word
recommended
worth it 
recommended
a big open world sandbox with stunning graphics and a long campaign with endless things to do in multiplayer sounds like the game for me i am a fan of rockstar games and all of the gta series in my honest oppinion this game is 910 with patches now 1010 love it bought it 3 times am i crazy
recommended
it was definitely worth the wait for the pc version best game of the entire gta series so far i always wish the games were slightly longer though with the huge maps and all the different things you can do i still never get as many hours as i can from some other rpg games i still definitely got my moneys worth however
recommended
thoroughly enjoyable not without its bugs and problems such as texture popin and the less than often jagged mouse control runs well at maximum settings on my 3770k16gbgtx670 ocd multiplayer is addictive and very enjoyable with the right people ive found more fun out of carrying a friend on a bmx on my hydra as far as possible however i have had repeated issues with singleplayer data glitching and progress being reset in order to allow the game to remember settings if youre looking for an enjoyable experience in an open world both singleplayer and multiplayer and enjoy grinding for luxuries it would be well worth taking a look at gta v
recommended
a breath of fresh air since the waytooseriousness of gta iv gta online is a blast
recommended
the campagne is the best part of grand theft auto 5 its is very long and has allot to offer and on the multiplayer side im not 100 percent pleased with it becuase it can get boring easy but i defently recomend having it in your steam libery xd
recommended

recommended
after a bit of a bad launch and an absolute trek to wait for the pc version i have to say it is a great game and that first person view gasm
recommended
you must buy this
recommended
well what can i say really its the best selling game of 2013 on consoles then again on next gen consoles and finally the release on pc this year the launch was the smoothest ive had so far this year i logged in to rockstar social and was in the game within minutes playing the single player campaign logging in the multiplayer was a little bit of a hassle due to the large amount of playing hammerin the servers eventually i got in and enjoyed ranking up to 10 before logging off the graphical quality of the game has been improved ten fold from the console editions how ever the texture quality of some parts of the game is lacking howeverall overall the game looks great and runs amazingly well on ultra on my gtx 970 the only problem i have is the loading screen time for both singleplayer and multiplayer on my ssd singleplayer takes a good 30 seconds to load in multiplayer which is expected takes a good few minutes before finding a game to load into
recommended
great game worth getting for singleplayer or multiplayer either game mode will give you hours of gameplay
recommended
vv would play again
recommended
nice game for 5999
recommended
please help me when i launc gta v it says script hook v critical error fatal uknown game version please visit bla bla bla support version bla bla bla
recommended
needs more heist then it wil be a great game single player is good not great
recommended
great game loved the story
recommended
the game itself is absolutely awesome the only problem with it are the hackers theres a hacker in pretty much every lobby you join the multiplayer will soon die if rockstar wont start banning hackers
recommended

recommended

recommended
great game 
recommended
this game is an absolute masterpiece of detail in an environment and its characters as well as the story that drives them the multiplayer is done well but connection things could be better designed such as heist teams separating after every setup mission how long it takes to actually load into a game as long as the slowest computer in the lobby and there is no region grouping here so be prepared to play with people from all across the globe etc but the game works the vast majority of the time and theres a lot of fun to be had with it in both online and singleplayer
recommended
very friend gather a crew off friends and u have a goldmine off activityes and fun

recommended
a lot of fun i could not wait for this game to come out and it is a amzing games and amazing grahics its just it crashes it just crashed 2 times in a row on the same gta online heistmission which is not good it got a lot better but it still crashes and is annoying and when u playing a mission the game will not give u money cuz it thinks u are rage quiting when the game is crashing but other then that this game is amazing best game ever
recommended
its a great game highly suggest this game for others to play

pretty good game so far running on my  laptop for some reason and i love it gt 650m gpu 2 strong
recommended
its a lot of fun if you have friends in multiplayer story mode is much better than gta iv and has bigger map
recommended
get this game and then hit me up
recommended
downloaded scripthook mod became a cat and got kicked cat kicking sim10
recommended
absolutely deserves game of the year theres so much content poured into this game and the pc port actually runs quite well bravo rockstar
recommended
really fun but if i were you i would get it if a friend has it if your planning to on playing online because of heists
recommended
1010 no regrets lived up to the hype
recommended
this is one of the best freeroam games ever
recommended
i have played gta 5 on every plateform so far this is the best version of the game that they had made love the views and deeper details in the pc version love how it can be played up onto 3 screens at once
recommended
best healthcare ever
recommended
okay so this game probably got a significate amount of hate due to the steam summer sale scam but i will give you the realest facts  iggy so this game has online and campaign both of which are amazing so many things to do and explore online a great way to play with friends you can host your own lobby or join a session with other people there are jobs to complete and the more you do the more you rank up ranking up gives you more weapons attachments and other great things you can do heists to gain several thousands or hundred thousands or millions of dollars and xp campaign also a great alternative you dont need internet to be able to play campaign so it is ideal for travel or for offline fun its the same great pleasure of online but without the people and you have three protagonists to play as slight cons warnings this is a hard game to run you need an excellent pc or laptop to be able to run controller support is a bit iffy there are a few glitches that occur due to it cant unaim controller disconnect controller spasm hard in the beginning especially online many ruthless people hard learning curve
recommended
couldnt follow the train fml
recommended
fun alone and fun with friends
recommended
people are bing about them raising it to $80 before summer sale pretty bad move and to bundle it for a while was cheap but come on guys the game is so worth $60 it is the best story driven game the best graphics in the game and it has a fton of you to do so much i have 48 hours already on it and i only have 28% of the story done love the game to death but dont just boycott it because of their  moves otherwise your missing out on the goty
recommended
this game is ing owsome
recommended
i just typed this in order to be able to use curators in my steam group nonetheless awesome game
recommended
ah a game without censorship is bliss
recommended
you know what youre getting into if youre consdering this game my computer runs it beautifully and the details of the map are really amazing great massive open world with a fun story that offers 3 different playable characters hell i even like opening the game just to drive around and do random stuff
recommended
whenever i get mad because i am badish at csgo or tf2 i play this not online for the same reason mentioned before the bad part i dont even progress the story i just have mods to kill people and drive fast it is the only way to alleviate my bloodlust to rek scrublords an the need for speed [lel 80s movie reference xxxddddddd] ez kills ez lyfe better in here than in irl
recommended
if your willing to sacrifice some cosmetics you can play this on an insanly low spec pc i am running this at 1920x1080 on an intel core 2 duo e6600 and an nvidia gtx 460 768m and i arvrage 30 fps while walking in town and 24 while driving in town at high speed i have made modifications to my config to get it to do this but again if you are willing to saccrifice some most cosmetics you can run this game pretty good with low @ss specs
recommended
i wasnt particularly fond of how rockstar handled the release of the game on the computer the story line is okay but in my opinion doesnt match the stories of gta 3 and vc graphically its stunning and the alternative activities in addition to the main missions are quite fun in the beginning i wasnt overly fond of the online portion of the game but it definitely grows on you after a while fair warning though online can get hectic and with global session mics enabled it can be loud and obnoxious depending on what session you get into luckily theres an option to toggle that off
recommended
i have been waiting for the pc port for so long and unlike most other games with pc ports coming out it was done correctly it is great still a 1010
recommended
recovering mmo addicts be warned gta online will relapse your

recommended
this game is ok i could of boughten a better game during the sale like shado of mordor and the presequel and still have money left theres not as many hackers as they say i only found 2 in 15 hours playing online its  how they wont reduce the price on the godamn summer sale when games that arent out yet have gotten price reductions like just cause 3 was 10% off its an ok game but the servers are practically deserted and theres only 30 people per server there should be like 100

its fun lots of fun you can play this game for ages and not get bored but there are hackers all over the game when playing online which can be very frustrating i would reccommend it however rockstar did a massive  move during the summer sale of changing the price up so that they could say its on sale and sell it for the original price thats also one of the reasons the percentage of positive reviews went down anyway would reccommend just be careful for those shady business plans like rockstars
recommended
this games just going forward at any given timethank you everyone who participated in its creation just dont die before playing this game guysseriously
recommended
absolutely beautiful
recommended
the gameplay hours speaks for itself

this game looks awesome unfortunately it arrived too late because when rockstar didnt release this game for pc first and i gave on the pc platform altogether and decided to go back to using the swizel and stone since rockstar abandoned us pc players for years i lost all hope on this innovative technology and decided to stick whats been tried and proven due to the godly graphic requirements of this game i will be forced to upgrade the video card of my swizel and stone so something a bit more new age thanks rockstar for taking so long to remember about the fans that started it all next time dont sell out to consoles and maybe i will give my rock 31 os and return to the pc platform until then ill stream this game to my swizel and stone from my sons pc

recommended
gtav is as groundbreaking and enjoyable as san andreas was before it regardless of the decisions that r chooses to make regarding pricing and the fact that there are hackers in some online lobbies the game itself is both solid and full of replay value 9510 looking forward to gtavi
recommended
the pc port is great no  bugs at least not anymore graphics are amazing there are many different things that make the pc version stand out from the console versions such as higher frames more graphical options like motion blur turning them up to very high etc but the most important thing is the mods sadly though they are only available in single player it is possible to use mods in online but you will most likely get banned due to rockstar thinking most mods will give you an advantage over other players which is understandable if you like to play free roam a lot you may be dissapointed because there are many cheaters who will randomly kill you teleport and sometimes they can even kill you in passive mode how are people getting away with this overall the game is a great buy i can get past the cheaters and mods specifically for single player the mods for single player are pretty awesome too if you have the money for it give it a try the game is still getting updates from time to time adding to the never ending fun the negative reviews i would have to disagree with these reviews are mostly targeted at the business decision rockstar made at the steam sale basically rockstar raised the price of their game by slapping a shark card on the normal copy and the price wouldve came out to be 7000 but because of the sale they reduced it to 6500 while this was a lousy sale for the game it by no means makes the entire game bad they made a mistake and it will pass just wait for the sale special to go away and then buy it the game is still worth the buy and a lot of fun
recommended
really good game almost no hackers online and no lag from rockstars servers great game all around
recommended
great game beautiful graphics what more could you want
recommended
amazing singleplayer story  super fun multiplayer  this __________________ buy it
recommended
wonderful game for multiplayer if you like to drive down the street with a high end car than suddenly being blown up by an aggressive player best to play with friends or to make new heist friends for online single player mode its amazing good storyline mods are oustanding they did a fantastic job compared to gta iv pc compatibility only need to have a hungry power gaming pc to run jaw dropping settings
recommended
just go buy it ffs

singleplayer great online even better got friends play with them got money got a decent system get this game got no money got a weak system definitely not iseng gw coeg v
recommended
would defininatly recommend for singleplayer but not so much for multiplayer if your looking to play with friends its pretty fun but if you go online some hacker will probably either kill you or spawn in $10000000 and once you have everything handed to you the online gets boring kinda quick other than the hackers gta online is pretty stable for me also the leveling grind to unlock stuff takes forever would still recomend for the  and gigles
recommended
dude its a gta dont even bother read reviews just purchase  install and boom even tho your pclaptop is not supported to run this game just buy why cos its gta dude owning the game makes you feel like a god already dude its a gta
recommended
great game graphics are over the top and you cant run out of things to do on the downside it takes alot to run the game and if you dont have a great computer expect lots of lag but if you have a decent computer i recomend getting it

gta online experience one of the first tutorial mission is to rob a convinience store after robbing it 6 other players waiting outside and shoot you when you go out people are jerks 1010 edit 1  raging modders now i see a lot of people angry about being banned after using mods do people even realized that any mods that you make to your game is just for your own game if you use your mods on gta online that gives you an edge no matter what the mod is fov mods yes that isnt much  to you but it does give you a litttle edge over other players on gta online rockstar has made a statement that modding singleplayer is a go go online is a no no just treat the gta online as any other mmos for all its worth i really hope rockstar loosen the punishment a little bit instead of banning the ones who uses mod gives them a warning first or something frankly people i dont get why you dont see modding a multiplayer game is wrong

the pc port is great no  bugs at least not anymore graphics are amazing there are many different things that make the pc version stand out from the console versions such as higher frames more graphical options like motion blur turning them up to very high etc but the most important thing is the mods sadly though they are only available in single player it is possible to use mods in online but you will most likely get banned due to rockstar thinking most mods will give you an advantage over other players which is understandable if you like to play free roam a lot you may be dissapointed because there are many cheaters who will randomly kill you teleport and sometimes they can even kill you in passive mode how are people getting away with this overall the game is a great buy i can get past the cheaters and mods specifically for single player the mods for single player are pretty awesome too if you have the money for it give it a try the game is still getting updates from time to time adding to the never ending fun the negative reviews i would have to disagree with these reviews are mostly targeted at the business decision rockstar made at the steam sale basically rockstar raised the price of their game by slapping a shark card on the normal copy and the price wouldve came out to be 7000 but because of the sale they reduced it to 6500 while this was a lousy sale for the game it by no means makes the entire game bad they made a mistake and it will pass just wait for the sale special to go away and then buy it the game is still worth the buy and a lot of fun

would defininatly recommend for singleplayer but not so much for multiplayer if your looking to play with friends its pretty fun but if you go online some hacker will probably either kill you or spawn in $10000000 and once you have everything handed to you the online gets boring kinda quick other than the hackers gta online is pretty stable for me also the leveling grind to unlock stuff takes forever would still recomend for the  and gigles

great game

do i have to say anything its just a great game the only downside is the loading screens and that you have to log into rockstar social club

in the main story trevor tortures michael this is some information on torturing torture is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological pain and possibly injury to an organism usually to one who is physically restrained or otherwise under the torturers control or custody and unable to defend against what is being done to him or her torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals groups and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or even longer reasons for torture can include punishment revenge political reeducation deterrence interrogation or coercion of the victim or a third party or simply the sadistic gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture the need to torture another is thought to be the result of internal psychological pressure in the psyche of the torturer the torturer may or may not intend to kill or injure the victim but sometimes torture is deliberately fatal and can precede a murder or serve as a form of capital punishment in other cases the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim alternatively some forms of torture are designed to inflict psychological pain or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation depending on the aim even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible such as halfhanging

dont make the same mistake i did make sure your graphic card on your computer is going to be able to run this game before you get to excited and just get righht into it i fixed the problem well kinda is a very hard game to run so i am figuring out how to make my game run faster but that might take a while for go sakes make sure you can run this game before you spend the money

its actually a pretty decent game but after you beat the game it doesnt seem to get better because now you have a choice between playing with friends or pretty much roleplaying in los santos in single player gta online is okay its just not that fun if you play by yourself but youll get the most of the game when playing with friends the one thing i didnt like about it is that there are not a lot of heists to play in gta online there is but v its not much seriously if you want to have much more fun with friends get terraria instead its actually more worth it

bought the game a few months ago saw the steam sale and its a decent deal people are whining and bing about the main game not being discounted do you realize how many dlc weve gotten free since the original game release for last gens consoles they arent going to lower the price for years because they continue to give you free dlc every few months dont  and moan just buy the max payne 3 bundle or the san andreas bundle if this is such a big deal to youthe game is awesome and you get new stuff every few months free of charge

having just played this game for a short time on pc so far i can say i am very pleased with the pc version the pc version has better graphics no loading hiccups that plagued the console version and it has smooth performance looking forward to beating the game on the pc version and playing on multiplayer i definitely recommend the pc version over the console version 1010

recommended
an amazing port to pc its not a port though rock star did something that most developers wont and made a properly optimized game for the pc this game is absolutely gorgeous whats a draw distance you seem to forget that a limit exists standing on top of a mountain looking down on los santos controls are intuitive for the most part game play is smooth and new player friendly but at the same time giving more experienced players a fun challenge online works  1010 the only two things i do not like about this game  no modding support and its 65 gigs of space on your harddrive ouch

good game just fix the ing random crashes already taking the  now rockstar

a must buy game on pc perfomance isnt so bad even if your computer is not powerful enough the disadvantage nothing but dont ever try to mod the game as it could get you banned

my short review 1010 solid game i have played this on all consoles and i feel like this is definetly the finished version and definetly worth the money most the negative reviews are people who are crashing and dont know how to look up a fix simple and everywhere online

am i just one of the lucky few i used like 4 mods and im still not banned xd

singleplayerstorymode gets a 45 not even close to being one of the best though multiplayer is a mess but rockstar is slowly progressing still cheatersscripters lurk in about half the lobbies now before the update there was a cheaterscripter in every lobby the mutliplayer is still very fun though but like i said needs more updates i would say in the next 23 updates in the future this game will be solid also dont buy the sharkcard things they are the biggest rip off in the history of gaming its not fair to sell virtual money when the average player has 1m40m from cheatersscripters using the moneygun and shooting a million 40k$ sacks on the road everywhere overall this game is fun but not worth $60 i would sell it for around $40 since the game really lacks important things oh ya almost forgot this game has the worst matchmaking system for heists in the history of gaming frigging the old halo matchmaking rekts the  out of gtas matchmaking system
recommended
very recommended best game of the year

whats left to say at this point ive been playing gta since it was a top down and this is the game ive been waiting for the best in the series so far im just hoping rockstar releases plenty of dlcs i only know of 2 on the horizon and hopefully those wont be the only ones
recommended
for the gta5 complaints or dislikes is the price or the multiplayer but have they looked into the singleplayer the fun thing is you can mod and do more crap in the single player yes rockstar rose the price but they felt the pc version is the best what if you had anagreement with steam and they lower your game price youd wanna strangle them so they found a loop this is one of the best games youll play so much work went into this game and people dont apperitiate it so if anyone tells you its a bad game you can do what you do in gta to em

anyone who rated the game down because of the rather scummy marketing move are just a bunch of  the game is great really good port online is riddled with hackers which they should be fixing eventually ignore the top rated  who got all pissy because they are cheap asses who get all ey when the game they want didnt go on sale but instead pretty much gives a free large cash card seriously though  some of these reviewers review the game thats what people come here for

this game is truly worthy of waiting for the amount of delays i play put many of hours into this game i admire rockstar for their effort putting into this game and i know for sure that this game will live on for many of years with continuation of mods and dlc this is truly a great port but be ware of the performance for those who using under minium or recommeded it will eat up all your vrams and ram

its a solid 710 my personal gripes with the game for why i gave it that score 1 the loading times in multiplayer are a constant annoyance 2 the visuals are dated compared to a game like watch dogs and honestly they require way too much horsepower to run for the framerate to get as low as it does watch dogs maxed out gets 80100 fps maxed out this game ive seen it go as low as 25 on a gtx 980 in some areas 3 heist missions online are very fun however replaying them isnt as 90% of my time is worrying about other people doing their jobs correctly rather than actually enjoying the mission itself 4 first person mode was definitely overrated and i find myself constantly switching back to the 3rd person mode instead it just doesnt feel fluid and even with the fov setting maxed out it feels wonky and limiting the weapon position itself feels off as well 5 the pc helicopter controls are as bad as gta 4 the design wasnt improved at all 6 still way too many buildings that have no interiors it really kills immersion for me in this world when 98% of the buildings and houses you see around you cannot be accessed i was really hoping to be able to break into houses or something this time around to do robbery jobs or something like that but sadly that isnt an option at all would have been a great sideactivity for online as well the games world itself just feels too limited to the street which was the same problem gta 4 had you see all these great looking buildings and houses and cant access any of it maybe someone can do a mod that opens up some of these housesbuildings i realize that its a lot of work doing interiors especially interiors with multiple levels but still it shouldnt have been this restricted like gta 4 was and they could have enhanced it further over gta 4 by adding some sideactivity to go along with it like robbery jobs

ahh the long awaited gta v first off the port i cannot express how impressed i am with it my gpu is barely above minimum requirement and i have to play everything on lowest settings possible with gpu memory maxed out yet it still runs at a silky smooth 60fps even then everything looks beautiful except for a few minor details here and there like a bit pixely shadows or franklins hairstylebeard as for the pc controls theyre plain amazing you can now walk run and sprint at will which wasnt possible without a controller in gta iv you only could walk and sprint which is done by toggling walkrun with your set sprint key you hold the key to actually sprint the radio stations can be changed both by mouse wheel and by holding a button to bring up the radio station wheel just like in the consoles default keybindings suit my needs well and i think they do alot of other people finally the settings i dont remember a game which you could customize so well one can set their first person field of depth vehicle camera height try messing with advanced graphics options and much more all functions are rebindable with a primary and a secondary keybind overall well worth my money the port is amazing the game runs smooth and i had no problems with the game yet definitely my favorite pc game for now

all goodbut in few minute i play keep getting this error err_gfx_d3d_init

reading all the posts from people regarding mods im not sure on rockstars policies personally about mods but i never use them myself and i have no problem buying the shark cards have spent a few hundred so far loving the game the wife and i both play and have had no real problems thus far dont listen to the negative comments the people getting banned are usually doing something wrongwell 95% of the time lol

software rubbish do not buy this  game just does not work after 3 game patches and 2 graphic cards driver versions the sad thing is i am not the only one with the same problem a waste if money

the best version of one of the most beloved games of recent times runs like a dream and plays like one too exceptionally programmed barring the social club inclusion which is needlessly clunky and only really exists to sell you virtual money this game has every great feature you can think of unless you like fps with fov and dont you dare mod it in single player is everything you could have dreamed and while multiplayer is kind of an afterthought it is still wholly competent and runs half decent the worse complaint from the multiplayer is likely that it loads everywhereso expect to be waiting all over the place overall 910

2 hours in witnessed homoerotic dog freaky times with commentary the unabashedly violent narrative is awesome  the writers and comedians working on the single player storyline are brilliant almost 200 hours in  the work that went into creating sympathetic portraits for each character is shocking i mostly play fps not rpgs  this is a stunning blend of both additionally the environment and sound detail are exquisite i would also like to take a moment to respond to boiler plate feminist critiques the game lacks a femaile protagonist  and i think a future version should feature one but the story and archetypes in play here are wholly nihilistic with the exception of franklin and even that story line is very dark there is nothing happy about these entwined stories but they are written exceptionally well the voice acting is amazing and the ingamefeel empathy for character is striking this is not a game that objectifies women its a game that objectifies every last slimy detail of male fantasy and freemarket capitalism which by most 3rd and postwave feminist critiques is a heteronormative and maledominated world the games storyline is tragic for all involved and the immersive elements radio talk show hosts reality tv shows corrupt beauracrats plutarchs autocrats mobs the rich and famous etc all suggest that our world sucks there isnt much you can do to change ingame what is effectively a portrait of modern society but it gives the player some pause some reflection on very wellresearched tropes and incendiary topics without holding back think of this game as the video game version of the  monologues but documenting us culture unapologetic rapey terrifying confusing but welltold

brilliant game brilliant characters even more brilliant script but the plot and the use of the map has been very misused in this edition of gta unlocking part of the maps at the time and taking the player to location that otherwise would have not be noticed was one of the main strengths of the gta series both this formulas have been ignored in addition if we consider that gta was one of the most enjoyable modding platforms available since vice city the lack of such feature or to better explain the fact that you get banned if you use mods takes so much away from a title that has been on the top of the world for so long please rockstar dont make the mistake that so many userunfriendly production houses have made dont make yourself be hated by the community allow single player mods without consequences in the online side of the game i do recommend the game its fantastic but mods in single player must be made possible before i can give a positive vote

made hookers join nasa after i blew my load in them gravity gun mod would be 55 but the online should not have that much grinding even after the heists because it contradicts the point of grand theft auto therefore i settle to 45

this is a great 3999 game the single player is not the best but it still has a great story and even without any multiplayer the game is worth the 3999 but the multiplayer makes it worth more than what we pay this made me pay 7998 since i got the console version and i still love the game that doesnt mean its without its flaws there are a few glitches for instance the single player characters can turn invisible through cutscenes there are more glitches but i want to keep this review somewhat short the biggest problem is rockstar games not allowing any modifications to the point of banning players even if its a single player mod so if you enjoy how the game is now buy it but for those who wanted to mod the game rockstar says no 9610

just like the ps3 version but for the pc what elase can i say

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful

love gta sa from 10 years ago now you get to play as three different sociopaths with their own separate backstories and agendas to wreak havoc all over san andreas in hd the method the story is portrayed is slightly different from previous gta games as the story focuses more on the interactions between the main characters than the standard antagonist ruining my life so i need to hunt and kill him at the end of the game nontheless still an amazing story oh and if killing npcs isnt enough you go online on gta online and do heists with friends or strangers although theres a very high chance that youd spend most of the time being killed by dck players until the point where youd be a  yourself and kill unsuspecting players yourself

pc games there are times when i look at los santos and think why would you even think to build that this is appropriately a thought that i often have about los angeles in gta 5s case the tone is different baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled yknow despair rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit i look at it and i wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so i marvel at the care evident in san andreas gorgeous sunsets in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world in the artfullychosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience everything about los santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years the abiding irony of grand theft auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in los santos hates it there

this game is one of the best games ive ever played it is separated from most games due to the vast variety of things to do this is more than worth the money as for children i feel children can handle most of the vulgarities in here note that you are the criminal game so remember if the child can handle it i recommend for mature kids at least 13 and up and immature kids at least 14 and up

pc latest got this wonderful game but the wait was worth it prashna version looks much better console its even better even more beautiful and thats the main advantage in front of the console shadows textures quality of detail and the range of drawing  this is what happened at the conference also pc will receive exclusive fps kind of an eye and a lot of sakam small poprock type of animals some nps weapons machines and so forth jambs of course first  system requirements the pc version of gta 5 will not go on low komputerach and given the prices on the hardware the upgrade will cost the price of three nextgeneration consoles improvement of course a great pleasure to play the game in 4k resolution but the price bites second  the bugs and lag at the start of the game can and works better than four but stocks still a cloud the problem with the launch registration settings and more there are complaints about performance

brilliant game brilliant characters even more brilliant script but the plot and the use of the map has been very misused in this edition of gta unlocking part of the maps at the time and taking the player to location that otherwise would have not be noticed was one of the main strengths of the gta series both this formulas have been ignored in addition if we consider that gta was one of the most enjoyable modding platforms available since vice city the lack of such feature or to better explain the fact that you get banned if you use mods takes so much away from a title that has been on the top of the world for so long please rockstar dont make the mistake that so many userunfriendly production houses have made dont make yourself be hated by the community allow single player mods without consequences in the online side of the game i do recommend the game its fantastic but mods in single player must be made possible before i can give a positive vote

this game has everything youd want except for the fact that 1 out of 1 sessions you find a scripter youll constantly be hopping online sessions hoping that youll find a nice scripter thatll give you money otherwise youre screwed and get griefed have fun

a well optimized port

utter mayhem in multiplayer heists are amazing but there needs to be more of them luckily r is releasing new content quite often so youll never be bored ive not played much campaign but i can say that a lot of people have good things to say about it the three main characters are apparently quite easy to relate to even if you arent a retired bank robber did you see that guy on reddit dang all in all a solid game with a ridiculously fun multiplayer some server instability at times and its a bit clunky to meet up with friends but nothing worth writing home about

rockstar eventually responded to my support ticket and the response was to advise that they are fixing the mouse input issues latest bug fix reports state these issues are fixed but they still persist  i am also experiencing a consistent decrease in fps the longer i play the game for which suggests a memory leak still exists even after their most recent updates which stated these sort of problems were resolved rockstar fix your fu game  also why is it that in gta online there is a constant stream of lag spikes which somehow tie directly in with my frames per second too so i can be cruising along at 75fps then out of nowhere 1fps and back up agan and down etc other players have advised they see this happening where my car rubberbands all over the place in sessions when this starts ive seen it happen to other players as well we are on very stable fibre optic connections here and are usually elected as a viable host connection in other games that use peer 2 peer hosting but for whatever the reason in gta online this fails so bad well if you read all of this and consider that i spent the entire time since the game came out with massively delayed correspondence between support and myself trying to get them to acknowledge that the issues i am having are the fault of their game and then to try get something done about it still to no avail well go ahead and buy a copy but i genuinely could not recommend it gtamp is being worked on which is a gta 5 multiplayer mod with an estimated release date of some time later this year once that comes out  perhaps then the memory leaks and mouse input will be fixed enough that i could at least recommend buying the game as an engine to support gtamp gtamp will avoid the inconsistent latency issues that r provide their customers with shy p2p hosting by giving us dedicated hosting for custom gamemode servers it wont be an deathmatch freeroam with basic rpg elements necessarily it will be something unique and exciting using the great map and content of gta 5 so thats worth hanging out for but right now no not worth buying wait for that to release and wait to make sure r dont slam it shut with a lawsuit threat or similar hopefully theyll be too busy selling preorders to gta 6 by the end of the year to care about gtamp ^ ^

people need to stop downvoting this game just because rockstar didnt want to contribuite in the summer sale vibe be happy that they included a free shark card with the game for the sale anyways overall this game is well built super optimized and runs like a dream i recommend

so rockstar have finally releasted gta 5 for pc and well atleast we all new it would be better than a xbox or ps4 the game is a big step up from gta 4 but also not i say this because well the graphics are better and look even more better with sweetfx and the story is amazing better than gta 4 in my opinion and also its better runed i think u would atleast need to have a system with these follwing parts to play 5060 fps on high gtx 750ti 2gb intel i34160 500w psu samsung evo 850 ssd 120gb 8gb ram if u are looking for fps like that for ultra then you are going to want better conponents and overclock your system if needed i think this game would be alot better with servers that allow online mods because well mods are just fun and some peopel only want the game for that reason also you can optimize the game with geforce experience and set the game setting to how you want and to your liking i suggest you complete the game first so this gives you and advantage to know who the players are but there are also some things i didnt like about this game is that well the map i know we can get jest and all other army equitment and stuff and i know that there are gun shops to go to and the higher level you are the better wepons you get and free dlc wepons but i just think the map should be bigger i think its just to small in my opinion some people might not think this but i think this is what should be changed also i think the clothing should be changed aswell to be able to have your name going across the clothing you selected and maybe different emblems not just crew badge and i also thin that this should apply to cars like so you can get a warraped custom designed by yourself and have a custom wrapp for the rims also air bag suspention so u dont have to keep buying different suspention for your car you can just get the air bag suspention and control it without paying another thing is the prices is that its not good for me but for people who dont have any friends to play this game with and cant get people to do hiest with i think they should just downgrade the prices so that peopel have better chance of owning things and getting better things i like how the gun system works but they are trolls who are higher levels than you and then they kill you over again with guns you dont have and they think there mlg or something so if you dont like that then kepp that in mind when getting this game and the only thing left to say is let my play time speak for itself xd

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect

rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful

the graphics look like the damn ps3 some parts look nice but the shadows are very choppy trees are glitching out and i cant use my mouse it staggers too much im forced to use the wired xbox controller and my graphics card fans are screaming in over load anyway rockstar ed up i thought with the amount of delays the pc version had i thought it would be better without glitches i guess i was wrong i think the rockstar team need to learn to create games for the pc first then work on consoles they did better that way im playing at 60 fps 60 hz cause i cant play any lower other wise the shadows are all choppy and the cars have glitches in the textures

first i couldnt play because i had a space in my windows user name yeah really i had to make a new windows user account to get the game to finish patching and play then i couldnt complete any missions involving driving since the streets and buildings wouldnt render so im driving along in the sky and smashing into invisible objects my specs fall within whats required i figured out the fix for that ctrlaltdel set priority to high awesome then im forced to take an unpaid day off from work and figure at least ill be able to play some gta5 today woot oh whats this a new patch ok <downloads> gta5exe not found please reinstall the game really hey no problem its only 60 gigs 2010 would totally uninstall again i dont know why its totally ok for game publishers to completely %$& over their customers on a regular basis when other industries would end up in court with classaction lawsuits

if you planned playing gta5 with keyboard and mouseno way mouse handles like  you can mess with the options in the keyboardmouse settings men however it wont work if you dont have a controller the game is unplayable or as best annoying as  rockstar should have known better hopefully a future patch will level this out nontheless best gtastory ever the mousething is a shame though
not recommended
believe the hype and get burned still plays like a ps2 game and the online portion is a tacked on grind fest not fun at all the controls are convoluted and the rules of familiarity changes all the time the characters are boring sociopaths and unrelatable this makes the missions a chore and you will have no feel for the stakes if you are a casual that want to kill some brain cells and toy around in a virtual sandbox at least do yourself the favor and wait for a sale
not recommended
i was expecting a great game however when i started playing i came through to see multiple erorrs for a game which is so expensive i thought these problems would be solved along with this the game has very high cpu expectations to run the game features which are not required for games off the same demand which do not have these problems after 18 hours off downloading paying for a expensive game the last thing i want is a poor quality game which crashes whenever i pause the game and deal with multiple problems i do not recomend this game

i am done pretending this game is okay its not and people only like it because it is edge theft auto lets start with the online aspect its an abomination not because it is nopt a fun mode well i guess that is why its not fun because the community is well you thought the community on call of duty was bad this amps it up no one does missions they simply go and kill low level characters with miniguns and the other op weapons rockstar decided to give their jackass online community please either make the weapons open for everyone and quit making players have to level just so they can get some overpowered weapons they can get tanks and bomber jets which equals your game being ruined the community is the rudest i have seen since counter strike go sexism racism hackers and much more i shot a guy in the head with two clips from an ak47 before he died i was point blank shooting his head and it took two clips to kill him the hacking is real in this game you can no longer mod which was the only saving grace to this garbage franchise 310 for the online to me the story is the typical lets be criminals mantra and that crap i cant even beat the second mission its just uninteresting without mods 310 for the edgefest story rockstar was much edgy with this game dont buy this unloess you are max level online if you plan on playing online i know i will get thumbs down but thios game is just the online would be fun if not for a the community b the hackers c the trolls who do nothing but ruin the game for others and laugh like the subhuman mongrel they are d just not fun with mods being banned mods would of been the reason i kept this how do i end my eula i want a refund

please wait a little more loading review  loading story review oh you didnt want a story review you wanted to jump into online you must of mashed buttons in frustration or picked up your controller and nudged one this is story review and its crap the plot is so awful a beautiful world and everything is so so so so so dull until trevor arrives on the scene who cares about michael and his family home you want to shoot his kids and this is gta ffs you cant shoot them no one would put up with their crap what a  franklin only really here to cling on to some old san andreas grove street roots and i hated grove street trevor is just  well youll see but story mode is playable without a doubt it is a great way to see this sandbox and how beautiful it is flying over it looking down at the houses you will see that the guy who was copy and pasting house models was fired it would be hard to find two similar houses in los santos the detail is rather incredible and i completed this twice on ps3 before coming to the pc version and seeing even more extras to detail it is impressive but loading joining friends  crew server looking for friends no friends loading joining friends  crew entering solo online what even is solo online loading failed to join server joining friends server  getting server info joining server timed out loading bored joined friends server finally we can start to play online you may of gathered there are plenty of load screens but once you are in you can play for a time and have plenty of fun the amount of missions  heists etc is where this game does excel and keep you from boredom because there is nothing more stupid than being in a game where someone is in an armored car shooting at you and you cant do much back but you will play with friends  crew members and then you will go to freemode to take a break and muck about or restart some missions because all you are being offered is death matches and races but you wont be in the same server and god knows you are going to be seeing 5 loading screens before you can get back to each other or not at all or you will be in a loading screen forever like limbo while you wait for everyone else to come out of theirs because yours seems to be hanging until they have all made it back to a server and this has to be why the connections are so bad and you are desyncing so much watching people plough into car after car but they swear they have hit nothing the entire time except that wall where finally everything resyncs the whole character transfer idea is awful what ahole thought that up maybe in 3 months allow that when some people have gone from level 0  100 or we but to let people start at 100 so they everything unlocked way to ruin the playing field saw one guy at level 1000 already one thing i think is missing is crew cribs i mean why would you want to all have a different appartment i would rather one crew crib where you have earn ya money and do it up rather than rockstar making a few ikea furnished homes of course then they would have to make a bed bath and beyond walmart where we could buy or steal goods from

game mysteriously labeled as gta v when it should be labeled as a hurl 60 dollars into barrel of fire simulator currently only able to rate 510 because of the misleading title of gta v swap that name though and 1010 they really captured how it feels to throw 60 dollars right into a barrel of fire probably feels the same as hurling 60 dollars right into the garbage tearing 60 dollars apart and throwing it in a busy street honestly the list goes on its an excellent sim at the end of the day you lost that 60 bucks and thats all that matters httpiimgurcomhuw5htujpg

i have this on ps3 and ps4 and if i had an xbox360 and xboxone id buy it on those too i now own it on pc as well and i am being absolutely sincere when i say that the pc version is the definitive version of grand theft auto 5 if youre worried that it might be a horribly optimised mess like gta iv was when it was ported to pc just set those worries aside rockstar really have outdone themselves with this port now its not all sunshine and rainbows if you have 75 cop cars 36 police choppers and 12 tanks on screen all shooting at you at once youre going to get a bit of lag whatever your system specs no doubt but youll get a hell of a lot more mileage out of the pc version than any of the console versions by a long shot setup your xbox 360 controller or ps3 controller with motionjoy for car and plane controls and you wont know any difference from the console besides the better graphics and the fact you can finally pop off enemies expertly using the keyboard and mouse controls the gamepads will always be ready for action so you can seamlessly switch from keyboard and mouse to controller when jumping in a vehicle if i could recommend one upgrade it would be a video card with 4gb of memory the gpu isnt the main issue with gtav unless you pile on the extreme post processing settings which you dont really need anyway its the video memory having said that youll need more than 2gb of video memory only if you intend to use high or very high texure qualities normal looks fine if a little blurry and is about the same level as the consols use this suits me fine point is im running an ageing geforce gtx670 and it has no problem keeping up with general gameplay although i havent had any wanted levels that might lead to the scenario i described above as yet for general gameplay in which most people are looking to do storyonline missions a 670 or comparable gpu will have no issues running this game as long as it has 2gb of memory or more

heres the thing the method currently being used to mod isnt really what most people think of as modding scripthook is an example of dll assembly code injection which sneaks foreign code into the process in order to provide a method for an additional payload of code to hookmodify the game process in memory the problem with this is that there is no way to tell what the payload is nor is there anyway to prevent the payload from working in only some areas of the game thats the point a lot of people dont understand here were not talking addons were talking dll files that have been modified to allow a user to run any additional code they want and have the game accept it and execute it there are no limits to what can be run with this and the trainer that comes as the included demonstration of scripthook is a very benign usage of the potential to give you an example of the dangers of allowing dll injected clients to connect to multiplayer servers or any other client for that matter until recently in reign of kings hackers using the same method that scripthook uses were using injected assembly code into dlls to modify files on the computers of other players on the servers they connected to and in many cases even the files on the servers themselves when were talking about dll injection there is no such thing as singleplayer mod or multiplayer mod its just foreign code being run anywhere the user wants the only way to prevent it is to check the integrity of the dlls of any client on connection and cutting the connection as soon as a disprecency is found it may seem like overkill but the alternative is a complete loss of security for anyone using gta online

ignoring all the recent steam summer sale business for people who werent able to preorder the game and they could get a bit of the same edge as people who did preorder now i understand sixty bucks isnt that much hard to come by is gta5 fun in most cases i like to drive down a ing mountain in my sports car and still make it without it exploding on me i could go past a mountain to catch up to my teammates when i was away for a while i could play golf and tennis i could scubadive i could find theres no easy mode to fly a plane in this game like it is in other games which creates a sense of realism to it pros had the highest hype train in 2015 variable third and first person views which most games dont have beautiful illustration of graphics a rather curious wellput storyline always noting to you that in every gta game theres always a betrayal which competitors dont really do such as saints row gtaonline feels realistic about a town riddled with crime and chaos its city survival simulator technically although no ones trying to survive but it gives you a frantic case of a city sprawling with gangs but as with every game there are cons cons money isnt easily made unless its by stocks and doing a heist as michael when the player is given about 75k in cash their instinct is to see what they can do with the amount of money they have compared to franklin gtaonline is riddled with cheaters and trainers at the moment where even a newly made friend can be a hacker that has a minismg that shoots out 40k bags of cash just to get your attention and telling you to take it playerbase is unusually aggressive but then comes a wise choice of pick your crew and group carefully as even your own teammates can turn on you simply for being in the same limo those cheaters and trainers they get rp and cash boosts and what not they also occasionally have the ability to drop a nuke in los santos and murder them while pinning someone else for the blame regardless to say though i still personally prefer to play the game every now and then although what im spouting for the most part is blasphemy this is still just my opinion of the game im not a professional critic after all

sad that rockstar released the pc port for gta v a mere 3 weeks ago and you already have people complaining about crashes and bugs ect originally owned gta v on the 360 which got outdated moved up to the ps4 was more than satisfied with the pc edition finally out this is the best gta to ever hit the market a big reason why i bought this game on pc was for the modding and at this very moment if you mod single player you will get banned from rockstars servers if i know rockstar well enough they will listen to their fanbase and put in a patch which will allow you to mod single player without being repremanded online rockstar is usually good with listening to their fans how you could buy this game with such high expectations for it already and yet while playing it having it exceed those expectations having played gta iv for so long both on pc and consoles for hours upon hours then moving to this game on 2 different consoles then moving to the pc port and still being suprised at what quality kind of game rockstar can always manage to put together 1110 would get drunk at the strip club again

the game is great you get what you pay for the only down side is that there might be a hacker in you lobby and what i normal do is just join a new lobby but other than the hackers the game has great graphics a great story line thats not a lot but there is probably 20 more things i could easily put on there

the game runs fine for me overall the game is a solid story you should get if you want to see how it plays out you are given the option to skip quests if you fail them too many times the only bad thing about this game some systems wont run it or some systems run it at very low settings people have been vocal about that part as well as it links your socail club accountonline with whatever email you used to pay for the game keep that in mind i like it so far i would pay for it again overall good game should research if you can run it and other stuff to be safe

gta v 810 pros  sandbox mayhem shooting sht up driving like a dumbss flying planes through the different buildings strip club  etc  firstperson view  vast open world and a lot of random sht happening in game  cars are fun to modify  3 characters  online multiplayer  i find the graphics a bit better than ps4 version which i have played hours and hours on  rockstar editor and director mode are really fun to use to make random videos and clips  keyboard and mouse seem more fun to use than the controllers no more super auto lock on in multiplayer mode if using keyboard sessions can be played with other players who use the keyboard and mouse more fun in shoot outs when there is no lock on function  the game itself has life and constantly has something for you to do and pushes you to want to do stuff cons mods the reason i bought this game was mainly for the crazy and even stupid mods and after reading tons of reviews on getting banned for modding and perma bannnn on online mode i dont even want to risk it after seeing that rockstar apparently is trying to get rid of modding entirely what does this mean that mods in game even in singleplayer will result in some consequence correct me if im wrong the point im getting at though is these mods are amazing some of them help make the game experience more real and fuller for example the fov mod talk going around the forums creating fov mod will allow more options for the fov which will make the first person view feel real as mentioned in one of the forums driving in firstperson would be a lot better if you could see a little more off the windshield and maybe even the side mirror maybe rockstar should view this kinds of mods as what improvements could be done within the game better fov a little bit faster cars an actual use for the gas station beside robbing the store hahaha maybe a collaboration between rockstar and players could allow us to use mods under their supervison maybe submitting possible mods to rockstar and they choose whether to allow it or not is another way maybe even allowing or creating a separate server for mods or even an option that allows you to create a session with mods on could be another way to allow for mods to happen maybe rockstar can place a punkbuster kinda thing on servers that detects players who use cheats that affect like that stats and healthbars damage ammo etc just giving some ideas that could help idk if any of these are possible but its really disappointing that there is this difficulty with mods overall its a fantastic game but what could make it even better is being held back by some dispute on modding content the mods from old gta games were amazing and id love to see that again in gta v to some extent this whole dilemma pushes me to just find a pirated copy of the game and use that and mod it like crazy then hope that some private server is created to handle the gta online mode eventually which allows modding via submission to the admin or what not

definitely worth the buy since the latest patch they finally managed to fix the annoying crashes & performance issues havent played it online yet since there seen to be alot cheaters but its sad that you receive an vac if you mod the actual game
recommended
so much to do and easter eggs galore see here httpwwwigncomwikisgta5references_to_movies_tv_games_and_pop_culture  i love how you can kind of play this any way you like dont wanna do missions go play a round of golf or hit up the strip club and the environmental details are astounding rockstar really put a lot of work into this game and believe me it shows i wish all game companies took the same amount of time dedication and attention to detail in their games ps those giving it negative reviews are just whining about being banned from gta online for using hacks or mods until rockstar officially supports mods or makes changes to fov etc its their game and their work and buying it doesnt give you the right to change it that would be like buying the mona lisa and wanting to fix her smile because you dont like it its really just whining over entitlement syndrome

before i start with the game well the launch was terrible i was expecting not to be able to log into any serversoften happens on day 1 cant really help itbut the lack of support is what killed me like many other people i couldnt log into the stupid drm to get the online or even offline going couldnt play at all with no help from rockstar after hours and hours of searching the forums i finally found a fix rockstar was no help and didnt even acknowledge the issue fastforward to the steam sale now everyones complaining that rockstar is conning us with their sale tons and tons of negative reviews because they offered a free game or in game money instead of a % discount on a two month old game apparently it was on sale for 30 bucks for 20 minutes before switching to the free gamein game money deal you have to understand that steam messes up sales like today bioshock was a daily deal but was still listed as the normal sale price not the 75% off a few other games had that issue today but it was fixed after about 10 minutes im assuming steam messed up gta5s sale this is probably the most obnoxious conspiracy theory ive ever witnessed and its over the pricing of a video game during a sale put down the pitchforks and find some real activism to be a part of im sure a lot of you are fresh off of getting valve to remove paid mods from steam but this is something completely different you arent entitled to any sale period so dont throw a tantrum if the sale isnt the price you were hoping for and creating a bunch of drama that nobody has any proof of okay onto the game a very fun game to play by yourself or with friends some people are friendly but a lot of people will just kill you on sight you do have the option of going in passive mode which is cool in case you arent looking for pvp and you just want to do your own thing and not worry about dying plenty of pve to do with the missions and hesits and there are also tons of different types of races and deathmatches to participate in as well plus there is a huge map with all different kinds of things to check out all over the place plenty of random non mission stuff you can get yourself into and have a lot of fun with pros amazing graphics there arent really too many hackers like everyone says and if you come across one you can just join a new server anyways tons and tons of content to do and its sandboxy so you can make your own fun without joining any missionsraces etc in game video editor dlc keeps coming they arent done giving out free content great world pvp gives you the choice of auto aimcontrolleror free aim and puts you with players who choose the same style cons no region choices im no racist but its really hard doing heists with people who dont speak your language for the most part everyone looks the same minus differnet clothes and a haircut the character creation isnt that great the field of view in first person mode is really weird and feels awkward and your gun takes up too much of the screen you get penalized money for blowing up other players cars in most circumstances armored car is a bit op but if you dont mind losing 6k you can blow it up pretty easily most people drive around in an armored car so it gets a little boring seeing the same damn cars driving around ill give it a 910 just make sure your pc has the specs to run it and find some friends because people are going to probably rather kill you than be your friend

i have been playing gta since gta 2 so i believe im one of the few who has experienced the complete evolution of this game gta 5 is a great game just like the previous ones 3 new antagonists micheal franklin and trevor are definitely the most exciting and crazy dudes we ever met in the series story is much more exciting new stuff like heists strangers and freaks side missions are great ideas i think vehicles and city modelling is almost perfect and interestingly this time the game gives a lot of political and social messages and try to somehow justify our criminal friends ways it describes their personalities quite successfully throughout the game we get to know michael franklin and trevor which helps the player to choose the ending when we played cj niko or vercetti we knew so little about their characters and many of us havent had any attachments i mean for example i see female players commenting they have a crush on trevor as for the negativities i think the biggest problem is still the police its very easy to get 1 star and it take ages for it to go away you could get police attention in a lot of unrealistic ways such as beating a hiker in the middle of nowhere with nobody sees you the helicopters are endless which is very annoying and if you have more than 3 stars its going to be like cops raining from the sky this problem destroys the game replayibility because after the missions end there really isnt much left to have fun except shooting stuff or doing crazy things then ladies and gentlemen the cops will ruin it for you one of the reasons why i believe ill soon quit playing the game online as well when it comes to online the problem is the people there are tons of modders and hackers there that could ruin the fun creating millions of money and giving to players you could play honestly and try to earn money with heists reach level 50 and boom you will see a level 5 player with 2 more apartments full of high end vehicles and equipment that has taken you weeks to obtain there are players that have godmode or kill you with codes or spawn wherever you respawn overall perfect game minus the replayibility

playing online has a 5050 chance that the server youre playing in has a hacker in it that cant die and can kill everyone in the server at the press of a button but i found one that gave me $50000000 cash so theres that oh yeah and the campaign is amazing

i havent racked up hours on a game this quickly since i first played gmod payday 2 and swtor now that its the summer ill probably be wasting my life on this i like the skill system it reminds me a little of gtasa but not too much just enough that i have fond memories while playing a new game it does have a few issues though unless you are playing with friends waiting for crew members to join your heist can take hours no joke the community of players reminds me too much of codcs just a bunch of s usually weapons and vehicle upgrades take forever to unlock and lastly but not least the flight controls are horrendous on keyboardmouse they should really take notes from just cause 2 imo however the game also has amazing graphics a good story funny characters great stunt jumps fast cars and tons of ways to cause trouble overall id give it an 810

bought it to play online with my friends since i have no interest in the single player personally i can say when it works properly its really fun and worth the buy even if its for online alone it makes my graphics drivers crash from time to time or it freezes and ctd there is a workaround for the driver crash however just set it on dx10 and youll be fine

all of the people who are talking about rockstars shoddy sales practices are out of their minds lets be real here this highly anticipated release on the pc platform made its debut just 2 months ago i wouldnt put my game on sale either and many other game developers also did not choose to participate in the summer sale rockstar went out of their way to do something that they didnt have to do and threw a normally $20 shark card worth $125m in ingame currency in with the purchase of a full price game for the summer sale i encouraged my friends who had not purchased this game to do so now while the shark card was still part of the sale there is nothing wrong at all with what rockstar did yall are just a bunch of greedy gamers with that said over 230 hours ive got in this game over the past 2 months a large majority of that time spent in online mode but ive more recently begun playing through the story mode allows me to make judgement of my opinion of this game of which i opine that the game is incredible rockstar has honestly hit a grand slam with everything theyve done for gta v the car selection and customization is impressive and allows us to express ourselves exactly as we please the world is large and im finding new things about the map every time i play the heists are fun and rewarding however i wish there were more as of when i write this theres only 5 missions are fun to do when you cant find anything else to do and when you get tired of those at least as someone who spends most of their time in online mode you can always fall back on story mode where you can either play through the story or just mess around with the giant open world i plan to put many more hours of gameplay into this especially with all of the free content that rockstar is providing us illgotten gains part 1 just released a week or two ago with insinuation that there will be more installments in the future never change rockstar i expect you to effortlessly continue to impress me

edit rockstars weird behavior continues as i am banned for no reason what so ever no notice nothing banned from single player too no idea why i have been in a lot of lobbys with hackers but i dont know what is going on or anything im not angry just depressed that my 219 hours of grinding and frustration have just been undone for no reason rockstar if you see this rember that you where a good company untill you stalled the release for no good reason  aka fixing the game witch my screen shots show is false   i know there was a lot of hate on rockstar about some bans about mods or something i am not here for that i am here about something else i will be honest i was hyped very hyped so hyped that the moment i heard you could preorder it $50 when it came out i immediately played the intro and then online it was fun until i got my way up to level 50 then the hackers found out how to break the game and i was flooded with them most commonly teleporting around the map this got to the point were i decided i would record all of the scum running around gta v the thing that has  me off the most was one waste of data called rockstar admin he was the worst of them at first i noticed his name and did not like the idea of level one players worshiping him so i set up a max bounty called a mugger and also some mercs for good measure the only things that worked where the mugger and the bounty so i decided that i should probably check up on him on my tv of course this did not work because he turned off spectate witch i found a little odd as most high level players he was level 114 liked to show off their expensive stuff to as many people as they can i then looked at him on the map and saw that he went from the top of the map to the city in 3 minutes and that his character on the map was lagging heavily unlike everyone else i then went to see what was going on as he kept killing the same 3 people over and over again he had a tank on him again i know not hacks but still a  move i helped destroy the tank with the help of a buzzard he then climbed out of the burning hunk of metal and killed me in my kurama again not saying hacks just fishy with a minigun he then killed the rest of the players in his vicinity he then got on a highway getting ran over by 3 trucks 2 cars and 1 suv after 1 minute of this i get my lockon rocket launcher and shoot him he falls off a bridge and then teleports back up and kills me i then go into passive mode watching the endless flow of petty insults and swearing coming from him in chat i then record him get blown to bits from 2 stickys 3 air strikes 1 plane suicide and about a million bullets after this i decided to try to kick this guy and report him so far he has not been banned or anything rockstar please lock computers from running gta v after bans or something as this is getting more common by the day in all i do love this game to bits but i dont think rockstar is not taking hackers as seriously as they should also trying to explain to my friends who did not get gta v what was happening during the drug sequences in single player also is currently broken for me was amusing to say the least

runs great fun game but the only two problems are the control scheme is a little weird and there is slight lag in menus and in windowed mode it tends to open the menu randomly but other than those this game is one of the most fun games ive ever played

 it does not start  steam launches the launcherexe which does close after approx 3 sec & nothing else happens  tested all that i could think off  3 different pcs  2 desktops 1 laptop  tested all the os available  tried 5 different launchers that i found all over the internet tried bunch of system settings disabled all non essential windows stuff enabled all crap as well played with virtual memory ram drive ssd hdd tried integrated graphics nvidia graphics amd graphics tried downloading via steam tried downloading via torrent tried downloading via rockstar social club  tried different monitors tried to create countless accounts with tons of settings tried to disable all non essential hardware tried launching the game via various launchers  gf experience cortex  tried command line bat file  tried to launch the game via wmvare emulated os tried to disconnect all usb devices disabled touchpad disabled keyboard tried all the possible options in nvidia panel did not bother with amd farthest i got launcher kept saying loading for 15 minutes then my mouse started to go slow motion & windows kept doing lot of weird sounds well done either rockstar or steam no wonder that people eventually decide to pirate stuff i mean look at it with steam its self i am forced to create a steam library and then have the game in bunch of subfolders moving the game around is difficult would it be so much to simply let me choose the path where i would install it without the steam library  i believe that all this crap is simply tied up to anti piracy protection but face it 99% of protections attempts have failed and the only people that got punished in the end were  are the ones that decided to pay money for your product perhaps this will never be heard by people that this is addressed to but i will take my mini chance

grand theft auto v is an outstanding title that far exceeds anything that people might call its competitors the grand theft auto series is one that keeps pushing that bar higher and higher with every new release and with gta v there is no exception never in any game have i seen so much detail and effort gone into the game world los santos and the blaine county area are vast spaces that keep on presenting you with stunning levels of detail in both the world and the behavior of the ai the story typically the gta formula remains the same go here kill this guy mission passed with this title theyve put a wild spin on what weve come to expect with that formula and there are many unique missions that involve stealth special vehicles and events that take advantage of the characters special abilities the story invigorates you with a real connection to the protagonists personalities and the integration of all three characters into a single story is an example of true master class writing what makes the story so engaging is the motion capture acting show by each character the animations therefore are very realistic and rockstar have certainly learnt a lot from their time with la noire with the level of detail that we get in the facial areas from the characters as acted by their real life counter parts im never usually a big fan of cutscenes but this game plays them like a real film the on screen interaction is vibrant and realistic which really connects the audience into the story through the needs shown by the characters i wont spoil the story in this review i just recommend that you see it for yourself and pay attention to it because its very rewarding to play in a certain style after seeing how they feel from the cutscene stealth system the stealth system isnt actually that bad its a bit hit and miss but it works the ai have visibility cones  in some missions where stealth is important which indicate their field of vision and as long as you stay out of them and you dont make too much sound indicated by your sound bubble you should be alright the cop ai system works well too ok sometimes they are a little bit too magnetic to the player ie they sometimes know your exact whereabouts when there is now way they can but you can break the line of sight by hiding behind even very thin items which is a bit of a surprise world and ai as ive said there is no competition when it comes to level design the map is huge ive played this game since it came out on potato station 3 and im still discovering new areas of the map if you slow down and explore the world then what youll notice is the bags of satire everywhere nothing in this world is serious but a mockery of the real life counterpart and almost everything you see in game has a source somewhere else on the map a milk bottle has a company name and youll see a hq for that company somewhere their take on social media really plays on a slightly exaggerated version of the american attitude towards it with ingame versions of facebook and instagram that have a key focus when going about your life in ls including integration with the main story line the ai in gta 5 is like no other they are full of surprises amusing stereotypes and some make some pretty intelligent decisions in the game the cops for instance will use shine a torch out of their windscreen if their headlights are out or if you are causing mischief to nearby pedestrians sometimes youll hear them say right im calling the cops see them take out their phone and before you know it the police are there its the little features like that which make the open world feel so realistic and dynamic because who knows how much those ai are capable of youll see hikers at mt chilliad and rich jerks at richman who are all randomly generated using a set amount of areaspecific clothing and facial options available for that area meaning that each day you will see many different people vehicles there are hundreds of them they have been reconfigured a lot since gta iv and they are more user friendly this time around at first i was not happy with how they handled i felt that they were perhaps too easy to control but at this point i can see why theyve done it gta isnt a driving simulator and so it has opted for a system that allows the majority of people to pick it up and just drive without too much effort the vehicles on this version have all been enhance not only with new looks but more appropriate sounds too classic cars sound classic and sports cars sound sporty its sometimes quite nice just to drive around and listen to the sounds of ls and the car itself especially the classic ones theyve captured the raspy exhaust sound that classics tend to have theyve also reintroduced vehicular functions such as forklift operations cargobob helicopter and the tow truck which is nice again these are things theyve added into the missions to try and escape that linear feel pc version and graphics its clear to say that the best version of this game is to be played on pc when you get the game running and overcome any issues youll see an incredibly well optimised game that runs beautifully on mid to highend machines there are of course a multitude of settings to customise how you want your game to run which is quite different to how it was done on previous titles gta iv was a bit of a shambles in this department but fear not in this title as rockstar have learned how to do this from max payne 3 and if that ran well then this will too 60gb is a huge download but as you play the game through you begin to see why i wont bang on about graphics here because its something that youll have to see for yourself but they are very impressive on this version gta online its good it features a leveling system which is put in place to keep you playing but also is a way of making you play to unlock weapons cars planes missions and other expendables money is hard to get hackers already have lots of it and so result to constantly killing you but for those trying to get by on a legitimate basis they can be avoided by passive mode a mode that makes you noninteractive to all other players which represents everyone else as a hologram if you dont like this option you can leave and make a new lobby aside the obvious people problems though the gta online experience is a trimmed version of the game world there are minor details altered online to ease processing from what ive noticed these things include reduced amount of enterable buildings reduced vehicle damage fewer punches to kill people cops kill you and make no attempt to arrest no fast travel taxi no chilliad cable car and the big one everything is more expensive by a lot the money is harder to actually get in the first place and the online world beefs the prices up on everything $50k for a horn $12k for a weapon silencer $25k for bullet proof tyres i suppose it forces players to either do more missions or just end up giving in to microtransactions who knows the missions and races are all good fun though you get money and xp for doing them and even more if depending on how well you do heists are good wont go into that here but they are good fun and give arguably huge payouts why arguably well you could probably spam contact missions and get more money than an entire heist in the time it takes to go through that process but their fun assuming the fact someone doesnt dc near the end or something social club ive had no issues with it it tracks your every breath on both single player and multiplayer including times crashed races won cops killed bullets fired etc so head to their website for some interesting figures its also the only way you can invite players so be sure to check with your steam friends as to what their username is for that

dont buy this game its not worth it story is mediocre and multiplayer is down right unplayable on pc loading times are long enough to make yourself a cup of coffee the whole mp system is unnecesary complex and just wastes your time with stupid menu screens awful matchmaking and etc it says ive played this game for 200 something hours on pc but half of it was looking at the loading screen sitting in lobbys and backing out from one lobby and trying to find another one cause the previous lobby host was a ing  also the game is filled with cheaters and r completely ruined the performance of this game with the last two updates the second update was supposed to clean up after what the first one did but it only fixes the performance in freeroam in heists the game still runs like  you get fps drops from 60 to 20 and what not unplayable rockstar and its attempts at stopping modders is just pathetic they can update their code all they want  wont change a god damn thing oh and for all of this they charge you a full price i hope the people who are reponsible for gta online will never get to make a multiplayer for any game ever again clearly they have no common sense and they dont play their own created piece of  online clients

i am glad that the development team decided to go all out on this port and put themselves in the shoes of their characters watch as they rob you off your money when you realize that this game is as buggy as a rotting corpse you will get problems such as crashing due to failed initialization saving failed  rockstar services are currently unavailable and the classic request timed out then watch them help other companies rob you more off your money by requiring a ridiculous amount of memory that a poor mans 8gb ram cannot handle then if you feel like they havent molested your wallet enough watch them drain the life out of your credit card by selling you ridiculously expensive shark cards that will quickly go down the drain after buying your first high end apartment and luxury car or you can grind your way through the heists which is plagued with glitches random headshots troll eight year olds and lahhhggggggg but hey at least they promised to fix it later right right but if multiplayer is not for you then feel no despair for this game also sports a single player sandbox with an engaging story line you may play as michael de santa an american dude with a disfunctional family and rob people of their money or play as franklin an african american dude with a disfunctional family and rob people of their money but if those two feel too tame for you you may plas trevor philips a crazy canadian dude with no family and rob people of their money feel free to feel anxious about the heists that the game promised the players will be free to do however they choose then feel free to feel betrayed as those heists hold your hand through a scripted set of predictable events that you totally have no control over but if those heists dont do it for you there are fun side activities like parachuting racing and the extremely weird strangers and freaks side missions that feel like they ripped off from saints row annnd there are also some action packed activities like doing yoga towing cars for a living and watching movies by yourself look at all the properties you will only be able to buy at the end of the game when youre finally rich due to the money you get from all your heists unless you play the stocks market watch how rock star teach you how to make it big in the stock market by killing your competition destroying the products of your competition or downloading an app that tells you exactly what time to sell your stocks so join michael trevor and franklin in turning the city of los santos into a hell hole filled with robbery murder mass murder genocide homicide arson torture and drugs or create your own ugly character and join a million other people turn los santos into a hell hole filled with robbery murder mass murder genocide homicide arson drugs and laahhhhggg give us money v oh look im about to finish pacific standard 125m babyyy wait what failed initialization f f f fix this s you shark selling cs c sucking grds

not as great a game as gta san andreas which has much better writing mission design wit music and most other things gta v is designed more to be a makeyourownfun game with the story and missions being more filleresque that doesnt appeal to me as much as having the story be the main affair and made to be awesome i want to be taken on a detailed and exciting adventure not just be given the environment for one and have it be up to me to find something interesting to do with it minigames and freeroaming doesnt compare to scripted storytelling gta v feels like a greatly diminished design from gta san andreas i think that rockstar needs to shift its priorities and not expect to get a free pass on its story quality also with gta v the mission design has the player crisscrossing the map every next mission in the most annoying way in gta san andreas available missions would develop in an area close to the player in gta v the player has to backtrack long distances between each mission and the missions in gta v are bitesized largely deliverytype styled theyre often pretty boring gta san andreas missions are all kinds of different things and theyre pretty well thought out gta v is ok  but if someone wants exciting story and missions gta san andreas is a superior source and i recommend gta san andreas wholeheartedly gta v is pretty mundane in comparison

first of all rockstar lied im running minimum graphics with fps drop with a gtx560 they said the minimum was a gt9800no fcking way anyone who says that the game is really polished is obviously using a monstrous video cardhow many years would it take for a well polished game alright pc version the same game that launched 3 years ago but now it costs 4x moreyaay seriously oh im running it on my titan z and it looks amazing cool not everyone can pay for a top notch pc so anyone that didnt spend a fortune on a computer maybe didnt get half what the ps4 version gavethat if the game actually works and you can log in the servers with no issue wich is a 35% chance the campaignsame thing that you played 3 years ago online i was excited to see how it would be i thought it would be awesome its crap so far ive bought a house that people camp right outside with everything you can imagine ive been sniped bombed exploded many many times trying to get out of the house i have even seen tanks and jets theremy apartment is a  war zone what you can do in gta online well lots of things a useless rally race a boring deathmatch were someone has better guns and kills everyone a weird air race wich is the best thing to do bikecarbicycle races were lagg and s always ruins the race heists where you can never earn anything because that random guy will always screw the entire thing or you can roam around and explore waiting for some troll to find you and kill you for no reason at all damn so fun and just to add never play with someone from ign expecially timmerman he is stupid offends other players for no reason and rages all the time and is clearly a bad sport and a troll but guess what you cant report him and he will never be put on the bad sport session  want to troll rage kick ban leave and more without consequences join ign today

really dont see why people are complaining about this not being on sale during the monster sale this was just released and most new releases dont get discounted during steam sales they did extend the extra ingme money with the shark cards which isnt a bad thing this is a fantastic game that the pc community waited a very long time for rockstar did an incredible job of optimizing this and it looks and plays great even on lower end pcs singleplayer is really fun with a great story and with 3 main characters it never gets dull online does have its challenges with the assorted griefers out there but if it gets annoying you can always find another session or even play solo in the online campain and still be able to level up and make money only complaint i have is sometimes it does get a little laggy online but its torrerable big thanks to rockstar for finally bringing this to the pc if your a gta fan this is a must buy if you never played a gta game before this is a good one to get you hooked on the series highly recommended

despite its absolutely abhorrent single player campaign which gta is quite good at making horrid story modes the multiplayer is really the redeeming quality of it all after you finish the sleep inducing intro to the story and are able to save i recommend jumping right into multiplayer where the fun is really at i have spent almost all my time in multiplayer from the moment i could get away from the nightmare that is single player if you want a good story driven experience then i recommend going to saints row where you can create your own character and really play the a fun and funny story looking for an amazing sandbox coop or pvp if that is your thing game for you and your mates i suggest you pick this up immediately despite the bad single player i give it a 910

great addition to the gta series it doesnt matter if you want to play solo or online if you liked the previous games youll like this one i recommend doing research online about how to make money and various other tips before playing online playing online can seem a little overwhelming but once you figure out how things work it is very fun and rewarding
recommended
it is a fun game and is basically all around enjoyable the only problem i have had is the fact of other players being quiters during a heist or just being a  and killing everyone thinking that they are awsome but do recommened

grand theft auto is a very safe card for rockstar at least when it comes to the console versions of each game everyone knows what to expect and people are rarely disappointed this time we even got a gta that performed well on pc which shouldnt be a surprise given the time it took before we could get our hands on it however now we have to spend half our playtime yes im exaggerating watching loading screens partly because they refused to give the game a simple main menu rockstar could easily have made a better solution than the one we got but it doesnt seem they wanted to overall i recommend gta v because despite all the loading times it is still a lot of fun

unauthorized copying reverse engineering transmission public performance rental pay for play or circumvention of copy protection is strictly prohibited just in case you know you didnt see it the first time there and so if youre buying the game for no reason other than to mod it you are probably going to be disappointed and that will likely remain the case for just about any other title just because its coming out on pc doesnt mean there will be open and free mod support for all who buy in but they had mods for gta iv that was then this is now welcome to the next generation there are some of us like myself who waited patiently for rockstar to release this game for pc and are digging in to the experience with glee as it is all fresh content for anyone who hasnt played a gta title since iv was released in 2008 literally hundreds of hours of content ive played the game for 62 hours in 2 weeksand im only just scratching the surface still scratching while the hackers and modders huff and puff about rockstars desire to keep their intellectual property well theirs i trust that they dont want to ignore the potential of the modding community that surrounds gta for pc but as it stands the games singleplayer and multiplayer interface in a certain way very interchangably and that is a major impasse for modders as they are basically handing out the very tools that allow cheaters to do what they do i sympathize for anyone who received a ban for just using mods in singleplayer but a few bad apples will always ruin a good time for the lot and this is a great opportunity to sit back think about it and consider how to approach your game time in a manner that not only sustains great games but treats your fellow players the developers the publishers and everyone else with the respect that you know you want to be treated with too i hope rockstar made themselves clear with this statement as i honestly would not mind one bit if the escalation of this punishment is a permanent ban clearly i have nothing to worry about why should you

negative reviews for justified bans welcome to the steam community most people complaining are cheaters also if you want mods go play arma or whatever

okay so i thought i would write this reveiw after seeing the hacker garbage bad reveiws posted everywhere gta 5 is online in any online game hackingmoding is considered cheating you sined an agreement when you first loaded your dam game not to cheat or mod whats the big deal if a desinger wants their game played the way they made it this game play awsome has amazing updated grapics 100 times better then the consol version dont listen to the script kiddies who are all rageing on here this game is amazing just dont cheat and i do bleive moding and online game where theere is copetive gameing raceing shooting excetra is cheating you are give yourself and advantage over another player hope the bans sting i saw a guy walking around last night asking folks to shoot him money if they have the hack wtf enjoy your bans kiddies

wow holy fkn wow wtf is wrong with you people there is literally nothing shady about what rockstar did they are not greedy corporate fat cats trying to con their pc customers out of their hardearned money if any of you actually even glanced at the bundles being offered as part of the summer sale rather than just regurgitating the mindless uninformed braying of the masses because its trendy right now you would see that rockstar is actually going out of their way to participate in the summer sale even though the game has only been out for 2 months and cant really be offered at a discounted price they didnt raise the price of the game to create the illusion of a sale and rob us all the game is simply not on sale because sane business practices dictate that it cant be yet but in an effort to once again show their support for the pc community theyre offering new customers a free great white shark card thats 125 million gta$ a $20 value which is a wonderful head start in the online mode rockstar even anticipated that some gamers wouldnt care about free gta$ so they offered not one but two additional bundle options where new customers can get an older r aaa title and still get some gta$ all at no extra cost they didnt have to do any of this just like they didnt have to put so much extra work into making the pc version of their game the ultimate version they could have simply released a version identical to currentgen console versions with 4k support and it still wouldve been a top seller i see a lot of you posting that you are done with r and that you wont be buying any future r releases as you add to the cacaphony of pathetic herdmentality whining and zealous false accusations based on someone elses unfounded opinion that even if it had merit does not negate the fact that this is one of the greatest video games ever created however i dont think youll even have to worry about following through with your threats and angry promises because there is no way r will be releasing the definitive version of their future games on pc well be lucky to even see half ports after the utter lack of gratitude or appreciation theyve received from you clowns with your overdeveloped senses of entitlement and complete inablitliy to think for yourselves yuck you should all be ashamed of yourselves that being said why the  sucking  are hackers still running rampant in gta online this issue is not a minor nuisance rockstar gta online is nothing short of broken and totally unplayable until this madness is resolved and since online is almost inarguably the 1 reason to buy this game this should absolutely be your top priority who cares about dlc releases if you cant even play the game if gta v has to lose all support for communitycreated modscontent for the time being so be it if the current wielder of the r banhammer is too timid to do what needs to be done hand it off to someone who is not afraid to teach these hacker fools a thing or two about a thing or two rules is rules for fks sake unless of course theyre not in which case you should just say so so us few remaining honest players can stop waiting for a return to the good ol days and try to scrape some enjoyment out of joining the lawless freakshow madhouse that the sandbox of los santos has become with modstrainers of our own i suppose since this should technically be a review of the game and not a rant i should mention that even the lastgen version of both online and single player receive a 1010 from me with all of the improvements extra layers of polish and additional content that the pc version brings to the table the only suitable rating prehacker plague or posthacker purge mind you is masterpiece even if youve already put hundreds of hours into this game on a lastgen console like i did i still highly recommend you buy it on pc as well especially if your rig allows you to turn on all the bells and whistles in the graphics settings bravo rockstar youve truly outdone yourselves this time thanks for the love and the awesome game

this game was hyped a year before release we had very high hopes the game surpassed our hopes and i have trouble finding another game doing such a thing an amazingly well crafted story that takes in the divine setting of los santos with smooth game play and a even smoother experience said smoothness is slightly roughened up by the online servers but i can look past that i love this game and everything about it especially the story holy  the story is better than the sex i dont have with my wife because i dont actually have one if i did the sex would be below par compared to this story this game made me feel actual feelings for someone who water boarded burned and ate multiple people 1110 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvibduhpr0h0

i have spent $60 pre ordering max payne 3 before it was released i spent $60 us on gta 5 i have never played either game and most likely i never will the problem i have isnt with the games per say it is with the rock star social club which is a fancy way of saying always online drm with a lot of snazzy social features at some point i must have logged onto my steam acccount at a close friends house and now somehow in a way that only rock star can explain my steam account is linked to his rockstar social club account that means that when i try to launch many of rockstars games i get one of two different errors depending on the game both errors can only be fixed by submitting tickets with many screenshots serial numbers and screen shots of serial numbers in my life i have bought 1000s of games many with very restrictive drm in my life i have also only submitted tickets on mmos i have neither the time nor the patience to waste more time other than the hours of research i have wasted on the internet looking into this issue than i already have i wont be submitting a ticket so that rockstar can be convinced i am not attempting to pirate their triple a multi billion dollar franchise i would rather spend my time playing any of the hundreds of games i currently have access to their drm if they have any is not so restrictive that their customer service gets overwhelmed when they launch a product and or patch a product this seems to be a problem only rockstar and ubisoft have

what can you say its mf gta v why are you reading this go play it if you havent yet now for the rest of us who have purchased and already enjoyed this game on a console but are pondering is this worth it no f no youve already played this game so unless you get lucky and catch it on sale this game will never be worth the money if youve already bought it once in my opinion this is simply an ingenius preplanned scheme of rockstars to turn the success of v into a sort of crowdfunding exercise for their next titles now cynicism aside should you still do it to treat yourself probably chances are my reader if you thinking about it then youre thinking about it for the same reasons that i did end game graphics for all versions of vso far and yes they are something to enjoy especially in first person on the pc features not seen in even newer console versionsdont quote me but i think someone mentioned to me wildlife or something is beefed up for the pc version for one example seems like it compared to ps3 at least but then so is everything else as mentioned above but worth its own spot first person mode real game changerobviously for the title and especially if youre like me and went from ps3360 to pc the first person mode of the game is unique for what it is and a great addition to the game that really does warrant at least borrowing the title from someone to play it again all in first person finally i have to mention multiplayer multiplayer along with the modding community can not be challenged on the pc it is an entirely different beast of a game once youre able to just type a message to another player for example in a heart beat so not only is it far more convienent than the console counterparts of the game but from my experience so far it is way more stable probably just due to a pc running it and performsloads a lot smoother as well in short the experience online is not just a frusterating mess that im so used to i actually have to remind myself not to bother going for a coffee break when im joining a friends map performance wise as well compared to gta ivs history this game shows none of the same symptoms that plauged ivs enjoyability factor it looks great runs great and i havent had it crash or lock up on me onceyet i can also confirm that on both atinvidia bit older and brand new components the above statement holds true oh and in case your wondering when you transfer your character over it clones them from your old console you can still go back and play with friends just nothing crosses over progress wise between different platforms once youve transferred

so far this game is excellent my desktop can handle this on maximum settings without an issue this is much better optimised in comparison to gta iv would i recommend this game yes what would i rate it a 1010 for the game how could it improve personally i feel that money is a bit hard to come by online unless doing heists i would love for the income from jobs mission ect to be slightly increased as this would allow it to be a little less stressful and time consuming ive been playing the game with my friend today and the game runs perfectly we did have an issue yesterday though where we spent 2 hours trying to enter a session together but it kept saying connection lost or something of the like with the new update which is pretty cool as some of the ui has been changed to be a bit more user friendly im not sure if its been fixed but we could get into a game together and we had a bunch of fun escaping police doing races and missions together overall this game is brilliant but i would like rockstar to be mod friendly as ive read that a lot of people have been banned just for small tweaks like fov mods if it was like gtasa where mods were allowed online this game would be perfect

another rock solid rockstar release  requires social club to play crashes almost immediately on launch  yeap  glad i paid for this   update the launch of this game was appalling huge amounts of different causes for crashes and different bugs causing eg incredibly sluggish fps on default settings the apparently needed mobile app still doesnt support pc a couple of days after launch the only official answer ive heard is that if you use anything but az az and 09 in your user account name they suggest you create a new user account which is ridiculous in itself some of the other causes for crashes have been solved by the community and eg on reddit you can find a decent list of suggestions however there still seem to be a lot of people for whom none of the suggested solutions work i finally managed to get myself into the game the crashes at launch seemed to have been caused by  my microphone disconnecting my blue yeti before launch got the game to launch and i could reconnect it once i was in the menu without it causing the game to crash again after managing to get into the game the gameplay turned out to be very good much more fun than i hoped for but still leaves room for improvement on the controls side the controls are incredibly complicated pretty much every key on the keyboard has some function assigned to it and the hints for using them are briefly flashed at the top left corner the first time you need it thus its easy to also miss it and get stuck trying to look for what key is for eg going into cover while the game has a lot of promise i cannot with good conscience recommend this to anyone until they fix their   this might take a month it might never happen ill try and remember to update this if that ever happens

so here i was expecting the game of a decade then after a 60 gb download with the anticipation mounting bam the thing doesnt get past the decodingupdating screens i demand a refund for this it isnt early accses and its one year late this is outragous either fix the damn bugs or dont bother i want my hard earned money back in my pocket youve already ruided this customers satisfaction dont do it for others ive tried well over 100 times to launch the game and tried these solutions to the windows account error to no effect

been waiting for this for a long time but i have to say that this time it disappointed me despite the numerous beautiful 4k screen shots of gta v thats been released earlier you might have gotten hyped for this game like me but after several developemnt delays the result is that the graphics are not even up to par with watch dogs which has been downgraded a lot since ive played ps4 version for awhile it is easy for me to say that the console version looks much better maybe i need a better graphics card or cards and a 1440p 144hz monitor rather than a single gtx 770 gpu and a cheap 1080p 60hz monitor build to fully immerse myself in this game but this time i only wish steam has refund policies because i cant see myself spending hours on this game getting distracted by those jagged lines and mozaiclike textures

launcher crashes all over the place for many users if you submit a ticket to rockstar they send back a confirmation email containing a link to your ticket what happens if you click that link the page doesnt exist good to know that this common issue is being resolved ps my windows username is alphanumeric thats not the issue

figured out how to launch it turns out the driver update specifically made for the game causes the launcher to crash but forget that still cant play it rockstars sht tier drm couldnt stop my key from being stolen guess ill be staring at the social club screen instead of playing the game nice job rockstar glad to see you have your priorities straight

dont like rockstars sales tactics find it a little unethical to raise the price on a game right before the summer sale dont buy from rockstar anymore just because they did something bad doesnt give you the right to pirate grand theft auto v or any other rockstar game for that matter pirating rockstar games because youre mad makes you a piece of sht either buy the game or dont but dont think you can tell rockstar to fck off and then still get to enjoy gta v you entitled little cnts it fcking disgusts me that the pc master race has fallen so low youre all behaving like a bunch of fcking console peasants

why the hell do you have to have social club when its so bad i cant even start the game because it keeps crashing on startup because this social club crap just wont work what were you guys doing in that one year delay i thought you were fixing it polishing it up this is just terrible

wait a few days to buy this game unless you want to have to deal with all the bugs crashes and all around  that you have to deal with like redoing the tutorial 10 times because of game crashes or having max frames then all of a sudden the game crashes due to a fatal error with no number code

1010 perfect but i feel the city should have more options with the buildings cuz it hasnt updated much since 2013 anyways i want to say im not dissing rockstar did a great job on this game i preordered and felt that it wasnt worth it because the setbacks were a lot but its still made me jump out the window and yell gta v is out i loved the hiests this game is great funny and realisitc just the antisemitc thing mountzonah hospital that should be changed also a little bit less racism towards minoritys the strip club wasnt as good as i thoght it would be lap dances s dont look realisitc try online hiests wow just wow for the first time you can get  done on multiplyaer and have more fun than ever if you like dark humor guns gangsters classic guys old music vechicles and military  also blowing  up than this game is for you 1010 for hookers

this is a really awesome game and i am recomending it to everyone i know i love this game other than it doesnt run very great on my laptop but other than that it is amazing

who dosn`t love gta v it`s impossible the game is made for everyone you can drive fast cars go and rob a bank and so much more the game has also a extreme graphic and it will get better you can also connect a playstation or and xbox controller to you pc and use it for this game it makes it much easyer to play the game the only negative thing with this game is that rockstar won`t allow us to mod it so it`s getting harder to mod but i think this game is a 9510
recommended
do not buy this game lucky for me i preordered it and got a refund quickly it is a broken mess this is nothing new for rockstar though and now theyve banned people for using mods including me thanks rockstar you never cease to amaze me truly you guys are consumer friendly and not to mention mod friendly

now i am recommending this to people with pc that are built for gaming i tried this on two computers my laptop and my gaming pc graphics great for gaming pcs this has possible great graphicstextures on a great pc sadly for user on laptop sorry but youre out of luck until rockstar wants to update the game on my pc the map loaded fine occasional lag for a sec to reload the map amazing game for pc on my laptop geez talk about badgame occasionally crashes when trying to loadin fact crashes more than often the map will try to reload several times while you drivingmovinglooking out for your apartment see the thing is that they made a game without a low or very low setting maybe take away bushes gates certain details that just generally make it to hard for a laptop to work gameplay story mode overall gameplay of story mode is great being able to switch from characters and characters having different abilities being able to buy cars you love and just mess around playablity after the story okay i guess side missions and stuff to do afterward still can do whatever you want after the story is finished that is about it gameplay online great fun challenging gta online takes the best aspects of the story mode and puts them into multiplayer own garages cars tanks planes weapons etc being able to fully customize vehicles guns your character multiplayer is a struggle though inorder to keep up with certain stuff such as rentinsuranceammoclothingetc overall as a conclusion pc gaming computer is the best laptoplower end pcs is the worst

alot of you guys are complaining about getting banned for using mods i dont have any sympathy for you ive been enjoying the game without using mods the graphics are far beyond what the ps4 or xbone is capable of almost any modern computer can play this game the storyline is incredible best story of any video game ive ever played online gameplay is super fun grabbing an insurgent with a 50 cal on the top and rekting sum knobs with your wolfpack couldnt be any funnier this game gave me cancer a good kind of cancer cant wait for more heists keep up the good work rockstar

not sure what the rants are about summer sale but i personally think the campaign was great online is a little iffy because theres tons of people rdming for absolutely no reason at all then theres the cheaters the people who ruin the game for others and somehow find it fun or funny to do so all in all this game is great if you plan to play campaign and then play a bit of online

people are way overreacting about the how steam sale thing base game  125m online for $60 is actually pretty good i will say however that not decreasing the price of the base game is stupid overall in my opinion one of the greatest games ever created

well obviously reddit has been here please ignore all the people who are claiming rockstar is being shady anyone with eyes can see that none of that  is true beyond the nonsense though this is a great game one of the best ive ever played its funny how all these people have over 100 hours on the game yet they wont recommend it because rockstar didnt lower the price during a summer sale talk about feeling entitled look at it this way if these people have put over 100 hours then i bet they had a good time playing it and they paid the exact same price that you will be paying which is 60 dollars so no rockstar is not being shady in fact they are offering you more bang for you buck with the deals basically free in game cash and a free game how is that shady

yeah yeah if you mod the game then you get in trouble this is the case in almost every multiplayer pvp game that exists so welcome to reality with all the complaints against hacking it is no wonder that they are strict about this for those of you who dont mod please read on the single player game is very entertaining and has awesome dialog and stories the multiplayer is ten times better than the single player if you have some friends to play with not sure about if your solo but if you are solo and play multiplayer get into an active crew asap my group of friends have been playing this game every night pretty much and having a blast doing missions and raising hell in the city i wish i had played the other gta games never knew how much fun these were

made pc gamers wait two years and pay $60 and the game runs like  1010 in detail the game is extremely vram hungry and has a few settings that eat up almost all the vram leaving no room for anything else making anybody with 2 gb or less vram play with ps3grade textures and minimal render distance if you do turn it up to high settings you will get 60 fps but with a lot of frame drops and if anything explodes or shoots at something the game will lock up until everything is over in conclusion overpriced poorly optimized overall the technicals of this game are very poor  you rockstar edit it appears that the game has a memory leak issue right now i will stick by my opinion until the leak is fixed

buy this at your own risk looks like almost all of the negative reviews are from people who cannot even play the game due to social club errors im currently still not able to launch the game after hours trying the possible fixes still no response on this issue from rockstar after more than 12 a day i rarely preorder and i sure do regret this one

pretty good game

i literally cannot even play the game i meet the system requirements i preloaded and went through the preallocation download and unpacking of the additional day 1 stuff i made a new administative user using the rockstar approved characters i updated my nvidia graphics card to the new gta v recommended driver i installed the latest rockstar social club version i verfied the game cashe i run steam as an administator and every damn time when i click play or play online my little blue icon turns green for about 45 seconds posts that i am in game and then turns blue again i would love to give the game a good rating but its kinda hard when i cannot even play the game after spending 3 hours after launch trying to get it to even run

one of the best ports for me so far since i have a constant 30fps on 4k with everything maxed out only msaa is off since well 4kdont need it anymore with an old titan one 4k and smooth 30fps what else is there to say i first played it when it came out on ps3 witch gave me eye cancer now i see the full potential of this game as it looks damn beautiful and has so many details that one could roam around without doing missions but just exploring this peace of art  well one could also the ego persp is a huge deal its very well craftd with different feels to motorcycles cars and walkingrunning combined with the details and the enhanced graphics this is my game of the year again 
recommended
rockstar has done an amazing job on this they did what they said its incredible 10010 edit pc is the ultimate way to enjoy this game especially with the added first person feature i owned it on xbox 360 back when gta v was first released completed it then sold my xbox you notice straight away how silky smooth it is compared to consoles i get between 45  50 fps on a asus 7950 3gb with a i5 2500k @ 33ghz to sum it up great gameplay excellent visuals and a unforgettable story at least in my opinion highly recommended

refunded im sure the game itself is great but the launch was not its not to late to get a refund if its not working for you

hahawell overhyped 2k graphics are good i guess however they feel way too similar to gta iv the gameplay is very stiff it doesnt feel dynamic like the physics are bad actors unconvincing at best the start of the game at least is riddled with crappy cutscenes i got so bored of them that i didnt bother with missions after the prologue i just went rogue in the huge sandbox world i wouldnt recommend it at all at this price and i will never ever have hopes of a game as good as san andreas from rockstar ever again thumbs up on the first person though oh and the best part the best graphics and physics are found in the citys cats yes the cats are highly realistic unlike most other parts of this game

the game does nothing but run silently for a few seconds then crash without any output  not even an error message this seems to be a case where having special drm was more important than the game actually being able to run on a customers computer buyer beware edit an upgrade of nvidia graphics card drivers to a version released after the review was written solved the problem still the main point stands shoddy software enineering and problem was caused by the unneccessary drm component rockstar social club

i waited through the entire gta 5 console crash of 2013 dealing with the entire shhole show of online i waited with antisipation for the pc release knowing that i would enjoy it more and save more by using it on my pc over a console the day came today where downloading it was crap installing it was sh signing in to rockstars really nessissary social fart club to gain all my features crashed the game having to read that they found a issue on the release day that for some reason leaves the game unplayable because of the admin name i mean wtf how do you not notice that on nearly every pc that somehow ran past every single dev at the production facility and again having issues merging accounts because my account was locked after 2 i mean two attempts and then a reset i know for sure that at least steam has the right idea by offering a refund i am only taking it because i dont wanna wait another 6 months for rockstar to understand their problems and fix them i will say after another 6 months i will purchase the game again to get the full set of features i shouldve recieved on day one i will say not to buy the game just yet only so rockstar can fix their peice of sh they call the gta 5 experience see you in six months make a game that doesnt have such a big mistake you somehow overlooked after seeing all the money glitches on pc that can be avoided easily maybe i will torrent the game in a few weeks to see if i should support the company who once again produced a game that failed at launched just as much as the first time they released im suprised that they somehow skipped the near perfect release of the newer gen systems that went off far better than the older consoles i dont want to support a company who doesnt learn from their mistakes now for the people who actually got the game working i heard it was great but as a service to me and the other perople who are having issues please tell them that even though it may work its not gaurenteed to work for all now on the bright side it is a posssible 60 fps and 4k game that is what the team wanted and will include heists as well as all the other included dlc this makes the game good the specs to run the game at those quality is rather lower than what you would nomally think i also are planning to get the game later because im building a pc that can handle it better than my current labtop that runs most games at a good balance of quality and preformance the game if it works will not fail to impress anybody but i want to be clear of its current faults but i cannot forget that it really states notice some customers are experiencing issues installing or playing gtav due to a windows user account name error click here for details on how to workaround the issue wtf who doesnt notice the elefant in the room i guess th people who built a default pc to test their game contraz rockstar you lost a customer who was supported of this game who waited since day one of prepurchasing just to produce te same mistake fool me once shame on me fool me twice shame on you ill be waiting

ive restarted steam and my pc my game is already preloaded and unpacked and activated on the social club and when i hit play it starts the grand theft auto vexe process but theres no game running after 2030 seconds it just crashes with the usual grand theft auto v has stopped working social club prompts me to restart in safe mode which only does the same thing i didnt pay $60 so i can enjoy not playing the game on release day i would have been better off pirating it instead of buying it legitimately apparently since then i would have been able to actually play it on release day

for everyone saying they rasied the price you are completely incorrect and need to actually take a look and not listen to what your friends have too say its 25% off with a great white shark card or basically the same price as the actual game just with a gift card to help you start your bank account on online the seperate game is actually below that and is priced separately please read the prices before you post  reviews overall games amazing 10  10

day one day fricken one doesnt work i would say this is unexpected but that would be a lie considering the issues the xbox version had my problem with this one is that year after a game has been out and you know they know what is required to get this up and running countless delays and 4 months sitting on preorder now its telling me my code doesnt work the game i have payed full price for not once but twice is telling me moment one of release that my damn cd key doesnt work brilliant so now i have to wait for support to uncrash itself which is going to easily be a week worth the time i would ask for a refund right damn now so i can buy it again but it appears that the social club also went ahead and deleted my everything so overall pretty much history repeating itself buy this game at your own risk a smart man would wait till they actually get this game fixed you know after the third ^%$ing time its been released

a few gamers worldwide have had an experience with the grand theft auto franchise at some level whether its from the birdseye point of view perspective to the current industry trend that is first person this franchise has definitely taken a couple of years of my life from the franchise debut to gta 5s pc release excluding gta 2 and gta chinatown wars unfortunately ive put countless hours into this series and enjoyed each and every sociopathic moment story spoilers  micheal townl i mean desanta franklin clinton and trevor tp industries phillips are the protagonists which brings variety to the gameplay with the new character switching feature a delightful addition in contrast to the previous one man army formula shouts out niko bellic it gives a thrilling dynamic to missions and the opportunity to use each character to their strengths and ability micheal with his max payne style slowmotion gun play franklin with his ronin driving skills and trevor with his super saiyan rage where he can mow down whoever or whatever has a pulse micheal is your slightly beyond middleaged early retired bank robber turnt aspiring family man living with the odd midlife crisis franklin the youngster of the trio is your everyday gang affiliate  car thief with an above average potential with something to prove not forgeting he also has a dog named chop trevor on the other hand hes something else id say that hes more nuts than your local peanut factory frankly hes the type of crazy that begs for the lethal injection i do feel a touch of guilt considering that hes almost my favorite gta protagoninst of the series victor vance baby so micheal is in debt to the boss of the mexican drug cartel with his and his beloved families necks at risk he needs cash a sexy amount of money at that so long early retirement hello heat the movie the video game its time to run some heists the heists are easily the strongest elements in the story including lamar with his punch lines gameplay  the world that rockstargames has created is phenomenal with stunning attention to detail a world that is seemingly living the sense of immersion and atmosphere is superb the map is fair in size from the dence city to the sprawling mountains various wildlife vast ocean and desert los santos is a joy to explore at your disposal are a number of vehicles from the all new submarine helicopters planes boats cars motorbikes and bicycles extending to indepth customisation options such as vehicle mods weapon mods clothing barbers and tattoos there is a whole host of content on offer here that extends the gamplay value however i am slightly disapointed by gta 5s car handling something seems a little bit off in comparision to gta 4s driving mechanics which were in my opinion vastly superior the first person mode after tinkering with the sensitivity settings enchances the gun play giving the missions an added replay value im thouroughly enjoying driving in first person with fully functional speedometers exploring the world as well as when visiting certain gentlemens clubs huh hmm the lspd los santos police department are hyper realistic in many ways although are more than a bit sensitive to your criminal activity when youre in isolated no witness areas like a mountain top the music selection is on the weaker side in contrast to that in gta 4 the lab which is the pc exclusive radio station is a decent addition performance many graphical options are availible that are on par with the excellent pc version of max payne 3 gta 5 has kept up to standard texture quality shadows ambient occulsion ect im having solid performance of 40 to 60 fps with all options set to high on my 2gb radeon r9 270x for me coming from the ps3 version which considering its hardware was solid to the pc release its pretty veredict story  75100 gameplay  100100 sound  90100 graphics 95100 overall  95100

while i cannot really compare how this plays compared to the 360ps3 or even the newer xbox 1ps4 versions i can tell you that if you have a decent pc read that as at least minumum specs it looks and plays wonderfully ive had several of my friends whom i have managed to turn to pc gaming from consoles remark at how they honestly wished they had waited and played this version first since it is so superior to any other that they have played so far as for problems i havent had any crashes and just a few times when exiting it would hang right before closing it hasnt happened recently so it was probably adressed in one of the patches for the people that have no end of problems im thinking it is more they need to do a fresh reinstall of windows since it is probably old loose files and such causing problems instead of the game itself being broken or horrible my big suprise was that i am enjoying the online mode so much i knew it sounded pretty fun from what id read but i was figuring on playing the story mode through and then playing around with online when i got to it instead i played the story mode until it suggested that i might want to try out online created a character that looks amazingly like myself and now im enjoying making my own story as i go along while there are bad parts about the online the good far outweighs the bad the main bad parts i would be talking about would of course be the people that seem out to ruin everyone elses fun but thankfully they seem to get kicked to the bad sports pool pretty quick the other for me would be the connection problems which have gotten better but still are there on the good side is when you manage to pull off something amazing which is fun but now youll probably have someone with you who is complimenting you for pulling off the amazing thing you just did

ive had one hell of a time on this game this game is one hell of a masterpiece i loved every single bit of the game except for that one mission where jimmy tries to sell that boat that one part where they were going back to micheals that part where jimmy tries to be like black in a way but franklin was like psh what does this kid thinkin the story is new and fresh unlike previous gtas where its about drug dealing and stuff like that it sorta has that but in the mix of heists and 3 characters to play as its a great port and you should buy it full price of $60 theres so much to do in this game

amazing game stuning visuals good performance aside some memory leak problems and an amazing story the only downside is rockstar decision to ban mods and everyone thats using them i know that some people are cheating but banning people that are using harmless mods only on singleplayer wont solve the problem rockstar need to isolate the singleplayer mode and them ban the mods there not on singleplayer i will have to cast a negative vote on the game edit  rockstar spoke about the mods ad its perfectly ok to use them in singleplayer so i will change my vote to postive

i have returned to the world of grand theft auto after about 5 years away and boy am i pleased to be back it has been such a long wait for this title but to be honest it was worth the wait first off if you dont have a decent graphics card i am afraid you will have to stump up the cash to get one secondly you do need a decent pc to run this as this isnt your second grade port from a console  a lot of work has gone into the pc version of this game and it does show as i have a 360 controller connected to my pc it has been very useful however there are very few hints to help you master the controls from the start of the game you have to fumble around and experiment for a little bit to ensure you know what to do and how to do it when the time calls for it it took a few goes on the first level of the single player part of the game to get used to the controls however once you master the controls on a gaming pad it is a very engaging game and it really does pay dividends the single player version of the game is incredibly engaging  you can play a number of different characters and work your way up the ranks just like any gta game the cars are beautiful and the ai characters are wonderfully unpredictable i do like the way you can stumble into a fight or pickpocket and you can save the day it is great and you do feel part of the gta world the story keeps you hooked and the way you can interract with the other characters is fully rewarding the multiplayer part of the game can be a bit hit or miss you join servers with people from all over the world and you can see other players stutter across the map however once you find a good server you can either join various missions and games or you can explore the gta world and shoot the other players that have joined once you work your way up the ranks more things are unlocked and you can do various other things the multiplayer version of the game is really geared up for players to connect and help each other you can join gangs and cause a lot of chaos to wrap up this review a lot of issues that pc gamers may have could be related to inferior pcs or operating systems but to be honest i have had very very few technical issues with this game it is a solid console port and i am really glad that i waited for rockstar to deliver a fantastic game which i will enjoy in years to come

even with my 5 year old radeon hd 6950 2gb card this is still amazing pros in 1080p even without aa or any advanced stuff this game looks great with my extremely old card i can get 3745fps averaging 43fpsish game is better than ever with mouse and keyboard cons the account integration is horrible when you get this game make sure that you have the right rockstar account all sorted with a username you like and with any previous version data on it such as from ps3 your account will be permanently linked to your steam account unless you do some  ass support ticket and your game will permanently be linked to your rockstar account i do not like this drm crap at all and i ended up using the wrong rockstar account because i couldnt be bothered to wait for their support this shouldnt cause you any problems if youre not an idiot like me but be warned
recommended
currently 910 some users are having issues with rockstar drm and slow downloads so steam version seems the better choice for downloading the actual game the drm allows for character transfers and is required the game itself is very fun has good optimization for highend or lowmid builds cpu phenom ii x4 970 at 39 ghz gpu sapphire 6950 8 gb ram i get 60 fps inside most buildings but 3040 while driving at 1080p at normal settings and fxaa currently has bugs some are minor while some cause frequent crashes d3d error memory leak albeit slow leak for some and fps stutter for some online the d3d error was fixed for me by reinstalling beta drivers for vcard then every couple days its bugs out again reinstall then its fixed easily could be a 1010 if online ran smoother between stuttering and how job system should back out to the lobby instead of kicking to free roam if someone leaves during a heist but overall it is a great game and hopefully the bugs get worked out

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

i will give it reccomended when they allow graphic mods update 5715 they have given an official statement which ign covers here httpwwwigncomarticles20150507grandtheftauto5pcmodsgetsealofapprovalfromrockstargames basically nothing has changed except they wanted to officially state that they support mods and the creative process that modding requires however they go on to say that users should be careful of using mods online what does this mean if you want to mod you can do it in single player only if you want to go online you have to unistall your mods i understand why but i dont know how i feel about that the game content is good and so i will change this to reccomended only because if someone were looking to get this game without mods or with mods but only single player it would be a good purchase

you will not get banned for mods in an official statement rockstar has stated that they support mods the bans are only in gta online while you still run the risk of mods leaking over and getting banned even while not using them if you do not launch gta online with mods installed you will be fine link httpwwwrockstargamescomnewswirearticle52429askedansweredtherockstareditorgtaonlineupdatesutm_sourcetwitter&utm_mediumsocial&utm_contentaskedandanswered&utm_campaignasked_05072015

ive rewritten this review a hundred times now following gtas updates rockstar has fantastic with the game itself you can run it on a potato and it will still look decent they have been reshaping the game based on player reviews etc and even though they did wait 2 years for a port among other things the game is still going great and will continue to have new content
recommended
turns out the whole banning thing was people lying game is fun
recommended
while this is gta were talking about the fact that rockstar is going out of their way to stop modding makes it so that i simply cant recomand this edit news has come out that modding should be allowed in single player hearing this i have decided to change my recomendation gta v is a great game and hopefully modding in singleplayer can make it a perfect one
recommended
pretty good worst game ever ruinined my life
recommended
everything is perfect but the online the reason because i got the game is a  plenty of problems and i hope that we can have mods in online mode editted mods offline  bans in gta online wtf rockstar pls dont buy this  and the problems with online lags bugs etc

first it wont launch into the launcher so i disable my nvidia video card  and it does then the game crashes on the first screen i assume thats the menu screen i play many alphaearly launch games that cost a fraction of this and rarely have issues i think there should be a big disclaimer before puchasing that says game in prealpha [update 42915] i can get the game to run fine on my desktop but after a few patches now im still experiencing the same exact issues on my laptop my best guess is that the game is being patched but the launcher rock star social club is not designed to run on laptops [update 5715] after the last patch everything is working fine for my nvidia mobile chipset it looks great on my gtx680m

i have played every gta since gta3 this is the best one so far now if they could just increase the safezone and fov sliders as well as add multiple fov sliders for each type the vr gamers need this

modding is now allowed in single player just dont try it online since the day i bought this game just 23 days after release i was worried about how itd run on my pc and how buggy it would be both in general and online after this 60gb game finished downloading i started it up and i was playing it with very high and high settings perfectly in 1080p with msaa x2 and fxaa on with that said i have not played gta v at all on either last gen or new gen systems but now that the pc version is out i was finally able to get it this game is still one of the best gtas since san andreas the graphics are great the acting is good the many things you can do such as shooting up the city blowing up cars screwing with the police and all the cool things gta has always allowed us to do is nothing short of pure freedom and entertaining openworld gameplay some people have or have not had a good online experience though it varies like i said earlier i have had a flawless experience with zero crashes glitches and bugs even online i also experienced no lag and connectivity issues while playing online either this is one of the few aaa title games that actually felt like it was complete and worth the $60 price tag i cannot recommend this game more its a mustbuy for people who are just beginning to play this for the first time or for people that simply want the most definitive version of this game to enjoy with friends 910
recommended
alright besides the issues with actually getting the game to start this is exactly what they promised it is addictive as hell and fun to boot no but seriously this is one of the best optimized games for pc with constant fps and such lovely graphics that i am amazed its so smooth the online mode is fun its competitive and insane at times also infuriating since everyone wants to kill you for some damn reason but teaming up can be insanely fun and with heists its just wonderful in reality this game gets an easy 910 the lower score is because of the issues i and others are having when starting the game edit the issues seams to have been fixed yay
recommended
gta v is probably one of the best games ive ever played i have hundreds of hours in gta online and think its pretty well put together however there are cracks in this games foundations the way servers are handled online mean you will be spending a lot of time in loading screens which can be very infuriating if youre trying to quickly join a friend

this is a great game have owned it on ps3 ps4 and now for pc but i will not recommend it rockstar waited til the game made the money and then posted a huge off limits on the modding community you will get banned for even having a graphical mod on single player the only reason i purchased gta on pc was for the mods else i wouldve just stuck with the ps4 version theres absolutely no reason for me play this game update ok so weve recieved official word from rockstar themselves they have stated that you will not be banned for mods offline that means single player is good to go mod the  out of it i had originally given this game a dumbs down now you still still be banned for mods including graphical online any alteration or addition to the game code while online is grounds for a ban so be careful proceed at your own risk

great fun game that lasts a long time and i guess modding in this game is now okay so now everything is good i was scared for a little bit when mods werent allowed but now i guess they are i only have one problem with the game i only have 4gb of ram and the game stutters and freezes a lot when i play and i have an intel i5 4690k with a gtx 960 which should run the game fine so i dont know whats up with that but im going to get 4gb more ram to fix it but besides that the game is super fun d

updatethank you for reaching out to your fans and clarifying your policy i do enjoy this game on the pc my main criticism would be the inconsistent frame rates but thats not a deal breaker not every game can be as well optimized for sli as sleeping dogs  banning single player mods is insane aaa companies need to stop punishing their loyal fans why do you think people like pc mods

when im trying to join my friends 2 others it says that it cant join because they are offline is therea fix

singleplayer is fun online is fun it can be made better with mods but you get banned for using them online unsure whether people get banned for using them in singleplayer because some people have reprted they get banned for sp mods and rockstar recently announced they only ban people for using mods online

i hate steams rating system needs to be points based if i had to choose 010 10 being outstanding id choose a 8 so far ive only played about an 10 hours and come in with very high expectations it worked on first launch no crashes or glitches i set my graphics to my monitors resolution of 1920x1080 and set several a few items to high but left most at normal including textures i only have an nvidia 570 card so i cant go extreme i chose to ignore overlimit warnings and went over the memory allocation slightly the game still runs perfectly smooth for me so far so i may try increasing a few more settings with my intel i7 4770k and 16gb ram running on windows 10 preview x64 ive only played the story mode so far but so far seems fun in typical gta fashion ill make a few more reviews as i progress in the game
recommended
set graphix to high  went to a strip club didnt see daylight up to now 1010 still no daylight up to now
recommended
great on pc love the first person and everything looks great but still there are too many trolls online and makes it impossible to exactually complete any missions to make any money plus when u lose a mission that i need to pay $40k to start because of trolls makes it not so fun need people u know who wont troll in order to play online  so game play is a 1010 missions online i give a 110 because of trolls
recommended
having played a combined 75 hours between the x360 and the pc i feel confident enough in my review this game takes place in a obvious parody of los angeles where there are plenty of things to do and pop culture refrences to find no spoilers for those the main story has a total of 40 hours and then another 5 in side missions the main story is very different from those of the other gta games but it is still quite interesting the online mode is par with some other online games but it could be more fleshed out in my opinion

great game theres so much to do and its all worth the wait trust me

eventually this game has come out for pc this game is amazing and with some pcs out there it will look out of this world and on low end hardware aside from the time to time crashing the game runs suprisingly well on any hardware nvidia graphics cards are the best for this game at the moment in time as they have releced a dedicated driver for gta5 amd have a beta driver online sometimes crashes for me this may be because of my slow internet or just my setup the game has an option for multipule moniters and other graphics settings the only real complaint from me is that it is 60gb and with my internet it took me 1 week to download but aside from that i would recomend this game to anyone with a 350 setup or more

you already know what it is its just been made better on pc bit of a cpu hog but what did you really expect really though a great game with a fun online 3gb gpu does the perfect trick for solid graphics at 1080p 60fps

had to format c\ for the game to function properly not due to the user name but for every other reason this game had a problem with my pc havent had a single error since though game is gorgeous and runs really smooth even when settings are set to above my gpu memory limit if you havent played the story yet yourre in for a real treat else theres gta online prepare to get shot alot in freemode but it is also your right to pass on the tradition as soon as you hit the higher levels just watch your back as you become a red player also a sao reference

this game tries very hard to become a criminal life simulator but falls short of it the single player portion is fine with me i have almost no complaints about it except for the fact that missions dont pay for  the online is a different story loading screens will be an integral part of the online experience trying to do even the simplest things not involving things already in the map will take you to a loading screen in my almost twenty hours of online time almost five hours of it was stuck staring at a birds eye view of san andreas the loading screens would not be a problem if the actual gameplay made up for it in some cases gameplay is fun however most missions in the early hours of your experience will be steal a car steal an item or kill a person if you decide to make a lobby it will take a long time to wait for players who dont quit the first moment they get into the lobby this experience will be what defines the heists portion of the online if youre the leader be prepared to wait at least half an hour for one person i dont know if its the community or the design of the invite system itself but when i start up the game im immediately bombarded by mission invites to lobbies with no immediate indication as to what settings the lobby has if you want to find out you have to join the lobby endure a loading screen look quit if you dont want to play then endure another loading screen to go back into free roam when youre being bombarded by mission invites it seems to be sensory overload and is what contributes to the lack of players in my opinion even if f you make a full heist lobby youre still not in the clear yet an online mission uses team lives meaning that respsawns are shared among the whole team because of this system anybody who dies will waste team lives and bring the whole team down this is infinitely applicable for heists which automatically fail if a member dies without any team lives left in my experience ive spent 45 minutes in order to bring a heist lobby together only to eventually fail because someone died from something really stupid like suicide or using a motorcycle while it may be frustrating to fail a heist it is infinitely more frustrating if someone decides to rage quit after we fail once when that happens the whole lobby gets disbanded each of us gets to go through a loading screen and we go into free roam all of that happens without providing us with an option to simply let us stay in the lobby with three players whie we wait for another fourth person to join even though my experience with this game has been less than stellar i feel that my experience closely mimics my own real life experinces i have lived in socal my entire life and i would say that this game is one of the best simulators of south californian urban life out there it has everything from the numerous and meaningless activities hour long commutes to work and other activites to the excessively expensive products you can buy so if anyone would like to experience south californian life playing this game without violating traffic law murdering people and robbing buildings which should cover most exceptions would make for an excellent substitute while the game is pretty okay i would not recommend it if youre looking for a great online experience or a great movie criminal simulator
not recommended
this game is worth the money for the single player alone end of story compared to 4 the story line is less dumb there isnt a lot to complain about with this game but there are still some the interface menus controls etc are very complicated and leave me wondering if the rockstar devs ever spend any significant amount of time playing pc games before they set out to make this version the online is pretty fun its admiteddly not exactly what i had hoped for but its still a good part of the game the jobs and heists are a lot of fun when you have the right group setup however that is the catch the community sucks so predictably finding a group that isnt full of trolls or doesnt have at least one bad apple can be challenging thankfully though their is a pretty clever reputation system in place so hopefully the environment for friendly players will become more enjoyable the online also has very long load times at the moment though its kinda sporadic sometimes your in a job in 30 seconds sometimes it can take a few minutes aside from all that for being about 3 weeks old the game is really good and will likely only get better

everything is bigger and better in gta v rockstars love effort and attention to detail they put into gta are qualities unmatched by other developers and is the main highlight of the series the pc port is great gta online is abysmal but it is technically a free extra just heed my advice and buy gtav for the single player otherwise you are wasting your money and will be disappointed theres a bunch of connectivity issues no matchmaking with players in your area so the lag is unplayable when near people the missions are dull and effortless and the online menu navigation is as terrible as gfwl stick to the excellent single player or play online only to mess around with friends in a private game like gtaiv

until rockstar fixes this ingi retched bug where the framerate plummets down to 15 fps then back up to the normal 60 i will keep a negative review i have a gtx 970 and an fx 8370 this should easily handle the game on low settigs which still struggles

hmm how should i review this game its just amazing there is nothing else to say the optimization is great lots of graphical options in fact lots of settings options to change every single thing to ur liking in 150 hours of game play i only crashed twice game doesnt chew on himself everything is smooth as a feather rlly worth the time we have been waiting for this version hell i have a average rig and i run this baby at high 60 fps by average i mean 2012 hardware enough of this and lets get down to the core of the game story mode is amazing 3 characters u can switch to any one of them anytime u want and when u do so u get to see a small cutscene of what she was doing michael complaining franklin eating chips and trevor running from cops or my favourite wake up in top of mount chilliad in a woman dress xd story has 3 endings there are around 3 heists 4 if u count fib like one since it had a heist setup with different approach ways making u replay the game or just the missions to check out the other ways characters are insteresting although most of them are s xd in my opinion this story wasnt great as in others gtas san andreas and iv had a better story now lets turn to the online well what is there to say just the online deserves another 40 $ in my opinion it has locations and interiors of its own lots of cutscenes u can work during the day and hit the club at night why not invite ur friends to ur house and have couple of drinks better yet why not call a stripper and have the time of ur life or if u are done with that why not take a shower drink a healthy green mix or go for a walk online is just simply amazing there are many modes missions adversary modes my fav 3 deathmatches races diferent types survival tennis darts lol and much more u can buy your own cars with the money u got from ur jobs giving u the feel that every small cent is worth getting buy houses boats planes hell even contract ur own mercenaries and pay them to go after a player overall this game is fantastic dun expect run this without a quad core i mean if u want to run this at a proper fps if u love 30 fps keep the dual but u aint going more than normal settings and ik what ppl are saying mods make u banned well idk about that i never modded this game neither i plan in doing it the game is amazing has it is i aint touching this masterpiece final score 1010 if u have a average rig a clean pc and love for gta series than this game will most certanily make u seduced have fun 3

this game is absolutely fantastic theres very few bad things to even mention about it the story is composed to make fun of the american ideals and it succeeds in it to add to that the story is really long which offers a lot of game time 30something hours of story  a bunch of side missions to do in addition and the multiplayer which supercedes gta iv by miles in terms of performance this game is so well optimized i dont have the strongest pc out there amd r9 290 amd fx6300 6core 8gb ram and i could still run it on high settings if you want to squeeze the most out of this youre going to need a titan and lots of ram try crossfiring too to get the most out of the amazing graphics the only few bad things i do have to say would be that with all of their immersion with the environment they really shouldve added indicators adds more realism for us role players in addition to that there was also the fact that no matter whether your gun was silenced or not police got right on you no matter where you shot and when it comes to multiplayer then occasionally me and my buddies had difficulty getting in each others games but thats about the only bad thing i hope they add big bank robberies into multiplayer soon all in all it is a very very good game that i can happily recommend to anyone who wants to be armed with 20 guns to go on a killing spree on bikers gang members and the police people who enjoy a good story will not be disappointed either with superb voice acting and sound quality the performance as i mentioned earlier is also a very good reason why anyone should try it out it might just run smooth as butter on your baby

with some hours under my belt i have to change my mind on gta v being a good game to be honest its not its a pretty boring rehash of what used to be a fun game but which has been milked dry by now the story mode is alright the story is basically san andreas 20  the dialog is funny and so on the missions become repetitive pretty quickly and after a while you just get bored sure the city is well made but the amount of entrable buildings is very very low the online mode well thats repitiion coming out of every pixel you have a bunch of heists which are the only interesting missions but thats all some standard races with occasionally a funny twice when you race golfcarts some fedex misisons collecting item a then taking it to point x some ratkilling in there somewhere done then random people on a random server dont kill them too often and dont destroy their precious cars that respawns though youll get bad player points because you have to be a nice criminal meanwhile if you drive around aimlessly doing fall you are rewarded so yeah that was the part where i said to myself really in the end gtav is a game you can buy in one of gabes discounts its fun with friends but outside of that theres too much repitition to be a game youll spend hours playing unless youre some hardcore fanboy 2030 would be a good price for it

a shining example of what thorough development times and attention to detail can achieve also a fantastic port with a ton of pcspecific options i will gladly wait longer for a games release if it means that they will all be of the quality and standard of this game
recommended
when will there be an update for gta v and do you need to pay for it
recommended
hands down without a doubt the best game released for a long time pc the game is optimized extremely well and it is extremely fun if you can run this game its definitely worth the money
recommended
excellent game i just find rockstar social club a little annoying
recommended
i do not think i can say much about this game that hasnt already been said its brilliant the exploration the size the look this is the definitive version of this game and as more and more mods are made there is going to even more more amazing and fun things to do in the game the story i find to be not as good as rockstars other works this is a far cry from red dead redemption but is story really the main reason we play gta and gta online adds an amazing amount of replayability and fun
recommended
a good entry into gta pc many of the bugs i mentioned before i amended my review have cleared up a good lot of them remain i am now recommending this game because it is a great experiencewhen you get to experience it heists are great fun with trusted companions dont bother with pubbies
recommended
whell i just finnished the singple player campaig mostly the main story missions witch took me around 40 hours to complete i found the story compelling and intresting

ive got what i payed for after launch i had 2 game breaking bugs 1 i couldnt start game at all and second when i somehow managed to start the game in multiplayer everybody always left this two problems were fixed for me 3 days after a release game runs smoothly i didnt have a single crush or any problems multiplayer is great campaign is super cool not like gta iv i am really happy i bought this game only one problem remains if i have water on better quality than normal it is super shiny and has no edges  on shores or in canals  pros controls settings graphics music dialogues everything is great even options that if you fail mission and you cant pass it you can skip it awesome you have  of guns you can upgrade same with vehicles and clothing people say there is nothing to do in this game well you might try online there is  of them cons when you in game and it is in lobby with other players or you spectate and you wanna use chat you cant because when you use letter that is keybind it will be accepted as command to be honest map is bit empty when you drive in desert or so sometimes you can experience random event tho which is nice i already mentioned water bug but there is one more bug after very first heist when you come home after setup in lesters black car and everything bla bla i got white screen without any movement and god kicked from game for being afk mission still got finished rating 97510 cons < pros buy

this is the game that should make other developers feel bad about some of the junk that they offer

i have been playing the xbox 360 version for over year and have been patient enough to wait for this game to come to pc completely bypassing the next gen consoles always love pc gaming and it is hard not to see why the pc version of gta v is a master piece of open world free to do as you please with some stunning graphics currently playing with the recommended graphics card gtx 660ti amp edition and i can run most the display setting high cant wait to test it out with titan x when it arrives this game has surpassed its predecessors and hope rockstar continues to keep up the good work regarding hackers in the online community that completely ruined gta iv i am disappointed when i still have to return to the xbox 360 and play with friends who have yet to experience the true taste of real gaming at its best well done nice port
recommended
the very long wait is over and gta 5 is a great game to play great graphics superb cars missions weapons and camera angles make this a winner the characters are not to my liking and the long wait is not good or fair to pc players however the great sound track and fun gameplay makes gta 5 a 810 game pros 1 graphics and sound trak is superb 2 amazing camer angles including firts person 3 massive city to explore cons 1 the long wait was wrong and unfair 2 the characters are dumb they lack charm or humour 810  a superb game better charcters and less of a wait would make it a 10

sooper fun to play lots of things to do cums with all dlc 1 problum i had was i cud not play it for 3 days thay fixed it good game
recommended
um yes this game is one of the best games ive had the chance to play to date ive played a lot of games the sheer amount of things you can do in this game is phenomenal for me i only play online which does have its setbacks but theres a whole single player campaign which i hear is pretty good too the level of immersion you can get in this game is excellent want to play tennis sure they got that want to race cool cars they got that too what about guns drugs and killing strangers of course now the biggest drawback for online is the money everything is terribly expensive and its very difficult to come by money not impossible just slow and tedious i believe they make it this way so that youll buy money with real usd but thats pretty much status quo of the gaming industry nowadays the bottom line if you want a game with a hell of a lot to do looks great plays swimmingly and is an overall joy to have this is the game for you there are flaws but theyre not significant enough to ruin anybodies day glhf make that money twitchtvthethinktank

best game on the market rn

one of the best games ive owned on steam so far already clocked 57 hours on it just the main story line alone was awesome took me 24hrs to complete the main missions but i still have tons of side missions to complete multiplayer is awesome as well even without friends however not everyone speaks english thus there might be a problem when it comes to heists

this game is one of the best games i have ever played the level of immersion in the story is very high as the dialogue makes it feel like an exaggerated stereotype of america the graphics are very good and even a midlevel pc can run this game on highnormal without any problems buy this game now

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
this is a great game but i dont recommend buying it at the moment due to rockstars awful discounts and shoddy business practices this summer sale hopefully rockstar will get their sht together and realize that you dont have to be a  to your customers to sell games during a sale

ok heres my story it all began on my xbox 360 i was rank 15 on gta online and i was good at bounty hunting and then it all went down my xbox 360 decided it didnt want to ever connect to any wifi and then i didnt give it away i was only disconnected from xbox live so i could still play but after that i waited and waited for gta v to show up on steam and finally it happened it was glory to me and then i finally had joy it took 2 years for it it still crashes for so many people on pc and me but its so worth it

not recommended
having played on ps3 ps4 and now the pc i can happily say this version of gtav is the best of the three while it doesnt add anything new in the pc version the mouse and keyboard controls make a major difference the extra detail present in the textures as well as the editing suite make this the definitive version of the game the director mode leaves a fair bit to be desired though it would be nice to be able to edit clips to add in more stuff to layer in some more detail cant film shooting down a buzzard without someone being there to be the guy that gets shot down for instance and ontop of that it would be nice to use crewmates characters in the director mode but all these small gripes are nothing compared to the quality of this port it would appear rockstar games have learned from their mistakes and given us a port we are massively satisfied with 910  as theres a lot of things we loved in 4 that we cant do in 5
recommended
well awesome game overall prefect graphics first person nice missions like heist although i currently have 18 hours of gameplay which may not seem much but when you play this game you will notice its not a game you could play for 48 hours in a row of all the 18 hours i have spent i have spent 7 hours just trying to get into a heistmission the loading screen is way to long hope they fix it so you can play this game without checking your phone ever 5 minutes because its a 20 minute long loading screen if you dont have a job  school  social life well then you obviously have time to play this so then it would probably be worth it its hard to say if it is worth it or not but the game itself is so good that i have to recommend it sry for spelling mistakes or whatever dontgivea im11

gta5 looks like one of the best games in the serieswith better graphicsbetter gunplaya great story all of that jazz it seems like rockstar really out did themselves with this titleso why then is this a negative review because for all this game boasts about it seems to have forgotten some little problems such as the game actually runningi have been trying to get my game running ever since i bought itand no matter how many times i try to i stil get the same messageyou cannot connect to rockstar servers gta 5 requires an internet connection to have the code redeemedhit retry to try again or cancel funny thing about this little error though it says i logged in to social club on the top right and i have gone onto social clubs site and added my game in with a valid code i was also in a video chat with a friend at the time that was running smoothly i have looked and attempted all manner of bug fixes trying to fix it frome verifying the fileschecking my antivirus for blocksfrom setting administrator to my gta filesand so on and so forthif this gets fixed and i get my 60 dollars worth from this game finally working then i will remove this review immediately

gta nub here well ive played 4 and the episodes main thing on my mind after 69 hours and 78% completion on the campaign is a lingering feeling of ever so slight disappointment the story could have been more unified and epic if you ask me its a grand medley of this and that and the pure scale of it is an amazing feat i guess im too much of a rpg fan these days for v to be mind blowing did not try online if youre not a full blown gta nutter get it on a sale 810

i offer my humble 71 hours as a way to draw you in the game is perfect ive had my helping of bugs crashes and glitches but its allllll worth it 70 of these 71 hours have just been on gtao i havent the slightest clue what the story is about 2 years of waiting well spent do yourself a favor and pick it up

this game is addictive please consult your physician before playing

im sure everyone knows what gta is so i will skip right to it the pc version is extremely well optimized i have been running it with barely over minimum system requirements and although the graphics are pretty limited with my crap computer the game still runs smooth i may update this after i install my new gpu i love the self radio station where it allows you to import your own music playlists into the game and listen to them either as a regular playlist or as an actual radio station with dj commentary in between songs the rockstar editor tool is also amazing allowing you to film your gameplay and edit yourr clips into a movie for uploading on youtube and you can upload your clips directly from the ingame menu you can seemlessly switch between using your game pad and your keyboardmouse without needing to change any settings this helps with navigating menus and editing your rockstar editor clips i cant say much about the graphics for reasons i have already stated but im told its amazing with a proper gpu if you dont already have it on your console i highly recommend it that said if you already own this game on a console i would not recommend buying it on pc the main reason i say this is because honestly the pc community just really sucks you can easily spend 2030 mins just trying to get people to join a job and then if you are lucky enough to get people to join chances are someone is going to quit as soon as you start it if they dont quit as soon as you start the job dont get too excited because they are probably just trying to waste your time so they will wait until you are almost finished and then quit or fail on purpose to top it off it seems like 34 of the pc community are communists what i mean here is on the heists missions you have say 45 setup missions that you have to complete first before you get to the main mission and you do not get paid for those so the way rockstar has it set up is that the host of the mission gets 55% of the reward because the host completed all the setup first each person who joins on the final mission gets 15% but the game allows you to adjust the take if you want well most people will demand at least 20% if not 25% if you pay them 25% you also get 25% which means all your work is really for nothing you would be better of doing regular missions if you pay them 20% that means you are getting 40% of the cut for doing 80% of the work if you dont raise their cut they are probably going to quit as soon as you start the mission if you do raise their cut you are getting screwed and they are probably still going to quit im not sure what makes these people think they are entitled to 2025% of the heist rewards they are only participating in a small part of the overall job and even at the default 15% reward for them they are already making 3x the amount that they would get from a regular mission

lets get one thing straight i love this game its loads of fun and very well polished the only problem is the online if you want to play online with your friends dont waste your money the curent state of the servers are pretty  youll frequently disconnect regardless of how good your internet is it makes it nearly impossible to do any heist roam the free world with your friends do missions dailies or anything online for that matter the game is great and is really well polished for pc however the servers are very unstable tldr if online is your main draw to this game wait until rockstar fixes their  servers

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
this is a great game but i dont recommend buying it at the moment due to rockstars awful discounts and shoddy business practices this summer sale hopefully rockstar will get their sht together and realize that you dont have to be a  to your customers to sell games during a sale

started playing gta online i robbed a liquor store with a pistol that had no ammo i pulled the trigger by accident and the clerk pulled a shotgun and shot me out the door i respawned outside the store just down the street and immediately i exploded after a fighter jet dive bombed me 1010
recommended
even for a 2 years old game i still excited i play mostly online mode since ive done the story on console and i enjoyed it very much but there are few things that annoy me 1 sometimes on heists mission when the mission failed and i tried to restart the screen stuck on mission failed scene but the gameplay is still going on so i have to change the resolution then change it back again which takes a lot of time 2 i bought a suppressor and extended clip for my pistol but everytime i log in its not equipped so i have to go to ammunation to equip it every single time 3 sometimes the game crashes well i hope rockstar fix the game soon so i can enjoy it even more great jobs rockstar for bringing this game to pc

original thoughts rubbish game did not work and crashed before anything even appeared revised 210415 now i have the game working was one file in the game which was causing major issues but now thats resolved i can give a real review and what is it that i am going to say this game is awesome and i have to say its a great port too with gta iv i even now see some odd issues but none of those issues are present in gta v overall its great <3
recommended
i played the xbox 360 version to death and now im going to play the pc version to death its great buy it
recommended
theres literally no reason anyone shouldnt be suggesting this if your computer meets requirements itll run and run just as youd expect depending on the hardware used youll be perfectly fine as long as you install the gta v graphics driver

finally made it to pc with improved draw distance and textures this game doesnt need another review however i like it so much here we are im not sure if its because of the 60 fps or if they further refined the controls but the controls feel better than previous versions to me as well of course any pc gamer will love the fact they can now use mouse and keyboard when gunning down their foes i still use my old trusty 360 controller for driving but this series has never felt better on mouse and keyboard i would ignore any minor issues with online play at release as this is fairly normal for aaa releases when the servers are flooded rockstar has a great reputation for patching and improving their products well after release last but not least the new editor is a blast to play with you can set scenes record and edit footage all right in gta with a little creativity you can basically become your own movie director im currently working on some fun content for my own youtube channel if youre reading this stop now and buy the game

im willing to bet that roughly 90% of the negative reviews are negative because eye h8 maenstreem being able to say that this is the first ever gta ive ever completed the story in doesnt sum up my satisfaction i really loved this game the story i thought was pretty deep connecting all of the characters in some fashion or another and creating bonds and divides all across the board compared to the other titles storiessome russians cousin who is inherently supposed to just kill people v is a winner characters are unique so very interesting franklin is a young man from the hood trying to work his way up in the crime world michael is a retiree from running bigtime heists with family issues from hell trevor is the meth head that people put in commercials to scare people somehow theyre all supposed to work together somehow it works out perfectly heists oh my god heists some of the side missions can get a little grindy but when the h word got thrown out there i kept noticing quittin time to be later and later while the heists take a good bit longer to put together once it starts happening every second of it is intense and in no way repetitive visuals i could take up a whole paragraph for this one but just about every other review covers it me gusta downsides all i can think of is maybe some of the side missions being a little bit grindy and not enough heists but thats me being critical allinall just as with all gta games there is a lot of satirical humor in every detail from the radio to the advertisements on the benches i didnt feel like any shortcuts were taken in any aspect of creating this game gta v is worth every last penny i paid for it and i havent even gotten on the multiplayer game yet still sitting on the fence stop there arent any unbearable russian accents to listen to or any odd obligations period kudos rockstar if i were a woman my panties would be wet

i waited for this game for two months before getting it on xbox 360 to see if they would release a pc version they never even announced it so i bought it i played a good 200 hours on it so i got a feel for it this is a very good game no arguement the story mode is very fun and and has a lot of replay value online is fun if you have a couple of friends to play with and a decent internet connection for a quick overview here is a procon list pros great replayable story great graphics good fps i get around 40 fps on my out of date gt640 with textures on medium great soundtrack great voiceacting really nice controls i use a controller but the k&m are very good overall great port cons requires internet connection for story mode online is terrible without friends to play with sometimes crashes if you have a nice pc you should have no problem with this requires social club companies seriously need to stop making separate launchers
recommended
this game is really fun and i want to play with my friends but whenever i want to get online it says files required to play this game cannot be downloaded from rockstar games service please fix this problem  all my friends have this game and i would love it if youd fix this please thank you

honestly ive never actually paid full retail price for a game but this game just take the cake with everything graphics are impressive gameplay mechanics are very good for example remember how easy it used to be to lose the cops in say gta iv not so much anymore in fact surviving with just 3 stars is difficult however i occasionally find attention to singleplayer a little lacking at times for example a super limited amount of hairstyles and very limited number a garages each character can own none of that is the case online overall gta v is definitely a huge improvement from gta iv heck you can ran over cars with a tank which i havent seen since gta 2 do note that online is full of trolls 100% recommend this game even a full price
recommended
if you can run it to your liking fps wise 1010 if there is ever mods 1210 bicycles priceless

this game is absolutly amazing the 60 frames are perfect the graphics are 3x better than consoles i dont even know what to say about this gamethank you rockstar for making such an amazing and beautiful game
recommended
as a grand theft auto v player who transferred from playstation 3 i would definiately say that this is worth the second purchase from the new immersive firstperson mode that allows you feel like the world of los santos is more personal to the highly detailed and sophisticated graphics that the pc version has to offer i would definitely say that this game was able to do more than what a remaster can do it truly shows the best possible way to play grand theft auto v which was still significantly better than a lot of games on ps3 the best game just got better 1010 again
recommended
id say its a pretty good game
recommended
the absolute best game i have ever experienced
recommended
106 my toaster didnt blow up gud gahm

game is very fun definitely better than the 360 version however there is one extremely annoying bug preventing me from completely enjoying the game the err_gfx_d3d_init crash which causes my game to crash every few minutes and it is extremely annoying please fix this issue for the people experiencing this so we can enjoy the game ive been waiting ever since i played the 360 version when it launched to get a pc launch of the game
recommended
alright game i guess but the online has far too many bugs crashes disconnects and loading screens that even with 8gb of ram take far too long to load and there is far too many im still trying to give it a chance though guess well see what rockstar do in the future but seeing the forums doesnt seem like they care much
recommended
this game is a masterpiece  everyone pretty much knows how great the game is already but what is important to pc players to know is that  is this game optimized and runs well the answer is yes it is i have a gtx 960 and fx 6300 and i run the game at high to very high settings with advanced distance scaling off and get 4560fps know that the game is heavily cpu intensive in future and i5 or i7 i might buy to get 60fps solid in this game anyway thats all the technical stuff i can say at the moment 9410
recommended
an excellent game worth getting but not without some flaws here and there the graphics look much better than on consoles but gta online remains as buggy as ever they are patching often and consistently but many glitches persist i would still highly recommend this game especially the single player
recommended
this is a fantastic game that came out 19 months ago yet is still $60 even though i already bought it once you win this time rockstar good no console kids in the public rooms now bad why do so few people have microphones ugly adults are a lot better at killing me

great game feels more like gta sa than gta 4 which is a huge  in my book gg rockstar lets just hope if there ever is a gta 6 that rockstar makes the right choice and doesnt make pc gamers wait for 2 years to play it

probably one if not the best pc game i have played ever the amount of detail is stunning the sheer amount of things you can do is unbelievable why go outside and ride a bike or play tennis when you can do it from your computer chair with online and mods coming out it is just absolutely insane what you can do also the graphics are so beautiful one of the most beautiful games i have ever played rockstar did a fantastic job on this game it is perfect so much better than the ps3 version
recommended
enraging trying to play this game as it requires an outside login seperate from already logged into steam every time it crashes your computer you have to re log into this lame system rockstar support is among the worst i have ever encountered having your account locked after only a few failed attempts will render your game useless for a very long time dont waste money on this garbage rockstar social club is a cancer and a virus

but for the casual connection errors and bugs on gta online this game is just amazing i play it when i can and enjoy every moment of it 1010

i was playing catch with chop after he retrieved the ball and ran back towards me he got run over by a car he died instantly rip chop enraged i hijack the dudes car run him over and blew up the car with a sticky bomb the police came and took a shot at me i was thinking he run over my dog that guy deserved it but they would not listen and kept on shooting at me while still grieving over chops death i fought the cops but they kept coming i ran back into the house and i kept on fighting untill the last bullet killing every cops that tried to enter the house through the front door after what seems to be the longest firefight of my life i was left with nothing but a police baton wait for me chop im coming i leave my cover and charge them head on but a shot from their shotgun stopped me dropping me on the spot my vision blurred they became black and white and a text saying wasted appear i woke up in a hospital the doctor did not say anything and release me i took a taxi back home and i saw chop still alive everything is so quite so peaceful it is like all of that violance never happen it feels like a dream

instead of writing a real review instead ill quote a song thats very fitting i still hear your voice when you sleep next to me i still feel your touch in my dreams forgive me my weakness but i dont know why without you its hard to survive cause every time we touch i get this feeling and every time i kiss i swear we can fly cant you feel my heart beat fast i want this to last i need you by my side cause every time we touch i feel the static and every time we kiss i reach for the sky cant you hear my heartbeat so i want you in my life httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4g6qdnc4jps in all seriousness this is a fantastic game and really well optimized i personally think youd be able to run it a little under minimum specs but i dont really know for sure ive enjoyed the hours ive spent in it so far and will continue to do so with the release of mods coming we already have the simple native trainer it doesnt work for online though thank god and it works beautifully theres so much of the game to explore and i love it better than gta 4 by a long shot i think theres something that the game is missing though gta 4 had an excellent story but i think this one is a bit worse than gta 4 while gta 4 had a great story through and through i really liked it but this one had a fun story instead of the deep story that gta 4 had its still an improvement though i just felt that it needed to be said the gameplay is also fun free roam and story theres so much to do may it be from golfing to looking for radioactive waste may it be from punching hookers in the face to throwing yourself down mt chiliad theres a wide variety of things besides the usual gta activities the new heists addition to the campaign is a fantastic addition fun to play over and over again which i frequently do might i add multiplayer wellthis is an obvious one but its also fantastic as are many things when you have friends to play with the new 30 or 32 player not entirely sure limit to servers makes the world feel fantastic getting a group of 10 or so friends together and holding out against 5 star cops is a great bit of fun as well as doing other miscellaneous stuff of course sky diving racing death match and of course free roam as i mentioned a little earlier the world ties very well into the multiplayer and still is amazing in singleplayer this world makes just cause 2 seem like childs play compared to how much raw stuff is crammed into it im not sure how else to explain it besides its vast full interesting and fun to explore overall i give it a 1010 rating probably going to be my game of the year as of posting this second favorite game that i own on steam highly recommended
recommended
this game is wonderlust the only thing i hate about it is that the loading takes forever everything else is perfect

honestly most engrossing game in years very good game to invest free time in and comes with spectacular graphics on the pc

right lets get to it pros everything you can do in this game is fun everything lots of cars insanely well optimised my old laptops gtx 560 m could run this online is stupid fun decent story dont expect it to take you weeks to finish though trains hookers impotent rage tons of playtime cons loading times on an hdd are quite long annoying in online 60 gb download sometimes randomly removes everyone from an online game and puts you in a game by yourself if you lose connection you have to wait for the story to load before rejoining the online games if you want to play with freinds in mp then you have to load either offline or online before joining them online isnt great if you only play every now and then because of the leveling speed im in high school and its perfect for me cover feels clunky at first but youll get used to it in time online deathmatches arnt the best dont expect much free time or sleep negect for everyday activitys might get fired or suspended all up get this game youll love it its one of the few games thats actually worth the price you can just keep playing and playing plus the online player base is preaty good

one of the best games i have ever played  if i could give a score i would say 9910 soon will be 1010  they just need to fix some minor bugs and glitches afterall  no game is perfect  isnt it  anyway its a must play  and as a pc only user i have waited a while to play this
recommended
the game is fun enough the story is funny and you always have something to do online is kinda lame since youd normally go from single player with all the items to online with nothing and if you dont have a group it seems like a gank fest for the most part which can be fun if youre into that kind of thing my only real complaint about the game is the horrible controls with a gamepad its not to bad but mouse  keyboard it is so awkward and clunky for example you go through the game using wasd for movement and then suddenly go into a plane and it wants you to use your num pad wasd and then youre expect to look around with your mouse they could have done a lot better with just using your mouse to steer the plane and wasd to control pwr and left and right forgeting the name the game is fun and once you get over the controls is very good id highly suggest atlest having a gamepad of some sort atlest plugged in for those flight missions since its very easy to switch between the two
recommended
the game is amazing once i found out my antivirus was blocking it i completly love the game is amazing everything works great and i have found no problems and all you need to run it is 1gb of video ram and you can run it at 1080p if you get the specialized drivers i think this game is worth every cent if you can buy it
recommended
game is awesome but it crashes my pc pretty bad every hour and my specs are above recommended i5 3570k 46ghz gtx 770 8gb ram dont understand why and the crashes happen during the worst times
recommended
this could be the game that saved triplea titles after a couple years of disappointing releases by the big publishers and after a poor port of the previous gta game expectations were low pc gamers were cynical and not feeling all that great about spending big money on a game that has already been out on consoles for years rockstar promised a great port and to my surprise delivered big time the game looks awsome in both story mode and online mode i havent had any server problems rockstar didnt throw out bs tactics like dayone dlc or paytowin gimmicks rockstar did take their time making ittoo much time in some peoples opinion but if it takes this much time to do it right to get a game that looks and plays as well as this rockstar rewarded our patience they showed that it can be done and now the pressure is on the other publishers to do the same

i own this game on 3 systems and the pc version is simply perfect let this be a lesson to all other game manufacturers put the effort in and make a game right and people will happily buy your product 3 times over

i rarely write reviews but this game is in deep need of one with amazing gameplay 60fps and 4k i though this game would be great but its just a bunch of errors waiting to happen i cant play for 10 seconds with out a zlib fire error corrupt data files not connecting to social club server crashes game crashes this is extremely stupid and after a year of waiting since release i though i would have been able to play a good game maybe i should have waiting for gta 7 before all the bugs were out

i enjoy this game and do recommend it to others who like the genre it is an allround great game by my taste i have had no issues in installing the game the rockstad platform is not slowing me down and i would say i am relatively really fast in game after starting it

this is the best game of rockstar games that i have ever played two problem  1` if you have 56 friends make sure you tell them that this is a 24 man heist game same as payday 2` if you have a bad upload speed you will be kicked off the server or moved to another server love the game super great and fun just dont kill everyone you see that makes it a bit of a pain for everyone

the best grand theft auto game to date the pc port is good but a bit wonky at times ive noticed small frame rate drops when driving through grass for some reason if youre having low fps try lowering msaa when i changed it from 8x to 4x my fps went up by about 20 also if youre going to be playing with a mouse i strongly recommend changing the mouse input method from raw input to windows otherwise you will experience mouse lag

not only does gta v run incredibly well on pc it looks absolutely beautiul doing it i first played gta v on my old ps3 and how things have changed since then this looks like a completely new game everything has been improved from the texture quality to the weather effects foliage is much thicker than before making the ps3 version look baron and wastelandish and the first person mode is truly stunning changing the game completely and adding a new level of challenge as you have to guess how wide your car is at 80mph squeezing between two cars or struggle to see around the cover youre behind in the middle of a gun fight with the ballas the weather seems to have had an overhaul with clouds casting shadows in the sky as lightning strikes and rain puddling and reflecting even the minor details all of this adding to an almost photorealistic level of quality with all but one exception when in first person mode walking into a wall will reveal a slight lack of texture quality despite all the tricks used to acheive such amazing graphics you have to bear in mind that this game was made as a 3rd person game this being said the only time youd notice is during an intense walllicking session and it in no way intrudes on normal gameplay i can heartily recommend this game even for those who have already played it on last or current gen consoles the jaw dropping astetics and interesting mechanics are very welcome additions to an already brilliant game whether its worth the 40 price tag is an unquestionable yes even the second time round with the files unencrypted and the code exposed its only a matter of time before we start seeing some awesome mods hitting the scene and i for one cant wait to see whats in store for the future of gta v

ok let me start by saying i have been playing pc games since cs 145 with mirc and cal leagues ive played alot of games yes i seem to enjoy first person shooters the best bf4 but also enjoy games where i can explorer and do what i want this game does everything that all current games do its like 30 games in one u really can do whatever its the first step into a world like the movie gamer which can get interesting as for gta for me its like playing gta part 1 on pc from the top view but super hd bad  graphics and lots of content simply amazing

more realistic than reality 1110

with all the crashesim gettingi cant recommend this gamefix crashes and online loading timemaybe then ill change my mind
not recommended
this game is a work of art when i first got it i was skeptical that the launch would be similar to gta ivs but when it came out it worked like a dream after all the unpacking and waiting for the social club to work of course but other than those two complications i havent had a problem with this game at all the graphics are out of this world and look realistic as hell the game play is very fluent with the mouse and keyboard and it works better than i expected the controls as ive said are great with keyboard and mouse flying and driving are easy with a bit of getting used to but nonetheless very well done the jobs and heists make this game greater than when i had it on the 360 i havent played it in forever so i havent even gotten to use heists yet until now overall i give this game an esteemed 1010 for being a great launch having fantastic graphics and amazing and innovative game play and controls i would highly recommend as would rockstar in their recommended parts to have a high end  mid range computer this game lags slightly on mine and i have some decent parts i would also highly recommend this game if you like playing with your friends and just messing around killing each other and such 
recommended
no doubt this is the best version of gta v just a shame it took this long to get here optimization is pretty good but definitely could be better the graphics looks stunning along with the improved pedestrian and traffic density the settings is also pretty good with a lot of options overall id say it was worth the wait but next time dont make us pc gamers wait this long and release it alongside the console version
recommended
extremely enjoyable game well balanced and performs very nicely on most hardware it seems
recommended
perfect port ive been playing gta online for a few days now and it feels 10x better then on console solid smooth fps with beautiful graphics if anyone was questioning if they could run it i have friends with very old cards that can get a solid 60 fps on high  very high settings with some mininmal tweaking

game sucks i looked forward to it forever because of the firstperson feature which is clunky at best you cant walk in firstperson i havent seen any of the cool ironsights or cockpit views in vehicles that i saw in previews ive spent an hour listening to bad voiceacting and contrived videodrama they give you the option to turn the hud off then bug you with a reticle annoying messages and constant cellphone ringing then again ive only used the guns provided in the opening scene speaking of the opening scene what if i didnt want to be a cop killer too bad i know its not an rpg but ffs give us some more control instead of funneling our characters into this boring $hit whats the point in even changing the characters just so you can shoot a security guard in the head give me a fvkking break complete gimmick for kids that want to be thugs to top it all off every time i start i have to cntrlaltdel because the native res wont start on my monitor so i end the exe and start in safe mode then have to reset the video settings i spent $6000 and i cant even stomach it anymore kiddy $hit uninstalled nice try rockstar but fail stick to nub a$$ consoles and thirdperson with autoaim im too spoiled by masterrace games if i want online action with vehicles i play planetside offline tes and fallout still have no competition especially not from this garbage and lmfao at steam for censoring language in reviews of this game

as someone who has played gta5 on ps3 and clocked many hours in it so far id have to say that the pc version was definitely worth the wait they could have released it in a state like gta4 was when it was finally brought to pc but they decided to polish it which im grateful for so far ive clocked 69 hours perhaps a little too much and every second of it has been wonderful the only issues that i personally have experienced would be a large fps stutter when ive been playing the game for longer than 2 hours however after restarting my pc it allows me to play for another 5 i regrettably tested this last night tldr fun game restart pc if stutter i now have no life thanks rockstar you enabler
recommended
i beta tested this on ps3 and then ps4 so you didnt have to the graphics on this are better than irl so i dont go outside anymore what even is life anyway also what got me thinking is that i heard somewhere that jelly fish are something like 97% water right so what purpose does that serve its doing nothing give it another 3% and just make it water instead add me on social club  itslloydm8 or steam here im looking to just have some casual fun on gtaonline no water sports though and my safe word is spaghetti later bros

this game is obviously one of the best gtas ever created rather than tell you whats good about it because the list is way too long ill tell you where the game is lacking the story for this game is very clich there are no exciting twists to the story and its very predictable think of an action movie from the 90s and thats your story here the story started to pick up in the middle but then it seemed like they forgot about the buildup and they just went straight into the game i didnt feel that transition i always felt with other gtas another thing that this game forgot was activities there are no police car missions and not as many interior buildings that gta iv had i personally enjoyed walking into a burger shot and i was disappointed when i realized you couldnt visit any food places sprunk machines are still there to give you health but i prefer eating at an establishment like in san andreas or gta iv the map itself is a decent size but one thing it lacks is dead space im talking about the empty desert we experienced in san andreas that feeling of being lost in the middle of nowhere you dont get that with this game every single part of the map is populated with roads buildings or people the only secluded areas i could find were the mountains which werent that big to be honest the way the map was made removes a bit of the realism for me its just a big island in the middle of the ocean that and the lack of dead space was unfortunate but one thing they did right was the underwater segment of the game ever wrestle a shark when you can in gta v dont be dissuaded by my pessimistic review keep in mind that this game is freakin amazing so amazing that i just had to point out some of the flaws of it the flaws are few with this game gta online is still somewhat buggy but if you can get past that you will enjoy another 50100 hours off that 8510  a technical and artistic wonder of the gaming world on par with skyrim

this game is one of the greatest games of all time i mean as of right now you can see it has 19000 positive reviews i have been playing the gta series since i was a kid i owned gta 1 and had gta2 on dream cast and to see it come from its early days from a unknown developer at the time called dma to becoming rockstar and eventually rockstar north and being this beautifully crafted game is amazing to watch over the years of playing the wait sucked for pc but thank you rockstar for another beautiful epic story line built on a beautiful breath taking environment i fear death because i know once im gone i wont be able to play these awesome epic games anymore lol how much i love gta and a great improvement on port this time standing applause
recommended
i have to addmit i was dissapointed with how badly this games launch went for me not that i wasnt expected some sort of issue my game wouldnt even launch but once i found a fix and got round the issue and can realy recommend this game it is a big step up from gta iv the campaign is great and the multiplayer is even better if you are having issues with this game stick them out it will be worth it in the end
recommended
a rare but fantastic port from rockstar the development team have clearly learned that the pc community wont be satisfied with copypasta garbage cough gta iv cough and as a result have come out with a highly optimised game that can truly be considered the difinitive version hopefully soon those guys on gtaforums or whoever will be able to crack and modify the game folders they can currently only see through openiv the modding potential for this game is enormous its just a shame that rockstar didnt embrace this idea as openly as say bethesda with skyrim and the like if you can run it and you porbably can buy it this is one of the best open world games ever created and youd be doing youself a disservice not to have it on your hard drive
recommended
50 hours in and i have barely scratched the surface of this awesome game my whole gaming community is involved now and i think the only problem that weve come across is whos going on heists i see no end in sight my girlfriend is finding me a lost cause and im out of paid time off at work because of this game just buy it and play this  til your fingers bleed

this game is one of the most immersive free space game i have ever played i cannot say ever that i do not love it the only downside to it is that this game is a huge game therefore requuiring a ton of memory and speed on your computer but if you meed the minimum reqirements you should be fine
recommended
 probably the best game i have played so far graphics are amazing and theres so much things to do in online and solo your brains probably explode before you explore everything in this game theres so much challenges ahead single player has an great storyline and missions have alot of cool features jokes etc in the cut scenes are damn good ones and usually gives a reason to laugh till my eyes bleed some tears of joy multiplayer is simply awesome heists are awesome rockstars made a damn great success here just waiting for few really small bugs and glitches to be fixed and some new updates to bring us new ingame content

gta v has been the best game ever with the loads of activities you can do in the game you can never get bored this game has the best replay value by far with the extraordinary campaign and online multiplayer to play with friends although this game has been delayed for pc for over a year it is worth it the gunplay of this game is good if you dont prefer using keyboard thats alright because you can switch over to controller with easei use controller though but either way this is a must buy game

hi iam really sorry if my english is bad bear with it good now lets review this game first the graphics the best i have seen in a long time you can see that they put in a lot of work in it with all the option to change this is a game that will run on a lot of configs second the gameplay is good i had a lot of fun playing around in general third the story is simple but fun rare are the game that go screwball wich for me is not a bad thing at all finally the community now here is the big problem the community is complete s litle kids going around killing every body shouting in the lobby and to following the plan during heist in conclusion this game is worth the wait the story gameplay and graphics are good but it has a  community i rate 8710

as if i need to tell anyone just how fantastic this game is well it is in my humble opinion that rockstar has outdone themselves the pc version is easily 10 times better than the console version at least the original console version i never had the chance to play the next gen version i have been waiting for this to happen ever since rockstar first announced that they were going to release gta 5 i can honestly say it was well worth the wait

the game is astounding in all respects however the online is a mess there is no division among servers so someone in america with a ping of 200 may be lagging around your server and that is only if you are successful in getting online in truth the system being used is so ancient and prehistoric that you will have spent more time loading than playing the game you want to set up a dedicated server load single player then load multiplayer then load a mission load the players into your mission load the mission itself and then when done load the end of the mission and load the server back up again usually invited players are kicked back to main menu and have to be invited again to the server when you play online and dont enter any events or missions you die by severe lag or get disconnected worst of all is the  where rockstar service is unavailable and you have no reason at all as to why you cannot connect but your friends might get online even though it says the services are unavailable its due to terrible online design and no literally no money spent on buying servers if you buy this game to get online just be aware you may never actually get online and all the  methods people tell you to do in order to get on will get you no where because this is all based on the terrible service from rockstar again another example of a game company that milk your money and tell you to go  yourself when their online service breaks down in truth steam should be removing this off their store as it only tarnishes their good reputation would love to continue playing the game but have been unable to for 2 days was playing perfectly fine for 3 days then this  its a disgrace and a waste of my time and money

fantastic game crashes from time to time though and requires a pretty beefy computer to run as well as load times espescially to online last way too long as a game though absolutely amazing worth every penny espescially when you play with friends on missions
recommended
brilliant game well worth the money imo only fault is the lag youll encounter online from time to time other than that the fact that you could easily kill 6 hours in the game and not realise it is gold for me 910

im on a mission to silence 4 corrupt jurors who are about to return a verdict that would seriously damage the share price of redwood cigarettes inc if im successful its expected that redwood cigarettes stock price will skyrocket in value the following day to prepare for my mission i customize my sniper rifle with an advanced scope and a supressor i grab a nice versitile vehicle lifted ford f150 and i spend the remainder of my cash on redwood cigarrette stock on the hopes that my mission will be successful however after i execute the first corrupt juror the situation on the ground forces me to make some adjustments to my plan the cops are on me but its only one star so its not too much of a concern on to the second juror i take him out quickly but the cops see me do it again and they are starting to get  two stars still not that bad the third juror is standing on a sidewalk so i easily find him and run him down again right in front of the cops three stars now ive got to do something to deal with these cops before i make my way to the final juror who is hanging out on his yacht in the harbor but then i notice im running out of time just one minute before juror number four goes into hiding and my mission is a complete failure frantically i speed toward the harbor thank god i decided to use a sniper rifle for this mission all i need is a good vantage point then i see it perfectly positioned near the harbor are some high bluffs that i can easily drive up with my lifted ford f150 to get a birdseye view of my target its gonna be close i think to myself but i got this mission at this point im feeling really smart correct weapon choice correct vehicle choice and a chance for an enormous payout due to my purchase of redwood cigarrette stock before the killing spree began i park my truck at the top of the remote bluff hop out and start to train my sights on the final juror 20 seconds left the boat is moving up and down with the waves making this a pretty difficult shot i put the jurors head right in the crosshairs 10 seconds left and just as im squeezing down on the trigger i am mauled by a mountain lion michael is dead mission failure 1110 moar plz best gta ever

the only game in years that really feels like a new step in term of size details and interactions with stunning graphics and excellent performance truly grand i dislike the too numerous and confusing menus a mouse oriented streamlined version would be usefull simple task like kicking someone from your lobby takes too many steps the loadingsynchro in multiplayer take way too long sometimes fps mode could be better but it is already a step in the good direction
recommended
nothing less than 1010 they have done it again everybody knows this game would be awesome because of how its been released on other platforms but rockstar has outdone themselves with this pc version really really good
recommended
most of the negative comments i have observed have had to do with either the game not running on certain video cards or the drm policies that rockstar have enforced i cant say much about the video card situation but as far as the drm policies with rockstars social club i have few problems yes if you are someone who moves a lot or lives in an area where an internet connection is difficult to maintain then you should probably not buy this game but if you are like me and are gifted wtih an internet connection of a major city you should definitely buy this game the single player is amazing by itself and offers great story gameplay and one of the best life simulators you could ever buy there is so much content and so many things to do that i honestly have probably not done half of them and i have spent 30 hours on the game the online mode is a bit of a mixed bag though free mode as always is a blast and the best part of the online experience on the other hand the missions hiests tdm and every other scripted or standard online feature are painfully average after the first few times playing through them hiests are difficult to set up through online and often will take so much time due to how hard i call it unfair the hiests can be at times this leads to an even bigger problem relating to money and leveling the money required to buy upgrade and get the best gear buildings and everything else is excessive at best and the only viable way to make money is to do the painfully average missions over and over again the leveling is also a huge barrier to any of the really cool stuff the game has to offer as its all barred behind player levels this takes hours upon hours of grinding the most boring part of the online experience its really hit or miss with the online where if it hits you will be having one of the funnest online experiences you have ever had and if it misses you will have one of the most averageboring onine experiences you have ever had its collectivly a 910 that peaks at 1010 with freemode and singleplayer a majority of my time with the game and dips to 510 with the boring online missions a minority of my time spent with the game thankfully the boring online modes are not a huge part of the whole game and you will spend most of your time in freemode and singleplayer ps change the flight controls if you are using mouse and keyboard the default is truly awful with the num pad

ive played a good 50  hrs of gta v and i need to say one thing all you console peasants eating ice cream while crying at gta v pc videos wanting to play it then u cry to your mom to buy it on a dell laptop run the game message comes up  go build a gaming pc you lazy   one ddownside to gta v when you go into a public match in under 30 seconds you are more or less likely to get ran over by a 100  with an armoured car and sticky bombs over 9000  10 ign  inside groovy nans would laugh at console peasants again would get a lap dance in first person again best gaymee evahhh any console players woould say 1010 would get hacked by lizard squad again  i spent over 69 heh hours coming up with this  review now im off to help kim jong un set of another mushroom croud bye

as far as nicknaming the game grand theft auto v pc loading screen edition this game has some beautiful graphics when running with a gtx 970 4gb card there are a few bugs here and there but thats expected like one of them mention previously loading screen sometimes it gets stuck or takes forever to go away other than that the game is awesome and is worth the $60 i paid for

holy balls is this port good essentially a mirror of the console versions but with aa brilliant gameplay awesome graphics wonderful and lovable characters and a bit more realism now instead of in gta iv where your car could be a flaming husk and work just fine vehicular damage actually effects performance the only downside to the increased traffic and pedestrian activity is the downed car damage maybe ramming an armored truck from the back at full speed in a sports car should do a bit more than a dent on the front otherwise i have no qualms tldr awesome great succession to gta iv with a better story and likeable characters graphics and gameplay are amazing and the cars actually work 1010  ign

even with my 5 year old radeon hd 6950 2gb card this is still amazing pros in 1080p even without aa or any advanced stuff this game looks great with my extremely old card i can get 3745fps averaging 43fpsish game is better than ever with mouse and keyboard cons the account integration is horrible when you get this game make sure that you have the right rockstar account all sorted with a username you like and with any previous version data on it such as from ps3 your account will be permanently linked to your steam account unless you do some  ass support ticket and your game will permanently be linked to your rockstar account i do not like this drm crap at all and i ended up using the wrong rockstar account because i couldnt be bothered to wait for their support this shouldnt cause you any problems if youre not an idiot like me but be warned
recommended
currently 910 some users are having issues with rockstar drm and slow downloads so steam version seems the better choice for downloading the actual game the drm allows for character transfers and is required the game itself is very fun has good optimization for highend or lowmid builds cpu phenom ii x4 970 at 39 ghz gpu sapphire 6950 8 gb ram i get 60 fps inside most buildings but 3040 while driving at 1080p at normal settings and fxaa currently has bugs some are minor while some cause frequent crashes d3d error memory leak albeit slow leak for some and fps stutter for some online the d3d error was fixed for me by reinstalling beta drivers for vcard then every couple days its bugs out again reinstall then its fixed easily could be a 1010 if online ran smoother between stuttering and how job system should back out to the lobby instead of kicking to free roam if someone leaves during a heist but overall it is a great game and hopefully the bugs get worked out

after a rough start and lot of crashes finaly got the game to work and it lives up to the gta franchise name make sure you update your drivers make sure you check instalation integrity in steam i had some file errors and it caused a lot of issues when i tryed to play the game  once the files got fixed it works pretty well in my laptop even without an ssd or crazy 3d card i7 12 gigs of ram geforce 550m works just fine

love this game

the game doesnt stop crashing on singleplayer use guns inside vehicles > crash automatic character change > crash but the multiplayer is just pure awesome even with all the singleplayer crashes the game is still worth buying

this game is hella fun i didnt have the game on a console before and jumped right into it if you wanna say it like that and im still surprised how good and detailed this game is definetly recommend this there are some really annoying parts as well for example the loading times or some visual bugs however the gaming experience is still gonna be worth it if you are still not sure whether you gonna buy it or not you can trust a stranger on this part go for it you wont regret it 
recommended
how can i be writing a bad review yet have bothered to play the game for 35 hours on pc after playing 100s on the ps3 simple they borked the online quite badly for this version so far we have heists that fall apart if one person quits happens a lot can drop out due to poor network conditions if someone hosting has a terrible net setup and fails if one player does badly on their part of the mission we also have issues with game hacks and missions that have completely skewed out the value of money in the game saw my nephew run one player mission that awarded 2mil for a simple knife fight add to this that i have had ghost vehicle duplication in my garage and lost a tricked out motorbike worth $250k plus other vehicles when their game has not updated the garage correctly also first person mode  nice idea but the car dashboard views in quite a few vehicles could have been designed far better and make driving arkward and the interior detail is not that good plus its handling is a bit poor plus i also get to see some of their lowres textures up even closer  really theres some pretty poor texturing in many parts of the game not bad for a 60gb download finally they mentioned enhancements in the online features for the next gen and pc versions of which many have not appeared i have hung onto the game hoping they would fix this stuff but instead on my last contact to rockstar support after vehicle loss all i get is a response 10 days later asking me to try more things that i already tried when it happened and sending them in some videos of me doing it ok rockstar provide me with a tardis to go back and take these vids and i will gladly do it  i have played a fair bit since then and my garages have changed around i was about to give up on support making any contact it was all wishful thinking anyway on my part this game could have been so much better than it is its just a 60fps port with some graphic tweaks and some new glitches
not recommended
played through already on console its a 2 year old game so maybe 60 is a little too much and as of right now online isnt really great beacuse all of the hacks running around still the single player is great is way better built than gta4 the story is great and i bought because i really liked the game in console totally recommend it but if you are not sure just wait for a sale

great game but too many delays

when i first bought this game being my first gta game i anticipated a much more serious plotline and gameplay i was pleasantly surprised to have hilarious dialogue missions plot everything along with a few giggles at crashing into pedestrians and accidentally launching one of the main characters though the windshield of a car nothing however will beat the fact i can randomly switch to trevor wherever he may be and make him ride a mountain bike halfnaked over a mountain until the physics engine catches up and kills him

this version of gta v is a lot better than the last gen ps3xbox360 version so many options and new things implemented its almost like playing an entirely new game i believe this is the point where about a thousand mods are hurdling towards you and you try em all out if you have no life then this game is for you  i have a life but still manage to get a fair few hours in on it its not even been a month since it was released sounds sad but i got big plans
recommended
driving in gtav is amazing the movements of the cars are so realistic i luv this game <3

to laggy for pc as key press delay is to much its like 2 to 5 sec delay and it just stacks so car just drives around on its own and crashes i have tried changing all settings dusins of times but still key lag

this time rockstar did it right gta iv was a great game but poor execution on pc platform now they really pushed this one to glory its worth my almost one and a half year of patience for this to be released on my favorite gaming platform even in low settings this game looks sweet play it on high  you will barely notice changes on ultra  nicely done well cooked

started gta online with friends played for 7 days nonstop to buy a $800000 car and a $15000 motorcycle both magically disappeared from my garage rockstar acknowledged there was an issue but refused to bring back the vhicles as gta would say wasted
not recommended
the entire interface for multiplayer is a ing garbage fire good luck tring to play with the people you want to play with rockstar doesnt seem to realize that the point of multiplayer is playing with friends i hope you enjoy loading screens that have no useful information about what youre loading or where youre going the only way to quit a race or job is to altf4 cant skip cutscenes in heists gta v the game that hates you back
not recommended
a deviently good game longevity is questionable but the immidiate fun factor is good with luck rockstar will quickly add more hiests and other content
recommended
amazingly fun game to play if you can deal with all the crashing bought it on xbox when it originally came out and couldnt miss out on owning it for my pc collection but was extremely disappointed to see that this version had most of the same day one problems that xbox did over a year ago youd think in the time between releases they would have fixed this version
recommended
dispite of the constant bugs lags long loading on multiplayer mode this is still the best game ive ever bought and played on steam

good graphics easy to run and a 1010 game online is really fun too

my review wont really contain any spoilers so rest assured first some points that need touched on before i dive into the meat and potatoes of this review  ive played every gta game out there because im old im pretty sure i still have the cd for gta1 for the pc around here somewhere  gta3 was my favorite of the series followed by vice city  gta4 was the least favorite of the series for reasons i will outline later  i didnt play gta5 until it was released on the pc but i can put it against the terrible port of gta4 ill be blunt i am surprised i sat down and played through this game i anticipated this being a lot like gta4 where i sink about 78 hours into it and then neglect it the game is much much much more engaging than gta4 but it has some of the same flaws that drove me away from gta4 and san andreas the game includes too much fluff that takes away from the core of the game one of the early missions in the game requires you to tow a truck from pointa to pointb i anticipated this coming in use later in the game during some other mission but it has absolutely no purpose at all except to gain money its a waste of time same thing applies to various other elements of the game one of the missions involved me getting into a footrace with some random woman near the beach this is completely useless it doesnt tie into the story and it has no purpose meaningless fluff another thing that really annoyed me is the almost unnecessary training missions that are injected into the game a great example is flight school oh my god you have no idea how much flight school annoyed me not necessarily because its difficult i breezed through the first few classes but because it feels so forced and unnecessary the airplane is super easy to fly but it is about 60% of flight school its a big time sink and on the flip side i completed flight school and still cant fly the helicopter worth a damn but did it affect me in my completion of the game nope i completed the story in approx 2526 hours and that is without messing around and doing the other random mini games after completing the game i anxiously dove into multiplayer it too begins with a tutorial featuring lamar explaining the ropes of gta online the first activity is a race with lamar and other online players in my particular case it matched me with the cpu player lamar and a single other racer who was afk the entire time needless to say this is how my 12 hours with multiplayer went if i got into a match that had people actually playing it was moderately entertaining however a majority of my experiences in these matches involved afkdisconnected players so it just wasnt fun  itd be immensely better if played with friends but you can say that about virtually any other multiplayer game ever so im not giving gta5 any credit for its online mode theres just not much else to say you can run around and shoot other players but that gets really old really fast visually the game is gorgeous a lot of buzz was given to this since it was being ported to the pc and it certainly lived up to the hype firstperson mode is completely uselessunnecessary albeit neat it doesnt help that the fov is too narrow even when turned all the way up feels like another fluff feature except its pcexclusive fluff i played the game the day after launch so still the day0 release and encountered a few bugs here and there throughout the story even after a few game patches nothing game breakingnoteworthy to report random visual glitches between cutscenes for the most part my bottom line is this the game is good and if you are a fan of the series you wont be disappointed also rockstar did a very good job porting the game this time around i have a decent computer 4790k & r9 290 and am able to easily run the game at highveryhighish settings at 60 fps i wouldnt see any problems for midrange pcs to be able to run this at very playable settings especially if you sacrifice quality the same couldnt be said about gta4 when it was released for pc 8610 also dongs

gta v story mode the story mode is long exciting and fun and it can give you a lot of funny moments been playing this constantly and is never tired of it there is so much to do here some examples is to play golf darts or tennis this is great for players that love to do sports in real life or those who are interested in sports when playing for a while doing random activities that comes up i must say they really put effort in this game for us gta online this is just like the story mode but much better you can for example play with friends and play heists or missions that can help you rank up and earn money to purchase an apartment or cars all activities works here as well so you can play together with friends or just random strangers from an online lobby there is so much to do in gta online that i cant describe all of them but if you are interested in a fun multiplayer game to play with friends then gta v is certainly the choice for you no matter how long you play for you can still have fun playing i rate this game an 910 for the reason that it is very fun playing with friends and just hang out
recommended
best played with trainer and mods  1010
recommended
im thoroughly impressed at how well they ported the game to pc much better than gta iv i like how the heists are handled but online sometimes feels not at its optimal because of connection problems luckily i havent experienced any launching problems or errors the other downside is that i am basically at the recommended system requirement however i still experience stuttering and loading issues online playing singleplayer on the other hand gives me little or no lag whatsoever therefore i recommend to be above the requirements to have a good experience minimum requirements will not even be close enough and will cause annoyances last thing to note is that the only long waits i have is when launching the game about 5 minutes but loading any other time in game isnt that long

grand theft auto is currently my favourite game ive mostly played online where you work your way through jobs and heists along the way buying nice cars and sweet apartments after playing with the graphics settings a bit i can now play at 55 fps on mostly maxed out settings with an r9 290x gpu some small things that i dont like is that you are not able to transfer your single player progress from your console to your pc i also dont like how when youre hosting a heist most of the time one person leaves half way through or just really sucks at the game and believe me one person makes a difference between completing a heist and failing one time after finally finding a good heist group we were 3 minutes from completing the heist the guy who was piloting the helicopter crashed it you can guess how angry we all were i found that people are more reliable not to drop out if they have a mic and the heists are also a lot easier that way because communication is a lot better i also love that you can hotswap between a keyboard and a controller you can be using the controller to drive your car around and you can quickly swap to keyboard if you need to escape on foot investing in a controller is definately worth it if you have a wired xbox 360 controller you can use it to play but i am using a wireless xbox controller using an adapter i found on ebay for about $10 overall gta v is a great game both single player and online i just wish rockstar supported mods thanks for reading my review if you want to join me in heists just send me a friend request through social club my username is e1ghtspace make sure you have a mic though otherwise you wont really be much help unless you use the chat in which case feel free to send a friend request

its really fun and stuff and well optimized and stuff

the pc version ended up being much better than the console version i hated gta 4 because it was a total train wreck but they got my faith back on this game still upset about them treating us like criminals though

grand theft auto 5 has stopped working fix your  rockstar it has been 22 hours since the release now still literally not even 1% of anything has been fixed by rockstar if anyone can help me {link removed} httpsnaggyqvm2fjpg thats what i get when i try to launch gta 5 please help  edit i can play it on my other computer though
recommended
so much fun the only problem is that i have a work pc and no power towerssteam machines etc so it is really laggy but i love it
recommended
game runs great its worth the $60 also if you ever have performance issues turn grass and particle effects down
recommended
i cant play the game when i press play it loads for a second then nothing happens i have reinstalled the game updated my drivers disabled my graphics card manually installed social club disabled firewall disabled antivirus uninstalled malwarebytes put literally hours into research on how to get the game to even open and what makes it worse is its been over 48 hours and rockstar hasnt said a word about it and its not just me either its a known problem dont come at me with dude their is a dun hur dur minimal requirmunt specifictuin to plai teh gaim brahh because i surpass the maximum requirements so that isnt a problem i paid $60 for this broken garbage they delayed it so much yet they couldnt make the game launch on 50% of the players systems please come out with a patch soon rockstar or i will be claiming my refund maybe when they fix these literal game breaking dumb mistakes ill give the game a good review because dont get me wrong gta v is a great game just not on pc in its current state update since they patched the game and i can actually play the game is fantastic
recommended
i have this on console and i decided to buy it on here because i wanted to play it with friends i must say it is a great game and the first person gameplay is amazing from doing missions down to the team deatmatch this is a must buy even if you have played it on console pc version outshines console 10 out of 10 rockstar
recommended
gta v is amazing and fun perfect
recommended
definitely a musthave game the controls for some vehicles ie bikes aircraft are a little awkward but thankfully every single key can be remapped to your choosing could not have asked for a better port 60fps on high with no noticeable slowdowns 1010 only complaint would be that the online lobby system still needs some changes in my opinion nothing more annoying than having your friends thrown out to random servers after a job or having to reinvite everyone after a heist setup
recommended
story mode is pristine graphics are polished and the gameplay was relatively smooth i didnt notice a storyline expansion or anything else that different from the 360 release like 2 years ago but then again it was 2 years ago and i dont really remember the multiplayer is chaotic as usual with no proximity based von so you get to hear every person in the session screaming into their mics spamming music yelling at their mom or whatever is happening i have to say that the proximity von is a big issue to me since heist mode is so communication oriented id have figured r would have worked something out aside from the desync of p2p combat and the mic spam i had a great time online playing heists with friends and causing general mayhem one huge buzzkill is that the online loading and matchmaking times are horrendous just getting in is time consuming not to mention if for some reason the session suddenly cant be reached or you get dropped from the heist lobby because the host fkd off somewhere you may be kicked back to single player have to load that then reconnect to online and sit in loading purgatory some more im saying the load times online are insane other than that ive had a great time racking up those stars and leaving a trail of chaos in tricked out cars with friends online tldr looks pretty blowing  up is fun better with a group of friends people scream into mics online loading may cause drowsiness

110 flip flops dont flop in gta o rockstar plz in all seriousness this is the best version of gta yet less than 10 seconds to load into gta o or gta sp from either or and only about 15seconds to load into the game on first launch 910 loading screens graphic settings is amazing you can control pretty much everything about this game only drawback is no matter how high it is reflects still look like  in cars textures and grasswater looks amazing 810 graphics combat is so much smoother than peasent boxes way easier to aim while driving or just aiming in general is a hell of a lot easier 1010 keybindings can be a bit weird but nothing too off being able to do anything you want without having to move your hand off of wasd is pretty nice all in all i give this version of gta v 910  way way way better than peasent box versions

well i cant stand all those fake postive posts but it is the first day ill give it awhile but so far only story mode is playable tried transfering over my online character i think it might of worked but it said servers are down so ill give it awhile but from hear from friends there crashing everytime on their launcher so will see so far ill say this wins a place in the est launch day hall of fame but lets see hopefully online will be playable in couple hours
recommended
i love this game it runs brilliantly on my system
recommended
the best gta game yet may even make up for the crap that was gta iv
recommended
100% i love this game 
recommended
1110 can play online on launch edit 3 crashes in 50 minutes only in online tho
recommended
ing great one problem im having is that online charcters have all these horizontal lines on them on all parts of there body and clothes not sure what i can do to fix it but other than that its great
recommended
perfect game it runs so smooth im even more in love with it than when it came out for the consoles o d <3
recommended
rarely do i purchase games day 1 very very rarely do i purhcase a game 3 times all on day 1 release i love gtav with an amounting passion that easily surpasses childhoods greatest gaming memories a great story that has mounting tension between mission that i have never seen matched in another game a multiplayer of multiplayer games with great heist missions console players waited what felt like ages for and a online freemode that can keep any bored gamer happy for hours on end i recommend this game blindfolded as to the new additions to the gameplay and visuals if you have a masterful pc and a 4k monitor all the better do yourself a favor and purchase this game
recommended
did a mission where i was tailing this cop car i didnt do nothing and this cop car just bashed into a radom civilian car automatically gave me a wanted level fk the ingame police as trigger happy as real life police 1110 would do nothing to get arrested again
recommended
great game a must buy for any previous rockstar fans or new fans alike

recommended
911 would boots before i cats

ive said this before sell an arm your mother whatever get this game if you only buy one in 2015 you will not be disappointed
recommended
another great game in the series finally on pc i personally enjoy the graphics better
recommended
its an optimized gta game on pc just buy it
recommended
best game gta v graphics are amazing love this game
recommended
ive already played gtav twice before but not like this gtav for pc is a good port if you where wondering theres a few rendering glitches as of this review but rockstar is good about fixing this game basically its gta4 but not  and has nonmodded firstperson mode which works extreamly well pick this game up now
recommended
game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
garbage alwaysonline periodic entitlement verification drm treating actual paying customers like thieves cheaters rampant online lobbies constantly implode theyre also pulling some shady stuff during the summer sale to avoid actually lowering the price
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics
not recommended
used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale
not recommended
raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for sale at the same price as before way to be cheap r to help the simple people who dont get it understand the problem is this is how they treat their customers you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters overpriced content and credit card unlocks essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other paytowin free games sorry for the ambiguity i supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect
not recommended
rockstar wants your $60 so much theyll increase the price by 30% add some gtaonline money then cut the price by 30% while not letting you buy the game on its own and claiming its a deal dont give them your $60 rockstar makes some great games but holy crap are their bussiness practices awful
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
well hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server so people think its me who is hacking besides that the hacker succeeded in putting me in a deathloop where i endlessly die on top of that he succesfully crashed my game probably with an invalid texture input eventhough i have lots of fun playing  this is an issue that needs to be solved
not recommended
great game honestly but bumping the price to 8000usd before the summer sale just to be able to say 25% off is a scum move
not recommended
it is here and it is beautiful
recommended
after many months and many dates being pushed back it is finally here and i couldnt be happier i am pleased to announce that the game is running silky smooth and so far i have not ran into any issues or glitches i give the graphics a 910 due to some quirky shadows though it could just be the setting i have it set to actual gameplay is so smooth that it could be used as a replacement for ky jelly the first person view is a big plus specially for all of you fps fans out there who want to enjoy the gta experience over all satisfied with the game and it was well worth the wait to get a game that is actually playable on launch
recommended
couple of issues with the preload uninstalling and reinstalling after release fixed the issue the port is very good very smooth utterly glorious in appearance the game itself is one of the if not the best open world game on the market
recommended
1110 would wait 2 years 4 months and 14days again 
recommended
the first person mode has really put this game on a whole new level also lets not forgetting the following visually stunning4k resolution action packed brilliant story great humor massive world does a great job to progress the story in a non linear feel awesome soundtracks fitting any mood gotta love getting into a highspeed chase in a stolen car that just happenes to be playing something fitting to the scene hours upon hours of gameplay etc downside requires a really powerful pclaptop to truly appreciate its greatness may lead to psychosis  lol
recommended
i wonder what its going to feel like to be game of the year twice 9510 5 bc why cant i connect online
recommended
the lag is
recommended
loved gta when they released it for xbox 360    couldnt play it with any reliability for the first few weeks    got it on pc now    no change so far online wont work servers cannot connect if they say they didnt anticipate the ammount of people loging on again this time as well ima go  great game when you can actually play it
recommended
this game is pretty good its beautiful and the graphics but there was a error that i came across gta 5 luancher has stopped working i havent fixed it
recommended
worth the wait everything works and you have all the pc options you can ask for should be possible to tweak to suit both low and high end pcs it is also an amazing game ive played it on both ps3 and ps4 before getting it on pc you cant go wrong with this game buy it
recommended
i havent fapped more in one day than today
recommended
way better on the pc than ps4 and xbox graphics are 10x times better make sure you do the driver update today for this game nothing better then blowing crap up with your friends on the master pc race tanks helicopters and big explosions

recommended
ive played the console versions of this game and it is fair to say that this is worth the wait gameplay was great in both 3rd and 1st person mode dont recommend first person if you have motion sickness the cars didnt feel slippery the campaign feels like sort of episodic if i spelt that right and the graphics were impressive especially on the last gen versions of the game 1010 ps be prepared to run into high level prcks going on a rampage in their tank on the online portion of the game
recommended
this port has been done right looks & plays great
recommended
really good experiance runs good with a gtx760 using the geforce experiance settings and adaptive vsync dont use the ingame vsync ever

recommended
as of now rockstar has kept there promise of great version for pc and even though its insallation process takes a while its all worth it once you get into this game people cant get mad over a install process its just going to take longer as we get into the future for any game
recommended
amazing gameplay and graphics runs smoothly a
recommended
gta v launcher sucks   i cannot get my gta v to start up same goes for my friends
recommended
this game runs flawlessly
recommended
waiting penta years for this port but it was a great b8 m8 i rate 88 more like buy this game now cause youre missing out big time
recommended
what can i say really about this game its fking amazing incredible job by rockstar this time huge improvement on gta4 but lets face it we all knew that im continuously amazed by the level of detail in this game not just in graphics but the little things getting wet in rain playing with the dog and accidentally getting it to maul someone passing by oops everything works on the dashboard of the cars in 1st person just the little things make this game great and then there is the storymode i have to say not a huge fan of the constant swapping but id does make it somewhat interesting and at least i have come across anyone like roman yet so thats a huge improvement as for the story as far as ive got its good still packed with classic gta dont give a f attitude funny and really pushing the socially acceptable love it and as for a pc port its actually really stable right out the gate so id like to take this time to thank all the people who got in on playstaion and xbox for beta testing it for us you did a good job i think the only issues im having right now is in the boot up for some reason it wont remember my settings so always starts in low res and windowed mode but once i change that every time runs smoothly so to sum it up should you buy this game only if you want a great open world to do whatever you want to do when you want to do it with amazing visuals and mechanics to be honest if you have read this far and not already hit that add to cart button then you must be skint like i am now but dont regret it amazing game get it
recommended

glitchy unpolished and buggy as  if you enjoy loading screens gunplay that can be achieved i ms excel and networking capabilities of a game belonging to the early 1980s this is a game for you adding on top of that the slow download rates giving your 100mb fiber a download time of 69 months 1310  best part was waiting to the slow download if youre a console fanboy with no demands for quality  enjoy if not youre better of to just burn the silly ammount of money this game will set you back

 will update as time passes  in my opinion the most important thing that might interest many people is that optimalization is good running full with gtx 780  recording videos and still getting 60 fps without drops  i have experienced only 2 drops down to 35 past 2 hours of nonstop recording worth buying if you have been waiting for this game
recommended
awsome game its so much fun with friends

fairly gpu demanding but if you can run it it looks ridiculously good plays smoothly and everything feels good only downside ive seen is that every time i load the game it goes back into window mode other than that gg rockstar

at this point most of you have probably played gta v on the old gen or the next gen consolesthe mere fact that rockstar released grand theft auto 5 so late that it felt more like an afterthought than a solid port is quite dissapointing itselfespecially after the heartbreaking abscence of red dead redemption on pcthe recent delaysincluding the announcement of 4k and the lower than expected requirementshowever made me feel like rockstar was atleast trying to bring a strong portwith that being said this definetly is the ultimate version of the highest entertainment earning product in historyif youre a gta series fan or if u havent played it yetthen its a must playthings you can expect if you played ps3360 version except for thehigher graphical detailsthe main attraction is the first person moderockstar also later added editor which is a pretty neatfeatureonly for the pc versionthe game is also hugely customizablein the settings menu but the main attraction is 4k though its quite sad that only a few amount of players would get to use it

the game runs flawlessly on my system i7 4790k gtx 980 sli ya i have a pretty crazy rig gaming only at 1080p too but this runs butter smooth all maxed out compared to gta 4 this is much more polished and not just a crappy port first person mode is amazing and really brings a new way to enjoy what gta has to offer well done rockstar

game runs great on asus g75vx laptop little blurry on rapid movement but better then choppy frames drivingflying is a little getting used difficult to make tight maneuvers with the keyboard it runs great overall graphics are as expected for my setup so im not disappointed its just that using the keyboard left me exhausted after a few missions will definitly need to invest in a controller if a cant tweek the keymap this seems to be too much game for a keyboard for now overall i am happy with this purchase great job i7 gtx670mx 3gb 8gb ram ssdos hhdgame is installed on
